      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council will first note with satisfaction the signing of the Lisbon Treaty, which is to take place in the Portuguese capital tomorrow, and the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will take place here today in a little while. It will also call for the process of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty to be concluded swiftly so that the Treaty can enter into force on 1 January 2009.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Lisbon Treaty, as I have said, will provide the Union with a stable and lasting institutional framework that will allow it to fully concentrate on the political challenges ahead, including globalisation and climate change, as clearly underlined at the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government on 19 April. In this context, the European Council will adopt a Declaration on Globalisation. The Declaration will make it clear that, in view of the global challenges that confront us, the European Union has both an opportunity and a responsibility to act. The Union’s internal and external policies need to be harnessed to that end. I am thinking of delivery on the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, fulfilment of the ambitious commitments on climate change and energy agreed at the Spring 2007 European Council, definition of a global response to the recent turbulence in the financial markets, promotion of free trade and openness, work with our partners to pursue vigorous and coherent development strategies, development of a comprehensive European migration policy and efficient use of instruments and development of capabilities of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Security and Defence Policy, so as to allow the Union to play a growing part in building a safer world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, the European Union will help to ensure that globalisation is a source of opportunity rather than a threat and that it contributes to the prosperity of the individual. We also hope to establish at the forthcoming European Council a Reflection Group, to help the Union anticipate and meet challenges more effectively in the next twenty to thirty years. The European Council will review the progress made in the area of freedom, security and justice. We should mention, first, the abolition of controls at the internal borders of the new Member States, a measure of great significance and great importance for the daily lives of our citizens. The implementation of the policy on migration will also be examined and, in particular, the progress made in the implementation of the Global Approach to Migration with regard to Africa and the Mediterranean, as well as the Global Approach to the Eastern and South-Eastern neighbouring regions. There will be a report, in this context, on the organisation of the first Euro-Med Ministerial meeting on Migration, which will be taken into account in preparing the Joint Strategy and Action Plan for the second Africa/EU Summit, as reported here yesterday.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Other aspects to be examined in the area of freedom, security and justice will include the work to be undertaken to combat terrorism, notably as regards radicalisation and recruitment, and the progress in judicial cooperation. On economic, social and environmental issues, the European Council will review the work that has been done in the relevant areas with a view to the preparation of the next cycle of the Renewed Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, to be approved at the European Council in Spring 2008. The discussion at the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government in October sought to strengthen the external dimension of the Lisbon Strategy and confirmed that the Renewed Lisbon Strategy is still the right framework to meet the principal challenges that confront us, in particular the challenge of globalisation. It also confirmed that Europe is making progress and that the objectives set are still appropriate, and the main focus of the new cycle will therefore be to maintain the necessary stability to consolidate gains and press on with reforms.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Council will emphasise the need to strengthen European competitiveness with the advantages of the single market combined with a sustainable industrial policy and promotion of innovation and skills. Development of the external dimension and improvement of the conditions in which consumers and undertakings, particularly small and medium-sized undertakings, operate will also be emphasised. In the employment and social policy area, the European Council will endorse the agreement on the common principles of flexicurity, underlining the role of the social partners in the design, implementation and monitoring of the relevant policies. The European Council will also report the results of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and invite Member States to strengthen efforts to prevent and combat discrimination. I must also stress the importance of carrying forward the Energy Policy for Europe established by the Spring European Council. The progress achieved in the discussions on the third internal market package for gas and electricity and the debate on the Strategic Energy Technology Plan will also be noted.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Council will then review the implementation of the Sustainable Development Strategy and it is expected to agree that the objectives and priorities under the seven key challenges contained in that strategy remain fully valid. It will also welcome the Commission Communication on an integrated maritime policy and invite the Commission to come forward with the initiatives and proposals contained in the Action Plan. On external relations, the European Council is expected, on the basis of Ministers’ discussions at the latest General Affairs and External Relations Council held last Monday, to concentrate on the process of defining the future status of Kosovo, in particular, in an assessment of the period of negotiation. Since, as you know, Belgrade and Pristina failed to reach an agreement, it is hoped that the European Council will also discuss the role that the European Union may play in the process in future and the course of action to be taken in this connection with a view to resolving the issue, strengthening stability in the region and helping to bring it closer to the Union. The European Council will stress the importance of the various summits held in the past six months, in particular the summits with Brazil and Africa. The summit with Brazil was, as you know, an unprecedented and brilliant initiative and the EU-Africa Summit achieved some very encouraging results, which I had occasion to mention in the Assembly yesterday. Lastly, attention will be drawn to the progress recorded in relations with other regions, notably the Mediterranean, and in the area of cooperation for development.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council’s conclusions reflect the results of the intense work done in the past six months and show that the main objectives of the Portuguese Presidency have been achieved. The European Union will still have a highly ambitious agenda of work before it. We believe that under future presidencies it will continue to proceed in the direction of a Europe of high growth, social prosperity and sustainable development, strengthening its role in global terms and in its relations with its partners at bilateral and also at multilateral level. Thank you very much, Mr President.</p>

    <intervention id="3-008" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the last European Council in Lisbon in October we were able not only to reach political agreement on a new Treaty but also to launch a debate at Head of State or Government level on Europe’s interest and the best way to promote that interest in the era of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Lisbon Treaty will be signed tomorrow, and on Friday the European Council will start on its task of seeking concrete results for a Europe at the service of citizens in the age of globalisation. I think it is important to stress the link between these two facts. Europe is solving its institutional problems but it is doing so primarily because it takes the interests of its citizens into account and also because it seeks to project its interests and values at global level. Both ways are, ultimately, ways of achieving the same objectives.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The signing of the Lisbon Treaty is no mere formality. It signals 27 States’ agreement on a Treaty and it marks their acceptance of a common commitment to Europe. It is, without doubt, a highly potent symbol of the long way we have come since the deadlocks of 2005.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Similarly, the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the President of the Council, the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission, which will take place in this House in a few hours’ time, is proof positive that the European Union intends to keep the rights of citizens at the heart of its activities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On Friday, the European Council will give us another opportunity to show a European Union that is seeking to define its position in the light of globalisation. This positioning is partly to do with the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. The truth of the matter is that what we are consolidating today is simply the external dimension of the Lisbon Strategy, essentially the idea that Europe’s response to globalisation must be pro-active and confident, not negative and passive. Only yesterday the Commission adopted an important package of communications and decisions preparing a new cycle of the Strategy for the period 2008-2010.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy is working: it is creating growth and jobs. We now have the best figures since the 1980s in terms of job creation. The Lisbon Strategy is helping to position Europe and European citizens to succeed in the age of globalisation. The Lisbon Strategy has given Europe a common, pragmatic economic agenda, fully respecting national differences.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, complacency would be fatal to Europe’s prospects of shaping globalisation. Much more remains to be done: progress is uneven between policy areas, and some Member States are moving much faster than others.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Yesterday’s package responds to the need for Europe to act, to face up to growing uncertainties in the global economy, and to the need for an even higher priority for the social dimension, education and skills, but also information and communication technologies, flexicurity, the need to have a common energy policy and to fight climate change.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The declaration on globalisation that the European Council is about to adopt fully acknowledges the role of the Lisbon Strategy. The declaration should set out our conviction that the Union has every reason to feel confident about its future. Today’s European Union is showing how the preservation of European political, economic and social values and the defence of European interests are fully compatible with a proactive approach to globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Today we are well placed to continue the internal reforms, to reinforce our ability to compete at global level and, at the same time, to maintain our values of economic and social cohesion and solidarity. Today, we are well placed to provide the global vision that the world needs for a multilateral order, a system of collective security, open and fair trade and sustainable development, which respects the environmental balance of our planet. Today, we are well placed to pursue European interests in the partnerships and in the relations with our allies and the world’s other great powers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Two weeks ago, together with the President of the European Council, I was in China and India for the summits between the European Union and these two emerging powers. It was fascinating to see the pace of economic development in that part of the world. We need to be attentive to what is going on in Asia. It is true that economic development has helped to take millions of human beings out of poverty. I have no doubts their progress will have a direct impact on future generations of Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The crucial question is: what are we going to do in the face of such a structural transformation? We should have no illusions: globalisation also means deep changes in the world balance of power. The truth is that, not many years ago, here in Europe, when people spoke about globalisation, they were thinking mainly about Westernisation or, sometimes, Americanisation. Today, when we in Europe speak about globalisation, many people think, above all, of the growing, emerging economic powers in Asia.</p>
      <p sl="pt">So the world is changing, and I believe this is also making the need to adapt our common European project to the new challenges more obvious. That is why, today, there are conditions for accepting the declaration on globalisation that European Union leaders will adopt this week. It is more obvious than ever that even the greatest powers of Europe cannot tackle the challenges of globalisation alone. It is obvious that, more than ever, we need a strong European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that the rise of the powers of Asia on one hand and the awareness about the climate change challenge on the other are, in fact, two very important driving forces for the European Union, because they show us that there is a challenge called globalisation and that there is also an opportunity to grasp.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, I think that this week’s European Council will have a very important meaning and a great significance. Some years ago it would have been impossible for European leaders to agree on the declaration on globalisation they are about to support. Now it is quite clear that the goals of the European Union are not just internal: the goals of the European Union are also global. We need to promote our interests and to promote our values in the new global order that is emerging. That is why I think we can take very important decisions this week. We should do that with full confidence in our capacities, above all trusting the ability of European societies to rise to the circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In particular, we should not forget that, in Europe, we have impressive human skills, great traditions of knowledge and critical knowledge, the capacity to adapt. We have sophisticated scientific and technological knowledge. More importantly, we have free societies organised under the rule of law, and this gives us a great advantage in a world that is changing – and changing fast.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is the European way of life. To preserve it and to improve it is our best investment. With the right policy agenda, we can face globalisation with confidence. Globalisation poses specific challenges. One of these is mass migration, which is, to some extent, a new phenomenon in Europe – at least with the dimension it has taken recently.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Last week the Commission adopted a communication on migration, which will be discussed in the European Council. It stresses the need to see the issue in an overall perspective. It is, of course, central to our border controls and security, but it also has huge economic and social implications, and demands to be a central theme in our relations with partners worldwide. Migration is close to the concerns and interests of citizens. It cannot be tackled by any individual Member State on its own. As I have said several times, also in this House, it is completely absurd in a European Union of 27 Member States, where we have freedom of circulation of people, to have 27 policies of immigration. We need to have a common approach to immigration, and we need to recognise that the problems some of our Member States are facing should also be considered as European problems.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pt">We need an integrated policy, one which makes sense to European citizens, to immigrants and to international partners. The goal of our document presented to this Council is to spark debate, first at the European Council, but also in European societies, including, of course, this Parliament, and launch a process leading to a comprehensive policy. By addressing an issue that is a central concern of European citizens, just a day after the signature of the Lisbon Treaty, the Union continues its approach, one which is based on concrete results for Europe and concrete results for our citizens. This is the right way to move forward, and I think this week’s European summit can take us a step further in our wish and our will to shape globalisation and shape it with our values.</p>

    <intervention id="3-010" speaker_id="4342" name="Joseph Daul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon European Council marks a return to a Europe of achievements and added value. For the people of Europe, this Council sets the seal on greater freedom of movement and closer integration. Many institutional problems have been resolved and two years of stalling and uncertainty are drawing to a close.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Tomorrow in Lisbon, 27 signatures on the Reform Treaty will confirm our shared destiny in a European 21st century based on our common values, our prosperity, security and solidarity. From January 2009 we aim to apply our new method of operation. This is important because the Lisbon Treaty provisions will have an impact on the next European elections and thus on the appointment of the President of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is the major innovation in the Lisbon Treaty because it delivers a clear response to two basic questions: who are we and what is the nature of our joint endeavour? The Charter embodies our sharing of values and, at the same time, reflects a consensus on our unity in diversity. If we neglect either one of those elements we will incur opposition and reluctance on the part of our peoples. I hope that both the spirit and the letter of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights will apply across the widest possible area of Europe, for this Charter truly does enshrine our individual identification with the European Union and our connection to a European Community of shared values.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Reform Treaty also extends the scope of democracy by enhancing the power of the European Parliament, establishing a fairer voting system in the Council, giving the national parliaments a bigger role as guarantors of subsidiarity and bringing the Union closer to ordinary people, who will now be entitled to initiate legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament will have more duties and more responsibilities to Europe’s citizens. Our Assembly must therefore be more rigorous, and it needs a higher profile. My group is ready to contribute both in the legislative process and in bringing forward new ideas. I also support the proposal to set up a Reflection Group. It will have a crucially important role to play in charting our course over the next 20 or 30 years. If we intend to build a Europe founded on prosperity and security, as well as values and a shared sense of solidarity, we need the capacity to reflect on the future of the European social model.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once the treaty has been ratified we shall be able to focus on those policy areas where people want Europe to do more. Issues like climate change, energy, immigration and security need to be tackled at European level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the second decision anticipated in Lisbon is of more than symbolic significance. It concerns extension of the Schengen acquis to those Member States which joined the Union in 2004. Freedom of movement is a sensitive issue, particularly for people who have borne the yoke of occupation and have been deprived of freedom. Living in a Community of shared values cannot be reconciled with the imposition of distinctions between people on the move inside the European Union. Having said that, equal treatment also implies equality before the law. If those principles fall by the wayside, we will never achieve social cohesion, and the people we represent will turn their backs on Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also welcome the extension of police and judicial cooperation among the Member States. In an open Europe, it offers an effective means of combating the scourges of trafficking in human beings and illegal immigration. Ladies and gentlemen, Thursday’s European Council brings us one step nearer to achieving a more open, more democratic Europe and one with a capacity to act. And remember, too, that a Europe which guarantees unity in diversity contributes not only to stability within its own borders but also to peace throughout the world.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-011" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Commission rightly referred to one of the core challenges of the present time, namely the question of how we should organise home-affairs policy in Europe on the basis of the Treaty that is to be signed tomorrow, on the basis of the new legal structures of the European Union. He cited the problem of mass immigration into Europe as an example of the way in which an internal European area, by which I mean a legal area that has external borders but no longer has internal borders, can be organised. We do that on an intergovernmental level.</p>
      <p sl="de">No one should be under any illusions – the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement is not the law of the European Union; it is not Community law, but an intergovernmental instrument. That in itself shows that we still have a structural defect, for intergovernmental instruments are primarily a form of law that focuses on national sovereignty rather than on the creation of an effective European framework. This is a fundamental distinction. The fact is that law based on national sovereignty enables every manifestation of national particularism and every individual reservation to block the progress of the Union. In view of the challenges facing us in the field of migration policy, that is something we cannot afford.</p>
      <p sl="de">To that extent, President Barroso is perfectly correct, for it is wrong that some – in southern Europe, for example – should be under intense migratory pressure, while those at the other geographical ends of Europe wash their hands of the problem. That cannot go on indefinitely. The step we are now taking in relaunching the integration process on the basis of a new Treaty is therefore a first step that must be followed by more, by which I mean closer integration in other areas, including those of the common home-affairs policy, the common security policy and the common justice policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">This brings me to my second point, which is of particular importance to us at the present moment. We shall be formally signing the Charter of Fundamental Rights today. Splendid! An exquisite table, magnificent chairs, a congenial atmosphere, as always.</p>
      <a text="(Interjection by Daniel Cohn-Bendit: And magnificent Members of Parliament!)"/>
      <p sl="de">Yes, wonderful Members of Parliament too. Some Members, however, are nicer than others, Mr Cohn-Bendit.</p>
      <a text="(Laughter)"/>
      <p sl="de">The setting will be marvellous, as always. Yet it all reminds me of a close friend of mine who has been married several times in his life and has also filed for divorce several times. And every time I attended his wedding and was about to go home after the solemn celebration and the magnificent function that had been laid on, I would say to him, ‘You gave us a great day, as always’. I feel a bit like that today. I was in Rome – along with you, Mr Pöttering, and a number of other Members who are here today. We experienced that in Rome. It was like a wedding – celebratory, fine food, a wonderful ceremony, great music,</p>
      <a text="(Interjection by Daniel Cohn-Bendit: Beautiful city!)"/>
      <p sl="de">a beautiful city, a splendid atmosphere, no Cohn-Bendit there, so just magnificent!</p>
      <a text="(Laughter)"/>
      <p sl="de">We went home afterwards and experienced the divorce. And today we are off to the next wedding, this time in Lisbon: splendid atmosphere, wonderful city, no Cohn-Bendit – everything just as it should be. I only hope that another petition for divorce will not follow in Ireland. In short, ladies and gentlemen, we have no reason to celebrate until the Treaty has actually been ratified in all 27 countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">It makes sense to ratify the Treaty. Those anti-Europeans who wanted to scupper the constitution because they believed they could halt the integration process that way have certainly been taught a lesson by this Treaty. It is true that the Lisbon Treaty does not satisfy all our wishes, but it is better than destroying Europe by constantly opposing integration.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">And those who rejected the draft Constitutional Treaty because they believed it was short on social policy and needed a stronger social element will not find that extra element in this new Treaty, but the proclamation of the Charter of Human Rights and its integration into the Treaty have made it possible to realise a number of fundamental social rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">There were no doubt reasons for the rejection of the draft constitution by extremists on both sides. I can sympathise more with those who rejected it on social grounds than with the anti-Europeans, who reject the Treaty on principle because they do not want this Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">One thing, however, is quite clear: this Treaty can only be a stepping stone. It is a step forward, but it does not take us far enough. Nevertheless, it is a step that must be taken now in any event. I hope that this marriage is for life and that the divorce lawyers will stay at home, for none of the challenges of the coming years – and my honourable colleague Mr Swoboda will shortly be speaking about Kosovo – will be surmountable unless we set Europe on firm institutional foundations.</p>

    <intervention id="3-012" speaker_id="4514" name="Andrew Duff" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Schulz is perfectly correct that this is a week of celebration, solemnly proclaiming the Charter protecting our citizens from abuse of the great power vested inside the Union, and the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon strengthening our capacity to act and improving dramatically the quality of our democracy. I am delighted that Prime Minister Brown has finally decided to show up, although, unfortunately, to show up late. I am afraid that is par for the course for British participation in the EU. Please be careful that Mr Brown signs in pen rather than in pencil!</p>
      <a text="(Laughter)"/>
      <p sl="de">The European Council is our first chance to step forward decisively from this introspective period of reflection and start to do some serious politics. First up is Kosovo, and here the Union is about to supervise the independence of a country without the approval of the UN Security Council. It is crucial for the future of Kosovo and the rest of us that those who fear that such a bold step will create a precedent choose the wise path of constructive abstention and do not seek to block the self-determination of Kosovans.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Council should also begin to take some firm decisions on the size and shape of the ESDP mission to Kosovo as a signal of its intention. We should also, moreover, reiterate our refusal to sign a stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia before the delivery of its war criminals to the ICC. It is in this context that the Sarkozy-inspired groupe des sages could be put to some serious work to build up some alternative scenarios for the future of the Balkans, but it must not mess up our current commitments.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, the EU’s leaders are assembled in Brussels for a European Council meeting on the day after the signing of the new Reform Treaty. Ireland is one of the countries where the provisions of the Treaty will be put to a referendum; if the campaign in support of the Treaty is run on a visibly professional footing, I believe that the referendum will prove to be a great success.</p>
      <p sl="ga">And, further to what Mr Schulz said about the dangers of a negative coming from Europe, it behoves me, as a representative from Ireland, speaking at this round of the debate on the future of Lisbon, to point out a number of home truths.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Firstly, to congratulate all those who have been involved in bringing about the final agreement on the Lisbon Treaty. But that is only the written document, and we ask ourselves – and often in this Parliament we ask ourselves – what does Europe want to see? What do the people and citizens of Europe want to know about?</p>
      <p sl="ga">Yes, the citizens of Europe want more Europe. But more Europe, to them, does not mean what a lot of us inside this room might think. It does not mean new regulations, new laws – new restrictions, as they would see it. It means a cleverer Europe, a Europe that delivers a response to their everyday needs. That is why the Lisbon Strategy – the continuation and the improvement of the Lisbon Strategy – is so important as regards what would be happening within the Lisbon Council meeting.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Secondly, the whole issue of migration, which was touched on by many Members, is putting enormous pressure on resources, not just in financial terms as regards the cost to countries, especially those in the southern Mediterranean who are forced to expend huge amounts of money on tackling this problem, but on the social cohesion within those countries as well. It is creating enormous problems and drawing on the goodwill and efforts that will be there.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Thirdly, and most importantly of all, the whole issue with regard to the kind of development of a European vision that we want to see around the world as is now being played out in Bali at the Climate Change Conference, as will be played out in the future at some other conferences in New York in the coming months, and, most importantly, that we have to tell our citizens and inform them properly of what comes before them.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Finally, could I say to President Barroso and to Vice-President Wallström, as we are having a referendum in Ireland: no tax, no tax, no tax. The Treaties do not give you the power to come up with tax proposals. The Commission should stay away from it.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-015" speaker_id="1934" name="Daniel Cohn-Bendit" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a wonderful gathering here. The President-in-Office and the Council have been diligent, and the summary they delivered here was marvellous. What exactly they were summarising escaped me, but the headings were certainly right.</p>
      <p sl="de">The head manager of the Commission emphasised to us that the Commission has taken up the challenges of globalisation. He said ‘globalisation’ 87 times and ‘challenges’ 82 times, so it must be true.</p>
      <p sl="de">And so to the wedding that Martin was so keen to describe. It is indeed an interesting state of affairs, for the bridegroom is marrying the same bride for a second time. That is unusual, even for the weddings you frequent, Martin. The only thing is that the bride is now a little older, a little more old-fashioned and less sexy than she was in Rome. But this wedding is necessary. Today we are all invited. Because I am attending today and was not there the last time, it will go well. That makes all the difference.</p>
      <p sl="de">Before I say something on two important problems, let me refer to the surreal performance of the British Prime Minister in Lisbon. He had discovered that a subcommittee of a committee of a subcommission was meeting in the House of Commons, and so he could not be present at the signing of the thing he did not want to sign but intended to sign nevertheless, but then later, at the meal, he signed it after all. It was surreal, but that is Britain today. It is your problem, not mine!</p>
      <p sl="de">Now, however, I would like to address two serious matters. The first is Kosovo. There is an old Jewish joke which says that, if you have two options, always choose the third. We have two options. If we do not recognise Kosovo’s independence, we shall have a conflict on our hands. If we do recognise it, we shall have a conflict on our hands. Both options lead to conflict, whether with Kosovo or Serbia. We in the European Union must now be resolute in showing how we can act, not just how we can talk. We must develop an Agenda 2020 with a view to bolstering the rule of law in that region, and that agenda must be developed together with Kosovo, with Serbia and with Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must reinforce the rule of law throughout that region. We must develop an environment and climate pact. We must devise a regional development plan with components such as trans-Balkan route networks, giving the region the prospect of accelerated convergence with the European Union with the aim of simultaneous integration of all these countries into the European Union. The only means we have of preventing conflict is to ensure here that these countries are not only offered the European bonding agent but help to develop it too. Then we shall see whether the 27 will be able not only to wed their brides but also to bring difficult children into the family so that peace can finally advance in that region. I am actually talking about the wedding night now.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point is just as critical, namely Iran. The Council will have to take a decision there too. In this case we can say that the threat of an Iranian nuclear bomb has apparently subsided, if we can believe the US intelligence service. We are all like little children, always believing what we want to believe. If people tell us something that does not suit us, we say they are lying. It they tell us something that suits us, we say they are right. I do not know who is right, but it would suit me if they were right this time.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Iran, however, the possibility of a nuclear bomb is not the only problem. There is also the problem of freedom or, more precisely, the suppression of freedom. The past few years have seen an incredible upsurge in the oppression of people in Iran. I believe Europe also has a job to do there. It is not just about averting the threat of a nuclear bomb. It is also about the freedom of people in Iran and about how we help civil society to win that freedom.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are heads of government who think they are clever because they give wise advice and do great and clever things for Europe. Those who believe, however, that they can sell nuclear reactors in all parts of the world, whether to Libya – a terrorist dictatorship – or to Tunisia, Algeria or Morocco, only to discover at some later date that these nations all want a nuclear bomb, are being hypocritical. Yesterday’s New York Times wrote something that we have all been saying for the last 30 years, namely that anyone who uses nuclear power for civilian purposes will ultimately use it for military purposes too if there is no alternative. And we sell nuclear reactors to all African, American and other countries and think we are clever. We are stupid to do such a thing, That needs to be said.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, the forthcoming European Council will take place in the context of the signature of a new treaty, immediately after a particularly important EU-Africa summit and also – let us not forget – during the first phase of implementation of the Annapolis process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the treaty, I believe the Union would be seriously misreading the situation if it thought that this summit agreement marked the end of the crisis of confidence which has dislocated entire sections of our societies from the current thrust of Union economic and social policies. That problem remains intact. We would do better to recognise it and prepare responses to it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A similar reality check seems necessary in terms of our relations with Africa. The Chair of the African Union Commission, Alpha Konaré, has called on Europe to break with paternalism. He emphasised that Africa ‘could not remain a hunting ground or become a new territory to be conquered’. He lambasted – and I quote again – ‘the logic of the Economic Partnership Agreements with their dramatic costs for the African people’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Significantly, seven Latin American countries created the Bank of the South almost on the same day as the summit, as a means of emancipating themselves from the IMF and of lessening inequalities in their region. The European Union needs to learn from that and take the measure of this general and growing demand for a fairer, more dignified partnership, including in its way of treating migrants.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the Middle East, which is apparently missing from the Council agenda: how could the Union agree in Annapolis to be completely sidelined from the structure responsible for implementation of the Roadmap? Does it intend to stand by and passively watch the agreement being violated – as was the case last week with the affair of the East Jerusalem settlements? Generally speaking, what are our true aspirations for Europe and what resources are we prepared to invest in realising them? This is a priority question for the next European Council.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. the Prime Ministers will sign a final Treaty none of them have read. They are signing a bundle of amendments they cannot even understand. Yesterday the Danish Parliament refused a referendum on a Treaty they have not read. They breached the Danish Constitution and may be taken to court so we can have a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="de">A few of them may have read a full draft; I doubt it. The final edition is still impossible to read for one simple reason: it is not consolidated. The IGC has decided that readable versions will only be printed when the Treaty is ratified by all 27 Member States. Do not read, sign, is a cynical moral. All negotiations in the IGC and the linguistic lawyers’ group have been kept absolutely secret so far as many Members in this Parliament are concerned. The numbering system has been changed three times to make any comparison technically impossible before the signing. There is not even a table for comparison with the October published edition.</p>
      <p sl="de">First they undo two referendums rejecting the Constitution. Then they negotiate in secret and keep the content under a new name. I still offer a good bottle of wine for just one example of a law which can be approved under the Constitution and not under the Lisbon Treaty. Even the most experienced legal expert in the Danish Foreign Office has admitted there is not one.</p>
      <p sl="de">In an expert hearing in the Danish Parliament, I asked three times to have some examples of national law areas where the Lisbon Treaty, with its horizontal clauses and fundamental principles, cannot reach. I did not get one valid example. The Lisbon Treaty will dissolve the existing EU, establish a new state with joint citizenship, legal personality and all the tools of nation states. Most laws will be adopted by civil servants in secret. The democratic deficit will grow. My group proposes the signing should be cancelled until you have read the final text.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, again today many talk grandly about European values of democracy. Today we will have a pretentious affirmation of a belief in human rights yet, at the same time, the EU elite are preparing to celebrate their greatest stroke of arrogance to date as they make ready to sign the repackaged Constitution without a backward glance towards their people and what they want or what they think.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 2005 referendums showed Europe to be out of touch, but the lesson learned was not to abandon what the people did not want but to circumvent their opposition by determining this time not to ask them. Hence the scandal that, across this continent, national powers will be stripped away, superstate structures will be established, a new EU citizenship will be created, legal personality will be bestowed on the EU and only a handful of citizens will ever be asked.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why? Because in most states, my own included, the leaders fear the verdict of their people, adding cowardice to their arrogance. So on a day when there is much talk of human rights, I say: Give the people of Europe the basic political and human right to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to this Constitution, the right to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ in a referendum.</p>

      <p sl="pt">President-in-Office, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Presidency is coming to an end and it has a number of remarkable successes to its credit. I am not among those who place undue emphasis on the diplomatic initiatives in connection with the Brazil and Africa summits, among others: only time will tell whether they produce concrete measures or whether they were just great events with high media visibility.</p>
      <p sl="pt">But I would stress the structural measures that have been taken, for the benefit of Europe, in these six months. Three spring to mind: the end of the institutional crisis with the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, which will be signed tomorrow, the proclamation of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will be binding, the historic enlargement of the Schengen area with the integration of nine new Member States and almost 4 million square kilometres, the achievement of strategic viability and the important GALILEO programme, which some people would rather not have, preferring to leave all that to the United States, Russia and China.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should also like to stress the useful legislative work in cooperation with the European Parliament, and the excellent understanding with the Commission and its President, Dr Durão Barroso. The interinstitutional cooperation worked well and produced good results. President-in-Office, I wish you every success at the Council meeting on 14 December. We expect further important decisions, both in the area of foreign policy, with special reference to Kosovo, and with regard to Europe’s response to the challenges of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should especially like to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on including the question of Europe’s immigration policy on the agenda for the Council, where President Barroso will be able to underline the European Commission’s timely initiatives in this connection. There are problems and challenges that are clearly beyond the scope of individual Member States and that call for a common approach, this being especially obvious, as already said, in an area without internal borders.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, allow me to conclude with a national reference. Portugal has always done its best to serve the common interest when it held the Presidency of the Council. This was the case in 1992 with Prime Minister Cavaco Silva and with João de Deus Pinheiro, then Minister for Foreign Affairs and now a Member of the European Parliament. It was the case in 2000 with Prime Minister António Guterres, and it is the case today in the third Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Allow me, Secretary of State, to draw attention to your personal commitment, the commitment of Minister Luís Amado and Prime Minister Sócrates, and the commitment of all those who have been actively engaged here, in Brussels and in Lisbon, in ensuring the success of the Presidency. I should like to draw attention to the work of REPER, to mention the skills of Ambassador Mendonça e Moura and to express thanks for the effective liaison with the European Parliament provided by Dr Alexandre Leitão.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, it is the crowning achievement of the Portuguese Presidency that the Treaty of Lisbon is now ready to be signed, and many Members of this Parliament have certainly played their part too.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of the functions of the Treaty of Lisbon is to strengthen the common foreign and security policy of the EU and to create an institutional basis for it. A treaty, however, can only create the right conditions, and the will and vigour to pursue a common foreign and security policy are essential too.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is correct, as some speakers have said, that at this particular juncture, when the Treaty is being signed, Kosovo will be a test of the Member States’ resolve to pursue a common foreign and security policy. Whatever we decide with regard to Kosovo will pose problems in that region.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is no new third option, as Mr Cohn-Bendit suggested, because a third option, namely devoting a great deal of money and initiative to that region, has already been pursued for some time. There is only the option of independence for Kosovo, which will then give rise to a number of problems in the region, or else we could decide not to recognise an independent Kosovo, which would also give rise to a number of problems in the region.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is quite clear, in my view, that we must abide by the principle that every step which is taken in the coming weeks and months must come from within the region and be taken together with the European Union. That cannot happen, however, unless the European Union has a common position on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the basis of my own experience – and I have been working in that region on behalf of the European Parliament for ten years now – I see only one feasible option, which is to move in the immediate future towards limited, restricted and supervised independence. I firmly believe, however, that it would be absolutely intolerable and unacceptable if Kosovo declared its independence unilaterally and we more or less acquiesced. Many politicians from Kosovo are also saying that this process can be jointly pursued. I saw that at first hand during the recent elections there. The process can be brought to fruition if the European Union opts for a joint approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the closing days of this Presidency, may I also ask the Council to ensure that there is a common European line, that the common responsibility for that region is exercised by all parties and that all steps that are taken in the coming weeks and months are accompanied by an EU presence in Kosovo. That is the main requirement. The decisive factor will not be recognition of Kosovo’s independence but energetic representation of EU security policy in Kosovo, and the Portuguese President of the Council must play his part in making that a reality.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the new Treaty is being signed at last after years of stalemate, but the parties to it must also at last act as the owners, the real leaders of Europe. It is high time they stopped simply crowing on the national stage about what they have achieved and started actively canvassing support for this Treaty and pushing for its ratification, so that it can come into force on 1 January 2009.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The biggest change is in police and justice cooperation. We need to be clear, and quickly, on how we are going to handle the relevant issues in 2008, during the transitional period. Where does the Council stand on Commissioner Frattini's suggestions about applying the new procedures now, in anticipation of the new rules?</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Charter of Fundamental Rights is also being formally proclaimed today. And it is shameful that Member States have weakened the Charter by taking it out of the Treaty and especially by endorsing two opt-outs. They must now prove in practice that they really mean business on fundamental rights, rather than just paying lip service to them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Lastly, Mr President, the European Union is being made a bit more democratic and a bit more effective. But a mature democracy must not only be vigorous, it must also scrutinise the exercise of power, and it must be responsible.

The leaders of the EU Member States were greatly pleased and sure that the document would enter into force. However, two nations expressed determined opposition in referendums.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Heads of Government are now signing an almost identical text and count on being able to avoid referendums this time round. Clearly, they underestimate this fundamental instrument of democracy. The time publicly designated as a period of reflection was wasted. Instead of being devoted to consultation, social dialogue and discussion, it was spent in devising machinery for manipulation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It must be emphasised that the so-called Reform Treaty is a very high-ranking document, since it leads in fact to restrictions on the sovereignty of the Member States. It transfers many of the prerogatives hitherto reserved for nation states to EU institutions that are not subject to real democratic control. I am convinced that if the nations of Europe were given a voice, the treaty being signed tomorrow would share the fate of its predecessor.</p>

      <p sl="es">This is a frequent sensation for those of us who still cannot see that the European Union is doing anything to incorporate the regional issue or stateless nations into its institutional structure and politics. Every time, unfortunately, there are more people who believe that that day will never come, and the truth is that we are not given many alternatives.</p>

      <p sl="es">With regard to the Lisbon Strategy, we think that there is too much complacency and that this complacency is due, in large measure, to the fact that the indicators for evaluating that strategy are based essentially on growth of GDP.

      <p sl="pt">Instead of responses designed to improve working conditions, they rely on flexicurity to make work even more precarious. Instead of responses designed to improve living conditions and address the problem of poverty which affects more than 80 million people, they present an even more neo-liberal version of the Lisbon Strategy designed to pursue the liberalisation and privatisation of public services. So, as with the events of 18 October and the demonstration in Lisbon, the workers and the people will continue the battle against this Treaty and these policies and the campaign for binding referendums on the Treaty after properly conducted, pluralist debates.</p>

I think that we in Europe might learn a lot from his example.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are seeing a 'European Constitution', democratically rejected in two Member States by a large majority of the electorate, dished up to us afresh. Virtually unaltered, apart from a few cosmetic changes. There is no room for any more real debate and certainly not for a referendum in countries likely to be critical of it or to vote no. The European Constitution – sorry, the Reform Treaty – is being signed in Lisbon amid much pomp and ceremony and will then be rushed through the parliaments that support it with indecent haste. Europe is a sham democracy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">And the way in which the Eurocrats treat the voice of the people was again apparent very recently in what Commissioner Rehn told us about the possibility of Turkish accession. He is on record as saying that national agreements or specific election pledges must not stand in the way of Turkish accession.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there are some important issues on the agenda of the forthcoming European Council. I look forward to hearing about improving Europe’s competitiveness, about progress towards Europe’s ambitious goals for tackling climate change and about Europe’s commitment to working with the developing nations to alleviate poverty. Yet the focus this week will inevitably be on the signing of the Reform Treaty in Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we British Conservatives have consistently said, there was no substantive requirement for this far-reaching Treaty and, just this week, one of Europe’s leading academic experts published a report on the effects of enlargement of the EU. She has stated clearly what we have been saying for some time, namely that the EU has been operating perfectly well without this Reform Treaty. She says, and I quote, ‘The evidence of practice since May 2004 suggests that the EU’s institutional processes and practice have stood up rather robustly to the impact of enlargement’.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is important bearing in mind all we have been told – that the EU could not cope with enlargement without institutional upheaval or even log-jam. All of this reinforces our view that this Treaty is all about political symbolism rather than any objective assessment of what Europe needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to challenging the rationale for this Treaty, we have also been very critical of the process that brought us to this stage. It beggars belief to claim that this Treaty is not in substance the selfsame European Constitution that was so emphatically rejected when it was put to the vote in France and the Netherlands. Alone among his fellow leaders, the British Prime Minister persists in perpetuating this myth that the Treaty and the Constitution are different. The British people do not believe him and the vast majority have repeatedly expressed their view that there should be a referendum. Mr Brown has ignored their wishes and this has done much to undermine his Government and the European Union more generally.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, in 1981 one per cent of Europe’s population possessed 8% of its overall wealth. Twenty-five years on, the wealthiest one per cent has 17% of total income in the European Union. Meanwhile, one person in six – a total of 74 million Europeans – lives below the poverty line as defined in the individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Were it not for social transfers, around 185 million Europeans – almost 4% of the population – would slide into poverty. Hence the need for an active social policy: a policy to redistribute wealth. The Union’s effort on the social front is, however, particularly puny. The vision that the Commission has just outlined, of a more socially orientated Europe in the 21st century, is conceptually flawless but bereft of any actual legislative initiative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commission President Barroso has just told us that the Lisbon Strategy is bearing fruit. He is right. Yet, at the same time, the economic upturn in Europe is threatened by a particularly treacherous version of globalisation, in the shape of financial markets without frontiers. The so-called ‘subprime’ lending crisis had its origins in frenetic consumerism in the United States. The global financial industry went in for ‘special vehicles’ funded through unsound mortgages, and the cream of the banking, insurance and pensions sector treated us to yet another triumph of greed over intelligence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The financial sector itself, of course, risks nothing: it is ‘too big to fail’. National central banks and taxpayers will ensure a safe landing for the golden parachutists, and that will not come cheap. Economic activity in Europe has already slowed down. Recession is looming in the United States. The dollar is sinking and prices of raw materials, including basic foodstuffs, are soaring. The credit crunch is already affecting small and medium-sized companies and would-be home buyers.</p>

      <p sl="it">It changes nothing of course, the negotiations will continue; however, Sarkozy, who is currently the strongest and the most political of the European Heads of State, as borne out by the speech that he gave to this House, then comes to talk to us about Europe’s borders and the Mediterranean Union and people say rather dismissively ‘he doesn’t know what he is talking about, what is this Mediterranean Union, he doesn’t know what game he is playing’.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my view, the game he is playing is very clear and concerns Europe’s borders: the Mediterranean Union is the strategy of the Europe of nations. In practice, if the approach were solely one of a relationship between nations, a Mediterranean Union could well be a reasonable way of solving economic, trade, and environmental problems. It is not reasonable, however, and an alternative needs to be found, if we want something else, if we want a Europe of law, of individual rights in particular, a Europe of citizens rather than a Europe of states.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is the alternative that the Heads of State, the Commission and the European Union must use to counter Sarkozy’s French strategy of a Europe of nations. We have to decide whether we want the Charter of Fundamental Rights, one day in the future, to be the Charter of Rights of Turkish citizens, the Charter of Rights of Moroccan citizens, the Charter of Rights of Israeli and Palestinian citizens; we have to decide whether or not we want to give our Europe such a future, as otherwise the Europe of nations and states will prevail.</p>

Where in this new version is there anything, for instance, reflecting the strong call to defend the European social model which emerged from the popular referendums; what answer have you given?</p>

It is sad that this Parliament has for most part applauded this. It is an expression of the highest arrogance and disregard for the citizens’ voice. I have the impression that the politicians are either too lazy to explain the new Treaty or – worse still – they are afraid of the citizens. The politicians do not want to have to explain how the new Treaty will change the Member States’ share in decision-making within the EU. The politicians do not want to have to explain to the citizens that they will not have ‘their’ Commissioner in the Commission. They do not want to have to defend the fact that issues such as migration, energy and transport will not be dealt with in the individual states but in Brussels. Ladies and gentlemen, if we do not win the citizens over for the rules governing the new configuration of the EU, if we do not explain to them, on the one hand, the advantages of integration and, on the other, the issues of loss of national sovereignty, which the Treaty clearly implies in some areas, the gap between the political elite and the citizens will continue to grow wider and wider.

      <p sl="en">Our discussions in the Committee on Foreign Affairs in this House allow me to pronounce a very positive view on the new Treaty for a number of reasons. A single framework greatly enhances the coherence of the EU’s external action: the new Treaty implies a major step forward when compared to the existing arrangements. It provides an explicitly legal basis for the Neighbourhood Policy, establishes a single legal personality of the Union as a whole and obliges Member States to consult one another and to demonstrate mutual solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Most importantly, the new Treaty enhances the budgetary powers of Parliament over EU foreign policy spending, putting the European Parliament on an equal footing with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, the new legal basis for instruments or policies related to the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) are also established, for instance the sanctions against non-state entities, space policy and energy security, combating climate change, prevention of international terrorism and protection of personal data.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, the greatest improvements refer to the European security and defence policy (ESDP), since the Lisbon Treaty provides in particular for a permanent structured cooperation in defence between those Member States with the military capability.</p>
      <p sl="en">From our point of view, however, the new Treaty also suffers from a few shortcomings: the European Parliament should be consulted on the nomination of the new High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, not only for the first person to take office on 1 January 2009, but also in the case of the interim appointment afterwards and, obviously, when appointing the whole Commission, including its Vice-President for Foreign Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also highlight the need for the new, newly-elected High Representative and Vice-President to effectively consult Parliament ex ante on the main aspects of the basic choices of CFSP and ESDP.</p>
      <p sl="en">To sum up: the Lisbon Treaty constitutes a milestone in the institutional development of the European Union in foreign affairs and, as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I would like to warmly welcome its pending signature.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, three years after the end of the Second World War the United Nations Organisation proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which remains the standard text in this field. Almost 60 years later the European Union codified human rights in its Charter of Fundamental Rights, a document meeting the needs and expectations of Europeans on the threshold of the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Why then have two States, Poland and the United Kingdom – so committed to the codification of human rights at international level – objected to the Charter? Why do they not wish to give it to their own citizens? My disappointment as a Pole is all the greater as both Poland and the United Kingdom had previously accepted the Charter. Their prime ministers and ministers of foreign affairs signed it as the second part of the Constitutional Treaty in Rome on 29 October 2004. Their signatures not only obligated them vis-à-vis their European partners, but also constituted a signal to the citizens of their own states and a promise that they would abide by the Charter.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The content of the Charter has not changed since 2004. What has changed is the attitude of Poland and the United Kingdom. My question is: why are the successors to Tony Blair and Marek Belka objecting to the Charter and depriving their fellow citizens of its benefits? I would also request the Chairman of the Council of Europe to ask the present prime ministers of Poland and the United Kingdom why they are not honouring the signatures of their predecessors. In foreign policy the principle of continuity is fundamental, and we citizens – I refer to the Poles – need the rights embodied in the Charter.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has been said here on the substance of the Treaty. We German Liberals have always attached vital importance to certain key points. Firstly, the institutional compromise had to be preserved. Secondly, we wanted an EU foreign minister, not as an embellishment but as a genuine mouthpiece of the European Union. We agree entirely with what Jacek Saryusz-Wolski said a few moments ago about institutional improvements. We still believe, however, that the Common Foreign and Security Policy will continue for the foreseeable future to stand or fall by the political will of the Member States, and that is regrettable. The third point to which we attached particular importance was firm protection of fundamental rights, and for this reason we look forward eagerly to the proclamation of the Charter.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the whole, it must be said that the Treaty of Lisbon is a success for German-Portuguese cooperation, for which both Presidencies deserve to be congratulated.</p>
      <p sl="de">A real fly in the ointment, however, is the lack of progress in bringing decision-making processes closer to the people. The Council’s decision not to present a consolidated text is what we would call Realsatire in German, meaning a real-life situation which is more absurd than anything a satirist could dream up. This decision will soon be overtaken by events, however. I am sure that the public and the parliaments will obtain copies of the consolidated text for themselves and read up on what the Treaty is really all about.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must now enter a phase in which the European Union reverts from institutional navel-gazing to the adoption of a global outlook. We must discharge our international economic responsibility. The general state of the world economy raises the spectre of slower growth and job losses in Europe. In many Member States, including my own, I am aware of a reversion to complacency and a weakening of the will to enact reforms. That has to change.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that we must play our role in international politics responsibly. People want the European Union to have a strong global role. The responsibility is ours.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Europe is not only an agreement among elites. It is not only the European institutions. Europe is above all a matter of trust.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Yesterday, however, Udo Voigt, the chairman of the National Democratic Party of Germany, declared on Germany’s public television channel that Poland must immediately return Silesia to the Germans – that Poland should immediately give Pomerania, Gdańsk, Wrocław and other cities back to the Germans. At the same time he questioned the figures regarding the number of victims of the Holocaust.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I ask myself today, when the spirit of Europe moves upon the face of the waters and above this Parliament, why Mr Schulz has lost his revolutionary sensitivity. Why did the German Government not speak out strongly? This is the kind of thing that led to the Third Reich.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We demand a sharp reprimand and delegalisation of the fascist party in question, which is doing something that can inflict the greatest harm on Europe: it is destroying trust between European nations that are striving for the common good. Germany, as a leading European state, should be especially sensitive to this kind of activity and take action immediately for the good of the European Communities.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I too should like to join in congratulating the Portuguese Presidency. The signing of the Lisbon Treaty and the EU-Africa summit will take their place as landmarks in European history. However, we cannot allow these tremendous successes to be overshadowed by coming events, and on that subject I must mention two concerns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is about ratification of the forthcoming treaty. The fact of abandoning the draft Constitution and replacing it by an ordinary treaty means there is now no impediment in any of the Member States – except Ireland – to ratification by a vote in parliament. That is a key feature of the political agreement concluded at the June and October European Councils. If, since then, any government has had a change of heart, the least it should do, in the interests of fairness to its partners, is to inform them before signature of the treaty and not afterwards. Mr President of the Council, I am confident the Portuguese Presidency will ensure that basic fairness prevails here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second concern – and it has already been mentioned by a number of my colleagues – is the situation in the western Balkans. For eight years now we have known that Kosovan independence must come sooner or later. Yet today, despite the considerable efforts invested by Javier Solana and the Commission, we are no less disconcerted by the situation than we were eight years ago.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have said repeatedly that the western Balkan region is destined to become part of the Union, and we claim to be embarking on a common foreign policy. Yet successive Presidencies of the Union have done no more than pass the hot potato to the next in line. Things have changed since 1991. Sixteen years and 300 000 deaths have intervened and it is time for the EU countries to show they have learned the lessons of that sad past. The future of the Balkans will not be decided in Washington or Moscow, or even in New York: it will be decided here in Europe, among the peoples who are directly affected and their European neighbours, friends and partners.</p>

    <intervention id="3-037" speaker_id="28124" name="Gunnar Hökmark" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I shall speak first about Kosovo. In the Balkans and the Caucasus, we see a conflict between European values and nationalist tendencies, between European integration and movements and ideas that are supported by Russia. If, in the future, we look back, I am quite sure that we will never regret the efforts we can make today in order to support European integration with all the different means we have, but we might very well, in the future, regret the efforts we have not made. I think it is important to discuss that at the European Council at the end of this week.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish, secondly, to speak about globalisation. I think it is important to remember that it is globalisation that has made Europe into a leading world economy and that globalisation is a necessity if we are to be the world’s leading knowledge economy, because we will never be world leaders if we are only the best in Europe. We can never achieve results by protectionist measures. In the long term that will undermine the opportunities for jobs and prosperity, but it will not give us the opportunity to be a world-leading economy as well as defending European values.</p>
      <p sl="en">That leads us to the conclusion that it is important that the European Council underlines all the efforts that are needed regarding energy legislation, telecom legislation, the internal market, trade and competition. Competition is not a fight between different personalities or identities. It is an opportunity for all to participate and to move Europe ahead. That is the way we should choose, and that is how we can use the Treaty in the absolute best way to respond to the global challenge. That opportunity has been given to us this week and we should use it.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, President of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I feel it right that we should start by publicly recognising the work of the Portuguese Presidency on a date which is very significant for the European Parliament, as exemplified by the ornamental front to the Presidency podium depicting the solemn declaration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Portuguese Presidency received – and I say this as a representative of the European Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference – a draft in which the Charter of Fundamental Rights was only declaration No 11. It is also right to point out – as the President of the Council told me personally at the beginning – that it was virtually impossible to change that status, and I believe that in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference we jointly managed to ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights was a legally binding charter. The Member States did not want to include it in the Treaty, but it is a Charter and has a constitutional status.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think we should remember the efforts made by many men and women over the years in the European Parliament in order to achieve that Charter. I think we ought to remember the woman who embodies the tragedy and the power to overcome of 20th century Europe, Simone Weil, not to mention men such as Altiero Spinelli, Fernand Herman and many others who worked for so many years so that, finally, we could have a declaration of rights which would express our identity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I also think it is time, in a Parliament which legislates indiscriminately about cows, goats, cucumbers and finance, for us to talk finally about people, about the man and woman in the street. I find it regrettable that there are still a few States even today who are limiting the rights of their nationals as European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, Mr President, I would like to add another important comment, which is that the Charter and the Lisbon Treaty strengthen the Union as a supranational democracy of States and citizens, and that is the first response in an era of political globalisation. We are doing it at regional level, but I believe that it is an example which we should follow for our own future and for that of mankind as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are preparing the summit, and I do not expect this summit to spring any surprises. I do expect it, however, to open doors to the future and to position the European Union on many issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first door it must open is the door to ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. We expect ratification to be effected quickly in all Member States and the result of the 2009 elections to the European Parliament to be taken into account in the appointment of office-holders pursuant to the new Treaty. I also expect, however, that clearing the way for ratification will also mean that the Council and Commission finally begin to communicate and provide information on the content of the Treaty in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Do not remain silent about the reasons why we support this Treaty. We welcome it because it strengthens our citizens, our parliaments, democracy and the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second door we are opening is the door to freedom. Schengen will be discussed. We are pleased that more Member States now fulfil the Schengen criteria, because meeting the Schengen criteria means more freedom within the European Union and greater freedom for citizens of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, the door will, I hope, be opened to enable the European Union to assume more global responsibility. Let me therefore say plainly that the scope for a negotiated solution to the Kosovo question has been exhausted and that the European Union must jointly assume responsibility for Kosovo. It is our unequivocal view that the future of Kosovo and Serbia lies in the European Union and that we must make every effort to ensure that people’s desire to be free and to live in peace with each other is satisfied.</p>
      <p sl="de">My last point concerns the door to research and technology. Implement the Galileo decision, which could only be taken because the European Union shouldered its financial responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, President of the Council, the Portuguese Presidency is leaving a legacy that is highly stimulating but also fraught with responsibilities. It is this political legacy that this week’s summit will be called upon to consolidate and develop. The signing of the Lisbon Treaty tomorrow, the solemn ratification of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the three institutions of the European Union in a few minutes’ time, the establishment of a strategic partnership with Brazil without detriment to the European Union’s special relations with Mercosur, the resumption of regular strategic summits with Africa, and lastly the boost given to the Lisbon Strategy and many matters of decisive importance for the future of Europe: these are notable achievements but they will only be of use if they produce the policies and achieve the objectives that are essential to make Europe stronger, more cohesive, more united and more decisive for world stability.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is, in short, the responsibility that the Member States, the European Council, the Commission and Parliament too inherit from the Portuguese Presidency. But it is also the incentive that will enable us all to emerge from the institutional crisis that has held Europe back and impeded the process of European integration for the past two years. To repeat what I have already said many times, my sincere congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency and I hope the forthcoming Slovene Presidency will continue on the same lines and develop what has been done. The sole aim of the forthcoming Brussels summit should be to create the necessary political conditions for that to happen.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I am pleased that the Lisbon Treaty is to be signed tomorrow. This will end a period of some uncertainty in which outsiders perceived the Union as suffering from a certain paralysis. I therefore congratulate the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="es">Once the Treaty is signed, I hope there will be no reason to sit back. It is a time for the Union, and hence the European Council, to look outward and to be decisive in tackling the problems faced by citizens. I will single out three.</p>
      <p sl="es">Economic growth: the European Council must not become complacent. The signs are not good: the euro is fairly strong, making exports difficult; inflation is falling; the dollar is fairly weak and oil continues to be expensive. All the studies – the most recent being that of the OECD – are lowering their forecasts of economic growth in Europe for 2007 and 2008.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, illegal immigration: this is a serious problem which the Conference of Euromed Ministers, among others, has been trying to tackle during this six-month period. In the action plan approved at the Africa Summit I also saw references to readmission agreements and other instruments, but will those undertakings be honoured? How long has the European Union been negotiating readmission agreements with certain Mediterranean countries?</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, illegal immigration does not just depend on cooperation with third countries; we too need to fulfil our commitments, for example with respect to FRONTEX. Furthermore, the effective enlargement of Schengen, which the European Council is to confirm on Friday, also means extended external borders. I hope that the authorities and officials responsible for those new borders will be up to coping with the illegal immigration network.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, terrorism: the threat persists. There are the recent threats from Al Qaeda leaders; there are yesterday’s bloody attacks in Algiers; and I would remind you of what happened in France last week with ETA.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am pleased that, during the Portuguese Presidency, there have been efforts to fill the post of European counter-terrorism coordinator, which has been inexplicably vacant for over six months. If by chance there was a lack of powers or resources, the reform of the Treaty was surely a lost opportunity to strengthen this post.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I hope that the European Council will insist on rapid processing of the recent Commission proposal to amend the framework decision on terrorism to include condoning as an offence.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, 2007 – this year of the German and Portuguese Presidencies – will go down in the history of European integration as the year of the ultimate snub to the peoples of Europe and to democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The treaty that will be signed tomorrow in Lisbon is neither simplified nor consensual. It is nothing more nor less than a rehash of the Constitutional Treaty, to which the French nation said ‘no’. Yet most of you, along with Mr Giscard d'Estaing, are noisily celebrating.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To those of my French colleagues who support this Constitution-with-a-makeover I must therefore address a very solemn warning. The provisions of the treaty create a new state. That state is being imposed upon our people against their will and it will therefore have no legitimacy. The consequence is quite specific, and quite dreadful: the organs of the European Union and the texts that they produce will have to be regarded as unlawful. Soon, therefore, we shall have a pressing duty incumbent on us under international law: the duty of disobedience. I have nothing further to say.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to refer briefly in my closing statement to an issue which has been raised several times and which is of the utmost importance, which is naturally on the European Union’s external agenda and will most probably continue to be a priority in the coming weeks and months. I refer to the question of Kosovo. I should like to explain briefly the Portuguese Presidency’s position on this vital issue.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In our view it was most important, after the Ahtisaari plan was presented to the Security Council, for the European Union, Russia and the United States to form a Troika in order to seek, again in very close contact with the parties, possible solutions on which the parties could agree. There were two main objectives, the objective of trying to explore certain aspects of the Ahtisaari plan that could and should be explored. On the other hand, we are sure, we and the European Union, that we have done all that we could to make it possible for an agreed solution to be reached on the future of Kosovo. We had 120 days to do it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We now know, and it is a matter of public knowledge on which the Troika too has reported, that it proved impossible for the parties to agree on the future status of Kosovo, but all is not lost. In the first place, we must record the excellent climate, the excellent atmosphere between the parties to the Troika and in the relations between the Troika and the parties. In the second place, as we hoped and expected, it was possible to explore some of the aspects highlighted in the Ahtisaari report and new points of agreement naturally emerged on that basis. In the third place, a most important aspect and one which has perhaps not received due attention is the fact that the parties agreed not to resort to violent solutions to settle the question of the future status of Kosovo. We attach great importance to this political commitment and we only hope, naturally, that it will be respected.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The process has been referred to the United Nations again and will be debated again in the Security Council. The United Nations, let us not forget, has a fundamental role in this matter. But if it proves impossible at United Nations level for the members of the Security Council to agree on a solution that will determine the future status of Kosovo, we have no doubt that the international community and the European Union in particular will itself have to take decisions which we all know will be complex and perhaps difficult ones.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Three observations in this connection are of fundamental concern to the Portuguese Presidency and will be of fundamental concern to Portugal as a Member State of the European Union after 1 January. Naturally, the first concern is to preserve the unity of the Member States. In our view, it is essential that when we are called upon to decide and if we take a decision it must be a joint decision. We must present a united front. In our view, this is absolutely essential. What we would not like or wish to see, what we would do everything possible to avoid, is for Europe to be divided on the question of Kosovo as it has been in the past on so many international situations, difficult international issues carrying great responsibilities. Unity must therefore be our watchword.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, the European Union must assume its responsibilities because Kosovo is above all a European problem, our problem, and while it is clear that we rely on all our international partners in seeking a solution to this question too, Europe cannot turn its back on Kosovo, it must fully assume its responsibilities for a European problem and, at the conclusion of the Presidency, I consider that the European Union is perfectly aware of this fact and perfectly aware that it has a leading role to play in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thirdly, we must not be precipitate, we must consider carefully the consequences of any decisions we may take, we must naturally seek a consensus if possible in all circumstances and in all situations, and we must also naturally take a clear position on this question and convey that position in a very transparent and very obvious form to all partners who are also involved in the question of Kosovo in any way.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, any solution to the question of the future status of Kosovo must always and in all circumstances respect the values and principles that are fundamental to the European Union: peace and regional stability of course and also, obviously, respect for the law, respect for democracy, respect for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is no other frame of reference for the solution to the problem of Kosovo and we must not, under any circumstances, forget that the European Union offered the countries of the Western Balkans and Serbia in particular firm and unequivocal European prospects, and we must work with the parties to that end also. The parties must know that their natural vocation is to be in Europe. Let us hope that the European Union, in solving the difficult question of Kosovo – and, let us have no illusions, this is a complex and a difficult question – we have no alternative, as I say, that the European Union, in all circumstances and despite any differences there may be on particular issues, must maintain its unity. This is fundamental and essential to the credibility of the European Union and its external actions. That, in brief, is what I wanted to say to you about Kosovo.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, Mr President, I hope you will forgive and I am sure you will understand if I end on a personal note: this is the last time I shall attend a debate in the European Parliament as the representative of the Portuguese Presidency. This is therefore a farewell and a farewell that cannot pass without an expression of recognition and gratitude for the support I have always received in this House from the President and from all the Members. I have learned with you and I have learned through you how important this Parliament is in strengthening democracy in our Union and also, naturally, in strengthening the legality of the decisions that we take here with a view, obviously, to creating a freer and more prosperous Union for the citizens of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">So thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I should also, naturally, like to thank the Commissioners and the members of their staff, and the President of the Commission, who often participated with me in these debates and with whom I was able to establish much common ground in our work, objectives and efforts. Thank you, Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should also, I am sure they will understand, like to thank the officials of the European Parliament and especially, if they will forgive me, my compatriots who work here. Finally, and I hope I have not forgotten anyone, I should like to thank my interpreters, the Portuguese interpreters, of whom I am very proud. I will end with the English expression: "I will miss you all" or, in Portuguese: “Já sinto saudades”. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you very much for this wide-ranging debate, which I think will provide valuable input to the meeting in Lisbon and to the summit in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to focus on a few areas that have been raised this morning, starting with the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter. First of all, I think that the Portuguese Presidency, like the German Presidency before it, deserves great credit for getting us to this point. The signature in Lisbon tomorrow will underline the commitment of all signatories to achieving ratification of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to use this opportunity to again thank the Parliament representatives for the important role that they have played in allowing the Union to solve its institutional difficulties. Of course, the Commission has also actively engaged throughout this long procedure, not least through the Citizens’ Agenda and the ‘twin-track approach’, which President Barroso referred to earlier on. Do not forget, those of you who say that, after all, the Union works even without these changes, that there are a number of new elements in this Reform Treaty that will help us and explicitly allow us to tackle more effectively climate change and the whole energy challenge, as well as providing for more openness through public Council meetings and the increased role of national parliaments. So I think it will also help us to become more transparent, more open and more democratic.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whatever ratification procedure is decided by the different Member States, we all have an obligation to communicate with citizens. Of course we will have to do that in partnership and also respecting the different needs and wishes expressed by Member States about this debate. I think today’s proclamation of the Charter is also symbolic of another important achievement of the negotiations, a symbol of the fact that – except for special arrangements in two of our Member States and as long as the Treaty enters into force – the Charter will be legally binding, guaranteeing the fundamental rights of Europe’s citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point I would like to comment on is the ‘Reflection Group’, because I think we must make sure that it focuses on the policy challenges of the future and not mainly on the institutions. It needs to focus on the expectations of Europe’s people, and I also hope that this group will be representative of the diversity of the Europe of today.</p>
      <p sl="en">My third comment concerns migration. I think that an integrated approach to migration involves a mix of European Union and national policies. It requires coherence between our policies on legal and illegal migration. It involves actions in development policies, social integration, freedom of movement, border security and visas, to name a few. It is excellent that this Council will also be discussing these questions globally, but I think that Parliament can make a substantial contribution to this discussion. The Lisbon Strategy, as the President said, is delivering, and I think this should be a cause for celebration on all sides of this House. Equally, there is a consensus on the need for actions to address all aspects of sustainable development as part of the strategy. This includes flexicurity, social inclusion and climate change. If we can agree on the policy direction, we will be able to generate real political commitment to solve the real problems that have been mentioned by some of you.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, let me also say, on the issue of Kosovo, mentioned by many in this House, that the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed by a number of Members on the situation in Kosovo, and the European Union has done everything possible to reach a negotiated solution, but it is clear now that the status quo is unsustainable and that the UN Security Council will have to address this when it looks at it on 19 December. The European Council will have to take stock of the situation, and it should reaffirm the European Union’s commitment to solving Kosovo’s status and to playing a leading role in implementing a settlement, the framework being, as many of you have mentioned, the European perspective for the whole region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, this Council, together with the signature of the Treaty and the proclamation of the Charter, does not, perhaps, draw a line under the events of 2005, but it marks the beginning of a new phase of the development of the European Union.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, preparations for the EU’s December summit in Brussels are taking place in a better atmosphere than was expected. That is obviously due to the approval of the Reform Treaty and the prospect of its untroubled adoption in Lisbon. The compromise reached in Poland –which consisted in maintaining the previous government’s line on the Charter of Fundamental Rights so as not to endanger the whole treaty – has played its part.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It must be stressed, however, that the atmosphere created around the new treaty has exaggeratedly linked its adoption or non-adoption with the European Union’s chances of survival. Following enlargement in 2004 and the admission of Bulgaria and Romania – i.e. with 27 Member States – the Union functioned on the basis of the Treaty of Nice. That it was functioning effectively was proved by the adoption of the Financial Perspective for 2007-13. Admittedly, it was adopted with some difficulty, but agreement was reached about money, which seems to be the most difficult issue and is therefore a test of the usefulness of the existing institutional rules.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Despite this and other agreements, an impression of crisis in the EU was created artificially. That in turn had repercussions in terms of the declining confidence of citizens in the European institutions and the advisability of further enlargement. This dangerous spiral, halted to some extent in the second half of 2007, should serve as a lesson and a warning for the future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The signing of the new Treaty in the European Council of 13-14 December achieves a reform of the European institutions but, mainly, it increases the European citizens’ power to state their opinion on the European legislation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">After the new Treaty is ratified, the Parliaments of the Member States will include the legislative proposals of the Commission into their own agenda, thus increasing the degree of democracy in the Union. We would have wished a chapter of this treaty to be the very European Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Unfortunately, it is only an appendix of the Treaty, but the legal basis for making its provisions mandatory is thus created. The six chapters of the Charter guarantee the right to dignity, freedom, solidarity, equality, justice and citizenship. The adoption of its provisions will make impossible any future discrimination of European citizens on criteria of nationality, ethnicity, religion, age, gender, etc.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Treaty also offers the Union the possibility to promote the fight against climate changes at an international level and guarantees adequate social protection to all its citizens. The Union is not based only on economic criteria. We have to build a Social Europe, based upon solidarity, economic, social and territorial cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The adoption of the new Treaty requires unanimity in the Council and its ratification by all signatory States by June 2009.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I should like to begin this short statement by welcoming the decision by the European Parliament Committee on Fisheries to produce a report on the Common Organisation of the Markets in fisheries and aquaculture products. It is known and recognised that this COM has still not realised the objectives for which it was created, namely to ensure stable markets for fisheries products and to secure a fair income for producers. That being so, we appreciate the European Commission’s albeit tardy decision to undertake an in-depth evaluation of the existing COM and call on it to carry out its urgent revision in order to boost its contribution to guaranteeing incomes in the sector, ensuring market stability, improving the marketing of fisheries products and increasing the value-added generated, notably by a significant increase in financial resources.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Despite the fact that some of our initial proposals did not obtain the necessary consensus in the Committee on Fisheries, we consider that the report now put to the vote contains valuable measures, such as measures to determine whether the existing intervention mechanisms are the most suitable ones and whether they are sufficiently flexible to meet the relevant needs in the various Member States; to introduce a compensatory payment for sardines like the one already existing for tuna; to meet the need for the Structural Funds to contribute to the modernisation and creation of support infrastructures for producers in the context of production/marketing; to provide genuine support for the creation and funding of producers’ organisations and above all for small-scale coastal and traditional fisheries; to ensure the application to imported fisheries products sold on the internal market of the same rules and requirements as those applied to Community fisheries products. These are matters which, though they may not mean much to some Members, are most important for fishermen.</p>

    <intervention id="3-089" speaker_id="1253" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">Mr President of the European Council, José Sócrates, Mr President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to welcome you here to the heart of European democracy, to the European Parliament, today on the occasion of the formal signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This is indeed a happy day, particularly for the citizens of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Fifty years after the founding fathers created the European Communities out of the ruins of a shattered continent, our intention today is to proclaim solemnly the common values that form the core of our European identity.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Charter of Fundamental Rights that we proclaim today symbolises the momentous journey towards a Union of the people of Europe which we have been making together over the past fifty years.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This Charter is proof that, when we laid the foundations of the European Union, we had learned the most important lesson from European history, and today we continue to regard respect for the dignity of each and every human being, preservation of the freedom that has been won and of peace and democracy and application of the rule of law as the driving forces of European unification.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Freedom cannot develop without respect for the rights of others, and peace cannot flourish without fair accommodation of each other’s interests. Freedom, peace, justice and social welfare are achievable only as an integral whole; none of these goals can be obtained at the expense of the others.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The founding fathers understood this and established Europe as a community based on the rule of law. The European Union is not governed by the concept that might is right but by the principle that power emanates from the law. Therein lies the true modernity and vision of our Union, a community rooted in shared values. Only true justice can guarantee peace for all of us.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This vision of the founding fathers has come to fruition. Far more than that, in the struggle between two systems, in which freedom and democracy were pitted against dictatorship and oppression of the individual, it proved to be the stronger and the more successful vision.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The miracle of our generation has been the end to the division of our continent. The fall of the Iron Curtain and the accession of twelve countries to the European Union were possible because the voice of freedom and democracy and the power of equal rights for all were stronger than those of inhuman ideologies in the twentieth century.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Berlin Declaration, which was adopted on 25 March of this year to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome, states an important fact when it says that ‘We, the citizens of the European Union, have united for the better’, for it is indeed our good fortune that freedom, democracy and human rights have become a reality for all of us in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Today’s solemn proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights gives us a great obligation and opportunity to bring home the real essence of European unification to the people of the European Union, who number almost 500 million, and to future generations.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The essence of the European Union, ladies and gentlemen, transcends economic cost-benefit calculations. While these are important and will continue to influence our lives in the EU, we are first and foremost a community based on shared values, and solidarity, freedom and equal rights are part and parcel of our everyday existence. These common values, central to which is respect for inviolable human dignity, as enshrined in Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, form the foundations of European unification.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">For this reason, the European Parliament has regarded legally binding recognition of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a vital component of any agreement on the reform of the European treaties, and the European Parliament has got its way on this point.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 6 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which the Heads of State or Government will be signing tomorrow, lends the Charter the same legally binding character that the Treaties themselves possess.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">That 21st-century Europe should possess a comprehensive catalogue of human rights and fundamental freedoms which are equally binding and legally enforceable for all citizens of the Union is perfectly natural; more than that, it is the very core of our perception of the European identity.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">People and human dignity are at the heart of our policies. In this way the European Union constitutes a framework that enables us, as citizens of the Union, to build our common future in peace.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Without the firm foundations of our shared values, of which we must be ever mindful, the European Union would have no future. Nor would we have any grounds to insist on respect for human rights in the wider world if we failed to recognise our own values as legally binding in the European Union.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Nor shall we let anyone, whether inside or outside the European Union, set limits on our resolute defence of human rights. We in the European Parliament have a moral and political duty to defend human dignity at all times.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">In our world of today, we Europeans must project ourselves as a community united by shared values and stand up for human dignity, and we must seek intercultural dialogue. We can do that with confidence, and we must do it with untiring commitment – and no one will stop us.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">In the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the new open and democratic convention method was used for the first time in the history of European unification. That method proved highly successful, and the convention became the model and the starting point for the entire reform process.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The European Parliament has played a particularly active part in the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and has brought decisive influence to bear on the substance of the text.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Charter is the first instrument to enshrine economic and social rights with the same status as political rights and personal freedoms. It protects fundamental rights within the sphere of activity of the Union and in the application of Community law. It also gives all citizens of the European Union a right of recourse to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. We hope that the day might come when the Charter of Fundamental Rights is legally binding on all Member States.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible. I therefore appeal to all Member States of the European Union without exception to subscribe, in the interests of all citizens of the Union, to this European consensus.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Today’s solemn proclamation should also be an occasion for all European citizens who can assert their own rights on the basis of the Charter to reflect on their duty to the community of Europeans, the wider world and future generations. There are no rights without responsibilities. Solidarity is what unites us.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">We are creating a people’s Europe and giving our European Union a solid foundation of common fundamental democratic rights. Today’s solemn proclamation shows that our community based on shared values is alive and growing. Today that set of common values will be embedded in the lives and minds of the population of the Union. This day is a great triumph for the citizens of the European Union, and all of us can rejoice at that with heart and soul.</p>

Today, in a solemn sitting of the European Parliament, we are proclaiming the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and I should like to state clearly to you that this day – 12 December – will now be a fundamental date in the history of European integration.

      <p sl="pt">However much some may shout to try to stop others from speaking, this is a fundamental date in the history of Europe. And I want to say to you too that this date, this ceremony, is probably the most important ceremony in which I have had the honour of participating. The most important ceremony of my entire political career.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I feel deeply honoured as a European to sign a Charter and to proclaim a Charter of Fundamental Rights and I feel particularly honoured that this Charter is being proclaimed during the Portuguese Presidency. I feel honoured as a European and I feel honoured as a Portuguese citizen, especially as it was during our Presidency in 2000 that the Convention which gave rise to this Charter started its work. That is why I want to say to the European Parliament that it is an honour for my country to be associated in this way with an important step in the project of European citizenship.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This Charter represents a commitment to values that gave birth to European civilisation, values anchored in the defence of human dignity, and we are here to proclaim that we are true to those values, values that have their source in the constitutional tradition common to the Member States of the Union and also in international legal instruments, as in the case of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. And to emphasise this compatibility, the Treaty of Lisbon itself provides for the Union to accede to the Council of Europe Convention and thus recognises what the protection of fundamental rights now represents in modern democracies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is why today is a such an exceptional day because from today on, though some may not like it, fundamental rights will be formally and irreversibly established as part of the Union’s common heritage, a moral heritage, a political heritage, a heritage of citizenship and of the best aspects of European civilization.</p>
      <p sl="pt">But this Charter is also an instrument for political action, an instrument for the institutions because the Charter will shape their activities. They will be duty bound to respect the rights and principles set out in the Charter and promote the application of those rights and principles, but it is also an instrument for action by the citizens because it shows that the project of the Union is a project of citizenship and it shows that the Union is at the service of its citizens and that it protects and promotes their rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Charter embodies, in the European context, the projection of human dignity and the rule of social rights. This is why it also has a social component, because it projects human dignity in the world of work, in the world of employment, in the world of health, in the field of social security and welfare, and also human dignity with regard to protection of the environment. It is the Charter of equality and solidarity, the Charter of the battle against discrimination of any kind, and it is a Charter for equality because it enshrines a special attention, the special attention that we pay to children and young people, to equality between men and women, to the role of old people, and to the substantial issues of protecting personal rights and personal data.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I must also draw attention to the freedoms that are enshrined in the Charter, the freedoms connected with European citizenship and the political rights associated with it, and the economic freedoms based on the Treaty of Rome, whose 50th anniversary we are celebrating this year. We are therefore true to our tradition and we repeat the ban on the death penalty, and I especially welcome the decision taken by the Council last week to mark the European Day against the Death Penalty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, I should like to point out that the Charter covers the rights of citizens and the rights of people, addressing a body that extends beyond the actual citizens of the Member States, and this is no less important because it represents, as of today, a fundamental element in our conviction that a better world is a world in which these rights and freedoms are universally respected.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This Charter, as of today, will be at the service of the external policy of the European Union which aims to establish a world in which all these rights and freedoms are universally respected and guaranteed. It will therefore act as a pointer, a pointer to the position of the European Union on the international stage and in any action that is proposed to secure global respect for fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is why the citizens of Europe can, in this way, recognise themselves in a Union that is their Union. They can recognise the rights that the Union guarantees them and realise that Europe is a project of peace and democracy, a project in which the rights of the individual are fully respected. It is our moral authority and it is the sentiment of this ceremony that unites the three institutions. We are proclaiming this Charter on the eve of the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon, a Charter which has the legal status of a basic law and a legal status which is equal to that of the Treaties, for the benefit of many and to the displeasure of some. This Charter is in the Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In this globalised world, in which many claim that economic and financial rules are absolute, the fact that twenty-seven European States are reiterating in the context of the Union this firm commitment to values and objectives designed to protect and safeguard fundamental rights is a signal contribution to the regulation of globalisation itself. Fundamental rights are a common tradition of democratic states under the rule of law, ways of limiting the power of the authorities and fundamental instruments for the protection of the individual.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In binding the institutions and states of the Union, the Charter limits the power of the authorities in the name of protecting the interests of the citizens and their organisations. And in formalising this limitation on the power of the authorities, the limits on its application will strictly observe the principle of subsidiarity and strengthen the eminently democratic nature of the Union itself. The defence of fundamental rights is clearly a value that is essential to the European identity, that is part of our genetic code, an element that structures the whole European project and enables Europe to be defined as a Union of values, and the unconditional affirmation of these values is what the world expects of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is the Europe I want to belong to, a Europe that defends these values. And we are well aware, I and all the Members, that the battle for fundamental rights is a daily task and probably an endless task, a task for states, a task for civil societies, a task for industrial undertakings and trade unions, a task for each and every citizen. That is why, in proclaiming the Charter, we rejoice in the agreement reached on the Charter, in the recognition of its legal value on an equal footing with the very Treaties establishing the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">But in addition to marking a day for rejoicing, the proclamation of this Charter represents an agreement by the institutions of the Union to be respected and applied daily in its actions. Only in this way will we live up to Europe’s history, only in this way will we be worthy heirs of the best features of our collective identity and our common tradition: a collective identity and a common tradition that do honour to a Europe that fights for the rights, the freedoms and the guarantees of its citizens. I thank you all.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President of the European Parliament, Prime Minister of Portugal and President of the Council of the European Union, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Presidents of the three political institutions of the European Union – the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission – are signing here, in Strasbourg, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is, for me, a great personal honour to participate in an act of such high significance. The proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights enshrines a culture of law in Europe. In the European Union, which is above all a community under the rule of law, institutional changes require the reinforcement of respect for fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Honourable Members, today the three European institutions reaffirm their commitment – the commitment they made in December 2000 when the Charter was proclaimed for the first time. But, seven years later, we go a crucial step further.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Charter of 2000 was not legally binding. With tomorrow’s signing of the Treaty of Lisbon, and then ratification, the Charter will be part of the Union’s primary law and will have the same legal value as the Treaties themselves. This progress will have very concrete benefits for European citizens. Let me illustrate this point by looking briefly at the content of the Charter. The 54 articles cover rights that until now had to be recognised by the Court of Justice on a case-by-case basis. Now they are brought together.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Charter, recognising the basic principles of human dignity, incorporates first of all the classic civil liberties already included in the European Convention on Human Rights: freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, equality before the law and the principle of non-discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Charter also confirms economic and social rights. It includes the right to property and the freedom to conduct business, but, at the same time, the rights of workers and of social partners, and it enshrines topics such as social security and social assistance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Charter also covers the new challenges facing society today. It therefore includes guarantees on data protection, on bioethics and on good administration, known as ‘third-generation rights’. These will be highly relevant in many of our areas of activity, be it in research policy, in the area of freedom, security and justice or in our permanent quest for good governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will help to anchor the European Union within a genuine culture of fundamental rights. By signing the Charter today, we – the Presidents of the Union’s three political institutions – are undertaking, as a priority, to respect those rights in all that we do. That commitment might, on the face of it, seem easy to uphold, but in reality it will be an ongoing challenge to ensure that civil liberties are fully respected in all EU policies, whether in legislating for the internal market, managing immigration or endeavouring to combat terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Charter is the first legally binding document ever produced at international level which brings together in a single text not only civil and political rights but also economic and social rights, making them all subject to the same system of legal supervision. It is undoubtedly a major achievement and one that the European Union should be proud of. It is, I believe, particularly significant that this should be possible now in the new enlarged Europe, a Europe formerly divided by totalitarian and authoritarian regimes which disregarded human rights, whereas the Europe that we have today is a Europe united around the values of freedom and solidarity.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">If we work together to promote the culture of human rights, we shall make a crucial contribution to achieving a Europe genuinely rooted in values – tangible values that are credible in the eyes of ordinary people. Strengthened by the Charter, Europe has become more determined to promote its values at world level. Ever since the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Europe has led the way in the fight for basic rights. From now on it will be better equipped to pursue that fight successfully in the interests of freedom, peace and democracy.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Honourable Members, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a particular honour for the European Parliament to welcome to Strasbourg today His Majesty Abdullah II, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. We bid Your Majesty a warm welcome to the European Parliament.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">I also welcome the high-ranking delegation accompanying King Abdullah, particularly the Speakers of both Houses of the Jordanian Parliament.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Today’s visit by the King of Jordan is the third since 2002, when His Majesty first addressed the European Parliament. In November 2004 the King visited the Conference of Presidents in Brussels. His visit and his speech in the European Parliament today are both a sign of the strong partnership between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the European Parliament and an encouraging signal for our common future in the Mediterranean region.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Your Majesty, I had prepared a far longer speech, but since we had to ask you to wait for a while, I shall cut my speech short and simply say that it is wonderful to have you here with us, and it now gives me great pleasure to invite you to address us.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>

    <intervention id="3-103" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Abdullah II" is_mep="False" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. − Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim, Mr President, Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your warm welcome and, on behalf of the people of Jordan, I am honoured to come before this distinguished institution again.</p>
      <p sl="en">My friends, a changing Europe and a changing Middle East are here today. A Europe of expanding membership and a visionary mission: for cooperation across borders and growth without barriers. A Middle East of new horizons and growing hope: for peace among neighbours, opportunities for our people and a future for our youth.</p>
      <p sl="en">These trends do not take place in isolation. The achievement of the hopes of our regions will advance stability and create new possibilities for security and prosperity worldwide. It is deeply in our interest to succeed. And a critical opportunity is before us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two weeks ago, with the support of the European Union and nations from both our regions, Israelis and Palestinians met at Annapolis. They pledged all-out negotiations toward a peace treaty in 2008 and immediate steps to implement their obligations under the Road Map. For the first time in years, we see movement towards a permanent settlement and an independent, sovereign, viable Palestinian state.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">This progress is the work of many friends of peace, including leaders in Europe and the Arab states. We believed that, after years of worsening crisis, a change of strategy was required. We urged a new commitment to the two-state goal and a targeted process that could achieve it – with tight timelines, measurable requirements and milestones for action.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second chances are rare, but I believe we have come to one. Very real challenges lie ahead, but Annapolis has created a new spark of hope. We can and must fan that spark into a blaze of confidence, action and tangible results.</p>
      <p sl="en">As our near neighbour, Europe shares our interest in solving this, the central crisis of our age. All sides respect Europe’s neutral role and model of regional progress and peace. For years, you have been our partner in the search for solutions. And you will be our partner, too, in the benefits of success: a vibrant zone of peace and prosperity throughout our shared hemisphere.</p>
      <p sl="en">These realities give Europe an important and prominent role in the future of peace. I speak especially of the European Union, and you, the voices of Europe, here in the European Parliament. And I have come here today to urge your active engagement, to seek your specific, practical skills and investment in the future, and to offer Jordan’s own commitment in the days of work that lie ahead.</p>
      <p sl="en">My friends, there are major areas where action must begin now. The first is to support the negotiations and their goal: a final settlement creating an end to conflict, security for both Palestine and Israel, and at long last, a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian state.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">We must not underestimate the difficult days ahead. The issues are complex and decades old. Real grievances must be faced – and left behind. On the positive side, Israelis and Palestinians understand their deep, shared stake in ending the conflict. And a great amount of work has already been done. From Oslo, through the Road Map, through the Geneva Accords, and other initiatives, the parameters of the solutions are in focus. I believe the parties can get to the endgame.</p>
      <p sl="en">But for this to happen, it is vital that the international community be engaged. Europe has a unique experience of the mechanisms and process of post-conflict recovery and reconciliation. This includes creating a security framework that can offer assurance to both sides. European peacekeeping forces have played a constructive role in Lebanon. Your commitment can help bring great trust to a Palestinian-Israeli settlement.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the ground, there is a need, not only for resources but for partnership – to boost economic opportunities, create confidence that the political process works, and help create the conditions that will sustain peace. Both Palestinians and Israelis need to see tangible results, and quickly. That means security from violence and an end to occupation; but it also means better conditions of life. In the occupied territories, the humanitarian situation for Palestinians remains dire. People need access to jobs and education, effective public services and more. Such action will provide a major infusion of hope and be a powerful counter-argument to extremist predictions that nothing can change.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next week, donor nations and institutions will meet in Paris to make commitments and plan the way forward. European nations and the European Union are already providing help, a commitment respected by people throughout the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">A second and related imperative is to understand and articulate the potential of peace. We must begin now to re-envision the future: a region where conflict has given way to cooperation, where a regional economy brings together the capabilities and resources of 22 countries – more than 300 million people, from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean – and where cross-border partnerships advance development, health, the environment and more.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a future that empowers people to be full participants in global progress. And it will unleash a new scope of partnership with our European neighbours, in science, technology and trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">This promising future is why we must move swiftly on a comprehensive settlement, with action on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. Indeed, the entire Arab world has recognized the importance of moving forward. The Arab peace initiative was affirmed, unanimously, last spring. And it has received the support of Muslim countries beyond the region. The opportunity is here, at long last, for a sovereign, independent, and viable Palestinian state and full, normal relations between Israel and 57 Arab and Muslim nations. This means acceptance; acceptance by key countries, with billions of citizens, representing almost a third of the membership of the United Nations. And that opens a shared future of security, peace and new partnerships.</p>
      <p sl="en">Achieving such a peace will also make a substantial impact on other issues. Within the region, it will create new strategic space, allowing the resolution of other serious issues, from poverty to proliferation. Aggressive forces will no longer be able to exploit the Palestinian cause to serve their own ambitions and interests.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">Resources and attention will be freed to advance the region’s potential through development and reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">We in Jordan are ready to meet that future. We have pressed forward with our reform programme, despite regional instability. In the last decade, we have achieved significant gains: strong economic growth, rising per capita incomes, and a model education system. And Europe has been an important partner, through private-sector investments, as well as official assistance. Allow me to say that we deeply appreciate the support and friendship of this Parliament and the European Union.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">And we believe that in the days after peace, our partnership can only soar higher.</p>
      <p sl="en">My friends, today we can think of a larger neighbourhood, one that stretches from north of the Baltic Sea to south of the Mediterranean, one that is shared by Europe and the Middle East. It is the basis of the Euromed partnership, our region-to-region platform for cooperation and development. It is a relationship with great shared interests and unlimited potential. And it is up to us to develop our partnership to its fullest.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, young Europeans are coming to adulthood who never knew a divided Europe. Their young counterparts, Palestinian and Israeli, have no such positive experience. They have grown up in a world of division and conflict. Now, together, we have an opportunity to remove the barriers to their future, and leave the past behind.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, the European Parliament represents significantly more Member States than when I spoke before Parliament only five years ago. That is the result of a region-wide commitment to increase the zone of partnership and progress. The Middle East is tackling the same important task. Now, together, we can help that work succeed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, a renewed peace process has begun. We have seen such beginnings fail in the past. But this time, a unique confluence of events has created new openings for success. Now, together, we can and we must, fulfil the promise of peace.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">My friends, we in Jordan know that when an olive tree takes life, planting is only the first step. A hundred processes are then activated to create the cells and structures of life. Roots emerge, growth occurs, and a core of strength ensures survival. From outside comes water and support to sustain life and create new fruit.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the arena of the Middle East, a new olive branch has just been planted. Now the real work must begin. It is in our hands to create the process and structures that will give peace roots, help it grow and sustain it into the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I urge you to share in this effort. Our partnership can create an historic transformation and a rich harvest – years of peace and prosperity that will benefit our peoples and our world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in consideration of the formal sitting with the King of Jordan, all my fellow chairs of the political groups have no doubt been unable to take the opportunity to make a statement under our Rules of Procedure about the preceding occurrences. I should like to do that now.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe I speak on behalf of many Members when I express my thanks first of all to the President of this House, to Mr Barroso and to Mr Sócrates for the dignified way in which they defended this solemn act, the signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. They had the overwhelming majority of this House behind them.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">There are, however, two things I wish to say to the House, and I say them entirely in a personal capacity and not on behalf of my group. I speak for myself.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to draw the attention of the House to a matter to which I am privy as chair of a political group. It is not normal practice to report on the deliberations of the Conference of Presidents, but you should certainly know, ladies and gentlemen, that the only group chairman who asked at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents for an invitation to attend the formal signing of the Treaty in Lisbon was Mr Bonde. I believe the House should know that. No other group chair made that request. Mr Bonde, who makes such a racket here, was determined to be there at the signing of the Treaty. These are the kind of double standards we have to live with here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another comment I wish to make is that I learned at grammar school in Germany about the way in which the tactic of collective chanting was used to shout down political opponents in the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic. The political group that introduced the practice was the one led by Adolf Hitler. Today’s occurrences reminded me of that. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I shall be quite brief. I too was extremely shocked earlier today. This is a debating chamber where democracy rules, and there is no need for a carry-on such as we witnessed this morning for the benefit of the TV cameras. Communication is something to which all of us here are entitled. To those responsible for this morning’s commotion in a chamber dedicated to democracy and freedom, I would simply say that they behaved disgracefully. We will discuss it again this afternoon in the Conference of Presidents, with a view to preventing any deterioration of the situation.</p>

      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">My group is certainly in favour of a referendum on the new treaty and it has questions and misgivings about certain articles of the Charter. But all that is quite unrelated to what took place here this morning and it is important that there should be no confusion.

The behaviour of certain Members of this House in shouting down representatives of Parliament, the Commission and the Council during the signing ceremony was intolerable and must not be tolerated. It brings the worst of the football stadium into Europe’s highest Chamber and recalls the actions of the Communists in the Russian Diet and the National Socialists in the German Reichstag.</p>

There may be 50 nutcases in the chamber but there are 700 Members who oppose them, so do not inflate the fact that 50 lame-brains disrupted the signing ceremony into an affair of state. Let us calm down and, Graham, let us not insist that those responsible be thrown out. In my view, a free Parliament is a Parliament that can tolerate a few nutcases, irksome though they might be.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, today we finally saw the introduction of a transitional period for existing nutritional and health claims on the labels of food intended for children. The Commission had forgotten that and tried to leave Parliament holding the baby. We have prevented it from doing so. We have compelled the Commission to make a statement acknowledging the need to introduce transitional periods for claims relating to children’s health and development too. The only problem, however, is that the Commission’s long-standing refusal to present a proposal to this effect has distorted competition. Products have already been taken off the market because the Regulation has entered into force in the meantime. It has been a seriously botched job on the part of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, I tabled a motion on behalf of my group for the deletion of Article 4. That was a political demonstration. We stand by our opinion that this Regulation is senseless. It is not possible to produce nutrient profiles for all foodstuffs. Almost half of the Members of this House share that view. EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, has now stated that it cannot see itself being able to provide nutrient profiles for all products.

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I think it is very important that we should try and have health claims on products, but it is right that we need to ensure that they are true and based on knowledge. It is not appropriate for a company to produce the research and ‘commercial arguments’ itself, as if that were enough to win the arguments about health. In other words, the research and knowledge must be found to be proper and correct and therefore reliable.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is very important to ensure that nutrition and health claims are correct and that this would also enable someone to switch to a healthier diet. This is especially important with children and young people because we know the serious problems which there are at present in Europe with obesity, type II diabetes and other related conditions. We need to make sure that the nutritional value is good and that the health claims are true.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I voted against the report on the liberalisation of the secondary market in spare parts. It is an inconsistent strategy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">On the one hand we insist that the industry develop cars that are increasingly safe and we combat industrial piracy. However, in contradiction to this Parliament has today legalised the production of copies of spare parts, which allegedly makes them cheaper. Consumers, however, will not be guaranteed an uncompromised standard of safety in the repaired vehicle. Liberalisation supporters, mainly from the UK, affirm that SMEs will benefit from this policy. The majority of cheap copies of patent spare parts today, however, are produced in Asia, not in Europe. In spite of this, in the 10 Member States where design has not been protected to date, the cost of spare parts is 7% higher than in the remaining 17. The latter continue to protect design like Japan and other major car industry leaders. I would like to draw attention to the fact that in the case of an accident both car users and pedestrians will be now be more at risk because of non-original spare parts of a lower quality. This directive is unfortunately an example of inconsistent EU strategy.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I would also like to express my disagreement with limiting legal protection of industrial design for spare parts. We are witnessing an unprecedented level of interference in the area of industrial rights. If there are abuses of monopolies by industrial rights owners, ordinary legal instruments such as licence requirements can be applied. The creation of an industrial design incurs significant costs, which is why legal protection is pertinent from an economic point of view, too. Its abolition will not lead to liberalisation of the spare parts market as expected by the Commission, but in all likelihood to an increase in the price of the end product. The foreseeable reaction of producers to the presence of independent producers in the spare parts market will be to offset their losses through higher prices. It is also of concern that the lower cost of independent producers’ spare parts will result in lower levels of safety and quality. What troubles me is that in the final analyses it will be the customer who will be placed at risk.</p>

For example, we were able to ensure that it will remain permissible to enrich wines with sucrose. Parliament also rejected the Commission’s plans to enact provisions at this stage prescribing the lifting of the ban on new planting in 2014. In this case we proposed a practicable solution whereby the decision on liberalisation would not be taken until a study had been presented in 2012. With regard to the labelling of individual wines, we also reached an agreement that takes due account of the various designation systems used in Europe. We succeeded, moreover, in incorporating a safeguard into the wine-market regulations which protects the Bocksbeutel, the specially shaped bottles used in my home region of Franconia.</p>

This primarily concerns Italy, where illegal vineyards should be grubbed-up and subsidies for overproduction of poor-quality wines should be discontinued. The reform, however, must not favour Southern producers over Northern ones. I am categorically against any grubbing-up of vines in Moravia, where everything that is produced is used and where traditional wine production is of great importance both culturally and for tourism in the area. I object to a ban on sugaring in Eastern Europe, including Moravia, unless wine acidification, practised in Southern countries, is also banned. I do not understand why Moravian winegrowers should buy expensive must from Southern countries, only to replace a 200-year-old tradition of sugaring, thereby changing the traditional bouquet and taste of their quality wines. This is contrary to the principles of competition in the internal market and I cannot but disagree with it. I thank those colleagues who during voting time stood behind us and in doing so let common sense prevail. The Commission will now have to conform.</p>

How else can we interpret the proposal to maintain the frequent use of must in the southern parts of the EU, while banning the addition of sucrose. I am therefore very pleased that Parliament approached the reform responsibly and brought to it an element of equal and just treatment. By supporting the addition of sucrose, Parliament benefited the Czech Republic among other countries, demonstrating its impartiality and resistance to influences based on conflicting national interests. I understand that a reform of the wine market is necessary. I do not doubt the fundamental goals, rather the manner in which they are being achieved.

In this way, added impetus is given to the EU’s increasing interference and military intervention in support of NATO operations, both in the Balkans – an example being the preparations to support the ‘unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo’, in violation of international law -, and in Central Asia, notably by funding these ‘missions’ out of the Community budget.

In my modest experience, however, use of this exceptional instrument rarely meets the criteria laid down in the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Such is the case with the draft budget for 2008. Both the EUR 200 million to finance the Galileo programme in 2008 and the sum of EUR 70 million under Heading IV, to cover increasing needs in the CFSP area, are solutions to problems that were foreseeable. Despite the reservations of the European Parliament delegation, which pointed to a lack of adequate funding for satellite navigation and insufficient funding in relation to the European Union’s international ambitions, it did not succeed in convincing the Council of the need to increase the relevant budget allocations.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report contains some amendments to the proposal for a directive to liberalise the secondary market in spare parts, applicable to the motor vehicle industry, the machinery industry and the capital goods and consumer goods industries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission proposal advocates unprotected markets, whereas this report advocates a transitional period of 5 years for countries where there is market protection, as in the case of Portugal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We know that, on the one hand, protected markets lead to large undertakings having a monopoly on the trade in spare parts since, in protected markets, the consumer has to buy a replacement for a defective or damaged part from the original producer. The argument used is that the design of the product must not be altered, the best known example being that of the motor vehicle industry, although this proposal for a directive also applies to other industries. But there are practical cases where the replacement of a simple part requires a whole combination of parts, with the associated costs for the consumer.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the meantime, on the other hand, there are factories in Portugal connected with the motor vehicle industry in particular, which continue to operate thanks to their production of spare parts for the well-known makes and for which the ‘liberalisation’ of the market could cause serious problems.</p>

So far, impact studies have not shown any significant reduction in the consumer price of these parts in the Member States where the system has already been liberalised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also convinced that the European Union is undermining its own interests here.

      <p sl="fr">The rapporteur’s text alters the proposal significantly by advocating that Member States be permitted to retain legislation strictly protecting designs and models for a further five years. Retaining the manufacturers’ monopoly on the production of component parts is a means of preventing the loss of Community jobs to countries like Turkey, Brazil and Korea, where production costs and quality are lower.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Over-hasty liberalisation of this sector could also entail major risks, notably in terms of safety. If vehicle manufacturers are to have no responsibility for the production of component parts, there will be nothing to guarantee their compliance with specifications and no assurance of quality. Surely we must put vehicle users’ protection and safety before any economic or political considerations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The aim of this directive is to achieve complete liberalisation of the secondary market in spare parts. On the one side, therefore, we have broad groups of manufacturers of spare parts who are demanding that their rights in respect of free competition and the prohibition of a market monopoly be taken into account; on the other, we have car manufacturers (and here we are obviously focusing on the automobile industry) who base the defence of their spare parts production on the legal protection of designs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this situation, which at first sight seems insoluble, I support the approach of the rapporteur, who proposes a system under which designs would be protected for a limited period. In practice, the protection period would be closely based on the life cycle of the complex product.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also agree with the rapporteur that upon the introduction of a new protected design, the protection of spare parts involved in the old design should lapse. It should also lapse when a design that does not have a replacement ceases to be manufactured.

In my opinion, however, endorsing the practice of sugaring and the provision under which this practice does not have to be indicated on the information label for consumers are critical points. The passage on the so-called fruit wines is also entirely questionable, as is the report’s general approach in relation to must.

The report views grubbing-up as a potentially useful measure, to be proposed on a voluntary basis.</p>

We have absolute confidence in our proposals, which were adopted by all Members of Parliament from all Member States. Viniculture in Europe is part of our heritage. The cradle of global wine production is here in Europe. Viniculture means business, income and jobs. It is not the task of the Commission to seek market balance by limiting our production or by changing the rules to make production impossible. It is, however, the Commission’s task to safeguard our share of global markets and to ensure that our products enjoy the international prestige they merit. The aim must not be to restrict the market but to open up new markets. Why should we alter winemaking methods for wines that are selling well? Our winemaking methods are rooted in ancient cultures and traditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today the European Parliament has clearly reaffirmed its support for more market measures, national budgets and scope for regional initiative, for socially sensitive phasing-out of intervention measures and for the preservation of existing oenological practices, in other words the addition of sucrose and rectified concentrated must (RCM), with these additives being placed on an equal footing by means of additional RCM subsidies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Although it contains aspects that criticise, albeit mildly, the violations of human rights committed in the name of the so-called ‘fight against terrorism’ – violations which we clearly and firmly condemned from the outset – this resolution does not dissociate itself from the fight or seek to challenge it when international law is flouted and State terrorism is practised in its name.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Yes, it certainly calls for criticism of the violation of the right to a fair trial and data protection, the lack of transparency and democratic control, the refusal of the Council to answer ‘allegations of abuse of powers under the pretext of counter-terrorism, in particular in the case of CIA extraordinary renditions and black sites’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nevertheless, we cannot accept that, under cover of the so-called ‘fight against terrorism’, Parliament should ‘warmly welcome the adoption of the new Reform Treaty’ and call on ‘the Member States to ratify it’; that it should highlight, once again, that ‘the US is an essential partner in this field’, adopting US foreign policy lock, stock and barrel; or that it should call for ‘the powers of Europol to be reinforced’ and for it to be accorded ‘independent power to conduct investigations’.</p>

It is high time the EU recognised that mass immigration from the Islamic world is a potential security risk, particularly since emigration to Europe has become a means of acquiring martyr status and the infiltration of the Christian West by Muslim immigrants has been declared a religious objective.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead of acting accordingly and pressing for an immediate halt to immigration from Islamic countries as well as getting to grips with the repatriation of illegal immigrants, the EU is adopting a softly-softly approach to avoid vexing the Muslims who are here already.

      <p sl="el">The European Parliament resolution matches and in many respects outstrips the reactionary policy and anti-democratic measures of the EU, which, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, restricts the fundamental personal rights and democratic freedoms of workers. It calls for still greater strengthening of police and judicial cooperation between the enforcement mechanisms and secret security services of the Member States, Europol and Eurojust, and for greater effectiveness in the operation of the SIS II and VIS databases, in order to extend and increase the effectiveness of the monitoring and filing of information on workers throughout the EU. Not only does this resolution align itself fully with the new dimension which the EU is giving to its ‘counter-terrorism strategy’, i.e. combating and preventing so-called ‘violent radicalisation’, but it demands that the strategy should be fought for and that it should be aimed, amongst other things, against ‘incitement to commit violent actions’. This strategy against ‘radicalisation’ reveals the real target of this so-called ‘counter-terrorism’ policy of the EU and its enforcement mechanisms: all those who resist and challenge its reactionary policy. However, no matter how many resolutions are passed by the political mouthpieces of the monopolies, they will not stop the opposition movements and the steadily growing groundswell of opinion challenging the EU itself as an imperialist inter-state union of European capital.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The majority of the EP ‘welcomes the Commission’s commitment to supporting the ratification of the Reform Treaty’, ‘urges the Commission … to intensify its efforts to develop a more effective communication policy in order to achieve a better understanding by citizens of EU action … with a view to preparing the way for ratification of the Reform Treaty and the European elections in 2009’ and ‘calls on the Commission to set out clearly how it intends to put into practice the content of its … priorities, particularly the priority relating to the Reform Treaty’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In view of the inadmissible role played by the Commission during the referendums on the so-called ‘European constitution’ conducted in 2005, such intentions, long proclaimed and now reaffirmed, will, if they are carried out, represent a genuine interference in the process of ratification which is a matter for each Member State.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Since it was impossible to secure private funding, as originally planned, to supplement the financing of the ‘Galileo’ project, the European Union ‘decided’ that it should be financed entirely with public capital, notably from the Community budget.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is the reason for the amendment to the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) – which established the Financial Framework for 2007-2013 – increasing the ceiling for authorisations granted under subheading 1a (competitiveness for growth) for the years 2008 to 2013 to a total of EUR 1 600 million at current prices, at the cost of under-budgeting and under-implementing the items under heading 2 (‘preservation and management of natural resources’, namely agriculture, fisheries and the environment) in 2007.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With this revision of the IIA and the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument, the EU is securing the future of its great ‘priority’ by guaranteeing its funding. It still remains to be seen whether, once the ‘Galileo’ project is completed – completed, it should be noted, with public funding – it will not be ‘offered’ at some later date to private capital, on the basis of some public-private partnership for example, with the public party bearing the costs and private capital making the profits.</p>

      <p sl="pl">As a member of the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly, I wish to support the results of last week’s EU-Africa summit meeting in Lisbon. At the Parliamentary Assembly’s last session in Kigali we called for prudence and the avoidance of hasty further regulation of relations between the EU and Africa. Clearly, the Joint EU-Africa Strategy must take account of the interests of both partners, and cooperation should not take place at the expense of either of them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The fact that the European Union is the African countries’ most serious economic partner – and that most aid to Africa comes from Europe – also imposes a special responsibility on the Union. That was made clear in the Joint Statement of the European and Pan-African Parliaments, which rightly called for greater involvement of both bodies in shaping future relations between the two continents. The European Parliament has clearly stated its support for the Kigali Declaration of 22 November 2007, calling for extension of the deadline for concluding negotiations on a new EU-ACP trade agreement, for the agreement to be a prudent one, and suggesting that the rigorous demands of the WTO need to be relaxed. It is good that the priorities set until the next summit in 2009 refer not only to peace, security, human rights, energy, climate change and migration, but also to combating poverty through employment, investment in health care, and education.</p>

However, João Cravinho, Portugal’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, as President of the Council, had already made things quite clear at the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly at Kigali on 21 November.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although obliged to retreat (for the moment), the EU sought to counter the resistance by coming up with a ‘proposal to negotiate’ the EPAs ‘in two phases, starting with trade in goods’ and proceeding later ‘to include other areas, such as services and investment’, at the same time promising millions and millions of euros as a pledge of the ACP countries’ sovereignty and independence (economic and, soon, political).

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I welcome today’s debate about the EU-China human rights dialogue. As you know, the human rights issue was raised and discussed at the very recent summit meeting in Beijing and the joint statement also explicitly refers to it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is fair to recognise that, although serious concerns remain and need to be addressed, China has also made remarkable progress in the human rights field over the last year. This is particularly true in the field of social and economic rights but also in some other areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are moves afoot to reform the ‘re-education through labour’ system. In this respect we welcome the new legislative initiative that is under consideration and we also hope that concrete reforms will be put in place soon. It is a fundamental principle of human rights not to deprive an individual of his or her liberty without due justice and a fair trial.</p>
      <p sl="en">China is also working to implement the recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture. For example, the Ministry of Justice has recently directed courts not to rely on confessions on their own as sufficient evidence of guilt, as such confessions can sometimes be made as a result of torture by police or detention personnel. Similarly, China is initiating specific training measures targeted at these groups of public order personnel.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also pleased to note the progress made with respect to the Supreme People’s Court now exercising full review power over death penalty sentences issued by lower courts. And we understand that the result is a reduction in the number of effective death sentences and executions. This is gratifying for the European Union. As you know, it has long been a priority area of intervention.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless – and now of course I also have to say a few negative things – the Commission remains concerned by the situation of human rights in China in general and more specifically in the field of civil and political rights. We particularly have in mind here freedom of expression, religion and association and the protection of the rights of minorities, for instance in Tibet and in the province of Xinjiang.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, the repression of human rights defenders remains a key concern. Exercising the right to speak freely often leads to beatings, to house arrest or even to terms of imprisonment. Access to the internet – the right to information – is closely monitored and restricted and those, for instance, who speak up in favour of greater autonomy for Tibet receive disproportionately long terms of imprisonment. The use of state secrecy legislation as well as other loosely defined criminal provisions facilitates the prosecution of those who speak or publish freely.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission therefore urges the Chinese Government to permit expressions of all forms of opinion. This is also, we think, a very important factor for how the international public views China, particularly next year in the run-up to the Olympics, when all eyes will be on China. History shows that allowing freedom of expression leads, in the long term, to a far more stable society. We all know that.</p>
      <p sl="en">All these issues are regularly addressed in the EU-China human rights dialogue. Therefore, we welcome the fact that the most recent dialogue which was held in October in Beijing allowed a sincere and an in-depth exchange of views on all topics of our concern, with several of the discussions leading to follow-up activity. It is important to recognise that this dialogue provides an important forum where both parties can openly speak about their genuine concerns while contributing to a better understanding of our differences – and our differences remain notable.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context we regret the Chinese decision to withdraw from the Human Rights Seminar in Berlin over the participation of two NGOs and that, for similar reasons, the Seminar could not be held in Beijing recently. We consider that civil society has a very important role to play and the Seminar provides the appropriate forum for NGOs to make their valuable contributions. I trust we are able to find a mutually agreed solution so that this important exercise will continue its successful path in the future, as underlined by the EU-China Summit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me close by saying that there are two more important human rights issues which we regularly raise with the Chinese side as a matter of high priority. One is the ratification by China of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the other one is the release of those who were imprisoned at the time of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations or who later commemorated the 1989 events. Decisive action on both sides would send a clear positive signal and would be highly welcome.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I should like to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for that statement.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think it is very important, following the EU-China summit – and particularly the EU-China human rights dialogue – that there should be an opportunity for Members of this House to examine the outcome. I do not want to spend time on the EU-China summit. I want to talk about the human rights dialogue, because that was what took me to Beijing last May when, jointly with Ms Flautre, I was preparing a report on the reform of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">I want this afternoon to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. That, of course, is the vast majority of people in China, who want change and reform. But that movement is led by, among others, Gao Zhisheng, a Christian lawyer who has disappeared from his home in Beijing, where he was being held under house arrest following his conviction for ‘subversion’ this time last year.</p>
      <p sl="de">While I know that his name was among those raised in the dialogue, I think that one of the problems that we find in this House is in relation to the dialogue. While I note that the Commissioner says that it was a sincere and in-depth exchange of views – and I am sure that was true on the side of the Europeans – I am not convinced that would be the case on the side of the Chinese. In my experience – since the time when I was EU-China rapporteur back in 1997, 10 years ago when this process began – there has been absolutely no product in human rights terms from China in the sense that people’s lives have been improved or prisoners have been released or torture has stopped or the massive imprisonment reported by Harry Wu from the Laogai Foundation has ended. He estimates that there are 6.8 million people in one form of detention or other in China today, many of them there for religious convictions – and we think especially here of the Falun Gong practitioners, who are blameless but who are tortured for their beliefs and, in many cases, are dying.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like also to reflect on the imminence of the Olympic Games. One should not forget that Article 1 of the Olympic Charter states that countries should enjoin ‘universal fundamental ethical principles’. That means only one thing: that China cannot be held to be an appropriate host for these Games, especially since nothing has fundamentally changed since 2001. I hope all Groups will support the joint motion, which calls for an assessment by the IOC of China’s compliance with the terms which were agreed back in 2001. I fear they will be found wanting. My view is that the Olympics should be transferred forthwith to Athens and remain there forever.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, to come straight to the point, I believe the Olympic Games should go ahead in China, because we have a good opportunity to use these very games to step up our dialogue with China. That is in the joint statement too, Mr McMillan-Scott, and if you hold the opinion you have been expressing, you are against the joint statement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, one of your former opposite numbers, Madeleine Albright, observed when she was US Secretary of State that it was naturally far more difficult to raise human rights issues in China than in Burma, because in China geopolitical factors were part of the equation. It is a fact that we need China as a partner in the quest for a solution to many global problems. That, however, must not prevent us from raising the question of human rights and discussing it in great depth, though not necessarily in the tone of schoolmasters or schoolmistresses who know it all. I am very pleased that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been signed today, because many speakers have made the point that we have no right to speak about human rights issues unless we ourselves have a very good record of respecting human rights. We, indeed, are firmly convinced that it is in China’s interests not to trample human rights underfoot but to respect them properly.</p>
      <p sl="de">China wants stability. How is China to remain stable if the question of human rights is not raised more emphatically? We do not want China to crumble. It makes no sense to build up Europe while seeking to destroy China, but failure to respect human rights puts China’s stability at risk. We want China to be governed in accordance with the principles of social justice. In the context of a monumental growth process, to which Mr Barroso also referred, the only way to safeguard stability is to take full account of social factors. It is impossible, however, to strive for social justice if human rights are not respected, if people cannot form trade unions or launch popular initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want China to focus more sharply on environmental matters, because the environment is a major common global asset. We know that many initiatives are taking shape in China for the purpose of mass protest against the violation of minimum environmental standards. It would be a good thing for China if the nation listened to those voices. It would be a step forward for China.</p>
      <p sl="de">For these reasons I believe it is not a matter of European arrogance but of protecting our common interests. In the interests of China we shall raise the question of human rights, and enlightened representatives of the Chinese political system would do well to listen to us and to this resolution, which is in China’s interests and which would help China to advance, something it cannot do unless it respects human rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I much admire the contribution of China to the development of world civilisation. In terms of technology, in terms of society and in terms of culture, China has probably contributed more than any other country to the development of humankind.</p>
      <p sl="de">I regret that China’s growing economic maturity is not accompanied by a growing political maturity. But I regret, too, that the European Union is not doing more to push China in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two days ago, on the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Union proclaimed its commitment to the ‘promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world as a cornerstone of our external action policy’.</p>
      <p sl="de">And yet, two weeks ago, Messrs Barroso and Socrates left the summit early, having secured Europe’s economic interests, leaving officials to negotiate the conclusions – conclusions which, unsurprisingly, made little mention of human rights, supported the lifting of the arms embargo and opposed Taiwan’s bid to join the United Nations. They did much to undermine Mr Solana’s carefully crafted words the previous month.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wonder what the world is coming to when the European Union, the self-styled protector of universal, interdependent and indivisible human rights, fails to speak out clearly against one of the world’s worst human rights abusers.</p>
      <p sl="de">I suspect that both the Chinese and others may come to regret the decision to host the Olympic Games in Beijing. The Chinese authorities themselves promised that they would bring a greater climate of freedom and openness. And yet figures from Human Rights Watch suggest that abuses have increased in the last seven years. Not only does China continue to execute more people than the rest of the world combined but it has clamped down dramatically on internal dissent and media freedom in advance of the Games.</p>
      <p sl="de">These developments violate the spirit of the Olympic Charter. They are in direct contravention of commitments made by the Beijing authorities themselves in the Host City Contract which they signed with the International Olympic Committee.</p>
      <p sl="de">That contract has not been made public. Why? Because, if the world saw the complete and total disjunction between Chinese promises and Chinese practices, we would have no choice but to boycott Beijing in the same way that we boycotted apartheid South Africa.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not believe in boycotts. I have also maintained that engaging with a China committed to reform and opening would bring greater fruits than empty threats. But President Hu Jintao has to accept that a deal is a deal. The Host City Contract, the human rights clause in the Chinese Constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – these are promises made to China’s citizens. If China wants the Olympics to prove its legitimacy and credibility to the world, then in return it must prove that it is willing to honour its human rights commitments: by improving media freedom in line with the Olympic pledges, by suspending the death penalty in line with United Nations demands, by ceasing its support for military dictators from Burma to Darfur and by allowing elections by universal suffrage in Hong Kong. That is how China can win its place at the heart of the international community.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the People’s Republic of China is a country to be found on every list of infringements of human rights, whether it is a matter of freedom of speech and association, compulsory abortion, disappearances, torture, religious freedom or threats of aggression against Taiwan.</p>
      <p sl="pl">China continues to persecute followers of the Catholic Church. A report by David Kilgour, the Canadian Government’s former secretary of state for Asia, shows that one of the most persecuted groups since 1999 is Falun Gong, whose members have organs forcibly removed in Chinese work camps. People whose only crime was to meet with a vice-president of this Parliament, Mr McMillan-Scott, have recently disappeared without trace.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Meanwhile, our trade relations are blooming. China is extending its influence in Africa and will soon be inviting millions of guests to the Olympic Games. I cannot understand the absence so far of the most obvious response: the free world must boycott the 2008 Olympics.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, we are talking today to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, and that is welcome. However, at the 10th EU-China summit in Beijing on 28 November, the European Union was represented by its President, by the Trade Commissioner and by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that, since 2000, trade between the European Union and China has increased by 150%; it is also true that it has become much harder to produce statistics on the deteriorating human rights situation in China. There is nothing taboo about discussing human rights issues at the same time as trade issues. There is an obvious link between them, for example in relation to the freedom to join a trade union, and the ability of workers in China to mobilise and demand better working conditions. The general attitude we encounter is deplorable, all the more so because its effect is to make us waste time: the decision taken in 2001 promised a new openness in China and progress on human rights and democracy; the Chinese people are waiting for that promise to be kept and they are looking to us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">They have been disappointed in their hope that openness would result from China’s staging the Olympic Games, and the sense of disappointment is bitter. Not only has the run-up to the Games so far brought harsher repression but – even more regrettably – the organisation of the Games has itself had unforeseen effects and has been used as a pretext for serious human rights violations. I am thinking here of the cases of forced expropriation and of the exploitation of migrant labour. All this may not be surprising, for the dissident Hu Jia informs us that the head of security in Beijing is also the person in charge of organising the Olympic Games there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Perhaps we shall get round to expressing surprise or even dismay about that state of affairs when the intimidation and repression of foreign journalists – which has already begun – becomes even more drastic, for they are already being prevented from working. The arrest of two Agence France-Presse journalists on 12 September, for example, shows that the rules introduced in January 2007 are being applied only patchily and only insofar as the persons concerned cause no embarrassment to the regime. The undertakings given by China are a dead letter; indeed, it is falling so far short of its commitments that it has resorted to compiling blacklists. There is currently a blacklist of 42 categories of people regarded as persona non grata during the Olympic Games, ranging from the Dalaï Lama to followers of Falun Gong and including dissidents.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In January this year, negotiations began on a new EU-China framework agreement. That is welcome because a new agreement also means a new ‘human rights and democracy’ clause. It creates fresh scope for discussing human rights concerns with the Chinese authorities. However, 2007 was also the year that saw the cancellation of a legal seminar to prepare for the human rights dialogue because the Chinese authorities refused to allow two particular NGOs to participate – one of them the well-known organisation represented by human rights campaigner Sharon Hom. It was certainly salutary to find the Union taking a firm stand on that occasion. At the same time, of course, we have to ask whether seminars like this can continue. Our position is that the two things must not be mutually exclusive. It is very important to go on holding legal seminars. Equally, however, we cannot permit the Chinese authorities to dictate who may take part in them.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, in past decades this Chamber has been the scene of many ringing declarations on human rights. The proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights has once again made us focus on what the essence of Europe really is. We are a community of values, based on solidarity, tolerance and respect for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At least, that is the theory, but the reality is rather different. And the European Union's watchword on human rights should really be rather different. In the last few weeks it has been abundantly clear that those who are sick of hearing about human rights are often the same people who apply that other principle of Realpolitik, namely erst das Fressen, dann die Moral, or 'food first, then morality', as Bertolt Brecht put it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In Paris Nicolas Sarkozy, in exchange for lucrative contracts, is rolling out the red carpet for a mass murderer who just a few days ago sought to legitimise terrorism, boasting that he did not waste words talking about human rights in his country. In Lisbon a bloodthirsty tyrant like Mugabe is received with full honours, because in Africa too we have to look after our commercial interests.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In China we are pursuing the same course. Last year Amnesty International reported that Beijing was lagging behind on crucial issues such as the death penalty, judicial procedures, press freedom and freedom of movement for human rights activists. In the meantime the Chinese capital is undergoing a slick clean-up, says Amnesty International. Re-education by forced labour and imprisonment without charge are now being used to punish offences like the unauthorised posting of bills, driving an unlicensed taxi and begging, to name just a few.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The human rights activists will be silenced, but the stadia will gleam and sparkle next year, ladies and gentlemen. A lot of European worthies will be jockeying for front seats at the opening of the Games. And when they get home they will doubtless continue the fight against extremism in Europe. It is enough to make you sick.</p>

      <p sl="lt">It is impossible to deny that since 1998, when we saw the start of the summit meetings between China and Europe, relations between the EU and China – at political, economic, trade and scientific research level – have been developing intensely and have grown into a strategic partnership. However, strategic partnerships, as we understand them, are based on common values, respect for democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Respect for human rights has always been and continues to be the foundation on which the EU is built. It is not a short-lived declaration, as the EU’s history over more than half a century has undoubtedly proved. It is time that all the countries, the EU partners, understood that there are some things that the EU would never give up and would never abandon. I would therefore like to point out that several hours ago in this very room a historic document – the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights – was signed.</p>
      <p sl="lt">At this point I would like to mention the fact that certain issues have a negative impact on the development of EU-China relations and the key to resolving these problems is in most cases in the hands of the Chinese authorities.</p>
      <p sl="lt">During our talks with the Chinese representatives, even during negotiations on trade and economic cooperation agreements, we have always remembered and will never forget the fact that people in China are continuing to suffer in prison for their political views, for their religion or for belonging to ethnic minority groups, and for economic crimes, such as tax evasion, they receive the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In recent years, with the approaching Olympic Games in Beijing, we have learned of other ‘developments’ such as the fact that people’s accommodation is being demolished without compensation being awarded, in order to make way for the construction of Olympic structures, and the existence of a list of 42 categories of people not to be allowed to attend the Olympic games, including the Dalai Lama, his followers and human rights defenders.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I can say only one thing: this is absolutely out of line with the traditions and spirit of the Olympic Games. My suggestion would therefore be to cancel these lists, which do China no credit at all, and ensure that in honour of the Olympic Games all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience are released and a death penalty moratorium is declared.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I regret the fact that the EU-China summit meeting in Beijing has failed to become a historical event and that the participants were not the sort of politicians capable of taking EU-China relations to a new level. Just one thing was missing: greater consideration and respect for people and their rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I speak in this debate on the EU-China summit and the EU-China human rights dialogue, although from some of the resolutions tabled by political groups in this House you would not have known that the first half of this debate existed.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is quite right that we raise with the Chinese the issue of human rights. The human rights situation in China is far from adequate. China continues to use the death penalty, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner stated in her opening statement. They repress campaigning organisations for Tibetan autonomy, religious groups outside a very narrow range of officially permitted groups, as well as others who promote their regions, promote press freedom and try and organise trade unions. We also have the insurmountable barrier with respect to the hundreds of millions of migrant workers in China who try to organise themselves to end exploitation and to promote decent labour standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet there is a complete refusal on the part of many in this House to acknowledge any of the progress that China has made over the past two decades. The human rights situation in China in my view, although far from adequate, is far better than it was back in the days of Tiananmen Square. As the Commissioner stated, the death penalty, for example, now requires confirmation by the Chinese Supreme Court. My own experience is that in China now there is a large degree of freedom of thought but not freedom to organise, because that still is the sine qua non in terms of what China and the Chinese authorities actually forbid.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must continue to press China on these issues, but a refusal to recognise any progress positively discourages those progressive and liberal forces within the regime who are trying to push further, because they get no recognition for what they have done already.</p>
      <p sl="en">China is now a global economic, industrial and political power. The EU needs to have a critical engagement that rightly criticises China where it has gone wrong, where it must go further, at the same time as we engage in a dialogue on tackling global warming, the negative impacts of globalisation, African development and the fight against terrorism.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I very much welcome a strategic partnership with China. I am very glad that we now have more than just economic ties alone and that cultural exchanges between us, for example, have grown enormously in recent years. I am very happy to see so much attention being given to the political dimension, and I will cite one example.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Africa: we must keep up our liaison with China on its Africa policy and we now have a forum in which to do so. I am pleased that Mr Michel is shortly going to Beijing to discuss that and other matters. And I find it a very good thing that we are increasingly working together on economic issues. But I am very concerned by imbalances in our economic relationship.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For example I find no hint of the fact that we should do more to pass on our experience of our Single Market to the Chinese who, in this regard, might improve their own market considerably. The same goes for regional policy, for the elimination of regional differences. We have experience in these areas. We have learnt a few lessons. But I do not think the Chinese are so keen to play ball here.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Mandelson has said that there is a fair bit of uncertainty about investing in China, and that this damages our exports to China, and Chinese economic growth too. He is right, I think. You need the rule of law, certainty, in order for the economy to prosper. On matters of intellectual property, product safety or capital management. But you also need the rule of law when it comes to individual human rights, of course. That is just as important, if not far more so.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am glad we are to have a report on the human rights dialogue. I think we should have one every time. Like you, Commissioner, I see a number of hopeful signs, but the European Parliament must maintain the focus on one or two things which have not yet been resolved: freedom of expression, policy on minorities, forced labour which regrettably still continues, abuse of power of which regrettably there is too much, and the death penalty which still exists. We as the European Parliament must continue to emphasise these things, and it is something we must do day in, day out.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are faced time and again with the question of the right way to proceed in our political dealings with China. Mr Sterckx has just spoken again of strategic partnership, and rightly so. I find that an absolutely desirable aim. But we must be realistic, and we are clearly not yet on that level at the present time, because we do not have a foundation of shared values – human rights, fair treatment of minorities, rejection of the death penalty – on which a genuine strategic partnership could be built.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe it was absolutely right – and I say this advisedly as a Green German MEP – for Angela Merkel to meet the Dalai Lama, because it shows that we mean what we say about respect for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, there is something I do not find at all right. President Sarkozy, when he recently spoke here, told us that human rights must be the hallmark of the European Union, only to travel to China three weeks later and not make an issue of human rights there. These are European double standards, and they are something we must not tolerate.</p>
      <p sl="de">I fervently believe that our dialogue with China, which I support and which we must have the political will to pursue, cannot be all fawning sweet talk but must also include confrontation. If we combine these and negotiate with China in a self-assured manner, we must also express unveiled criticism. In the context of the Olympic Games too, the Chinese have to achieve the goals they set for themselves, and we Europeans should be bold and frank and confront the Chinese with our criticism when the need arises.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, a few hours ago the President of the European Parliament signed the Charter of Fundamental Rights and declared that ‘we have a moral and political obligation to defend human dignity. This applies to each human being in this world.’ And the Portuguese Prime Minister stated that ‘the Charter is part of the EU foreign policy’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me turn to China. We understand that, by becoming the host of the Beijing Olympics, the Chinese Government committed itself to fully respect both the Olympic ideal of human dignity and internationally guaranteed human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament now has to conclude that there has been a recent increase in political persecutions related directly to the Olympics. In addition, more people are being executed in China than in the rest of the world combined – up to 10 000 a year.</p>

      <p sl="en">What should we do?

There is an understanding of the sin of omission – responsibility for what we could and might have done but failed to do.

      <p sl="pl">On the other hand, it does not seem right to me to ignore the changes for the better that are taking place in China.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, billions of people are awaiting 8 August 2008, the opening of the Olympic Games, with great interest. Not only sports lovers will be watching, but also those who are expecting progress from China in the area of human rights. Unfortunately, we cannot be satisfied with the results to date. The Chinese Communist Party can rejoice, since it must have achieved a lot of success for the legitimisation of power. But we also have the opportunity to make the most of the period running up to the Olympics and sternly to demand an explanation for the unlawfulness appearing in the area of human rights. The European Union-China dialogue on human rights has been going on for 24 years. Unfortunately, its balance is not at all favourable. There is some progress, for example in the area of application of the death penalty, but in many areas there is a strong sense of backing out, such as freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom of the Internet. In order for us to be able to bring about change, we must also bring about change in the dialogue on human rights.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Firstly, we must say that the dialogue on human rights is not the only forum for raising such problems. Every Member State is also obliged to act strictly and firmly on these matters in bilateral relations.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Secondly, the presence of civil organisations and transparency of negotiations must be ensured. Transparency is very important for us to monitor what is happening there. Since dialogue is not a goal in itself, it is only meaningful if it makes a good contribution to improving the human rights situation in China.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Finally, I would like to speak about the situation of the Uyghur minority. Little is said about them and they are a forgotten minority.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to issue a couple of reminders to European governments.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first has to do with the lifting of the arms embargo on China, to which reference has been made on several occasions. I would like to point out that this House has frequently insisted that the lifting of that ban could only occur when there was genuine and meaningful progress in relation to those apprehended following the Tiananmen Square events of 1989, not progress in general terms, but specifically in relation to that matter, because that is what we are waiting for from the Chinese authorities at this point in time: some meaningful progress which would enable such action to be taken.</p>
      <p sl="es">Until that time I believe that it would not only be premature, but would convey entirely the wrong message and give Europe a very bad image to lift an embargo which, I repeat, was imposed at the time for very specific reasons which have certainly not been clarified.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second message, endorsing the opinion of my colleague Mrs Trüpel, is that it is unacceptable for certain European countries to submit, and sometimes succumb, to pressure from the Chinese authorities aimed at preventing them from holding official meetings with important Chinese personalities, in some cases dissidents, or representatives such as the Dalai Lama, in return for assured trade relations with China.</p>
      <p sl="es">Especially today, when we have signed the Charter of Fundamental Rights, this is something which is completely at odds with the basic ethos which we seek to impose on the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pt">At the Summit, Europe spoke clearly about how China is perverting WTO rules, failing to respect workers’ rights, exporting products that are harmful to health, pirating technology and impeding European access to the Chinese market. The Chinese leaders were not used to hearing the EU speak so frankly and they retaliated by holding up the joint declaration for a few days, but the European leadership regrettably failed to keep up the pressure: not only did it make unacceptable concessions on the referendum in Taiwan, it did not contradict the ‘One China Policy’ and it did not confront Peking on the subject of serious human rights problems. Because there was not time, President José Sócrates told Portuguese journalists, sometimes these things are discussed over dinner.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The death penalty and the release of prisoners held since the Tiananmen Square massacre: these are among the reasons why this Parliament is in favour of maintaining the embargo on arms to China. Arbitrary detention and trial, corruption and forced evictions, persecution and repression of journalists and Internet users, repression of Tibetans and minorities, responsibility for the tragedies in Darfur and Burma: none of these fundamental issues was on the Summit’s agenda. Clearly the EU is not alone in having a duty to call Beijing to account before it holds the 2008 Olympic Games. If the International Olympic Committee mediates about the quality of the air, why not judge Beijing on respect for the Olympic ideal in its relations with its own citizens and those of other countries? No one, least of all the EU Council and Commission, can continue to neglect the fight for freedoms and human rights in China. This is a marathon that will only gain impetus in the context of the 2008 Olympics. Not only does it affect millions and millions of Chinese, it will have consequences for the whole of humanity.</p>

Reports of executions, torture in prisons and labour camps and the oppression of the Tibetans plainly show that we Europeans are not shouldering our responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, today we are having a debate on the EU-China summit, which took place 10 days ago, and on the 24th Round of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which took place two months ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">Especially today, let me start with the second one. Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is a core principle of the EU and its policies and it is something that we all strongly care about and support. But I am one of those who believe that the EU should follow a result-oriented approach in promotion of respect for human rights rather than a purely principled one and, most importantly, we have to accept that the improvements will only come step-by-step. That does not mean that the EU should hesitate in voicing its criticism and using its power to insist upon democratic reforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also one of those who care about the high-level product safety that affects 550 million European citizens; who care about trade imbalance, effective market access, intellectual property rights and international competition policies that affect thousands of European companies and millions of European employees; and who care about cooperation on environment protection, international environment governance and climate change that affects the whole population of the Earth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Because we care about all the above, we strongly support the Commission and Council and its Presidency for addressing, negotiating and stressing continuously each one of the issues in regular dialogue with the Chinese side.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this debate again shows that societal change takes time, and I think we always have to remember where China has come from. I think we also have to acknowledge a certain progress, as I said at the beginning. But, at the same time, it is true that we are not yet where we would like to see China.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I think the Human Rights Dialogue – also accompanied by the NGO seminar – remains the cornerstone for addressing our human rights concerns with China.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I think we need to be determined but also realistic. Determined to convince China that it is in its own best interest to establish full respect for human rights across the board. Realistic, because we need to recognise that only through engagement and long-term effort can we really hope to achieve genuine reforms in China. In this context, I would also like to say that the continued holding of the NGO seminar is in the mutual interest of both China and the European Union. This has also just been confirmed by the summit.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think, therefore, there is a good chance that, back-to-back with the next human rights dialogue under the Slovenian Presidency, we will be able to resume this civil society seminar.</p>
      <p sl="en">On a few other questions, let me just say that human rights were also mentioned in the joint statement that is there, and I will just read out the first few lines. ‘The two sides emphasised their commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and continued to place a high value on the EU-China human rights dialogue, including the accompanying legal seminar.’ You see: there it is. They underline the importance of concrete steps in the fields of human rights and affirm their commitment to further strengthening dialogue and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to say that there are a few concrete points that were highlighted in this discussion on which we want to see progress, such as the Falun Gong. The situation of Falun Gong followers who have been subject to repression because of their beliefs remains a matter of concern for us. We raised this issue several times, and more particularly on the occasion of the sessions of the Human Rights Dialogue. We asked, and will continue to ask, the Chinese authorities to put an end to the harsh treatment imposed on Falun Gong followers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the death penalty, I have said before that this issue is high on our agenda, and in this framework we have been urging China – and will continue along these lines – to reduce the scope of capital crimes, with a view to ultimately abolishing the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="en">A first step would be to impose a moratorium on implementation. Then, as I said in my introductory remarks, would come a review of death penalty sentences by the Supreme Court as a first step which would be continuously monitored.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the debate has shown very clearly that there is a mixed picture: there is progress, but there is still a lot to be done, and I can only say we will further engage with China in order to encourage China to make progress. I think the Olympic Games will be a good opportunity for China to show that more progress has been made by then.</p>

    <intervention id="3-248" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Franco Frattini" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me express my strong personal concerns about the rise in activities in Europe which have to be attributed to violent and extremist groups and organisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my view, therefore, today’s debate is extremely important, because it is not just extremism which leads to terrorist acts – extremism about which we have talked on many occasions in this House – but also those activities and developments which are more properly to be seen as racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, nationalist extremism, Islamophobia, all those forms of intolerance which, as I said, are worryingly common in Europe, and which, in my view, are absolutely incompatible with and run entirely counter to the values of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights which we proclaimed this morning. There can be no doubt that extremism, by its very nature, is divisive and leads to violence.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why the first goal, in my view, is a political goal. That will obviously lead me to mention measures which have more to do with security and policing; however, faced with the problem of extremism and its origins, we need once again to promote a European Union which is ever closer to citizens and therefore more able to pass on messages of tolerance, solidarity and respect for the Charter which, as of today, is one of the cornerstones binding on Member States and on citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that there can never be any justification for extremism; while we have said that many times about terrorism, we also need to say it about racism, for instance, and about xenophobia. However, we also have to explore the deep-seated origins of extremism and violence. We have a duty to do so, because we have a duty to introduce European policy measures that can help not just to counter but also to prevent and eradicate extremist developments and activities.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to cite a few examples which, in my opinion, show that a European policy may be genuinely useful and more useful, if I may say so, than a policy which is solely national. From the point of view of citizens’ participation in the political life of Europe, it is very important for that programme – and it is not by chance that the European Commission is financing such a programme on fundamental rights and citizenship – to contain policies and measures encouraging citizens to play more of a role in political life, in the life of the institutions, and therefore, for instance, in events such as the European elections. 2009 offers us a golden opportunity to foster a debate that leads to a large turnout to vote reflecting positive participation in the life of the institutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is nevertheless clear that the other policy measure that we are expecting from Europe and that Europe is keen to promote involves education, especially for the younger generations. In my view, that – a policy to keep the memories of past tragedies alive in people’s minds and to do so among today’s younger generations, among students and among young people, even the very young – is also extremely important. For instance, all the programmes which we support and which I believe should be further encouraged, programmes which keep alive the memory of the victims of all the dictatorships, of all the totalitarian regimes that have devastated Europe in the past, are, in my view, tools that can be put to good use in eradicating extremism and racism; from the history of the concentration camps, for instance, we can draw a lesson for today’s young people so that tragedies of that kind never happen again, not just in Europe but in any part of the world.</p>
      <p sl="it">Then there is another policy measure that I believe we can and must bear in mind: those measures that more generally promote tolerance and dialogue between different cultures and obviously between different religions. We have two major opportunities, one this year, which is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All – and we plan to review the initiatives that have taken place during the year – and one next year in 2008, which is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, of dialogue between different cultures and between civilisations. In my view, the 2007 review and the 2008 programme offer a golden opportunity to make people and, I would stress again, younger people, more aware of a spirit of dialogue which enriches, a dialogue through which everyone can grow together.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is undoubtedly important to keep the public aware of the importance of promoting rights and eradicating extremism, violence and intolerance. Here, the European Agency for Fundamental Rights has a role to play, which is what we wanted and what this House strongly supported; just as the Vienna monitoring centre on racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism has in the past been an instrument for a very important sector, the fight against anti-Semitism, the Agency for Fundamental Rights will also be an instrument. The Agency, as the main protagonist in this field, will have a very important role to play. There, as you know, we are preparing the multi-annual framework which we are discussing in close cooperation with Mr Cashman, and we take the view that the Agency’s multi-annual planning framework will provide us with useful instruments for our common action to prevent extremism.</p>
      <p sl="it">Over and above that, we obviously have to react: while those are all important prevention policies, we also need to react. I fought personally, in the Council of Ministers as well, for a European law – and we reached agreement on this last April – for a European law under which acts motivated by racism and xenophobia can be punished and those committing such acts are punished in the same way in any country of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is not just the physical act, but also concrete incitement, the dissemination of hatred, those messages that frankly cannot be confused with freedom of expression which is a sacred right for all of us. Here, we are speaking of concrete incitement to act, to commit violence. That framework decision was agreed by the Member States last April. Think of those awful manifestations of racism: at sports events, during football matches where people take the opportunity to shout neo-Nazi slogans, those are the kinds of act that the framework decision – which we genuinely wanted and which we agreed with the German Presidency – will punish. I say will punish, using the future, as unfortunately, and this is an appeal to your sensibility, between April and now the reservations of the national parliaments of some Member States have not been withdrawn with the result that the procedure leading to the entry into force of this European law to punish racism and xenophobia has been blocked.</p>
      <p sl="it">I say this with absolute respect for the national parliaments; however, as the government holding the presidency of the Council of Ministers has given its agreement, I believe that it must take steps with its own parliament, so that its reservation is withdrawn as soon as possible, and we can finally ensure that the framework decision comes into force after three and a half years of lengthy discussion.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, we already have legislation in other sectors which punishes discrimination based on race and ethnicity, and that legislation will undoubtedly be respected with the supervision, if I may put it that way, of the European Commission which is responsible for ensuring compliance with European law. I would point out, for instance, the recent directive on ‘borderless’ audiovisual services which very clearly establishes, from its entry into force, that audiovisual services must not contain any incitement to hatred on grounds of sexual orientation, race, religion or nationality.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is precisely to achieve all that that policing measures are not enough, criminal law is not enough, prosecutions are not enough: what is needed is a deep-seated culture of individual rights, of value for the human person! What we said this morning when we were celebrating the European Charter of Fundamental Rights! I believe that this is one of the policies, at a time when we are preparing to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon, through which Europe can offer the world a lesson on the ways in which these hateful crimes against the human person can be eradicated.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is scarcely believable. Four or five weeks ago I was invited to attend a counter-demonstration to a demonstration organised by parties of the far Right in my region. There were only 30 extremists demonstrating, whereas a large gathering of more than a thousand had assembled to demonstrate against them. In those circumstances, when you stand in front of those right-wing extremists, you say to yourself, ‘This is scarcely believable’. After that century in Europe, how can anyone revert to extremism, go back to strutting about full of hatred and arrogance and agitating against others?</p>
      <p sl="de">The debate we are holding today is welcome and important. Extremism is a cancer in our society. Time and again we politicians appeal to people’s moral courage, expecting them to rise up and protest against this extremism. I believe it is also time to give thanks that such moral courage exists in abundance, that so many people do rise up in protest. What is extremism? Let me stress that, when we speak of banning political parties, of banning the public expression of opinions and positions, it goes without saying that such measures must not be based on political judgements. They must be based on an objective criterion. We have defined that objective criterion today in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which sets out the essence of our basic values. If parties or politicians attack those values, the courts must decide whether their actions are illegal and, if so, impose a ban.</p>
      <p sl="de">What should be done if candidates of extremist parties are elected, if such parties win seats? Firstly, there must be no cooperation with these parties, and I am grateful to the Socialist Members, who have expelled their Slovakian member party from their ranks for cooperating with extremists. Secondly, we must not overlook the fact that such electoral successes stem from public dissatisfaction, and we must not respond to them by maligning voters but rather by addressing underlying issues. Thirdly, I wish to emphasise that extremism often begins with small steps in the party landscape too, and we must be aware of this. My message is therefore ‘Do not let it take root!’</p>
      <p sl="de">Political extremism exists on the Left and Right, and both are equally bad. That needs to be emphasised. Europe has experienced extremism, and Europe has suffered from extremism. Progress has been made in the fight against extremism. It is a fight that is worth waging. And it is a fight that we shall ultimately win.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Fratini, Thank you for the understanding and the presentation on the intentions of the Commission. I find it symbolic that precisely today, when the Charter of Fundamental Rights was signed, we are discussing a topic directly related to it. For the growing extremism, the growing influence of extreme right-wing parties and organisations is a direct threat to the existence of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="bg">It might sound too strong but our Union is based on clear principles and its existence is possible thanks to the fact that peace, solidarity, tolerance, mutual respect among ethnic and religious communities, and the peaceful co-existence of nations prevailed in Europe 50 years ago. Today, the extreme right-wing attacks exactly these principles; it attacks the very heart of the European Union, without which it could not possibly exist. But our Union is not an abstract construct; it is not just another administrative level of governance. It is a union whose mission is to defend and protect the values underlying the whole world.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Willing or unwilling, prepared or unprepared, we have to understand that there are people deprived of fundamental rights, suffering from political reprisals, oppressed by non-democratic regimes or discriminated against on the basis of race, ethnic origin and religion in all parts of the world. And, in all parts of the world, there is the hope that the European Union will support them and that the spirit of tolerance, guaranteed civil rights and social security can reach their country, too. Can we be powerful and convincing in the outside world if we fail to cope with the problems in our own backyard? How can we explain to the people who pin their last hopes on us that immigrants die just because of their origin, that ethnic minorities are subjected to systematic discrimination, that partisan ideologies challenge the equality of women or define homosexualism as a disease? How can we explain that we are on the way of forgetting the gloomiest pages of our history and that young people praise Hitler and anti-Semitism is turning into the vogue of the day? I cannot accept this and neither can my collegues Socialists.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I believe that there is no political group in this Parliament to remain indifferent to the fact that right-wing extremism, racism, xenophobia are gaining new grounds. Didn’t we become witness today how a historic landmark in the development of the European Union was disgraced in a vulgar manner by a noisy minority that could come back stronger, more aggressive and better organised in 2009? Under the hypocritical demand for a referendum, it challenged not merely the Charter of Fundamental Rights but fundamental rights themselves. It is this behaviour that we see also in many national parliaments encourages extremists who would resort to yet another punitive action tomorrow, inspired by this political circus. We must name problems very clearly and seek solutions together. Therefore we shall put this issue on the agenda of the Parliament over and over again. Because extremism is an all-European challenge which necessitates the cocerted efforts at the European, national, regional and local level.</p>
      <p sl="bg">If the European Commission is the custodian of the EU Treaties, then the European Parliament is the custodian of the values and I believe that together we shall be able to withstand a rising wave familiar from the recent past. And that we shall stop it, without violating fundamental rights like the right of free expression, the right of assocation, the freedom of the media. For one can fight for democracy only according to the rules of democracy. Breaking these rules will mean that extremism has prevailed. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, a few weeks ago a young man by the name of Carlos Palomino lay dying of stab wounds in the Madrid metro following a clash with right-wing extremists. Shortly before, in the Barcelona metro, a madman had been caught by TV surveillance cameras striking a young girl because she was an immigrant, just because of the colour of her skin – so she said – without knowing that he was being filmed and without knowing that his actions were going to be broadcast around the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">These and other similar cases have been repeated in various parts of Europe. Often, with a sometimes exaggerated feeling of responsibility, we and all politicians who are concerned by this phenomenon, try to minimise the significance of such attacks: we must not be alarmed, we say; at the end of the day these are isolated incidents, there are not all that many madmen about, we must not exaggerate, it is not a serious problem.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore label these attacks as minor because it frightens us to acknowledge that at best, in fact, this is not a minor matter. Among other things, because, as the resolution on which we are going to vote tomorrow correctly suggests, many of these neo-Nazi and right-wing extremist organisations are playing on feelings of fear which already exist in our society, and which we cannot hide.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, it is not enough to condemn. We need to open our eyes and act responsibly and face up to something which is not just an isolated phenomenon; without causing alarm, we must acknowledge its real scale and extent. The day on which we signed the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a good day to remember that the European Union has a role to play and has its responsibility in this area.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is no subsidiarity when it comes to defending the dignity of persons or denouncing racism, xenophobia and intolerance. Action is needed at European level, firstly on the part of the Commission and the Agency for Fundamental Rights, in order to examine what kind of ramifications and networks there are behind all this – if any – what links there are between the various extreme right-wing movements, in order that we can apply legislation, contribute through education policies and support educators who teach about diversity, and, where necessary, forcibly denounce those politicians, social leaders, sportspeople etc. who, either passively or actively, lie behind these actions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, growing extremism in Europe is a fact, and we need to talk about it. The Commissioner said a great deal, but he spoke in general terms and about matters of secondary importance such as racism at football matches. We need to talk about the facts, the political extremism we are witnessing at the present time in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Yesterday, Mr President, the leader of the NPD, a neo-fascist party, appeared on Germany’s public television channel, ARD, and demanded that Poland immediately return Pomerania and Silesia to Germany. He declared that Kaliningrad, Gdańsk and Wrocław are German cities and demanded German jurisdiction over them. He also demanded that those cities and territories, which are part of Poland, should be returned to Germany immediately.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are talking about events in Germany, a leading country in the European Union. For some years now, the German fascists in the NPD have been calling for the revision of frontiers, repudiating the international treaties that ended the Second World War, and demanding that borders be pushed back. Commissioner, we cannot permit this. There has to be a strong reaction. We cannot permit the public television service of any country, in this case Germany, to allow neo-fascists and Nazis to air their revisionist views and calls for another war.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is not a marginal problem, ladies and gentlemen. It is very real. The party in question has representatives in seven regional parliaments. This cannot be tolerated in Europe today, just as we cannot tolerate democratic principles, freedom to differ and freedom of speech to be undermined as they were today by Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Watson, who, referring to differences of opinion over the Charter of Fundamental Rights – or rather, not so much the Charter as the EU Reform Treaty – called the Members who were opposing him idiots. That cannot be allowed. That is not the approach to democracy and the present European Union that we should be teaching our young people. Let us be united in diversity.</p>

    <intervention id="3-254" speaker_id="4531" name="Jean Lambert" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think the part of the issue that we are looking at is: how do we combat what all of us see as extremism, this fear of the other, this desire to protect their own culture, as if it is the only culture, as if it has never changed, as if there has never been anything that has shifted in their lives? And yet we only have to look back over the last 50 to 60 years to see the enormous changes that have gone on, even within our own continent.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that desire to protect often comes from a feeling of fear that, somehow or other, you and your idea of yourself are going to disappear and, therefore, you want to project your strength against others and deny them their existence.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think all of us here feel a pride in who we are, in the country that we come from or our region or our heritage. But we do not, most of us, expect that to be passed on only through a bloodline, somehow, and a deep connection with territory, but through citizenship, through law and through our rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">And as others have said, the signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights here today was an extremely important symbol particularly attached to this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">But when we are looking at the election of extremist parties who only have one view of what is right – what is theirs – I think what we see is a legitimisation of violence, of hate speech, of actions against others that they see as different.</p>
      <p sl="en">I remember the time when, a number of years back, we heard of the election of a single member of the British National Party to a local council in London. The level of racist violence went up in that area.</p>
      <a text="(Cry of ‘Bravo!’)"/>
      <p sl="en">That is not a cause for ‘Bravo!’ That is shameful! How can you say that and sit in a House where you claim to be democrats?</p>
      <p sl="en">Racist violence is to be condemned. And, when we are looking at extremism, I think we ought to be aware that we have not yet seen the death of sexism and misogyny.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the election of such parties raises the level of fear and, therefore, we need to think about how we react to that. We react to it by also making sure that our actions uphold human rights and the values which we hold dear. We have to beware that we ourselves do not pass laws that in seeking to deal with one example of extremism actually give succour to those people or strike fear into the hearts of other communities.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Vice-President Frattini and all the fellow Members who have worked with me, and the proposers, to draw up this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="it">Manifestations of racism and xenophobia have increased in recent years, as is borne out by the reports of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. This increase is closely linked to the growth and proliferation of political forces which, in Europe, have interpreted the problems raised by immigration in an aberrant way, often to put forward slogans defending race and identity, and to stir up feelings of self-preservation against those entering Europe, describing them as terrorist threats or criminals, or even branding them with unacceptable anthropological names and xenophobic and racist slogans.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parties and movements which in recent years have had strong anti-European nationalist leanings, and are highly racist, are on the increase. Their political propaganda draws on social insecurity and tries to add pieces to the mosaic of the war of civilisations. That propaganda is now a mainstream part of the political and institutional debate and in some cases, seems to be the message emerging from governments or as the result of the activities of governments.</p>
      <p sl="it">Tomorrow, we shall vote on a resolution on extremism, a title which is perhaps a little vague. Lenin said that extremism is the infantile disease of communism; we could paraphrase Lenin and say that extremism is perhaps an infantile disease of all political, religious, economic and ideological programmes. Mr Weber is right: there is left-wing extremism and right-wing extremism, but there is not just left-wing and right-wing extremism, there is neo-liberal extremism, Catholic extremism, Muslim extremism, ecological extremism and anarchic-insurrectionist extremism.</p>
      <p sl="it">The problem in Europe, however, is the growth of right-wing extremism and the problems which are causing right-wing extremism to proliferate. Neo-nazi and neo-fascist political forces and movements have been set up in recent years in Europe and have made it their policy to work against European integration – we have seen them in Italy, in France, in Austria, in the Netherlands, in Belgium, in the United Kingdom, in Germany, in Denmark, and in Switzerland; they reflect the crisis that has led an intellectual such as Alfio Mastropaolo to describe the offensive of the new right as the mad cow of democracy.</p>
      <p sl="it">The democratic legitimisation of certain political forces has helped dangerous ideas to spread into the body of European society, feeding reactionary leanings. A dangerous, and in some cases underestimated, disease which feeds on ethnocentric proclivities, often concealed and hidden, in some cases masked by seemingly democratic and legitimate acts. We therefore need to question our choices and our political initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is a growing emphasis on the need to establish and consolidate a shared European culture and identity. I believe that a European identity and culture must be built on the basis of dialogue and contact with cultures other than those that have in recent years promoted and paved the way for the dissemination and the growth of a European idea, a European culture.</p>
      <p sl="it">A major cultural battle is needed, and that is my conclusion. Police or public security activities are not enough; there needs to be a major cultural effort and only in that way will we manage to ensure that 2008 is actually the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, because Europe must be founded on intercultural principles.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I detest extremism as much as anyone. British people do – we have been fighting it for centuries.</p>
      <p sl="de">If you want to combat rising extremism in Europe, look at its causes before you rush into yet more legislation which only restricts; it breeds extremism. Let us look at the high-water mark of European extremism, the Fascists of the 1930s. In Britain, the marches of Sir Oswald Mosley were protected by law and arid hateful policies thus exposed to the light of day were rejected by the people. Across Europe, Fascist leaders were vilified and obstructed. Hitler himself was imprisoned – so he, like the others, gained power.</p>
      <p sl="de">This morning, we saw the rise of extremism in this Chamber with the signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, part of the Constitution for Europe to be signed tomorrow and on which a national referendum was promised in seven countries. Two said yes, two said no – but were ignored – while the others are waiting. In the UK, our Government gave a written promise, now denied. So much for the talk in this Chamber about listening to the people!</p>
      <p sl="de">For the EU are today’s extremists, seeking to impose their will by way of this distorted document. It has been deliberately written so that no one beyond experienced lawyers can read it, with its numbered paragraphs taken from both the original and the existing Treaties, but which do not correspond between the documents. The numbering will be changed for the signing and changed again afterwards to make quite sure that the people of Europe cannot understand it.</p>
      <p sl="de">And this pseudo-democratic distortion is to be foisted on the people of Britain! No thanks – we have got our rights already, embodied in the great and wonderful Magna Carta of 1215, supplemented by the Bill of Rights of 1689. Just who do you think you are to overthrow these democratic measures laid down for us but open for all to follow?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this must be the umpteenth report on the so-called rise of extremism in Europe. The Council, the Commission and the political groups have all pitched in with their tuppence-worth and, as usual, the rhetoric is intellectually pitiful, politically disgraceful and morally perverse.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is intellectually pitiful because every new idea that ever was – in religion, including the Christianity that some of you are bold enough to say you espouse; in politics whether liberalism or socialism; in science, including concepts now taken for granted, like the earth being round and rotating about the sun – has been considered extremist, heretical, subversive and unacceptable. You cannot discredit an opinion simply by demonising it: you need to explain what makes it flawed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The political disgrace is entirely of your making – you, the people in power who, instead of resolving problems, care only about fighting off the opposition. All you are doing is highlighting your inability to solve the problem of immigration – of an invasion in which you, either deliberately or through cowardice, have colluded. What you are admitting here is that you have failed – on the economic front, the social front, the cultural front and the moral and educational fronts – and that, instead of changing your disastrous policies, your only concern is to get rid of those who protest or who criticise you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is in moral terms, however, that your attitude is most repugnant. You falsely equate violence and terrorism with the legitimate reaction of Europe’s people against the destruction of their identity. What hypocrites you are! You want to muzzle these people and deprive them of political representation: you are the Pharisees of democracy! You are what the Bible calls ‘whited sepulchres’; in other words, your sincerity is less than skin deep! You talk about human rights and freedom of expression, about Europe’s values and about tolerance, but underneath the whitewash it is all rot. You would deny to anyone who fails to think like you the very rights that you harp on about. All of this would be odious, were it not so grotesque. Tomorrow’s generations will pass judgment on you as the Barbarians passed judgement on Rome. I hope, at least, that the Barbarians will give you what you deserve!</p>

      <p sl="ro">Ladies and Gentlemen, the subject we are debating this afternoon is one of maximum importance for the future of the European Union and for the security of citizens and our values.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Over the last years, extremism has been an ever more frequent phenomenon in the public life of European countries, a phenomenon that has raised many alarm bells and many questions as regards fighting it. Although various causes with different origins have contributed to the spreading of this phenomenon, I would like to insist on an essential aspect of the debate created on the subject of extremism, namely immigration.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Extremist groups identify immigration as the supreme evil in the European countries, because it is a subject that they can use in order to explain the unwanted changes in their societies. Nevertheless, as we all know, immigration is a vital element for the economies of European countries and favourable for economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Its unwanted effects, arising from the inadaptation of immigrants to the societies that receive them, should be solved by methods that are specific to the European Union. Otherwise, we are in danger of changing the very basic values of the European construction.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Therefore, we cannot accept the extremist parties changing the agenda of traditional parties.</p>
      <p sl="ro">If we use such a strategy in an attempt to reduce the risks and dangers entailed by such groups and to prevent them from obtaining votes from our citizens, we will only offer legitimacy to their ideas and methods. We cannot allow messages of an extremist nature to be adapted and promoted as law in Member States. Such an action means destroying the vision of a multicultural and multiethnic Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The crisis generated by the issue of the Roma and the extremist manifestations in Italy must not create a dangerous precedent for the fundamental principles of the European Union regarding the freedom of goods, services, capital and persons. We must explain to our citizens that such an attitude would be harmful both to their societies and to the European Union, as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The results of the European Parliament elections in Romania could be an example in this regard. No extremist party has reached the threshold of necessary votes in order to send their representatives to the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to take a few seconds over my allotted time merely to direct at those in the back seats, on the right over there, a traditional Castilian saying: ‘A palabras necias, oídos sordos – silly words will be met with a deaf ear’. I will now continue my speech in English.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, as we have very proudly signed the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union, it is more than half a century since Europe assisted in the most outrageous crime of xenophobia and racism – the Holocaust.</p>
      <p sl="es">Millions of people were killed because of their religion, their ethnic background and their political beliefs. Therefore, it is more necessary than ever to bear history in mind by living our present and preparing for the future.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have to be alert and watchful; beware of the eggs of the snake, as Ingmar Bergman taught us. As Commissioner Frattini has confirmed today, there is a resurgence of violent acts with racist and xenophobic origin in our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">But, to me, what is even more preoccupying is that more and more young people get involved. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that we teach them citizenship and to be aware of what racism is about.</p>
      <p sl="es">More and more extremist right-wing parties which base their ideology and political practices on intolerance and exclusion are voted into national parliaments. There, they have an excellent platform for their political message of hate. We should be aware of this and try to do things to counteract that as well.</p>
      <p sl="es">Racism and xenophobia are the most direct violations of the principles of freedom and democracy and our fundamental rights. So the European institutions and we, the Members of Parliament, are obliged to reaffirm our determination to uphold fundamental freedoms and to condemn and combat any manifestation of racism and xenophobia by means of law.</p>
      <p sl="es">More than ever, zero tolerance is requested to combat racism and xenophobia. More than ever we have to be belligerent in defending our values, using and strengthening the instruments available to the European Union and its Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">No single citizen should ever suffer from persecution because of his or her race, religion, gender, social situation, language, nationality or sexual orientation. The eradication of racism and xenophobia, the right to live in peace, is a moral challenge to all democrats, and to defend civil rights is the duty of every democrat.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Yesterday we spoke for nearly two hours about the fight against the rise of extremism and the final text of the resolution that is based on liberal initiatives, but of course we have throughout taken into account the ideas and requests of all the groups. I am optimistic, and I trust that there will be a common position on this painfully important topic.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Personally, I am very sorry that in 2007, the year of equal opportunities, we are still obliged to fight the shadows of fallen dictatorships from the 20th century that creep out from time to time. We know that there are no Member States that are exceptions to this. Just to mention a couple by name: Pospolitos in Slovakia, the Young Nationalists in the Czech Republic, the New Right in Romania, the German National Democratic Party in Germany and the National Alliance in Italy, but we largely face the same extremism.</p>
      <p sl="hu">To speak of my own country, it is unacceptable for me that every day statements are issued by extremist parties and organisations like the Movement for a Better Hungary or the Hungarian Guard, in which they explain the conceptually absurd criminality of gipsies with genetic reasons, and instead of integrating the Roma into society they demand segregation and ghettos, whilst they march in black uniforms in Tatárszentgyörgy, and on Friday in Kerepes. In connection with this, I would again like to draw the attention of my fellow Members to the fact that so many of the gypsy settlements in Europe are still targets for extremist forces, even today.</p>
      <p sl="hu">And now some news for the end of my statement. The Hungarian Ombudsmen, the President of the Republic and the Hungarian Government have officially condemned the Hungarian Guard and the Movement for a Better Hungary. We would like all responsible European governments to do the same in the face of their own extremism. In any case, in order to do this it is necessary that as many of my fellow Members as possible vote yes tomorrow on the Parliament’s position on the fight against rising extremism. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today we witnessed a proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and we are now discussing the rise of extremism in Europe. To my mind, there is very clear link between the two. The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights was, until recently, known as the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. We cannot combat extremism without addressing the issues of racism and xenophobia, which are all too present in Europe today. Extremism breeds extremism, and we in Europe are in danger of finding ourselves caught in a very vicious circle if we do not move swiftly to tackle and eliminate some of these root causes.</p>
      <p sl="en">I listened to Mr Gollnisch earlier on, calling people in this House and others barbarians. He did not put up one credible idea, not one positive idea, of how we can tackle this problem in Europe, except the usual diatribe that comes from him. He and his leader, Mr Le Pen, want to come to Ireland in connection with the Treaty. I can tell you something for certain: those sorts of extreme ideas would not and will not be tolerated in my country, thank you very much. So please do come, and we can be sure that the Treaty will be passed when they hear the sort of continental Europe that you want to develop, and your kind of ideas. It has been shown that attitudes that made workers receptive …</p>
      <a text="(Interruption from Mr Gollnisch)"/>
      <p sl="en">We know what you stand for, Mr Gollnisch, and we have heard you so many times, you and your leader.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has been shown that attitudes that made workers receptive to right-wing populism include prejudice against immigrants, nationalism, authoritarianism, social dominance and political weakness, with prejudice against immigrants emerging as the most important factor among these. In countries where appropriate reporting facilities are in place, the most reported reason for discrimination is often region. If we address the elimination of such prejudice and discrimination, we will have taken a significant step forward in combating extremism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I call on all Members to encourage debate and the exchange of views on issues of social inequality, origin, race, religion and the impact of social and economic changes locally, nationally and at all European levels, and not to use emotive language, calling people barbarians. To this end, I welcome the fact that, as part of the work for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the European Parliament has invited Pope Benedict, the President of the African Union, the Dalai Lama, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom and the Grand Mufti of Damascus to address the European Parliament during the year 2008. I welcome those sorts of initiatives.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, we have all noticed that extremism is growing in the EU. I think we should ask ourselves why. Why are xenophobia and other extremist attitudes on the increase? I am convinced that exclusion and lack of participation in society are a breeding ground for extremism and xenophobia. The equal value of all human beings is a fundamental principle in a civilised society, so we must all help to combat xenophobic forces which discriminate against persons with a different ethnic background, sexual disposition or gender or with functional disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="sv">These groups use violence and they use threats. In my home country we have even witnessed the murder of people who have defended human rights. We see the murder of young people with a different ethnic background, merely because of their background. These things should never be allowed to happen again.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We who promote the equal value of all human beings must never allow ourselves to be silenced. But we know that is not enough.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the motion before us is another example of ignorance and hypocrisy. In it we read that, amongst other things, some political parties and movements, including those in power in a number of countries or represented at local, national or European level, have deliberately placed intolerance and violence based on race, ethnic origin or nationality at the heart of their agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also read that this Parliament strongly condemns all racist and hate attacks and calls on all authorities to do everything in their power to punish those responsible.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Chamber in which we adopt such resolutions, one of our colleagues used abusive and offensive language of mendacious propaganda – the very kind that is often used by extremists, the very kind that is based on slurs and qualifies as a hate attack. He implied that I could repeat Dachau. Well, let me enlighten him: one, Dachau was a German death camp; two, Dachau is in Germany, and I am not German. He even claimed that, after a four-day visit to Poland, he knew my country better than I did, and that I am not a part of Poland – but that Dachau apparently is.</p>
      <p sl="en">This kind of hate speech is too often cited, reoccurs too often and emanates from too many politicians. The same politicians want to teach us all about democracy, while they themselves have little respect for it and little respect for equal treatment under the law. It seems that in Europe today – just as George Orwell wrote years ago – some pigs are more equal than others. Some can hide under the privilege of immunity, some can even avoid justice and even European arrest warrants. Communist criminals are somehow better treated than ordinary citizens, and while we speak in here against extremist groups, some German politicians openly support historically revisionist political movements. My dear colleagues, the Europe of our resolutions is very different from the Europe of our reality.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, we have been yet again essentially consoling ourselves with the fact that the rise of extremism reflects a deteriorating economic situation and unemployment. I am afraid that such an assessment is no longer valid. The economies of many EU Member States have been growing, unemployment has been falling, but extremism has not been waning. On the contrary, the number of crimes based on race has been growing; national guards with an nationalistic ethos are being set up; SS veterans are marching across some EU Member States; and politicians who refer to the Jewish and Roma people as the ‘ulcers’ of society are being glorified. Politics and the army are being infiltrated by neo-Nazis and racists. The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, my native country, has made neo-Nazi rhetoric part of his vocabulary. Last but not least, the EU has become a destination of migration for poorer people and no one seems to know how to deal with it, which also plays a certain role.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, no resolution, no words can undo the swastika recently incised on the hip of a 17-year-old girl in Mittweida, Germany. In the daylight, ignored by indifferent bystanders, neo-Nazis in German Saxony incised it on her body because she stood up for a little Russian girl. I firmly believe that extremism can be prevented solely by citizens’ everyday acts, publicly declared opposition by the political elite, open and comprehensive interpretation in particular of 20th century history, and most of all the police and courts, which must not close their eyes to racists, xenophobes and neo-Nazis, but act without delay to punish such behaviour.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you, Mr President. I speak now as one of the authors of written statement No 93. The statement, which I tabled jointly with my fellow Members Mr Tabajdi, Mr Szent-Iványi, Mr Vigenin and Mr Amezaga, condemns the operations of paramilitary extremist groups within the Union, which are one of the most obvious forms of extremism.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In my experience, although many people feel a moral and political obligation to stop such extremist ideas from gaining ground, many stop short of specifically condemning it in a written statement or in another way. There are many reasons for this. One of them, for example, is that when we try to publicise these ideas, the list is never complete and never accurate. This deters many people from supporting it. However, one thing we must know is that the list will never be complete, and the concepts and definitions will never be accurate. For this very reason, we must instead grab extremism and extremist ideas by the roots.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Today in this House is a day of celebration, but the Charter of Fundamental Rights has not come to be signed in untroubled circumstances. This Charter summarises in 50 paragraphs all the values and rights that we respect and want to protect in the Union. This Charter is the charter of anti-discrimination, the charter of the freedoms of expression, religion and assembly, the charter of equality and the charter of protection for individuals, data, young people and the elderly. We cannot pick and choose from it at will, put some people before others or use it for our short-term internal policy objectives. Everyone must be respected and protected equally, because this guarantees human dignity, and we, as members of the Parliament, have sworn to do that. Opponents to the sum total of the ideas and rights formulated here are what we call extremists, irrespective of the age, sex, religion, or nationality of the person concerned. In this spirit, I would like to ask my fellow Members to support written statement number 93. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are seeing in Europe a constant increase in extremist, nationalist and populist movements that endanger our democratic system.</p>
      <p sl="en">In an ideal world, democracy is government of the people by the people and for the people. In fact, democracy is still the ‘least bad’ political system if it has proper checks and balances. However, the paradox of democracy is that it contains the possibility of its own death, in allowing the expression of populist and extremist opinions which erode the democratic system itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">In many European countries, there are parties that have succeeded in positioning themselves at the heart of political life with populist and demagogic discourses. European history has shown how extremist parties, dressed in democratic clothes and using populist and nationalist propaganda, have often led democracy to dictatorships.</p>
      <p sl="en">The best way to fight intolerance is to stand firm, to defend our democratic values and institutions, to defend individual rights, justice, equal opportunity and diversity, but also to sanction any discourse instigating hatred, segregation or discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Robert Kennedy said, ‘what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant. The evil is not what they say about their cause, but what they say about their opponents.’</p>
      <p sl="en">Healthy democracies need active citizens. Democracy can only function if citizens are conscious and exert their civic rights and duties. We need to reinvent citizenship. We need new ways to learn democracy. We need to ensure that our education systems promote the development of an active, critical and engaged citizenship. In a global world, we imperatively need a citizenship that celebrates diversity and promotes understanding and tolerance.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Article 21 of the Charter prohibits discrimination on the ground of political or any other opinion – I repeat, any other opinion – which thus includes extreme opinions such as those expressed recently on German public television by the leader of the NPD calling for changes to the border with Poland.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, it would be an omission on my part if I did not begin by expressing my concern at the general use made of the term ‘extremism’ without any definition, and without specific condemnation of extremist acts, in other words any extreme form of unlawful use of violence. It would also be a mistake not to mention the attempts to ‘awaken’ citizens to the dangers of radicalisation, and the simultaneous creation of flexible categories for possible criminals.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would like to remind you that in modern history, during periods when freedoms and rights were curbed in the name of security, policing and strict control, and when persecution based on stereotypes was allowed to gain ground, ideological bigotry, racism and xenophobia intensified and unspeakable crimes were committed. Similar lapses today could lead to the banning of political parties and trade unions, which will be a real blow to democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties. We must therefore ensure that democracy does not become merely a smokescreen for the adoption of punitive measures; at the same time, we must concentrate our efforts on mitigating the real causes of violent extremist acts, which utterly debase human dignity, since by definition they overstep the limits of freedom of expression.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is our duty to take up the battle against poverty, unemployment, deprivation, the exploitation of workers and social marginalisation, and to ensure that future generations, thanks to proper teaching and education, stay away from aggressively nationalist and fascist organisations which promote extremist acts as a means of expression.</p>

There is a certain symbolism in the fact that this debate is taking place on the day when the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Commission and the European Council confirmed with their signatures the EU’s legal commitment to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We cannot allow individuals or extremist organisations to attack citizens, whose rights must be guaranteed in a civilised society. The history of Europe has shown the forms that extremism, militant nationalism and ideological radicalism can take. It is our duty to consistently monitor European territory for any activities by these groups or individuals and take vigorous action against it.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I must add with regret that extremism seems to be on the rise primarily among young people in Europe. This reflects a certain failure on the part of the politicians. It is important to remember that many politicians, due to a lack of positive and professional assets, seek to promote their own political background and capital by provoking the least experienced and poorly informed sections of the public.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, at this stage of the debate most of what can be said on this subject has already been said. However, I would like to refer to the Commissioner’s exhortation about the need to think about the underlying roots of extremism.</p>
      <p sl="es">It seems to me that the problem of extremism is not that there is a series of groups who carry out violent attacks. It is a problem, but it has to be tackled through the law and individuals must be prosecuted, etc. The problem arises when the violence and the intentions behind it are repeated and have a chance to affect a broad sector of the population or certain sectors of the population. From a social and political point of view, it is when violence causes concern that the problem arises. As for how to prevent it, I think there are three essential factors.</p>
      <p sl="es">First, the Commissioner mentioned a knowledge of history – I myself believe that it is very important to know about tragedies, about successes and ultimately about ourselves as humans. However, I think we have to be careful not to use history as a weapon against others with a view to short-term political gain – something which is happening now in some countries, including my own country, Spain, I have to say.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, I think there are two other fundamental aspects which at the moment are much underrated.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, education. We have lost, and are still losing, or at least eroding, values such as work, discipline, self-reliance, that is to say all those values which go towards creating a good citizen when these people reach adulthood.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, in the context of the European Union, the important thing is not to break up that environment in which we Europeans can challenge together the networks created by globalisation. What we have now, and what we have had at other times in the course of 20th century European history, is a great deal of uncertainty, a certain desperation, a certain aimlessness, and what we need to do is provide hope, a forward-looking spirit and strong leadership so that everyone feels a part of the European Union.</p>

What is missing in Europe today is the liberal-democratic consensus of the period following the Second World War. Europe’s politicians lack the real political will to tackle these problems.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Dealing with the outbreaks of racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and xenophobia is a common duty that falls upon European education, media, churches, sports activists and, above all, politicians. We often find ourselves defenceless against such extreme forms of political activity. Worse still, many politicians and political parties take advantage of extremist or populist movements for their own purposes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I do not want to use this debate to score political points in the European Parliament, but I could mention many such examples. What matters now is to achieve a common policy at the level of the European Union – in the field of education, above all, as well as in sport, culture and politics – to combat extremism.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, eight years ago Jörg Haider’s immigrant-hating party entered into a coalition government in Austria. EU governments did not have a clue what to do. As a result of that disarray, Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union was inserted. It has never been used and it is clear that Member States have a cultural problem in criticising each other. But we have to have a more proactive policy of peer review when Member States call each other to account, because it is an EU concern if extremists and intolerant parties enter into government in one EU country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The criminal law has a solid role in punishing incitement to hatred, alongside provisions outlawing discrimination. The law can help change attitudes, as well as behaviour. Society signals the limits of acceptability in part by what it criminalises or bans. That is why I was so disappointed that the Commission apparently found the Italian Government deportation action against Romanians, largely Roma, and the accompanying rhetoric, compliant with EU free movement and anti-racism laws. Personally, I did not.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the law can and should only go so far. For instance, the question of whether to criminalise Holocaust denial is a controversial one in Europe. The recently agreed new EU law banning incitement to racial and religious hatred was right, in my view, to leave that option to individual countries. My own country’s tradition and preference is to leave people like David Irving to condemn themselves by the absurdity of their unhistorical views and to be contradicted by vigorous debate.</p>

      <p sl="el">Under these conditions – in marginalised sections of society or in social strata with a low level of political awareness and experience – far-right and fascist ideas, which are promoted under a populist, demagogic guise, are able to take root. Today there is more fertile ground for the creation and growth of such groups because of anti-communist hysteria, the attempt to rewrite history, the shameless attempt to wipe out the huge contribution of the USSR to the victory over fascism, and to equate communism with Nazism and fascism. We see this, for example, in the recognition and legitimacy granted by the governments of the Baltic countries to the local fascist groups, who were collaborators with the SS and the Nazis who were based in those countries during the Second World War.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fascism, racism and xenophobia are faces of the same coin. Born and bred of the capitalist system, which creates, maintains and nurtures these fascist groups. For precisely this reason we regard as hypocritical the alleged concerns over the rise of far-right and paramilitary organisations in Europe, and we reject every attempt to equate the class struggle, the struggles of the workers’ and popular movement and communist ideology with extremist ideologies, as an unacceptable attempt to instil fear in people.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr Chairman, Colleagues, This day is a testimony that the European Parliament guarantees the rights not only of the majority but also of those who have different opinion. Because if the nationalists in this hall achieved their goals, none of us would have the right to a different opinion as they had the oppoprtunity to express it today. We shall prevail over intolerance and extremism with arguments rather than emotions, with facts rather than noise. Unfortunately, however when we talk about facts, there is nobody to hear them. This is a regrettable fact.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Still, I hope that our supporters, our voters in the Member States will hear very carefully what was pointed out also by Commissioner Fratini. In the first place, intolerance and extremism come from the oblivion of the past. We must remember the past and the two severe dictatorships that Europe suffered. Therefore I appeal to the Commission and to all of us: let us remember the history of Europe and let give more opportunities for the progammes of the European Commision to finance projects that preserve our memory. Secondly, we must remember the involvement of citizens in the political process.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Colleagues, we are partly to blame for nationalism and xenophobia in Europe. Many of us started speaking as bureaucrats rather than politicians. They have forgotten the language that the voters can hear and speak the language of institutions instead. Let this make us strong enough in this debate to overcome the problem which exists especially in the new Member States. Let us name problems and tackle them directly, when they exist. For more often than not political parties win in elections by promising one thing and doing other things afterwards and then they are surprised by the existence of extremism and discontented people. It is our common responsibility of all of us in the European Parliament to also oppose the rising extremism and intolerance to the east of the European Union, which is dangerous to all of us. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, it is not generally enough to fight extremism. Everyone must act against the nationalist and extremist tendencies emerging in their own country. First of all, everyone should condemn extremist nationalists and distance themselves from them in their own country. This is an extremely important requirement, and this current debate also demonstrates that extremism must be fought using direct and indirect instruments at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Direct instruments must be used to punish speech that incites to hatred. There are some who refer to freedom of expression and say that this cannot be condemned using the instruments of criminal law, but I feel that we have not yet struck the right balance. Democratic forces must give an example, especially to the right wing, and the democratic right wing has great responsibility for distancing itself from the extreme right-wing phenomena that are running riot in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="hu">At the same time, some of my fellow Members have spoken about the fact that we must also react using indirect instruments, as the reason for very many extremist incidents is social uncertainty or uncertainty of national identity. This current debate is very important, and I feel that Commissioner Frattini, the Agency for Fundamental Rights and the European Parliament must monitor all extremist incidents closely. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, there are extremists on all sides, but in recent years they have been dictating the tone and content of the political agenda. Democratic mainstream parties are far too slow to distance themselves from extremists because they fear losing votes, and the result is a creeping political acceptance of extremism and intolerance.</p>
      <p sl="nl">And there is something else. On top of racism and nationalism there is also extremism against women and homosexuals, for example – we have not dealt with this yet today – and this is often based on religious beliefs. I am horrified when I see parties in government, with power to rule, or parties represented in parliament – in my own country too – encouraging discrimination against women, gays and people of other faiths.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Lastly, a word or two that may be controversial, Mr President. With all due respect to what Mr Ryan has said, I myself am not greatly in favour of inviting leaders of the major world faiths here to address our plenary unless they are prepared to abjure their discriminatory views on women and gays.</p>

I am not defending extremism, but it does not come from nowhere. In France Nicholas Sarkozy has understood this.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, let me begin by thanking all parties for the resolution. Today no EU country is free of right-wing extremism, not even my own country, Sweden. In the last local elections in 2006 Sverigedemokraterna (the Sweden Democrats) won seats in two thirds of municipalities. It might be suspected that their next targets are the elections to the European Parliament in 2009 and the Swedish parliamentary elections in 2010. We Swedish parliamentarians need help in making that more difficult, precisely as others need help in their countries in stopping the spread of right-wing extremism, which is on the increase throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Europe needs democratic parties whose programmes reach out to all, not just a few. In the 2006 elections the slogan of the Swedish Social Democrats was ‘Everyone is included’, and it becomes even more relevant in this debate, since the parties and groups we are discussing have programmes which do not respect the EU’s fundamental values and the equal value of all human beings. For me, as a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the approach to questions of asylum and refugee policy is absolutely crucial. The right-wing extremist parties oppose both a more open Europe and the development of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Instead they advocate nations with closed borders. It is a threat which I observe in Sweden and, along with all of you, throughout the EU. I would like to make one more comment on the resolution. The propaganda which extremist groups spread among children and young people takes the form of white power music. The media and communications are the tool used, and it circumvents school, the family, further education and our political values. It is important that we, as elected representatives, now take charge of the debate. We must do that as of now and continue up to the European Parliament elections in 2009. Let us applaud the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, a threat hangs over democracy in Europe, and I doubt whether we have all understood its significance. This threat is not the spread of far-right ideas, but the transition from the ideas to the methods of the far right. To the acceptance, in other words, of brute force, as seen in the activity of the paramilitary far-right organisations.</p>
      <p sl="el">A major distinction therefore needs to be made: on the one hand, we are combating ideas with which we do not agree. The ideas that promote nationalism in Europe, and racism, xenophobia, oppression of women, oppression of minorities. We are combating these ideas with our own ideas and with our effort to fight the causes, the political causes, which are to be found mainly in the problem of diversity – in the fact, that is, that European citizens do not accept diversity, do not accept the policy that supports it, and do not accept Europe itself.</p>
      <p sl="el">On the other hand, however, we are fighting a different battle, even by criminal means, against the spread of those ideas, through action which leads to violence. From this point of view, I think this very well-balanced joint resolution from all the democratic parties in Parliament is another great political moment for our Parliament – especially after what happened today – and I am very proud that this resolution originated from our own group, the Socialist Group.</p>

      <p sl="pt">On 6 September some twenty graves in the Jewish cemetery in Lisbon were desecrated and swastikas painted on the headstones. The two perpetrators were arrested. They are members of the Frente Nacional or National Front, an extreme right-wing Portuguese skinhead organisation which openly advocates racial war and violent action to secure white supremacy. This case and others, notably the wave of anti-Muslim hysteria in various European countries and the racist violence recently unleashed against the Roma community in Italy, show that xenophobia and violent racism are with us and we cannot afford the luxury of minimising them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the Portuguese case, the authorities were initially tempted to play the case down and declare that anti-Semitism was contrary to the supposedly tolerant nature of Portuguese society. But the presence of the Ministers for Justice and Internal Administration at the Jewish cemetery for the ceremonial purification of the graves and the publicity this demonstration of solidarity received in the Portuguese media are a lesson for other cases in Portugal and elsewhere. Extremism in Europe can only be fought effectively if the political representatives and the media assume their responsibilities by giving visibility to crimes of this type and identifying them as direct and base attacks on the very essence of democracy, of Europe and of Humanity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rise of extremism in Europe is certainly very worrying and all the European institutions need to mobilise to stem the growth of these extreme right-wing movements that are becoming ever more threatening as they not only promote suspect values but increasingly attack human rights on the basis of their racist ideology. This dangerous trend in the European Union is unacceptable!</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I see it, the Commission needs to respond on two fronts, reflecting the ideas expressed in the written statement and in the PSE resolution on the subject: it needs to act positively along with the Member States to identify appropriate political and legal means, on the one hand, of condemning human rights violations and, on the other, of preventing extremism, particularly among young people, by raising awareness of the Union’s fundamental values. It is also essential to ensure that no European fund can be used by an institution or organisation that promotes values, or makes statements, inciting people to xenophobic, racist violence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would remind you here of the case of Radio Maria in Poland, which, although notorious for promoting anti-human-rights views, applied for European grant aid. I would therefore take this opportunity, in the presence of the Commission representative, to urge once again that no European funding should go to media which serve as a platform for racist ideas, with a widespread and potentially very dangerous impact on the public.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider that today’s debate has been of extraordinary interest – of extraordinary interest and also of a high political level – and I should therefore like to thank all those who have spoken, including those who have said things with which I do not and cannot agree. Some speakers have questioned whether it is necessary or important to raise such an issue in this House; I believe, however, that it has been very important.</p>
      <p sl="it">An issue which is certainly a highly political issue has been raised: striking a balance between the right freely to express our thought, which is one of the rights that the Charter of Fundamental Rights recognises, and other fundamental rights such as the dignity of the human person, equality and non-discrimination. May I say that those who have raised this issue, taking the view that freedom of thought makes it possible to cause offence and to stir up values running counter to the fundamental rights of the person, have distorted what freedom of thought actually means.</p>
      <p sl="it">I always speak as I find, even when my opinions run counter to those who spoke before me. Someone said: ‘if, in a referendum, citizens come out against the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that will be an expression of freedom’. I do not agree, because calling for a referendum against the Charter of Fundamental Rights would be to call for a referendum against citizens, since those citizens are clearly the holders and protagonists of the fundamental rights that we must now safeguard. It is not because that principle has to be refuted, but because those who defend fundamental rights are not extremists, while those who violate and refute them, those who wish to affirm the right to incite a mob or a group of violent people to destroy Jewish graves are extremists. That is not freedom of expression, that is violence that has to be eradicated through policies and has to be punished by the instruments of the law. These are, in my view, the two measures for which Europe must steadfastly press.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must not play it down. We must not think that a single event can be underestimated because it is a single event, if that single event is a symptom of racism and intolerance, of a profound scorn for human values, we must also be worried by a single event, by a single act of violence!</p>
      <p sl="it">Many of you have raised another, very important, issue: can the propagation of a racist message by political forces be tolerated in the name of the free expression of political thought? Because they are elected by citizens, I believe that those in politics have a special responsibility and must not incite the mob against other citizens or other people: a sense of personal accountability.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my view, it is difficult, and I say this frankly, to use the instruments of the law, the police or the secret services to undertake a far-reaching investigation of this or that party. However, when this or that party publicly says that its intention is to restore racial supremacy, that is not free expression of thought, but an attack on a deep-seated foundation of Europe. It is for those reasons that repressive action is justified, and there can be no talk of censure or of violation of the freedom of expression.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will defend the right of those who do not agree with me to say what they wish to say, but I cannot defend the right of those who do not agree with me to incite the mob or other people to attack and to wound and kill. In no way is that free expression of thought!</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why today’s issue is a key issue and I shall put forward similar arguments when we debate the appalling form of extremism represented by terrorism, because we can surely not draw a line between the message of racial hatred and the message of those who consider that killing people in terrorist attacks is a possible answer to society’s problems. Both are issues which – in my view, through education and prevention, by fostering tolerance, and by using the instruments of law and the instruments of enforcement – must be tackled at European level. We can only be satisfied when we are sure that there is no room for racists, bigots and terrorists in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The extremist movements that are growing stronger throughout Europe give us cause for grave concern, since their political activities are based on inciting hatred against the most vulnerable groups in society, and they preach intolerance and social exclusion. Such ideas are incompatible with European values, human dignity, equality of rights and the fundamental freedoms in the founding treaties of the Union, or the basic principles formulated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, proclaimed this very day. Such movements and the views they express are capable of generating fear among minorities and among the law-abiding, democratic majority of citizens. Because of the increased media interest by extremist groups, the false generalisations and distorted half-truths that are expressed more widely than before are not only unacceptable but extremely dangerous, since they strengthen incidents of prejudice and negative discrimination and further impede the resolution of social problems.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to remind you separately of anti-gypsy incidents, which are also becoming increasingly frequent. There are more than ten million gypsies in Europe, and they are the largest and at the same time most vulnerable and most defenceless ethnic minority in Europe, and it is not that their situation has not improved in recent years, but in many areas it has definitely deteriorated. It is the joint responsibility of the European Union and civil organisations to find a solution to the problems of unemployment and abject poverty, and to put an end to the residential and educational segregation of gypsies. Resolving these problems is now the most urgent minority question for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The extremist parties gaining seats in many Member States of the Union and temporarily even in the EP cannot become acceptable in European politics. Their suppression is a matter for all of society in the European Community, even if we know that everyday racism and xenophobia are concealed by citizens who otherwise demand democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Young people, for whom not only the Holocaust but also the fall of the Berlin Wall are history, are particularly at risk. Europe without borders overestimates the consciousness of belonging to a nation, and it is easy to instil even wild ideas. So far, European legislation has followed national measures: it does not go beyond it and it does not point the way. However, the problem requires not only political or legal responses, so action should not just appear in our objectives, but also in responses from civil organisations and churches that profess European values and play a role in public life.</p>
      <p sl="hu">For example, Pope John Paul II spoke out against racism and xenophobia many times, and he saw the task of religion as serving truth, peace among men, forgiveness, life and love: in other words, all the values that these radical groups do not represent, or only in an extreme sense.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, extremist ideas and organisations have become alarming phenomena in our everyday lives, and we can see this everywhere, almost without exception. The basic concept for the fathers of European integration was freedom of thought and opinion. Today, these are our fundamental values. True democracy also guarantees freedom of expression, which cannot, however, lead to any disturbance or cast doubt on peace, life and existence; indeed, we have got there today. Nor can we allow the ideas that previously incited the Holocaust and hatred among nations and peoples to have a forum and organisations. In many places the extreme right wing looks for and finds one of the sources for its solutions to the social problems before us in segregation and in inciting hatred, rather than in social reconciliation and integration. The European Union, as the true repository of human rights and humanitarian protection, must do everything to make these ideas and organisations withdraw, and even to make them disappear from our everyday lives if their aggression, which disturbs the healthy life of society, so demands.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I also recommend that the Union have more room for information in its communication activities. Unfortunately, significant layers of the population, primarily though ignorance, are susceptible to extremist, populist manifestations. It is primarily the young generation that is at risk, since they have not had the means to obtain the relevant historical experience of finding the right direction.

For this reason, at European level, anti-extremist and anti-terrorist actions should not affect the fundamental rights of citizens. Extremist movements of paramilitary groups, ultra-nationalism, xenophobia, calls to violence and local ethnic and religious conflicts threaten the stability of the European Union, characterized by a rich cultural and traditional diversity of its Member States. The latter must join efforts to fight extremist actions and identify the instigators and organizers of such actions. The European Agency for Fundamental Rights will also play an important role in preventing racism and xenophobia, ensuring a climate of security on the territory of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Dialogue, education and public information on themes related to promoting tolerance and combating racism are important elements that contribute to the dissemination of the principles of freedom and democracy. Member States should also cooperate and make efforts to integrate marginalized social and ethno-cultural categories, so that fight against discrimination and incitation to violence would ensure an ethnic and political harmony inside the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">the recommendation, by Marcello Vernola, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a Council and Commission decision on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Montenegro, of the other part (COM(2007)0350 – C6 0463/2007 – 2007/0123(AVC)) (A6-0498/2007).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Vernola for this very solid report, which is due to be adopted at a very crucial stage of our relations with Montenegro.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me first make a point on the European perspective of the Western Balkans. The Council meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on Monday reaffirmed that the future of the Western Balkans lies in the European Union. As proof of that we have in the last two months signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Montenegro and initialled SAAs both with Serbia and with Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to thank the Portuguese Presidency for its major contribution to these encouraging steps. I hope we can soon sign the two latter agreements, once the conditions have been met by these two countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Montenegro has made good progress since independence, including in the development of smoother, well functioning relations with Serbia. Of course a decisive step on Montenegro’s European journey was taken on 15 October this year when we signed the SAA with the country. I welcome the unanimous ratification of the SAA by the Montenegrin Parliament soon thereafter. The SAA provides a stable framework for economic, political and institutional development in Montenegro and it is a significant step forward in the country’s European integration path, provided that the Agreement is properly implemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">In another positive development, I also welcome the adoption of the Constitution of Montenegro only a few days after the SAA was signed. The new Constitution, which is broadly in line with European standards, helps strengthen democratic institutions in the country. Its full implementation will require further efforts and determination.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s regular progress report, adopted on 6 November, highlights these positive developments. It commends Montenegro for establishing the necessary legal and institutional framework following independence. It also underlines progress made by Montenegro in preparing for the implementation of the SAA and strengthening its administrative capacity. Our progress report also points out certain key challenges that Montenegro will face in the coming years. For instance, Montenegro’s administrative capacity remains rather weak and therefore administrative reforms need to be continued at all levels. In the fight against corruption, urgent action is needed to achieve concrete, tangible results. Money laundering and organised crime remain areas of concern. These are also highlighted, rightly so, in your report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new Constitution enhances the independence of the judiciary by setting up a new constitutional body, the Judicial Council, in charge of the appointment and dismissal of judges. The Government also adopted a judicial reform strategy for the period 2007-2012. Its implementation will certainly be a major challenge but it is clear that Montenegro needs to ensure the independence, accountability and professionalism of its judges and prosecutors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Montenegro participates actively in regional cooperation. It has good relations with its neighbours. Most issues with Serbia following independence have been settled. Montenegro has also taken a constructive approach to the Kosovo status issue, aligning itself with the EU’s position.</p>
      <p sl="en">Focus should now be on full implementation of the interim agreement on preparations for the whole SAA as well as on the recommendations of the European partnership. Montenegro needs to build a solid track record of implementation and of reforms. She has got off to a very good start in the stabilisation and association process and I hope that the country will build on this positive momentum.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are very much looking forward to working even more closely with the Government of Montenegro, the Parliament, other institutions and the civil society of the country on its European reform agenda. I am pleased to inform you that the new Commission delegation has been operational since 1 November and is preparing to take over the work carried on by the European Agency for Reconstruction, in due course as planned. Montenegro is expected to receive close to EUR 100 million under the instrument for pre-accession in the coming three-year period until 2009. These funds will assist Montenegro in such areas as the rule of law, the strengthening of administrative capacity and implementation of the SAA. Economic and social development and civil society development certainly will be another priority. So I trust we can count on the strong support of the European Parliament, which is crucial as always.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now accepted that the future of the Balkan countries lies in Europe; that was confirmed by the Thessaloniki European Council in 2003 and has been endorsed by ourselves in this House on a number of occasions, marking an end to any further discussion of the issue.</p>
      <p sl="it">Montenegro is undoubtedly in pole position on the road towards accession to the European Union, as the facts show: following independence from the Union with Serbia in 2006, declared democratically after a proper referendum and duly agreed with the Serbian Government, the negotiations for the country’s own Stabilisation and Association Agreement were re-opened and concluded in the space of slightly more than two months. The agreements were initialled on 15 March 2007 but, unfortunately, some technical problems then arose which slowed down further progress, although the end is now in sight. The Commissioner has just announced that an office has already been opened in Podgorica – which we commend – and that everything is now in place for ratification of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="it">Montenegro’s progress in the last year, the commitments into which it has entered vis-à-vis the European Community and ongoing reform work, even in the last few days, all lead us unhesitatingly to endorse the favourable opinion on the conclusion of the agreement. Clearly, however, that is not the final goal, but is no more than a starting point.</p>
      <p sl="it">Montenegro must now focus on implementing all the measures needed to complete the reform process which is already under way in order to fulfil the commitments into which it has entered in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. From that point of view, we should note the good climate of cooperation between the European Parliament and the Parliament of Montenegro, which we have met on a number of occasions and by which we shall be welcomed next week in Podgorica. Montenegro has everything that it needs to bring this process swiftly to a conclusion, starting from its status as a candidate for accession.</p>
      <p sl="it">Montenegro’s economy has continued to grow in recent years and that has helped to attract huge foreign investment, partly as a result of fiscal policies favourable to enterprises. As a result, unemployment has dropped sharply from 33% to 12%.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some months ago, the new Constitutional Charter was adopted, a clear sign of the extent to which the country is strengthening the democratic prerogatives which mark it out in the Balkan area. The Montenegrin authorities are working speedily to bring themselves into line with European standards. The most recent news has led us to table five amendments to take account of recent developments.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the last few days, a cooperation agreement with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has been signed in order to regulate technical assistance in respect of that Tribunal. We should bear in mind that unconditional cooperation with the ad hoc tribunal in The Hague is of crucial importance for all the states emerging from the break-up of Yugoslavia. We should also bear in mind that Montenegro has never shirked its international obligations, and indeed has always been praised for its efficient cooperation with the legal and foreign authorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">Montenegro needs to make further efforts to combat and put an end to organised crime in the area of illegal cross-border trafficking. The European Parliament also considers that corruption in the public administration and the judiciary needs to be combated: the country is responding positively to the European authorities and signs of this can be seen in the new Constitution which introduces mechanisms to protect the autonomy and independence of the judiciary.</p>
      <p sl="it">The capacity of the ruling class will also be developed by participation in Community twinning programmes and exchanges with the Member States. Some of these programmes will foster the development of younger people and researchers. Promoting the free movement of people, in particular students and researchers, is a goal which is being pursued among other things by simplifying the procedure for the issue of short-stay visas in respect of which specific agreements were signed last September with the European Union; the final goal is fully to liberalise visas in order to make freedom of movement effective, another major point of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and to open up channels fostering growth and education. We consider that cultural bodies should be allowed to flourish, for instance by promoting the voluntary sector and protecting the representatives of civil society. Freedom of thought must be ensured as must the right to information.</p>
      <p sl="it">The environment deserves a special mention: the previous Constitution defined Montenegro as an ecological republic, the first in the world to give itself such a label. Nature has been kind to the country, from the beautiful coastline to the natural Bay of Kotor and the Durmitor mountain massif which is on UNESCO’s World Heritage List. That heritage must be safeguarded by specific legislation which is in many cases already in the statute book but not strictly applied, often for lack of financial resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">The country derives considerable income from tourism, but unfortunately tourism itself may have an adverse impact on the environment, as the facilities available do not have appropriate systems for managing the major influx of tourists from an ecological point of view. For that reason, we asked Commissioner Rehn in another forum to focus the Commission’s attention on promoting environmental policies, especially as regards renewable energy sources, waste and water management and coastal protection. Montenegro is aware of the problem and is continuing to work towards proper management of natural resources. The spatial plan regulating construction work so as not to spoil the coastal landscape has recently been approved.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I naturally welcome the progress which Montenegro has made since declaring its independence and which has very quickly led to the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Montenegrins, of course, should not sit back and relax now but should fully implement the agreement they have signed. They should follow the guidelines they have set themselves and enable their administration to apply enacted legislation. They should ensure that the judicial system is brought up to scratch and that action is taken to combat corruption, especially in the administration and the judiciary.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am well aware that the particular situation which prevailed in the region in the 1990s allowed corruption to take hold and that it is very difficult to eradicate it today, but it does nothing for Montenegro’s reputation among the countries of the European Union when its name keeps cropping up in connection with smuggling, corruption and money laundering. Montenegrin politicians must do everything in their power to alter that image. After all, at some stage the people of the European Union are supposed to welcome Montenegro into the fold. For this reason it is imperative that the development of democracy and a market economy in Montenegro should take place in a truly transparent framework.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not intend to discuss every point that has been raised today or is still to be raised, nor will I refer to everything that is contained in our resolution. I would like to stress, however, that the Montenegrin landscape is a jewel, and special measures are needed to conserve its unique characteristics. This means, as Marcello Vernola said, that the clause in the new Constitution declaring Montenegro to be an environmental state must not amount to an empty promise. The coastline and hinterland must be protected, and megalithic investment projects must be prevented. Natural features and sites of cultural and historic interest must be conserved in order to ensure that Montenegro does not squander its unique tourist appeal. There are enough cautionary examples of such desecration in western Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">A sell-out of the coastline and hinterland must be prevented, and judicious development of tourism and cautious land-use are the order of the day. There is an urgent need to prevent overdevelopment of the coastline, and land and property speculation must be curbed. I am pleased to note that there now seems to be a land-use plan for that area. I welcome the cooperation with ICTY, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and hope that it might result in the arrest of Mr Karadžić at some point.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also my earnest wish to see Montenegro finally create the national agency that will let the country enable its students and trainees to take part in the Erasmus and Leonardo education programmes.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will be meeting a delegation of our counterparts from the Montenegrin Parliament next week, and we will encourage them to support their government in its efforts to pursue the path of convergence with the European Union and to combat all the abuses to which we have been referring.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, at the EU summit in Thessaloniki in June 2003, the Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their support for the development of a European perspective in the Western Balkans, where Montenegro is the newest successor state of the former Yugoslavia, having declared its independence from Serbia in 2006.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since then, its relations with the European Union have become ever closer, and Montenegro has clearly chosen to steer a European course. I particularly welcome the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement on 18 October, which marks a milestone in relations between Montenegro and the EU. It brings numerous benefits to that small Balkan country, particularly in business and trade, for it provides for a free-trade area as well as facilitating investment and business cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">On 19 October 2007 little more than a year after the declaration of independence, another important aim was achieved when the Montenegrin Parliament adopted the country’s first Constitution, which will play a particularly important role in forging the identity of this young nation. It establishes Montenegro as a democratic, liberal and environmental state based on the rule of law. That is a great success. Montenegro still has a long way to go to attain membership of the EU, but remaining obstacles are being dismantled bit by bit.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is still a particular need for progress in the struggle against the informal economy and corruption. The functioning of a free and independent judicial system, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and, above all, reform processes in the spheres of democratisation, human rights and the protection of minorities are indispensable for Montenegro and its future in the EU. The initial priority must be the successful implementation of the reforms prescribed by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">On 1 January 2008 Slovenia, another of Yugoslavia’s successor states, will take over the Presidency of the EU Council. It is gratifying that one of the priorities of the Slovenian presidency will be the Western Balkans. The security and stability of the Western Balkans are a paramount interest of the region itself and of the whole of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">A democratic and stable Montenegro can and should play a major role in the pursuit of these goals. Let me close by emphasising that the prospect of Montenegro acceding to the EU one day, albeit in the more distant future, is the main generator of further reform processes. We in the European Parliament should support Montenegro on its way towards the EU.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Over a hundred years ago Montenegro was a kingdom on the political map of Europe. It was recognised and valued both culturally and politically.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Part of the coast, the Bay of Kotor, was an integral part of Austro-Hungary and at that time also provided access to the sea along with present-day Herzegovina. Montenegro was at one time part of modern Europe and is now preparing itself for full cooperation in and membership of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Since May 2006, when it became a new European country, Montenegro has made encouraging progress as regards implementation of the European agenda. It deserves heartfelt congratulations for its signing of the Stability and Association Agreement and the new laws adopted in October. Podgorica also deserves recognition for its cooperation with the Hague Tribunal and its positive role and contribution to the long-term stability of the region.</p>
      <p sl="sl">However, from this day forward our European Union will be different, since a few hours ago in this hall we witnessed an extremely historic event when the Charter of Fundamental Rights was signed. The nationals of Montenegro also deserve greater democracy, greater respect, greater diversity and greater legal certainty. The main challenges to this young country are associated with the fight against organised crime and corruption, where more must and can be done. I would ask the competent authorities to be more proactive in the fight against corruption, organised crime and the trafficking of people, arms and drugs.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In that context I welcome the firm legislative framework. However, I would stress that the implementation of legislation in practice is a process which also requires adequate administrative and political resources. I am still very concerned about the lack of transparency and political culture both in political and economic structures. This is preventing Montenegro from developing a democratic society and a free market.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Montenegro must do more in terms of freedom, plurality and professionalism of the media. It must carry out the adopted reforms in full and ensure the independence of Montenegro’s radio and television.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I regret the fact that there have still been no results in the investigation into the case of murdered journalist Duško Jovanović who at the time was publishing a series of articles on organised crime in Montenegro.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Journalists and civil society play an important role in the development of democracy, in particular where they draw attention to sensitive social problems. I would therefore ask the government to be more active in resolving these problems and to involve and consult civil society and provide them with better conditions in which to operate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, may I express my warm thanks to Mr Vernola for his report and for the cooperative way in which it was dealt with in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. It is with even more gratitude, however, that I congratulate our Montenegrin counterparts and the Commission, who have once again demonstrated that a European perspective fuels the development of democracy, the rule of law and stability.</p>
      <p sl="de">In actual fact, however, I feel that the process is advancing too slowly. For this reason I appeal to both parties, starting with ourselves, the European institutions, to remember that Montenegro, and indeed the entire Western Balkans, is part of Europe. It is in our own interests that lasting peace and democracy should prevail there. We should deepen our commitment to the whole region. Our proposal for a specific agenda for a close economic and environmental partnership with the Western Balkans should be adopted. Let us do away with visa requirements as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">I ask Montenegro to ensure that progress reports no longer tell, as they have told for years, of inadequate efforts to fight corruption, of organised crime and of public institutions with insufficient capacities. It must step up its efforts to put European values into practice. These include an atmosphere of openness in which the activity of civil society can truly flourish and in which unrestricted freedom of the media is a matter or course.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, it must take on a more prominent role as a constructive player throughout the region as well as in efforts to resolve the issue of Kosovo’s status. Perhaps it can also rethink some of the steps that have led to dependence on countries outside Europe in certain areas. Such steps include both the signing of the bilateral immunity agreement with the United States and legislation permitting unhealthy speculation in land and property, which undermines efforts to protect the environment and prevents truly sustainable development of Montenegro’s stunningly beautiful coastal region.</p>
      <p sl="de">The recent adoption of land-use planning objectives is an important step. Once again, then, I offer my congratulations and my encouragement for further progress on the way to membership of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, in 1918 independent Montenegro took a voluntary decision to unite with the neighbouring states of Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Slovenia. After the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Montenegrin electorate decided democratically in 2006 that they did not wish Montenegro to remain united with Serbia. Montenegro thus became Europe’s 49th independent state, a state in which most of the population are Slavs except in the regions bordering Albania and Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians predominate.</p>
      <p sl="de">In terms of everyday politics, it is important that Montenegro should not become a haven for foreigners who want to pay less tax and launder ill-gotten gains. Montenegro must find solutions to the problem of environmental pollution and to the plight of long-term refugees from Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
      <p sl="de">The railways must be made serviceable again, and smuggling must be combated. My group is pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has adopted our amendments on refugees’ living and working conditions. People who are not currently nationals of any country must not remain stateless for ever, and Montenegro must follow the relevant guideline laid down by the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our proposal on the resumption of rail services to Nikšić on the Bosnian border and to Shkodër in Albania has also been adopted. Urgent measures must be taken to put an end to the neglect of the North-South rail link and to redress the imbalance caused by the decision to rely entirely on cars, buses and lorries.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also welcome the fact that the rapporteur has not repeated the call he made in his previous report on Montenegro for the country’s rapid accession to NATO. Accession to NATO must not be imposed as a condition of future access to membership of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also a good thing that this report does not repeat the demand that Montenegro pursue the sort of neo-liberal economic policy which would go even further than we already have within the European Union. Montenegro has the opportunity to become a Member State of the EU. That is important, not only for Montenegro but also for the other states of the former Yugoslavia which likewise aspire to accession.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the rapporteur Mr Vernola rightly makes the point that Montenegro’s future lies in the European Union. But the road to European integration is not a rose-strewn path. There is cause for alarm at the way in which the fledgling Balkan state is developing. Montenegro may in theory be splendidly ‘green’ and developing ideally, but Podgorica has to sustain this over the longer term. And current practices seem to be stubbornly entrenched.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One danger, for example, is the unstable boom in property prices on the Gold Coast around Kotor. In addition, fast-expanding and sometimes illegal construction is placing undue strain on the country’s water and sewerage systems. Mr Vernola mentions this, but not forcefully enough for so serious a problem.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The huge potential for growth of Montenegrin tourism has its dark side too. Whilst the tiny state’s Adriatic coast is experiencing a development boom, unemployment in the north is more than 20% and poverty is above the national average.</p>
      <p sl="nl">And the legacy of the war is still apparent. Infrastructure is minimal and in some localities the population has to contend with water and electricity shortages. Montenegrins are still not investing productively enough in a sound economic future. With a view to development, with a view to joining Europe, Montenegro needs a properly thought-out strategy of growth for the whole of the country. There must be no careless action regarding a new ‘European Gold Coast’.</p>

      <p sl="sl">I am pleased to support the consent given to the conclusion of a Stability and Association Agreement between the European Union and Montenegro which is one of the important, positive acts to have taken place in south-eastern Europe in recent months. This Agreement is recognition of the work that Montenegro has done and at the same time a contractual obligation to continue work on the road to full membership in the spirit of Thessaloniki perspective.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The Agreement lays down clearly the key priorities in the political and economic fields and in other fields. In that sense I welcome the agreement’s clear relationship to development priorities in the field of tourism, environmental protection, transport and energy production. All these priorities are closely interlinked and it is therefore also important that Montenegro carry out or bring about administrative reform through which it will be able to ensure rapid development and satisfaction of the conditions for acquiring candidate status. I genuinely wish Montenegro success in this regard since implementation, which the speakers before me emphasised, depends on this.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I am convinced that under the Slovenian Presidency the European Union will note any progress by Montenegro in complying with its contractual obligations.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is much to admire about Montenegro. The landscape is admirable, as is the way in which the separation from Serbia was conducted, both Montenegro and Serbia having acted very responsibly. I must also express admiration for the country’s policy on minorities, as a result of which minorities, by and large, tend to feel at home in Montenegro. These and many other things certainly merit our admiration.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are also dark sides, however, which cause me great concern and which other speakers have already mentioned. One of these is the activity of foreign investors, particularly those from Russia. I have nothing against Russian investment in Montenegro or any other country. The Montenegrins must beware, however, of an imbalance that would make them dependent on a single country – and I would say the same thing about dependence on any country, not just Russia. Some of these investments are already endangering Montenegro’s natural beauty spots and its picturesque landscapes.</p>
      <p sl="de">What continues to make me particularly sad is the prevalence of corruption, to which some Members have already referred. We have many reports from media sources that can at least be trusted to try to report in a fairly balanced way. The cases of massive corruption in connection with cigarette smuggling and other cases we have been reading about are things we thought had been consigned to history. I ask the Commission to make these occurrences a priority. If corruption were the sole criterion, we ought not to consent to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement today or in the days to come. We shall consent to it, however – and I include the Socialist Group here – because we want to help the country with its reform process.</p>
      <p sl="de">Needless to say, however, we expect the Commission and the country itself to make every effort to eliminate corruption, which – and this is the sad thing – extends into political circles. At least there have been widespread serious allegations of corruption on the part of politicians. Like Mr Kacin, I wish to highlight the fact that the case of the murder of Duško Jovanović has not yet been solved. I wonder whether it is a mere coincidence that he and his colleagues had written a great deal about organised crime. I hope that it is a coincidence and that there is no connection. I certainly wish that the Montenegrin authorities would solve this case soon and would do far more to fight corruption in their own country.</p>

For the first time we have to deal with a country that achieved independence through a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I was an observer at the first parliamentary election held in Montenegro after the referendum, as a representative of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Both the Council of Europe delegation and the OECD confirmed the democratic nature of the election. I was fascinated by the degree of civic involvement in the observation of the election process. Representatives of non-governmental organisations, returning officers, were present in all the electoral committees we visited. The great commitment of the members of the electoral committees in ensuring that all procedures were complied with was clear to see. It should also be noted that Montenegro has adopted the euro as legal tender.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, the relationship between the EU and the Balkans is a delicate issue partly because the biggest EU Member Sates, through their policy which amounted to a ‘divide and conquer’ approach, contributed significantly to the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, which since the First World War had been a key stabilising factor in the area as a whole. With the exception of Slovenia, all of these states are characterised by instability, ethnic tensions, migration issues, high levels of corruption and unemployment, a weak state and limited influence of elected parliaments. Such an environment is a breeding ground for illegal trade and trafficking of weapons, people, drugs, alcohol and tobacco products. In such an environment it is difficult to plan for transport, energy and economic development. It is also difficult to protect the environment. It should not come as a surprise to any of you that we view these phenomena, which are also prevalent in Montenegro, as pressing global issues facing the earth. A resolution is only a weak substitute for what we should do to redeem ourselves from the guilt borne by several members for the current state of affairs in this area.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, our fellow Member Mr Vernola has given an excellent – vivid, I would say – picture of Montenegro, which is the most enchanting corner of the Balkans. In Balkan legend, there have always been tales of this ancient kingdom, which has managed to live with five neighbouring countries. So many neighbours! It shares borders with Bosnia and Croatia and Serbia and Albania, and also with Kosovo, which will now perhaps be Montenegro’s problem, because, from what we see in the newspapers and hear from fellow Members, Kosovo is about to declare its independence, unilaterally!</p>
      <p sl="el">This could be a problem for Montenegro, which is now home to large numbers of Albanians. In my view, the signature of the accession agreement, for the start of negotiations, is very positive, and will help towards the reform of public administration and judicial authority, but above all it will help to combat corruption, and I hope this same agreement will restrain whatever tendencies may emerge among the Albanian population.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the political situation in the Balkans has been a subject of special interest to this Parliament for many years. We are happy that, after a period of bloody conflicts, peace and cooperation between nations are now the norm in the daily life of the region.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Even the most sensitive issues, such as declarations of independence by new states, now take place, or can take place, in a manner and form complying with the highest international standards. That is the real trend in the political development of the Balkans, a trend that creates the possibility to achieve the strategic goal of the majority of nations living in the region, namely closer cooperation with the European Union, up to and including full membership.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Montenegro is an excellent example of this trend. After declaring independence, it maintained good relations with its nearest neighbours, including the Republic of Serbia, with which it had previously been joined in a federation. It immediately began intensive negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which culminated in the signing of the Agreement on 15 October of this year. In parallel, it concluded a free-trade agreement with the EU that will enter into force in January.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the course of this short period of time, barely one and a half years, Montenegro has made appreciable progress. The changes made in fiscal and taxation policy, and in establishing a market economy based on competition and the free movement of capital, must be seen as positive achievements.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is still much to be done, especially in the fields of social policy and employment, energy and protection of the environment, and security and civil rights. An effective fight against corruption and organised crime and full cooperation with the International Tribunal in the Hague are particularly important tasks facing the government of Montenegro.</p>

Montenegro is one of the leaders in this process, and I would like here to express the hope that it will remain so. The Union is prepared to welcome the Balkan countries into the community. Whether and when that happens depends, above all, on the Balkan elite and the wisdom of Balkan politicians.</p>

The foundations have been laid for a new state and a new constitution has been adopted. The country’s economy is showing strong growth of 8% and inward investment has this year been in the order of EUR 700 million. The Stabilisation and Association Agreement has been signed and Montenegro has taken its first steps on its way to full membership of the EU. If, however, its path to membership of the EU is to be as short and fast as possible, Podgorica should make some fundamental decisions. It is necessary to reinforce the functioning of the rule of law and guarantee among other things an independent judiciary. It is also necessary – with more conviction than in the past – to combat corruption and increase transparency in decision-making in political and economic structures with a view to guaranteeing the democratic and equitable functioning of the market economy. Tourism has a fundamental significance for the economy of Montenegro. Its sustainability must be guaranteed by adopting a unified legislative framework for the protection of the natural environment and the coastline.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, the accession process of Montenegro and its neighbours facilitates much greater development of regional cooperation.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Swoboda rightly referred a moment ago to the widespread corruption in Montenegro. In support, I would like to quote figures given by Transparency International, which show that, on a scale of 0 to 10 (where 10 denotes the absence of corruption), Montenegro scores 3.3. It is thus right at the forefront of countries where corruption is a major problem.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would add that smuggling is also a dramatic problem for Montenegro. In this respect the country really does have no borders. Recently there was a proposal to prohibit smoking in public places, when at the same time, in the centre of the capital city, you can buy thousands of packets of contraband cigarettes. In that regard Montenegro clearly has a long way to go on the road to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the other hand, the country must be encouraged to meet the Union’s criteria as soon as possible. I welcome the fact that, in regard to the judiciary, for example, or the functioning of the administration, there has been perceptible progress. We have to appreciate what Montenegro has done in this field since the moment it rather unexpectedly declared its independence following a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe the European Union should give a clear signal that, once the relevant criteria have been met, the road to the Union will be shortened. We have to hold out a real prospect of membership – obviously not in two, three or four years’ time – but a real incentive to Montenegrin society for the increasing achievement of European standards.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Montenegro is not just one of the world’s most beautiful countries; it is also the Balkan country with the oldest tradition of independence in the modern era. When Belgium was founded, Montenegro had already been independent for centuries and possessed the characteristics of a state. I stress this because Montenegro is always wrongly dismissed as an example of a superfluous tiny land that suddenly found itself independent by a quirk of fate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me say to Mr Markov that Montenegro was annexed by its Serbian ally after the First World War. There was no question of voluntary union at that time. A pro forma parliamentary vote was taken, but that was all. There was a massive Montenegrin liberation movement, whose activities continued through the twenties and into the thirties. Tito then restored Montenegro’s independence within Yugoslavia, and under Tito’s Yugoslav Constitution it had a right of secession. When it tried to exercise that right, however, obstacles were placed in its way. Today it is an independent country on the way to membership of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must support the democratic forces there. As has already been said, its treatment of minorities is an example to many others in the region, which is why the minorities supported independence. What it still needs, however, is a stronger system of independent education, such as that provided by the Franciscan school centre in Tuzi, near Podgorica. Private education initiatives are needed to release the country from its rigidity.</p>
      <p sl="de">I call on the government to keep moving vigorously along this path towards pluralism, not only in the economy but also in education and in the country’s constitutional and democratic structures.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, there is no doubt that Montenegro is an example of positive development in the Balkans with regard to the structure of the state, the constitution, the rule of law, entry into the global market and the creation of a market economy. Without a doubt, therefore, the European Parliament should support the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Montenegro.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, however, we must remember that Montenegro has a great deal to change and to do, especially with respect to the rule of law and the fight against corruption. I would point out that in April 2007 Montenegro signed a bilateral agreement with the United States on exclusion from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Unfortunately, that agreement is in contradiction with the common position and basic principles of the European Union. The International Criminal Court is a very important institution from the viewpoint of EU policy. The bilateral agreement therefore grated unpleasantly with the prospect of an agreement with the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I do not say this in order to make the European Parliament ill disposed towards Montenegro. On the contrary, I believe the European Commission and all the EU institutions should do a great deal at the present time to help that country prepare properly for closer relations with the European Union, especially in combating corruption, strengthening the rule of law, building a market economy and countering the black market.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the example of Montenegro shows how important a referendum can be. I therefore understand why numerous posters calling for a referendum were held aloft in the House today, as the Treaty of Lisbon itself, of course, gives us the option of offering the European people such a referendum. I believe it is important that the general public are involved in the consultation process and that they have the opportunity to express their wishes.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Montenegro I believe there is also a need to improve the country’s economic structures; as Mr Posselt has already indicated, the educational establishments and programmes of the European Union are particularly important in that respect. In energy too, energy efficiency and renewables pose a huge challenge in Montenegro as well as offering unprecedented opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the telecommunications sector too, it would be desirable for Montenegro to transpose the Roaming Directive into national law because that could, of course, contribute to better communication with our European countries at more reasonable prices.</p>
      <p sl="de">It goes without saying that the environment is one of the key challenges, and the domain of waste management, sewage works and waste water poses a particular problem. If we speak of magnificent unspoiled natural beauty, we have grounds for applying the latest standards there. The European Union is offering environmental support frameworks, which should be put in place as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Many thanks to the rapporteur, who had the honour, in this report, of introducing a new and at the same time old European country. After the ‘velvet divorce’ from Serbia, Montenegro has been given the opportunity to demonstrate the unlimited potential of a small, proud country. On the other hand, Montenegro should lead in the development of regional cooperation, continuing to increase the rights of minorities and contributing to the conversion of the Balkan region from a barrel of gunpowder to a garden of nations.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Like the other countries whose names have only recently appeared on the map, Montenegro is facing a number of hazardous challenges: deep-rooted corruption, illegal business, the black economy, etc. It is unfortunate that some foreign investors, especially those from Russia, are attracted to this young country mainly because it offers easy ways of striking illegal financial deals. The decision not to hand over the US workers to the International Criminal Court in exchange for military assistance undermines Montenegro’s credibility as regards its willingness to cooperate peacefully with its neighbours, and even its dedication to European objectives.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Today, from the shadows of the past, Montenegro, like some of its neighbouring countries, is attracted to the prospect of becoming a member of the European Union. The very perspective of becoming a Member State encourages the development of democracy, human rights and a better life for citizens. The implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement should put the wind of Europe in the sails of Montenegro’s reforms. The country can draw from the experience accumulated en route to achieving EU membership by their neighbour Slovenia and other countries that joined the EU in the new Millennium.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Montenegro’s initiative of declaring itself an ecological republic is laudable; however, the path to achieving credible implementation could be a long one.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is good, that the curtain of isolation surrounding visas for Montenegro and other Balkan countries has been ripped up. The European Commission and the Council should not linger at the halfway stage, but continue to demolish this obstruction, together with financial and bureaucratic barriers, while maintaining a strong level of protection against criminals and lawbreakers.</p>

    <intervention id="3-323" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the Members for a very substantial and substantive debate and Mr Vernola for stimulating this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most Members rightly emphasised the absolute necessity of combating corruption and crime and ensuring that the rule of law is reinforced in Montenegro. I could not agree more: the rule of law is fundamentally important for all sectors of society, underpinning the functioning of the whole society and the economy. That is precisely why the Commission insists very much on judiciary reform early on in the pre-accession process in Montenegro, as well as in the other countries of the Western Balkans. This is one of the most important political criteria of accession, which should be considered first and foremost.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Vernola and many other Members also highlighted the importance of ecology and the environment. The Commission is assisting this ancient kingdom to become the ecological republic in the garden of nations, as Mr Paleckis said, by strengthening the administrative capacity of Montenegro, which in turn makes the country better able to approximate its laws to ours, for instance in the field of waste management and water treatment.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, this is also related to corruption and I want to quote from the progress report of the Commission. ‘There have been no improvements in activities to curb political corruption. … Management of public assets raises serious concerns. There is considerable room for corruption, especially in the cases of construction and land-use planning, privatisation, concessions and public procurement.’ This is a very serious issue and that is why Montenegro needs to address corruption as one of its first priorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also inform the honourable Members that the Commission intends to adopt a communication early next year – probably in March – in which we will take stock of developments since Thessaloniki, and Salzburg last year, and give pointers towards the future. One such issue will be visa liberalisation, mentioned by many of you, and rightly so. The Commission will initiate dialogue on roadmaps towards visa-free travel, which should help the countries of the Western Balkans to make progress to meet the requirements so their citizens will no longer need visas to travel to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, I want to underline that this is not, as such, within the competences of the Commission but in the hands of the national governments of the European Union, and the ministries and ministers of the interior are the key players here. Therefore let us join our forces and carry out effective lobbying of the ministers of the interior as well as of the countries concerned in the Western Balkans, because we have to be sure that all the security requirements, such as the issuing of documents and border controls, are in full order before we can move towards visa liberalisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I am very pleased to hear about the successful parliamentary cooperation which is taking place between the Parliament of Montenegro and the European Parliament. I know this is very important – it is part of true political integration – and this is helping to develop institutions in Montenegro in a most welcome way. I trust that we can work together towards reinforcing the democratic institutions and administrative capacity of Montenegro. I am very glad that we see eye to eye on the future development of Montenegro on its road towards the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I believe that cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Montenegro will be mutually beneficial in the future, especially through the gradual creation of a bilateral free-trade area. I am also very pleased at the progress made by the Republic of Montenegro towards meeting the obligations imposed by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would, however, refer briefly to areas in which, as set out in the Commission’s recommendations, Montenegro must continue its efforts if it wishes to draw closer to the European Union. The most important task is to improve the rule of law by reforming public administration so as to strengthen institutions at all levels and effectively combat their politicisation. I am aware of and appreciate the legislative efforts made by Montenegro in this area, but it is most important that they should gradually be given greater practical force. The Montenegrin authorities must also achieve greater transparency in matters of budgetary control, management of public funds and tender procedures.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that implementation by the Republic of Montenegro of all the European Commission’s recommendations will make it possible to set the country swiftly on a direct path to accession.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, once again we have the opportunity to discuss this serious health threat in the European Parliament. It was only a few months ago that we had the opportunity to discuss the Community Action Plan regarding this health threat. Our concern does not, of course, relate only to the European Community, but also to the whole world.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are concerned with the rise of infections, with the number of people who are affected and living with HIV worldwide, and the number of 33 million people, for us, is too high. Therefore, we want to take action within the European Union but also coordinate with all the other international players outside the EU to tackle this issue globally. This also matches the new European Community health strategy, which includes a global role for the European Union in the area of health.</p>
      <p sl="en">Areas we can concentrate on: first of all, to prevent infection – this is very important. At the same time, to make sure that testing is available, and treatment and care where needed. To achieve all this, we need to raise awareness, and this is a very important factor; this is something where we are lagging behind – I will come back to that in a minute. But also the social stigma. This is one of our major concerns, and in a way this works as a vicious circle, because the social stigma prevents people from wanting to test themselves and learning whether they have been infected, and therefore, they could infect others. They do not seek treatment and do not get tested, with all the negative effects. This is more worrying among young people, and this is our main concern and target.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our studies and polls show that, among young people, there really is a lack of knowledge – one could say there is ignorance when it comes to these health threats. So it is important to show to them in a balanced way, in a way that presents information and on the one hand does not create panic but on the other hand does not lead to complacency, that it is a serious disease; there is no cure for it, but they can protect themselves – and they can be shown how to do that – and at the same time that they should not be afraid of fellow citizens who have the infection, who have the disease.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have seen two extremes from the Eurobarometer. Some young people think that there is nothing to worry about: you take some antibiotics and it goes away. On the other hand, just by touching infected people or even sharing a glass with them or through a kiss one can catch the disease. So we see two extreme views regarding this health threat, and neither deals effectively with our aim, which is to control the spread and further infections.</p>
      <p sl="en">World AIDS Day is an important day and gives us an opportunity to discuss and raise awareness; but we should not limit ourselves to this one day, and that is why I am happy that, within the European Union at least, we will be discussing these issues continuously. But when it comes to young people, we have to remind ourselves that we had very active, very effective, very aggressive campaigns in the 1980s which managed to reach the goal of raising awareness, but then we stopped and we forgot that a young generation, a new generation of young people became sexually active after the end of those campaigns. In fact, some of them were born just before the end of those campaigns, and they did not benefit from those awareness-raising initiatives that were taking place then, and that is why we have the results I have just mentioned. We know that, through simple messages, simple methods, role models, celebrities, opinion leaders, giving a good example and explaining the situation, we can achieve the awareness that we would like to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="en">This year, our initiative was to propose to the health ministers of the European Union that we would all go simultaneously into schools and discuss these problems with young people on World AIDS day, to see what they know, tell them what we know, and have an exchange of views. We had a positive response: more than half the Member State Ministers followed that approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">We went into schools – I also went – and it was an eye-opener: the debates and discussions with young people, understanding, first of all, what they know or do not know about this disease, and also some practical problems. They know, for example, that the use of condoms is the best protection, but at the same time, how can they get them? They are too embarrassed or they are worried or they are shy. So we see some practical effects that we never thought were problems, never thought we would have to face in Europe. But they are still there.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, because we want to talk to young people in language that they understand, the Commission this year took the initiative of producing a new TV spot addressing the prevention of HIV transmission. This was done through a competition among young people, and the best one chosen, the winning entry, was by a Polish student. We produced that, and it was broadcast by several TV channels and was also used in the school visits. This is an important strategy which we must follow: we have to talk to young people in the language they understand.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, as I said earlier, the challenges arising from HIV and AIDS are present well beyond the European Union boundaries. It is true that, worldwide, there has been some good progress in terms of access to HIV-related services, especially low-middle-income countries. Now, about 95% of people infected with HIV live in those countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thanks to an unprecedented increase in international funding in these countries, the number of people receiving treatment has considerably increased, from 100 000 in 2001 to 2.5 million people in 2007. These are impressive figures; nevertheless, more than 70% of people in need of ARV treatment in these countries do not receive it or do not have access to it. This shows that we still have a long way to go.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European action is financed through a wide array of financial instruments both at national and global level, such as the global fund, for example. There are also other financing mechanisms through public private partnerships. Progress has been achieved through these joint efforts with the international community, but we still have a long way to go, and this requires strong cooperation among the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said at the beginning, our principal goal is to bring the number of new HIV infections down and work towards the best possible solutions in terms of support, treatment and care for those who are already living with HIV/AIDS. I therefore want to emphasis this once again: fighting the stigma – the social exclusion, the discrimination of the disease and people suffering from it or being affected by it – is very important and unless we do that we will never be able to control the situation. To do that, we need to raise awareness campaigns and increase them.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why the motto of the European Commission in this action against AIDS is ‘Remember me’, because it is a forgotten disease at all levels, or at least it has become one. We will now bring it back to the forefront; but it is not just for the citizens, to remind them of the existence of this disease, but also for the decision-makers, to make sure that they put it back at the top of the political agenda and take all the necessary actions. In this respect I am counting – and I know I have it – on the support of the European Parliament.</p>

    <intervention id="3-329" speaker_id="4527" name="John Bowis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, there is so much to be done. Let me start with what the Commissioner really highlighted in his speech, which is the effect on children, because one of the campaigns that is running this year, of course, is Stop Aids in Children. We know that every minute of every day a child is born with HIV; we know that 2.3 million children are living in our world with HIV; that only one in 10 who needs anti-retroviral treatment receives it; in the absence of treatment we know that an estimated one third of infants die in their first year and half die by their second birthday; we know that 15.2 million children under the age of 18 have lost one or both parents to AIDS; and we know that by 2010, that magical year, more than 20 million children will have been orphaned by AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is the children's story, that is the challenge regarding children, but of course it is an adult story as well. We know the numbers that we have in our various countries for people being diagnosed, for people living with HIV: all on the up, and the frightening statistic that one in three people do not know they are infected.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is the challenge, but there are specific challenges I think we should highlight this year, and the Commissioner has hinted at some of them. The level of basic knowledge has actually been going down in the last five years: the public is less aware than it was. Myths and misunderstandings have been growing. One in five people do not know that HIV can be transmitted through sex without a condom. Fewer than half of all sexually active people always use a condom with a new sexual partner.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know that the number of people diagnosed has trebled since 1997; we know that risk-taking sexual behaviour is on the increase; we know that a quarter of all HIV-related deaths are due to late diagnosis, and a third are preventable. And, specifically, we know that failed asylum seekers living with HIV are too often not eligible for free HIV treatment and so cannot afford lifesaving care, and can go on and infect others. We also know that the rate of HIV among male prisoners is 15 times higher than among the general population.</p>
      <p sl="de">All those things we know, along with the knowledge we have of the hopeful signs, of research. Recently in Rwanda I saw for myself the research, the ongoing clinical trials and the need for trials in Africa for vaccines for Africans.</p>
      <p sl="de">But all these things need that urgency, and 2010 is the target year; 2010 is nearly with us. 2010, Commissioner: you and I come to the end of our term of office. I want us not to hide behind that fact and leave it to our successors. I want us to say, in 2009, when you and I may be leaving office, at least we have fulfilled this promise.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, my compliments to the Commission for its efforts, which the Commissioner has just described. I would stress today the importance of World AIDS Day and of our joint responsibility in combating this disease. Because a disaster is unfolding worldwide, a disaster which does not get the attention it deserves.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My group thus welcomes the fact that we are having this debate today in Strasbourg. The figures speak for themselves. Worldwide there are 33 million people who have full-blown AIDS or are HIV-positive, and a total of 25 million people worldwide have died of the disease.</p>
      <p sl="nl">But a lot of people act as if AIDS does not exist. Because AIDS is associated with sex, many people prefer not to talk about it. And that makes it hard – as the Commissioner says – to educate people about AIDS. The younger generation of today is paying a high price for that. Half of all new HIV infections are in people under the age of 25. In the time it takes me to say this, six more young people will have been infected with the virus and three children will have died of AIDS. We are talking here of a generation which has not known a world without AIDS.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The disaster is not confined to Africa. In recent years the number of HIV infections in Europe and Central Asia has doubled from 1.25 to 2.4 million. It is high time for the European Union to do something. This terrible disease, which destroys the lives of millions of families worldwide, is preventable. AIDS can be fought by effective information, readier availability of condoms, and affordable drugs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Commissioner rightly points out that we have allowed AIDS to become a forgotten disease on our own continent. Europe's youngsters of today were not around for the big public awareness campaigns of the 1990s. We must act vigorously if we do not want things to get out of hand here.</p>
      <p sl="nl">So, partly as a symbolic act and partly because we think it is a really important initiative, my group launched a campaign last month to get the tax on condoms reduced to 5% throughout the European Union. The fact that the rate of VAT on condoms varies so widely – in some countries it is as much as 25% – shows that we do not in Europe have a shared approach to this shared problem, or at least that we are not doing enough about it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Portuguese Presidency has given solid backing to our campaign and we hope for a positive endorsement from Commissioner Kovács too when he launches the debate on the European VAT system at the end of next year.</p>

    <intervention id="3-331" speaker_id="28247" name="Holger Krahmer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘Yours for ever, AIDS’ were the words I read on a poster for World AIDS Day, which took place almost two weeks ago. The message was that AIDS is treatable but not curable. Many people, especially younger people, lose sight of that or choose to ignore it. The infection rates, to which previous speakers have referred, speak for themselves. Education is the only way to prevent HIV and AIDS, and I am pleased that the Commission subscribes to that view.</p>
      <p sl="de">Education, however, must not be confined to poster campaigns or visits to schools by government ministers. These things attract brief attention and may catch the eye of the media too, but they do not modify behaviour patterns, especially among young people.</p>
      <p sl="de">AIDS and HIV were once the stuff of real-life horror stories in the press. Many people felt insecure and afraid because nobody knew how dangerous the virus really was. I have no wish to return to those days, but with the existence of HIV/AIDS having become a fact of life and treatments having become safer, the problem no longer automatically captures the same level of public attention today.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many people have become accustomed to these messages, and some are even tired of hearing and seeing them. That is irrational, but it is a fact. Education must be adapted to take account of these changed circumstances. Education must be designed to reach out and capture people’s attention, to address tailored messages to specific target groups in their own vernacular. There are young people out there who misinterpret HIV as a negligible risk, and it is particularly important that we engage with them on their own cognitive ground and prompt them to think about the consequences of infection.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many people still do think about the consequences, but unfortunately they start too late, namely when a doctor or social worker tells them they have tested positive. Then the disease, which has hitherto been a dim and distant concept, suddenly becomes very real. Only if we manage to make people think about HIV before it is too late shall we have made any progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">Patient long-term efforts will be needed to achieve that goal. There must be facilities, services and projects designed for target groups – the more differentiated and the closer to personal experience they are, the better they will be. The organised AIDS charities, such as the AIDS-Hilfe associations in Germany, can continue to play an important role here if they rise to this new challenge. That, unfortunately, is not happening everywhere.</p>
      <p sl="de">Those who are HIV-positive today have a good chance of a long life, in western Europe at least. In other parts of the world, such as Africa, it is a different matter. This comfortable situation of ours, however, should not breed complacency.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am a doctor who has been working with AIDS for twenty years and I have to say that, frankly, I would have expected much more detailed and pragmatic proposals from the Commission. In the European Union, sexual relations are the main channel of transmission. To be more specific:</p>
      <p sl="it">1) Is the Commission urging all the Member States to organise sex education classes in schools?</p>
      <p sl="it">2) Is it urging Member States to introduce price controls on condoms which are at present the only way of blocking sexual transmission?</p>
      <p sl="it">In Europe the second main channel of transmission is intravenous, especially among those using drugs. What, then, is the Commission doing to urge Member States to implement damage limitation strategies which are the only way in which intravenous transmission can be reduced among those who are unable, cannot or do not want to give up drugs?</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the rest of the world, I would have expected the Commission to come here and tell us: after eight months of deadlock with Parliament, we note that Parliament has voted to amend Article 6 of the TRIPS Agreement and, while that that has not led to any amendment, the Commission is committed to fighting to amend the WTO rules. At present, the TRIPS rules allow multinationals to hold patents for twenty year with the result that drugs do not get to Africa. We have heard absolutely nothing about that! If those rules are not changed, speaking of Africa is no more than hot air!</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, how is it possible, when everyone is talking about the fight against AIDS, that you have Commissioner Mandelson writing letters to the Thai Government asking it not to pass laws making it possible to distribute generics and, in his letters, sponsoring and naming companies such as Sanofi-Avensis? In my view, the Commission should have something to say about that!</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, yes, AIDS has claimed too many victims – far too many. It continues to claim them and will claim many more. Tragically, many children will be infected before birth. We have heard the figures, they are frightening, and I do not intend to go through them again.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sadly, the spread of AIDS is continuing not only in the EU Member States but in non-member countries too, and to fight this new wave of the epidemic it is essential that we step up preventive action, provide more treatment, care and support and forge the partnerships that are absolutely vital to the effort. Alongside prevention we need to improve access to information, and make it easier for people to obtain advice, treatment and social services. We need to mitigate the negative impact of this disease – one of saddest aspects being that it is a taboo condition, something people dare not discuss freely. To achieve all this, we need to mobilise available resources and focus research, coordinate our efforts and fund specific projects. Only if everyone concerned works together in constructive partnership can we make a significant and lasting contribution to stemming this epidemic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One striking thing is the fact that today’s young Europeans have never experienced the type of effective prevention campaigns that were run in the 1980s. European societies need to shoulder their responsibility here and get the essential information about HIV and AIDS across to young people. The most recent surveys show an astonishing level of ignorance about the disease among the young. 54% of young people in the ‘old’ EU Member States believe HIV can be contracted by drinking from the same glass as an infected person. That shows how vital it is to improve awareness and to invest in prevention and in information about the use of condoms. The cost of condoms is another issue that needs to be addressed. The survey findings also show that we cannot relax our efforts; we cannot overlook what is no longer a ‘new’ disease. In raising awareness, we need to deliver the right messages – messages better tailored to their audience. Efforts are currently under way on this front. The messages we put across need to be more up-to-date and they need to make a real impression on young people. Until recently and largely for ethical reasons, it was left, in the main, to patients to seek advice and to request HIV testing. In retrospect we can now identify two problems with that approach: firstly, the availability of services was poor and, secondly, people were afraid of being stigmatised and discriminated against. In low-income countries the fact that testing is voluntary is a serious obstacle to combating the AIDS pandemic. How can disadvantaged, poorly educated patients be expected to give informed consent? How can a person who has never heard of HIV consent to being tested for it?</p>
      <p sl="fr">And what benefit does an individual derive from taking an HIV test in a country that has no social protection system? Recent surveys in sub-Saharan Africa show that only 12% of men and 10% of women have had the test and received results. This disease is an ongoing threat and we must not lower our guard against it!</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, AIDS remains one of the great plagues of the 21st century despite the international community’s exceptional efforts to combat it over the last 20 years, albeit with occasional periods of slackening.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Number 6 on the list of UN Millennium Development Goals, adopted in September 2000, is to halt and begin to reverse the spread of AIDS by 2015. However, the current situation in developing countries – and particularly in Africa where the death rate from AIDS is still rising – demands that we redouble our efforts if we are to achieve that target.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are several potential avenues for European action here. Firstly, we can strengthen cooperation arrangements, particularly with local authorities in the southern hemisphere because it is only at local level that lasting solutions can be found with regard to caring for sufferers, preventing the disease, supplying medicines, running information and prevention campaigns, and generally managing health services so that they meet local people’s needs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, we must find ways of tackling the shortage of health professionals in low-income countries. Europe needs to step in here with practical, properly funded programmes to enable health professionals to do the work they were trained for in their own countries, under proper conditions and within proper structures, with the necessary equipment and medicines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, combating AIDS in the long term will require a firm commitment to give patients in developing countries access to the medicines they need at prices they can afford. Given that many AIDS patients in the southern hemisphere have already developed resistance to the first-generation drugs they have been treated with, it is essential to find ways of making the latest treatments available in generic form in low-income countries. For that reason I would ask the Commission specifically to ensure that bilateral and regional agreements currently being negotiated – especially EPAs – do not include any provisions that might make it harder for southern hemisphere countries to use all the flexibility available under the TRIPs agreement and the 2001 Doha Declaration for the purpose of protecting AIDS patients.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have no more to say. The unacceptable situation of millions of people dying of AIDS every year demands that the European Union face up to its responsibilities. It is time to stop talking and to get to work.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I shall be brief, because I understand we are under pressure of time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I just wish to make three or four points. Firstly, this is a problem that affects the whole population and this is the message we try to convey. It is no longer a question of risk groups and that the rest of us need not worry: it is an issue for the general population – young people, women. We must raise awareness about this, and the political message has to go through as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular – because it was mentioned – on the issue of immigrants we take a particular approach. The Portuguese Presidency had the issues of health and immigration as a theme of its Presidency, and access to treatment, testing and treatment and healthcare of the immigrants – even undocumented ones – is an important aspect. This is something we are discussing not only for their protection and the human rights aspect of it, which, of course, is a priority, but also for the protection of society as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issues that were raised, such as the possibility of the exchange of needles for drug-users, promoting condoms, sexual education in schools, the problems in prisons, are all part of our discussions with the Member States and the civil society. We have a think-tank where everybody is involved: they have discussions and exchange best practice and experiences. But, of course, within the European Union we realise that we do not have the competence: it is the responsibility of the Member States to implement these policies. Therefore, we raise the profile at a political level, we hold discussions at technical level but, at the end of the day, it the responsibility of the Member States to take specific initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other issues raised by Mr Agnoletto, I have taken note with great interest of the issue of TRIPS. I have noted that and also the effect it would have on access to medicine in developing countries and all the other issues he raised concerning dealing with countries outside Europe. I will raise them with my colleagues who are responsible for these particular areas and I will inform them of the points raised by the honourable Member.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, when it comes to access to ARV within the European Union, initially – and then hopefully we can extend it to other areas – we are supporting very actively the initiative of the German Presidency after the Bremen Conference to achieve access to cheap and affordable ARV treatment for all patients and those who need it. We already have, if one can call it that, a first success story with Bulgaria. But, of course, we will pursue it in the Presidency, with the support of the Commission, and hopefully once the model is established we can extend this approach outside the European Union. We always have this as a target.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to say that my colleague Mr Dimas regrets not being able to be here today for this debate but, as you know, he is at the global warming conference and he has to represent the Community there.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a very important issue. We know that heavy storms in the Black Sea region in November caused a tragic loss of life and property and of course damage to the environment, with an estimated leakage of 1 300 tons of fuel oil and the sinking of ships carrying sulphur. Under a bilateral agreement, the Commission sent a team of five EU experts, who were joined by representatives of the Commission and the UN Environment Programme. The EU experts found Ukrainian clear-up operations well underway. Locally available technologies and resources were considered sufficient, and Ukraine expressed no need for additional emergency equipment. The key results of the mission will be presented to the Ukrainian authorities in Kiev on 14 December. During that meeting discussions will also focus on further strengthening cooperation with regard to improvements in the monitoring of the environmental quality of the Black Sea.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to international oil spill statistics, the current oil spill can be considered of medium size and is not expected to be a major environmental disaster. Of course, that does not mean that we are not just as concerned, in particular because there is always the possibility of secondary pollution. The density of the environmental pressures, the presence of sensitive species in the strait, the political sensitivity of the area and the risk of further, similar accidents in the future all underline the need to assess the situation in a more comprehensive manner. The European Commission is therefore considering follow-up through other instruments such as post-damage assessment missions, so I am looking forward to the debate on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today’s opportunity to discuss last month’s Black Sea disaster is very welcome, for at least two reasons.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The first is that, with respect to many countries, including Russia, the European Parliament has a role to play as a substitute for public opinion. Imagine what would happen in the European mass media if a similar disaster occurred, let us say, in the Baltic. The television would regale us with pictures of damaged flora and fauna for days on end. We would be subject to an onslaught of experts explaining the ominous effects of the disaster. In Russia, however, the media are silent. Only with great difficulty was I able to gather a few scraps of information, mainly from Ukrainian sources. Our voice, therefore, is exceptionally important in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second reason is what I would call broadening our European awareness: the awareness that regions to which we have hitherto paid little or no attention, like the Black Sea, are an integral part of our continent, not only in the geographical sense but in terms of nature, ecology, economics and culture – the awareness that we are parts of a common whole and that those parts affect each other.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Such awareness should increase our sense of responsibility, which should also extend to the Black Sea region. Our responsibility entitles us to demand that the Black Sea basin be made much safer than hitherto. It should be mentioned in passing that disasters on a smaller scale have occurred several times in the recent past.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this respect the following demands are particularly important. First and foremost, monitoring of the situation in the Black Sea – both now, barely a month after the disaster, and much later on.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The next demand is to get the European Union’s neighbouring countries, at long last, to begin modernising their fleets, especially their tankers. The Black Sea is turning blacker and blacker, not from the natural causes to which it owes its name but from the colour of crude oil. It could become one huge oil container. Pressure must be brought to bear on the EU’s neighbouring countries to impose a swift ban on the use of obsolete single hull tankers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore ask the House to adopt the motion for a resolution that has been tabled, in which we call on the Council and Commission to step up cooperation with non-EU riparian states. A land border can be closed relatively easily, but a sea border cannot. As we shall not be building dams, the action proposed is also in our own interests.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr. President, following the recent violent storms in the Black Sea, four ships sank and seven were damaged, among which there were two oil tankers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The accidents happened in the Kerch strait, which connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov and represents the main route for the export of Russian oil to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">2,000 tons of fuel oil spilled into the sea and the ships that sank were carrying over 7 tons of sulphur. The Community Civil Protection Mechanism sent a team of 7 experts to the field to evaluate the effects and identify the necessary actions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As rapporteur for the endorsement of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy of the European Parliament regarding the Commission’s Communication on the Black Sea Synergy, I asked the Union to become a leader in promoting the principles of the common maritime policy and developing maritime transport routes in this region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The legislative package on maritime transport is important for the Black Sea region. The Directive regarding port control and Directive 65/2005 on port security will increase the maritime transport safety in the region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In 2006, under the Black Sea Memorandum of Understanding, over 4,650 inspections of ships belonging to 83 flags were performed. Following the inspections carried out by the authorities of Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, the Russian Federation, Turkey and Ukraine, it was found that 69.39% of the ships had deficiencies, and approximately 6% of them were retained. Out of the total retained ships, 8.7% were cargo ships, 2.9% passenger ships, 2.7% ships carrying chemical substance and 0.5% oil tankers. These retentions were due to deficiencies in the systems for navigation safety, absence of rescue equipment and flaws of equipment and structures providing ship stability.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Also, the countries bordering the Black Sea, such as Georgia, are on the black list of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, and the other 5 countries bordering the Black Sea are on the grey list.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the Union should do more to increase the maritime transport safety in the region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Maritime Safety Agency, together with the Secretariat of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding and the Member States, will finance studies and programmes to increase the maritime transport safety. As of 2007, the agency will support Member States, by providing assistance, to prepare capabilities for preventing and combating sea pollution with toxic substances.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Through the TEN-T budget, the Commission has already created projects for the development of maritime routes in the region of the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the seas situated in Western Europe. I request that the Commission carry out a similar study for the Black Sea region as well and I also request the use of the CleanSeaNet service, developed by the agency, which allows the detection of oil spill and surveillance in European waters, in the Black Sea region as well.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner. First of all I would like to thank Mr Costa, who tabled the motion for a resolution on the issue under debate on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Politically, though, I would like a much quicker reaction than merely emphasising the need for the Council not to delay in adopting a position on the seven legislative proposals in the third maritime safety package. In my view, this solves nothing in the ecologically dangerous internal seas, such as the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea, which are surrounded by both EU Member States and the Russian state, as a coastal state. In view of the level of oil prices and the profit levels involved, Russia’s oil exports by sea will grow very quickly in the future. This corresponds to Russia’s transport policy: to export oil via its own country’s ports, while at the same time keeping the pipelines in the EU oil terminals at Ventspils and Būtingė shut. Can we expect an increase in demand for these tankers, and will Russia’s fleet of tankers receive the necessary investment to avoid further use of single-hull, 40-year-old tankers and vessels designed for river use? I think not. The basic motivation for potential oil transport by sea will be wrecks that are as cheap as possible. I believe that if stringent maritime safety measures are maintained only in the European Union, this will not save the environment in the seas adjoining it unless it can bring in international standards. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="hu">We have seen explosive growth in many areas in recent decades, but nothing compares with the growth that has taken place in global trade and, in connection with this, the transportation of goods. Sea transportation has played a prominent role in this explosion, since 90% of the European Union’s external trade is in this area. Since this is the biggest method of transportation, I feel that people are right to expect that this means of transporting people and goods should also be safe and clean, so that the risk of accidents occurring at sea and pollution caused by ships falls.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Over the last month three grave disasters have occurred, the total scale of which is the same as the Exxon Valdez pollution of 1989, so this must have a sobering effect. Attention must be drawn to the importance of prevention and effective measures. The environmental damage caused by accidents like this does not stop at the borders of a country or two, or of a continent, but endangers and will ultimately destroy irrevocably our common values and our common natural treasures. There is therefore an urgent need for more effective international coordination than there is now, and to play a serious role in active prevention and in remedial work after accidents. It is also necessary to review the international legislation in this area without delay, to fill in the gaps, to prohibit ships designed for river traffic from going to sea, and to enforce effectively the ‘polluter pays’ principle. It is the overriding duty of the European Union to press for measures aimed at safe sea shipping at international level, as has already happened in the European Union. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr. President, the incident in November caused ecological damage both to the Black Sea, and to the Sea of Azov, proving that sea waters have no borders and oil spills caused by accidents that happen outside the European space may also affect the coastal ecosystems of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The sunk ships that caused the pollution of the Black Sea were designed for inland water navigation and not for sea navigation, thus causing the spillage of tons of oil into the sea and affecting the natural habitats of the sea. Over 15,000 birds and dolphins were covered in fuel oil and several rare species of flora and fauna, from the Black Sea coast and bottom, were destroyed, requiring significant efforts in order to recover the integrity of the Black Sea ecosystem.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The degradation of aquatic life is full of negative consequences, since it influences the ecological security and the quality of life and health of the population. The acute reduction of the Black Sea biodiversity is worrying due to the continuous degradation of the ecosystem, illegal fishing and overexploitation of natural resources, and oil spills contribute to the worsening of the environmental condition in this region, which is deemed the most polluted in the world.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union Heads of State and Government have undertaken the commitment to stop the reduction of biodiversity by 2010, and these objectives must be achieved in the sea sector as well.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the European Union, we have to make sure that maritime transport is carried out under conditions of safety, and sea borders are protected as efficiently as possible from cross-border threats. Moreover, the new Green Paper on market-based instruments for environment and related policy purposes aims at a better implementation of the “polluter pays” principle and I hope it will have a positive influence on the methods to prevent this type of ecological disaster.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr. Chairman, Colleagues, The Black Sea is not only an external border of the European Union after the accession of Bulgaria and Romania but also a sea of huge economic potential for the development of our Union. If we take the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea as a single region, its market has a foreign trade potential worth over 200 million Euro and a population exceeding 350 million.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Let me briefly recall the debate in September in the wake of the big floods and fires in Europe. Then we discussed the need for the establishment of joint forces to help Member States cope with natural disasters like those which struck us this year. A similar need could be identified now in the Black Sea region. First and foremost, I appeal to the European Commission and, of course, the Member States, especially Bulgaria and Romania, to launch priority study of the need for a regional rescue centre for the Black Sea region to help countries cope with serious situations like the one we witnessed a few months ago. Secondly, a thorough analysis should be made of the root causes of these disasters and all other disasters in the Black Sea region so that to learn the lessons and give recommendations for our policy in the region. Thirdly, it is time to set up a regional navigation information centre for the Black Sea, which will contribute to the security of transport routes and, generally, navigation in the region.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The tragedy in the Strait of Kerch is something we have to live and cope with within the shortest possible time limits, especially those of us who border on the Black Sea region. But let us use the occasion of this tragedy to seek both reasons and opportunities for cooperation among the Member States, the Commission and the other countries bordering the Black Sea so that to enhance the security of this important European route.

      <p sl="ro">Ladies and Gentlemen, as rapporteur on the Black Sea regional cooperation, I welcome the initiation of this debate, but I also deeply regret the fact that the theme of our discussion is, in reality, a sad acknowledgment of the fact that the Black Sea is still not subject to necessary attention from the European Union and a satisfactory level of implementation of the planned actions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Nevertheless, I would like to remind you that, since Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union, the Black Sea has become a partially internal sea and we cannot ignore its strategic importance for the entire world.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Black Sea region is of major importance from the point of view of the European Union energy policy and transport policy. Therefore, this forces us to develop a global and coherent strategy for the entire region, a strategy that would aim at ensuring security, sustainable development and thorough integration of environmental protection aspects. More than that, in order to promote a veritable policy at regional level, joint efforts are required from all countries bordering the sea, which would exceed the national and bilateral framework.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Thus, I welcome the 2007 launching of the Black Sea Synergy, but I reiterate an essential aspect from my report, namely the need to take concrete and firm steps in order to develop and achieve this cooperation initiative, both within the region and between the region and the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The 11 November 2007 black tide tragedy has proved to us that, in this field, we need to combine our efforts. The European Union has to play a central role entirely, both through increased involvement in the Black Sea Synergy development and by encouraging its neighbours and partners in this direction. This is the only way in which we will be able to respond efficiently to the expectations and calls of our citizens who face the direct consequences of the 11 November disaster today.</p>

      <p sl="bg">First and foremost, I would like to express my satisfaction with the fact that the Commission has come up with this opinion. This debate comes to show that the Black Sea is now the focal point of European politics and European politicians. I commend this approach and believe that it would benefit all citizens of the European Union. As mentioned earlier, a lot more should be done to protect the Black Sea region. The point is how to prevent disasters like the one which happened in the Strait of Kerch. Because disasters can never be fully prevented but their root cause can certainly be minimized.</p>
      <p sl="bg">There are two ways to ensure better protection of our seas. Fist, we have to contunue the promotion of regional cooperation. Second, side by side with regional cooperation, better policies are needed in navigation. The measures suggested in the third package of the maritime policy are in the right direction and they should be implemented in the best possible manner. Their implementation is indispensable for the prevention of events like the one in the Strait of Kerch in the Black Sea region. Since the European Parliament and the Commission expressed their support for the package of measures quite some time ago, it is time for the Council to become more active and undertake the necessary steps for the introduction of this package. The successful implementation of the measures envisaged in the package, coupled with the enhanced level of regional cooperation, for instance the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the DABLAS initiative for protection of the environment. Could be an important contribution to the security of our seas and, at the same time, could ensure higher competitiveness of our navigation industry.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I believe that this disaster proves once again the importance of the issue related to our water basisns and the need for appropriate policies to prevent such accidents and to protect the environment. Therefore I believe that the time has really come for the third package of measures within the framework of the maritime policy to become a reality and enter into force. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I should like to explain why we are tabling this motion for a resolution on the shipwrecks in the Kerch Strait in the Black Sea. Our solidarity goes to the victims of that disaster!</p>
      <p sl="it">We invite the Council and the Commission carefully to monitor the situation in the Black Sea and to take concrete measures to help to reduce the ecological impact of the disaster. Europe does not yet have the panoply of regulations needed to prevent any repetition of very serious accidents along the lines of the Black Sea accident; among other things, those regulations must make states responsible for the safety of the vessels flying their flags and for prosecuting, including through civil proceedings, those responsible for such environmental disasters.</p>
      <p sl="it">Although the European Parliament adopted the third maritime safety package at first reading in April 2007, it has not yet been fully approved by and is inexplicably blocked in the Council, despite the commitment that the Portuguese Presidency gave in this respect to the Transport Committee and Parliament. The package, consisting of seven reports, is a comprehensive package: it steps up maritime safety standards, safeguards passengers, limits environmental damage in the event of accidents, and sets out obligations and responsibilities on the part of states, carriers and ship-owners. Breaking up the debate and giving priority to some aspects and not others is proof that the Council does not want to tackle the issue of safety in a serious way and wants to put a brake on the package as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="it">Maritime safety is too important an issue to be the subject of tactics, too serious because of the events that have already taken place: Erika, Prestige, more recently Segesta Jet in the Strait of Messina and Sea Diamond in Santorini! Because of the accidents that have already happened and because increasing maritime traffic in Europe and the world could well increase the risks in future.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is for that reason that the European Parliament considers that all seven of the proposals must be taken forward as soon as possible, before there is another environmental disaster with human losses: to harmonise types of classification, to compel states to monitor vessels flying their flags, to ensure that vessels are inspected in ports and to monitor their movements, to decide what action should be taken in the event of accidents and to monitor and manage responsibilities as regards both third parties and passengers. We therefore urge the Council not to turn a blind eye to this tragic warning from the Black Sea.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a few points. First of all regarding Russia, a point raised by various Members. I would like to begin by saying that the Community civil protection mechanism can be activated only upon a request by an affected country. Official letters offering assistance were sent both to Ukraine and the Russian Federation and, while Ukraine answered positively, requesting assistance, Russia declined the offer.</p>
      <p sl="en">But on the general issue of maritime safety, my colleague Vice-President Barrot wrote on 10 December to his colleague Mr Levitin, who is the Russian Minister of Transport, to raise these concerns and to stress the importance of strengthened EU-Russia cooperation in the Black Sea as well as the Baltic Sea – in order to improve maritime safety.</p>
      <p sl="en">Addressing maritime environment problems at regional level is one of the cornerstones of the European Union’s marine strategy and the proposed Marine Strategy Directive, for which a second reading agreement between the Council and Parliament has been reached. I think this is a very positive development.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has set out its views on a strategy in the region in its communication ‘Black Sea synergy – a new regional cooperation initiative’. The proposal puts forward an initiative that would focus political attention at the regional level. The recent accidents in the Black Sea have notably involved a special category of vessels, the so-called sea/river oil tankers, which can only sail in open seas under certain restrictions.</p>
      <p sl="en">More generally the Commission is concerned by the possibility that this category of vessels will trade in other sea areas of the European Union or neighbouring the European Union, and in particular the Baltic Sea. Within the EU we have strict rules on maritime safety and the condition of the vessels, but we are also concerned about what happens in international waters both because it could easily affect the European Union and because we are concerned about the global environment. That is why these accidents also demonstrate the importance of maintaining pressure on maritime safety issues both at EU and at international level.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this respect, as pointed out by Parliament and by Members already, it is important that examination of the seven proposals of the Third Maritime Safety Package is accelerated.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on the issue of response, the Commission is also committed to continually strengthening the Community response instruments, such as the civil protection mechanism, to ensure a rapid and effective response should such disasters occur again in the future. This also involves cooperation with the EU’s neighbours such as the Black Sea countries and of course other third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Members for the debate and of course I will talk to my colleague about the interesting points you have made.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Christian Ehler, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on deposit-guarantee schemes (2007/2199(INI)) (A6-0448/2007).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-355" speaker_id="28226" name="Christian Ehler" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me pleasure to be able to present a report to you today that was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Before the vote in committee, the future of deposit-guarantee schemes was the subject of intense debate, particularly in the light of specific regional problems at the present time and of the recent crisis in the US property market.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the end of 2006 the Commission presented a communication reviewing the 1994 Directive on deposit-guarantee schemes. Before drafting the communication, the Commission conducted a consultation process. On the basis of the empirical findings that emerged, we can conclude that the aims of the directive have essentially been achieved and that there is no need for any legislative intervention at the present time.</p>
      <p sl="de">The increasingly cross-border nature of financial market structures in Europe, however, requires us to focus more sharply on the question of cooperation between the diverse deposit-guarantee schemes in Europe. In its communication, the Commission identified the areas in which self-regulation measures or different treatment of the legal bases could bring about further improvements in the interests of consumers.</p>
      <p sl="de">This approach should, in our view, be pursued further. We believe that the dynamic discussion process involving the Commission, the Member States and the EFDI, the European Forum of Deposit Insurers, has a very useful role to play in enabling us to adapt as quickly as possible to changing circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Nordea problem does not warrant calling for an expensive new amendment of the directive at the present moment. I am therefore grateful to the Commission for making it crystal-clear that the Nordea problem, which is essentially about the reimbursement of contributions, must be resolved by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Those who operate the deposit-guarantee schemes in the Scandinavian countries and the supervisory authorities there must decide for themselves whether contributions are to be reimbursed or whether deposit guarantees in those countries should be treated like insurance policies and not give rise to refund entitlements. That is a fundamental problem, but it is a fundamental problem for the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report can basically be divided into three parts. The first part is a discussion of the study undertaken by the Commission and the adoption of a position on its findings, such as the amount of the minimum guarantee. The second part addresses the question whether or not the diverse deposit-guarantee schemes in Europe cause unacceptable distortions of competition. The third part deals with future crisis and risk management.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the first part of my report I intend to be very brief, since it proved largely non-contentious and reflects the findings of the consultation process on deposit-guarantee schemes. I believe our statement on the minimum coverage level, which should be adjusted for inflation when the directive is next revised, strikes a balance between the interests of the new Member States and those of the older ones. I should like to emphasise that every Member State and every deposit guarantor already has the option of exceeding the European minimum when guaranteeing deposits.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another important point that is reflected in the report is the examination of the question whether the diverse deposit-guarantee systems and the various methods used to fund them are distorting competition. The Commission has set out its views and presented a study which, if its recommendations were implemented, would result in a harmonisation of funding for individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">If Member States with ex post systems were now to be asked to carry out a complete restructuring of their deposit-guarantee schemes at great expense, it would be necessary to analyse whether the diversity of the schemes and the accompanying unacceptable and expensive market distortions are at all justifiable in the internal market. This has not yet been analysed, and such an analysis will be an important task for the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third part of the report examines risk and crisis management. The internal market and the increasing degree of cross-border interdependence require us to examine whether cross-border risk and crisis management works smoothly. There is an urgent need for in-depth discussions with all stakeholders. Long-standing issues such as the problem of free riders and the risk of moral hazard must be addressed in that context.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that empirical studies analysing crisis and risk management are imperative if we are to work out viable arrangements for burden-sharing in the event of cross-border crises and common methods for early risk detection or develop a system for the introduction of risk-based contributions. These studies should then determine the content of subsequent discussions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Against this background I also flatly reject the PSE amendment, which postulates existing market distortions although there is currently no evidence of these. We believe that the present process is the right approach.</p>

    <intervention id="3-356" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Charlie McCreevy" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would first like to warmly thank the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Christian Ehler, for supporting the policy set out in our communication.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully endorse your view that legislative proposals are not appropriate at this stage. Some issues can be improved through set regulation without major cost impacts and by working together with the European Forum of Deposit Insurers (EFDI). The recent financial turmoil provides evidence that maintaining deposits or confidence is crucial during a financial crisis. As to deposit guarantee schemes, two elements seem to be key – an appropriate coverage level and a short payout delay. If depositors know that their deposit will be covered and if they feel confident that the insured deposits will be reimbursed rapidly, there is no need for them to join any queue outside a bank.</p>
      <p sl="en">The existing directive has proven to be flexible and allows Member States to increase coverage according to their own economic situation. Member States may take immediate action if their coverage level proves to be inappropriate. The timely payout of insurer deposits can indeed be improved. According to the directive, reimbursements should normally not exceed three months, but this reflects the technology available back in 1994. This is why we have asked the EFDI to identify obstacles to a rapid payout.</p>
      <p sl="en">Depositors must also be made aware of the protection available to them. The existing information obligations in the directive are applied differently across Europe. Therefore, we have asked the EFDI to identify best practices to improve the dissemination of such information to depositors. With regard to cross-border crisis, I share Parliament’s view on the need to have clarity about burden-sharing and the interactions between all involved parties before such a crisis occurs. The ECOFIN conclusions of 9 October are clear on this point. I have noted the suggestion that the EFDI participate in general burden-sharing discussions. Let me underline that only very few schemes have powers which go beyond the mere reimbursement of depositors. Their funds will also only cover a fraction of the amounts involved in a larger cross-border crisis. Therefore, I am unable to support the suggestion to include the EFDI in general burden-sharing discussions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also stresses the importance of eliminating possible market distortions. As requested, we will examine this matter. However, currently we do not think that the high cost of fully harmonising the present regulatory framework, estimated at between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 4.5 billion, would be justified. Some level-playing-field issues are already being dealt with. For instance, we need to facilitate topping up, where a branch should be able to offer a level of protection in a host country that is higher than in its home country. However, sometimes, arrangements between schemes in different Member States have not worked in practice, and we support the EFDI’s efforts to achieve a voluntary model agreement. Some Member States already adjust the contributions through their schemes according to the individual risk of banks. We would like to assist interested Member States, as this would contribute towards a level playing field for banks with similar risk profiles.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, Europe needs deposit guarantee schemes that ensure depositor confidence in a financial crisis. With the envisaged improvements, I am confident that we will come closer to this objective.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-357" speaker_id="4258" name="Piia-Noora Kauppi" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, first I would like to thank everyone because this is a very timely issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know that ongoing financial turmoil has underlined the importance of cross-border crisis management, and the October ECOFIN decision to have more ex-ante coordination between Member States and, especially, supervisory regimes cannot be more welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">Banks are at the heart of the payment system and deal with the savings of ordinary consumers who are not financial professionals. Therefore, the proper functioning of the payment systems and clearing and settlement system is particularly sensitive. Many of the banks are functioning cross-border now. A scattered national regulatory framework is not adequate. Currently, not even the types of account falling under the deficit guarantee scheme’s requirements are the same in every Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not let this become a depositors’ problem. The rapporteur, Mr Ehler, has done good work in the report and showed a lot of willingness to compromise. In particular, the report rightly emphasises the importance of eliminating distortions of competition. As the Commissioner said, it is very important to guarantee a level playing field.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I regret that the report finally does not address the issue of ex-ante deposit guarantee (DG) schemes. While it has been argued by the Member States having ex-post DG systems that this is a problem specific to Scandinavia and Nordic markets, this is not. It is actually anti-competitive for the whole single market on a wider scale. In fact, most schemes in Europe are ex ante. If the rules of refundability and transferability of funds paid into such schemes are not harmonised, this distorts the choice between branch and subsidiary models in the host country, and this leads to distortion of competition. So it is very welcome that the Commission is studying this matter, analysing whether there are competition distortions and making possible future recommendations in this area, especially on refundability and transferability of ex ante deposit guarantees already paid in money.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I welcome the Commission initiative and Mr Ehler’s report but further work needs to be done.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I am grateful to the rapporteur for his text. For once, I would echo many of the comments made by Mrs Kauppi. We began working on this text back in the spring and I think that those of us who considered it very timely have been proved right by the events of the summer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What happened this summer raises questions about deposit-guarantee schemes. We simply cannot live with a system where many of the market players operate across a number of countries without deposit-guarantee arrangements that are at least harmonised or based on common principles, in the interests not only of competition by also of public confidence in market mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I was very struck as I travelled around during the summer – and not just in the Scandinavian countries – at how this question of deposit-guarantee systems was raised systematically and was considered crucially important. I know, of course, what the Commissioner will say: ‘If you were to put together all the European-level guarantee schemes, the total would still be no more than a drop in the ocean by comparison with the sums needed to tackle the crises.’ That is a poor argument when we need to reduce our handicap in terms of both competitiveness and confidence in market mechanisms, particularly because it has the effect of distorting business strategies, as companies suddenly find themselves forced to arbitrate, for the wrong reasons, between their various subsidiaries and branches.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the basis of all these arguments, I asked my group to support me. The group tabled an amendment calling on the Commission to work faster and to recognise what people expect of it: while they may not express their demand loud and specifically, in terms of a priority, they do need reassurance about how Europe’s financial markets work and how accurately they respond to events. A sound, European-level deposit-guarantee system is bound to make a contribution in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, I believe it is part of your task to assess the level of confidence or otherwise in the functioning of the financial markets at European level. It is hardly enough, I think, to sit back and await fresh research results. You need to take action to accelerate the response and enable us to progress on a more harmonised basis, with a better and more transparent understanding of deposit-guarantee schemes and how they operate in the European Union.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-359" speaker_id="28244" name="Wolf Klinz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, deposit-guarantee schemes have again been in the public spotlight in recent weeks. The case of Northern Rock, whose branches were inundated with hundreds of customers rushing to withdraw their savings, and the question of investor compensation in the event of the Bank’s collapse are still fresh in our minds.</p>
      <p sl="de">This illustrates all too well that the global integration of financial markets poses challenges for Europe too. The increase in cross-border consolidation in the banking sector raises questions about supervisory jurisdiction, the appropriate coverage level of deposit-guarantee schemes and cross-border cooperation between these schemes. As we know, the European minimum coverage level is set at EUR 20 000, but of course it is actually far higher in many Member States. The funding of the guarantee schemes, however, is a matter for the Member States, and the structures of the schemes are quite diverse.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason the following points need to be clarified, and clarified quickly: the extent to which deposit-guarantee schemes need to be harmonised, their funding and the proactive ex ante use of resources for damage prevention.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the case of cross-border institutions, attention focuses in the event of a crisis on the supervisory structure, particularly in the case of group supervision, and on burden-sharing. If a subsidiary is operating in a host Member State and belongs to that country’s deposit-guarantee scheme but is subject to the supervisory authority of the home Member State by virtue of the principle of group supervision, a gulf is created between the supervision system and the deposit-guarantee scheme, and that is surely unacceptable and contrary to the interests of investors.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do, however, support the line taken by the rapporteur. Before we resort to legislative measures, the Member States should first eliminate remaining weaknesses in their deposit-guarantee schemes. At the same time, the Commission, acting as quickly as possible, should conduct targeted studies of cross-border risk management and a detailed analysis of the ways in which the various schemes are funded. On the basis of its findings, serious consideration can be given to legislative measures at a later date if they are shown to be expedient and necessary.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for underlining the need for studies and analyses, but also concluding that, if there are distortions on the market, something has to be done in order to achieve a level playing field. I think it is important to conclude this from this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">If there are distortions, we can have different opinions – if they are there. But if they are there, something needs to be done. We need to do that because I think we all agree that we want more cross-border competition, and we also wish to secure the interests of the consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is relevant to discuss the difference between different systems, because if you have in some Member States ex-ante systems and in some Member States different ex-post systems, which in reality assumes that the state might bale out banks which cannot pay their customers, then you have a distortion.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is my opinion that, due to the differences in opinion we have, there is a distortion already. The distortion is even more serious if it is also based on the assumption that the state should help banks which are not able to pay their customers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think a good achievement with this report by Mr Ehler is that we have achieved that conclusion. I think it is important that the Commission respond to that in future actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We might have differences in opinion about how the state of play is today. But we do agree on the need for action to be taken if the studies to be done show that there are distortions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the rapporteur for that and also ask the Commissioner to respond to that with action.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Ehler for his work which comes ten years after the transposition of the 1994 Directive on deposit-guarantee schemes, in a period of financial upheaval when improvements to the European financial services market are under discussion.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is currently considerable disparity between the positions adopted by the Member States and there are important issues to resolve. Although the majority of the Member States apply the system based on an ex-ante fund, there are still significant disparities in the level of guarantees, the size of funds and their method of financing.</p>
      <p sl="es">To give two examples: the sum guaranteed is eight times higher in the most protective state than in the least protective state, and the guarantee fund in one state alone amounts to 40% of the European total. This situation creates a distortion of competition. The ex-post system threatens national and European financial stability in times of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">Cross-border banking groups are also experiencing problems. The consolidation of funds from different schemes poses practical difficulties. A concentration of guarantees in a single system can only be achieved through a proliferation of regulations and agreements between states, something which fragments the system and makes it more vulnerable to an unacceptable accumulation of risk. There are substantial questions marks over the aims of the deposit-guarantee scheme: harmonisation of levels of cover, risk-based contributions, utilisation of funds to provide liquidity, burden-sharing, handling of cross-border crises, liquidation of institutions and cooperation between authorities.</p>
      <p sl="es">Deposit-guarantee schemes should provide a risk-based safety net capable of protecting depositors, ensuring fair and effective competition, providing stability for the money markets and contributing to an equitable sharing of the burden in crisis situations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, extraction of all the possibilities from the existing framework should not stand in the way of a thorough and ambitious reform once the necessary studies have been carried out.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Colleagues, I note the fact that financial crises are not new prehomena; they are indicators of an asymmetry between the financial sector and the real economy. The mortgage crisis in the USA has recently made financial experts say that the economies and the financial markets are interrelated and a large-scale discussion is needed to improve risk management.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The idea in the Ehler draft resolution to assess and improve the precuationary and early warning measures of the European Union with a view to ensuring the stability of the financial martkets, and the issue of guaranteeing deposits as a traditional form of savings in my country Bulgaria is very timely indeed. In this context, I wish to emphasize that the responsibility of banks to carefully organize their porfolio and effectively manage the resources of their depositors is of paramount importance. Of course, the greater awareness of citizens of the ways to use flexible schemes, the diversification of deposit forms and the mechanisms such as deposit guarantee funds further build confidence and promote financial stability.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to thank Members for their contributions. In closing, I would like to make two key points.</p>
      <p sl="en">We do not believe that regulatory change is appropriate at the current time. The directive has stood the test of time well. It is able to adapt to changing circumstances. In the longer term it will be crucial from a financial stability perspective for the positive guarantee schemes to contribute to smooth crisis management in an increasingly pan-European banking environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any further steps towards more harmonised schemes in the European Union now depend therefore on the outcome of the wider work that is currently being conducted in the context of crisis management.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the problems raised by both Ms Kauppi and Mr Hökmark, the reimbursement of contributions to a bank that leaves the scheme, for whatever reason, is not covered by the existing directive and is therefore a matter for Member State legislation. Harmonisation at European level would require full harmonisation of the funding method.</p>

    <intervention id="3-367" speaker_id="28244" name="Wolf Klinz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, since the adoption of the UCITS Directive in 1985, European fund markets have experienced meteoric growth. The directive has since been updated twice to take account of new market developments, and further modernisation is right at the top of next year’s agenda.</p>
      <p sl="de">Not least among the sources of the Commission’s present reform project is the first resolution on asset management (Asset Management I) adopted by the European Parliament in April 2006, which set out the main elements of the reform package. I am grateful to the Commission for having adopted these recommendations and for its intention to have them implemented in a legislative instrument in the new year.</p>
      <p sl="de">The present draft resolution, entitled Asset Management II, is similarly designed to pave the way for future initiatives on the part of the Commission. To this end the draft provides for numerous measures which go beyond the content of next year’s planned revision package but which we deem necessary if the European funds industry is to become more competitive. The following are the main points:</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, the Commission should consider an extension of eligible assets to cover property funds and hedge funds. Both products help to diversify the risk exposure of portfolios and offer attractive returns on investment. Besides scope for adding these products to portfolios, consideration should also be given to a European depository passport, which would give private investors direct access to these products. We welcome the establishment by the Commission of an expert group on open real-estate funds (OREFs) and its decision to conduct a study on non-harmonised retail funds.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, not only retail investors but also professional providers and institutional investors should be able to benefit fully from a single European market. There has never been any scope for these groups, who can effectively do without the traditional consumer protection mechanisms, to operate across borders without very public notification procedures. A European private placement regime can remedy that situation. It must be designed in such a way that it does not restrict the existing schemes, some of which are very liberal, in individual Member States. In order to guarantee this flexibility, Parliament is proposing that the CESR, the Committee of European Securities Regulators, should formulate recommendations for the organisation of such a regime. The next step would then involve examining whether that was sufficient or whether there was a need for a universally binding directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, the range of investment products for retail investors is constantly increasing, but the available product information does not permit comparison of the relative merits of products. This is due in part to the highly fragmented legal framework in Europe. If individual investors are to make informed decisions, however, information requirements and disclosure obligations must establish some degree of comparability between competing products. The various industries should be able to compete on a level playing field under the same rules. For this reason we call on the Commission to review the existing legal frameworks for the various product categories and to present proposals as to how the situation can be improved.</p>
      <p sl="de">The aim is not to make products fully comparable. Life assurance policies, certificates and funds differ intrinsically in their legal status and structure. The aim is rather to establish equivalent information requirements. Even maximum transparency, however, will count for nothing if investors do not possess at least a minimum level of knowledge about diverse financial products and the way they work. It is therefore the responsibility of the Member States to encourage education initiatives in this domain.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, investors should be able to benefit not only from a wide range of products but also from low costs. At the present time, however, the European fund landscape is extremely fragmented, which breeds relative inefficiency and excessive costs, especially by comparison with competitor countries. The Commission is planning to create a legal framework next year for fund mergers. That is to be welcomed. The Commission, however, is disregarding one of the main obstacles to cross-border mergers, namely taxation. We therefore call for cross-border mergers to be treated in exactly the same way as national mergers for tax purposes; in other words, they should not create any additional tax liability for investors. We are not asking for any measures to be taken on tax rates or the like. We are merely asking for cross-border mergers not to be treated differently from domestic mergers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fifthly, Parliament will produce a separate report assessing the potential utility of a European legal framework for hedge funds and private equity. The Commission, however, should prepare itself to engage actively in the international discussions on these matters.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, I should like to thank my fellow committee members, especially the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups, for their close cooperation. I hope that the Commission, as it did the first time, will again embrace our proposals so that we can make the opportunities of the single European market fully available to both investors and the fund industry.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to commend the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for taking the initiative to elaborate an own-initiative report, and for the hard work put into that report. I would like to take this opportunity also to thank the European Parliament for its valuable contribution to the asset management debate. Parliament’s previous report on asset management was also an excellent contribution to our work on the UCITS Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">A long process of analysis and consultation has, we believe, succeeded in building a strong consensus on what needs to be done and how. We should not overload our agenda, but we are not blind to other issues and problems. Today’s report testifies to the wide range of other issues confronting the European funds industry. We have already started work in many of the areas highlighted in the present report. The aim is to build a robust body of evidence on which to base future decisions. We are glad to see that a careful impact-assessment-driven process is endorsed by Parliament. We strongly believe in that approach in the Commission. It would ensure that future initiatives respond to real needs and provide effective solutions. We are also applying this approach in our work on private placement. By May 2008, we plan to present a Commission communication assessing the need for, and the feasibility of, the European private placement regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report before us today calls for speedy solutions to facilitate the cross-border passporting of retail non-harmonised funds. We are also looking carefully at this important issue, and will report to the Council and Parliament in autumn 2008. We hope that this report will bring some empirical basis to this complex discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sometimes, listening to this debate, we might have the impression that solutions are identified before a problem has been properly specified. We would caution against rushing to further enlarge the EU retail fund framework. UCITS 3 already permits a wide range of innovative strategies, including some types of alternative investment. We need to be clear about what is currently possible, and on whether risk management controls across the industry are up to scratch, before contemplating further enlargement of the retail fund framework. We understand the European funds industry’s desire to explore its lead in innovation and financial creativity, but not at the price of investor confidence in the UCITS brand.</p>
      <p sl="en">We acknowledge the concerns raised in the report with regard to the divergent regulatory requirements applicable to the distribution of substitute products, and stress that the Commission has an open mind on whether there is a substantive issue that needs to be tackled. Responses to the call for evidence launched in October will allow us to assess whether the existing regulatory patchwork results in a real and significant risk of investor detriment. In the light of responses and further follow-up work, the Commission will issue a communication in autumn 2008 on the need for EU-level action.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the report’s acknowledgement of the positive contribution that hedge funds provide to the functioning of markets and corporate efficiency. Some recent industry-led initiatives to develop voluntary standards on best practices are a welcome and proportionate response to the demands for greater disclosure. We appreciate that Parliament also considers that international responses are needed in these highly globalised businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">In summary, a lot has been achieved in the area of asset management. There is a long road ahead. New challenges constantly appear in this fast-moving business. However, we will do ourselves no favours by rushing into hasty and ill-prepared responses. We are glad to see that the Commission has, in Parliament, a valuable partner working towards the same goal, which is an integrated and efficient European fund market delivering for both industry and investors alike.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, in relation to this important own-initiative report on the Commission White Paper on investment funds, our position is that we have decided by general agreement to focus on the non-legislative aspects, given that the legislative proposal for revision of the UCITS III Directive will be tabled in early 2008. That said, the issues we have decided to address are vitally important to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is a risk that extending the range of eligible assets to include open property funds and alternative funds could mar the excellent worldwide reputation of UCITS products and negatively affect their distribution both within the European Union and to third countries. To avoid any detriment to the investment fund industry in Europe, Parliament has asked the Commission to conduct an in-depth study of the possible consequences of including these non-harmonised retail funds among the assets eligible for branding as UCITS.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Investments in UCITS total thousands of billions of euros and account for around 80% of the investment fund market in Europe. The sector is impatiently awaiting revision of the UCITS Directive. To prevent any unnecessary and counter-productive delay with that revision, however, Parliament has clearly proposed that no extension of eligible assets should take place until legislative reform of the UCITS Directive is complete. On behalf of my group, I have consistently urged that line and I welcome the rapporteur’s readiness to compromise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report also calls for the creation of a harmonised framework for private placements within the Union, and I fully support its recommendations on that point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The private placement regime needs to be based on an accurate definition of qualified investors, as provided for in the MiFID Directive. Properly informed and qualified investors eligible to practise private placement should not, under any circumstances, face a bureaucratic surcharge as a result of rules that are not only unnecessary but actually counterproductive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have to oppose the Socialists’ amendment calling for equivalence between Member States’ systems of regulation and supervision in the context of applying the private placement regime, which would entail permitting reciprocal access to markets. This kind of equivalence across Europe is simply unrealistic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must also highlight one point on which my group and I disagree with the rapporteur. It concerns paragraph 19 on the question of so-called ‘guarantee funds’. The very concept of these funds is controversial and we tried to protest at the mistaken definition of them. I hope we shall manage to lose that paragraph. I must nonetheless congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work, which enables us to prepare properly for the legislative proposal. It means we can now look forward with equanimity to the work that lies ahead next year.</p>

    <intervention id="3-370" speaker_id="2286" name="Harald Ettl" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, may I say to Astrid that she should not always assume that Socialist motions will be untenable. Let me begin by warmly thanking the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for his balanced report. I must tell the Commissioner that he need not always be so wary of overloading the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is against the backdrop of the US financial and mortgage crisis that we are now dealing with the report on asset management. Not even the European Central Bank is able to assess the full extent of the damage this crisis has caused to the European financial system and to European banks. And there may – indeed there will – be more to come. The global financial market is already so closely intertwined that there was no way of protecting the Union from such speculative escapades, for which all of us must ultimately carry the can. Greedy bank executives, focused solely on shareholder value, still enjoy celebrity status, and the US rating agencies continue to do a roaring trade and to lead us up the garden path. Knee-jerk legislation, however, is never warranted. Nevertheless, there is a lot to be done in this field, and the Commission cannot leave the issue to resolve itself and let the market be.</p>
      <p sl="de">One message I wish to highlight from the report is that more information and transparency lead to more consumer protection and greater consumer security. That is a very sound starting point. Another good thing is that the report refers to hedge funds and private equity, because more and more asset managers are investing in alternative investment products. Hedge funds, open real-estate funds and other retail products should therefore be included in the UCITS III Directive – a task that still lies ahead.</p>
      <p sl="de">To my mind the very concept of asset management implies steady development, whether through investment certificates, pension funds, life assurance companies, banks or private asset management. Since 2003 we have had a directive on insider dealing and market manipulation. Its implementation has been totally inadequate. The fund industry in particular is always citing costly overregulation and refuses to extend its transparency and liability rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we need here, Commissioner, is a clearly structured system that provides legal certainty. I am pleased that my proposal for an improved corporate governance clause has been accepted but regret the rejection of my motion on EU supervision of financial markets. We could and probably must think a bit further in this direction too, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is nevertheless gratifying that a cross-party compromise was reached on the issue of guaranteed funds. When all is said and done, we should and must make every effort to ensure that speculation by asset managers is restricted and that Parliament, the Commission and the Council do not distinguish themselves by collective inertia. Commissioner, that was addressed to you. Go to it, and do it well!</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to point out that this report, though well-balanced and generally acceptable, does not in fact reflect true reality. The problem is that most of the financial institutions, as appears to be the case, judging from the data supplied, are not adhering to the rules and regulations we have recommended.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The main problem appears to be the abuse of the discrepancies occurring in these regulations. For this reason we must examine the report in the context of the other reports and documents, like MiFID, with the aim of finding some kind of compatibility. Another point that I would that like to highlight is that I support Mrs Lulling’s opinion: UCITS is a good name, and we therefore need to be very careful about including new products in the portfolio.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Why is that? Because we do not know what these products are like. I am very sorry, but in this document, as well as in the Commission’s proposal, the portfolios and interests of a retail investor and an institutional, professional investor appear to be slightly jumbled. Retail investors should have clear definitions and regulations. However, when we have both UCITS and alternative investment funds, the reality is that in my country, for example, they are mixed together and presented to the retail investor, who then does not understand what he is investing in.</p>
      <p sl="lt">That is why we must have clearer definitions and a document that is structured unequivocally. I do hope that next year the Commission will produce a document that is structured more clearly. We really must protect retail investors. Of course, private investors should have more rights, but these should be defined separately. We should not advise people to invest in alternative funds that have not even been defined. In my country any fund is branded alternative at present.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for his own-initiative report and also for taking on board all the proposals and opinions of the other groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">Harmonising the environment for asset management and products on the fund market can bring huge benefits to the European economy, as proven also by the 1985 UCITS Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UCITS Directive has become a huge brand globally. It sells well abroad. UCITS represent the basis for a robust fund market in Europe and they make the economy more buoyant through increased stability and the productive reinvestment of savings.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the topic of this report is not the UCITS revision, which is forthcoming and which we welcome. The report addresses, instead, non-harmonised retail funds that are outside the scope of UCITS, calling for a number of important measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would particularly like to welcome the private placement regime, which was also mentioned by the Commissioner. Initiative is very instrumental in achieving the European market in non-harmonised funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, fee transparency is a long-due and underrated feature for increasing investor information. Other measures in the report go in the right direction as well, removing market distortions.</p>
      <p sl="en">However – and coming back to UCITS’ success – we must not get greedy here or mix things up hastily. I am, of course, referring to the debate on extending UCITS’ scope to new asset classes such as open-ended real estate funds or funds of hedge funds. I do not think the time is right now to discuss these sensitive matters. We might end up with a more rigid regime, and we would probably find ourselves in a different financial market environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also think it is very important to discuss the role of guaranteed funds. There is no such thing as a guaranteed fund. Our group wanted to have some flexibility. We do not think that having a capital adequacy regime for funds solves the problem. Guaranteed funds do not exist, and this kind of definition should be removed from the regime. That is why we have both put forward a proposal from the PPE-DE Group.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-373" speaker_id="1985" name="Pervenche Berès" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his text. The issues it tackles are recurring ones. For example, what exactly divides institutional and professional investors from private investors? Some people would have us think there is a sort of ‘Great Wall of China’ between the two. I am unconvinced, and recent events have shown the extent to which financial innovation spreads from one category of investor to another, right down to the individual saver. The fiction that we can design legislation entirely around the existence of two types of investor – enlightened, professional investors on the one hand and small savers on the other – is, in my view, a dangerous one. We are well aware of the gradual slippage of investment products. The notion of two kinds of investor is all very well but we need to recognise very clearly how we apply it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second question I would like to raise – which is also reflected in other texts concerning the financial markets – is about information for investors. This is obviously of key importance, yet we are starting from scratch because the complexity of financial innovation is something new that has not yet been properly acknowledged or confronted. To leave it at that, however, is not good enough: there is no substitute for responsibility on the part of those engaged in product placement and we need to remember that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, Commissioner, I have to say that I think you slipped up with regard to the connection between implementation of the MiFID Directive and the UCITS Directive. Does it make sense for the MiFID Directive to be implemented in the Member States before we even know how it will relate to the UCITS Directive? I think the current situation would be more balanced had we had proceeded otherwise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to taxation, the rapporteur has mentioned the implications for fund mergers. I think we also need to bear in mind the implications for product placement, which could be complicated by obstacles of a purely fiscal nature.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to say something about the Socialists’ amendment because the reality of the market in these products differs between countries that produce them, countries that buy them and countries that both produce and buy them. We have introduced the concept of reciprocity, which would apply not only to opening markets and to market access but also to the nature of regulatory provision and supervision. I think these elements are essential because the idea of a non-EU country which only produced these products having access to our markets on any sort of terms simply because we had access to its market (which might well be of no interest to European consumers) seems either unrealistic or purely theoretical and I cannot accept it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The rapporteur has suggested more than once that reciprocity would be in breach of WTO rules. But Commissioner, I ask you: what did we do when we recognised equivalence rules with the United States? That is precisely the approach we are asking you to take here. It is also suggested that the concept is unrealistic because we do not have harmonisation inside the European Union. If, however, negotiating equivalence with third countries encouraged us to establish a common standard of regulation and supervision inside the Union, would that not constitute substantial progress?</p>

    <intervention id="3-374" speaker_id="28138" name="Zsolt László Becsey" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="hu">Thank you, Madam President. I hope I will be brief. As an Easterner, from an area that is poor in capital, I am not enraptured by the fact that everyone is now biting their nails to see what will happen with hedge funds or private equity when the UCITS is extended because this does not affect our own region at all, or at least will not for a good few years. Perhaps we will even experience something of this from the human side with property funds. But I would perhaps emphasise what I might expect from the audit, as an Easterner. One thing is that the banks, which very often operate as distributors within this mechanism and receive very large sums, should nevertheless be examined for some reason, since the sale cost currently accounts for 60% of total costs, and I note that in my region the banks are unbelievably profitable in this way. If we achieve something in this, we have taken a step forward.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The second thing is that the case of the MiFID inducement has also not said very much for transparency of costs since, for example, if a bank has the fund manager and the seller, we do not know what is going on in the in-house deal, and interestingly not even such in-house deals have been able to break down the different sale prices.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Thirdly, however, some Member States are doing a great deal or implementing provisions that virtually ensure that the custodian, the fund manager and their management keep their feet on the ground. In my country, or our countries, there are very many capable young people, and they are able to perform management activities, for example, at a good price and to very high quality, if they can, and I feel that relocation is in everyone’s interests with a view to them coming onto the free market.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Finally, consumer protection. I acknowledge that training really is very important, but alongside it we must highlight tax matters. It cannot be that if I want to take out UCITS in another country, I will end up in a worse situation than if I did it in my own country. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Klinz for this report. The European fund industry has made some big strides in recent years, and the UCITS Directive has been instrumental in this. But, while the fund industry has experienced rapid growth, it has much more potential. This potential can be unleashed through increased competition and mobility in the industry across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to make some observations about the report. I can see merit in the recommendation to extend the scope of UCITS to invest in open-ended real estate funds and funds of hedge funds, but this should be dealt with, in my opinion, in a separate directive or legislative instrument. I also see merit in proposals to enhance the EU private placement regime and agree that the definition of eligible investors is crucial. It is important to note that, while the definitions contained in the MiFID and the Prospectus Directive offer a good starting point, there may be some additional issues which might also need to be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to investment policy and risk management, I want to remind the Parliament that, while CESR is conducting a review of how the risk management process requirements of the UCITS Directive are implemented across Member States, it is not CESR’s intention to harmonise these requirements. Certain key areas where divergent practices exist could be explored with the objective of a more harmonised approach. Guaranteed funds should be backed by capital advocacy requirements and this should be addressed by only allowing funds to be called guaranteed if they are backed by an adequate guarantee arrangement. I have concerns regarding any call for a depository passport that would result in the depository being established in a different state from that of the UCITS. This would create a regulatory gap because a UCITS and its depository would be subject to separate regulatory regimes, and complex legal issues might arise in the event of difficulties within the UCITS.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thank my colleague for this report, which is a very useful one, and I hope that the Commissioner will be able to respond to the points I have raised.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament and, particularly, the rapporteur, Mr Adamou, for the continuous and constructive cooperation as well as the support in reaching this very important cooperation agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The establishment of the Agency for Fundamental Rights was a big success for the promotion and respect of fundamental rights in the European Union. It is also a success in terms of interinstitutional cooperation. I have always been committed to ensuring that this important initiative is fully supported by the three institutions. Smooth cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe is crucial for ensuring the success of the Agency.</p>
      <p sl="en">The draft Council decision reflects this objective. It represents the genuine will of the two organisations to work together, and I am delighted to see that the negotiations for the agreement have been swift and made in a very constructive way by both parties.</p>
      <p sl="en">This important agreement will enable the Agency to work to the best of its capabilities. Indeed, in order to be fully operational, a number of measures have already been taken, and some are still in the pipeline. This agreement will help foster a comprehensive cooperation framework. It will help to provide a structure platform for both bodies, making mutual dialogue and common action both more possible and more efficient.</p>
      <p sl="en">It will also help avoid the duplication of work between the two bodies. The agreement provides for regular contacts and meetings between officials of the Agency and the Council of Europe, as well as for the regular exchange of information. The appointment of an independent person to sit on the management and executive boards of the Agency fosters an exchange of views and cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, fellow Members, I would like to begin by expressing my satisfaction at the excellent cooperation so far, between the European Union’s Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe, especially in achieving an agreement with which both sides are satisfied. I hope their future cooperation will continue smoothly on the same basis.</p>
      <p sl="el">Despite the prolonged discussions and consultations with the shadow rapporteurs on the substantial content of the report, we were informed by the Tabling Office that under Rules 83 (7) and 51 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, it was not possible to amend the text of the Agreement and, in respect of the report itself, only procedural amendments would be admissible, a circumstance which led a number of members of the LIBE Committee to give their vote for the report under protest. My report therefore simply approves the conclusion of the Agreement between the Council of Europe and the Agency for Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="el">The EU’s system of principles for the protection of fundamental rights has been developed mainly through the case law of the European Court of Justice and confirmed by the express recognition contained in the EU treaties. However, it is particularly important to ensure that this system of human rights protection is further strengthened whilst safeguarding basic principles such as non-discrimination, non-exclusion, respect for freedom of expression and religion, freedom of conscience, and social and economic rights.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Agency for Fundamental Rights could provide the relevant institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Community and its Member States with these safeguards during the implementation of Community law. It is important to recognise that it is the Council of Europe that has developed, through its advanced work in this field, a comprehensive system of norms and legal and judicial instruments for the protection and promotion of human rights and the rule of law and has gathered extensive experience. Therefore, the common aim of protection of fundamental rights, shared by the Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe, has to be achieved in a significant and positive manner, avoiding duplication and any risk of fragility in the well-established judicial and non-judicial system put in place by the Council of Europe for the protection of human rights and individual rights. We must take care to ensure that there is no challenge to the legal precedent and the substantial content of human rights protection as established by the Council of Europe, an organisation with 47 member states.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would also like to emphasise that any dangers of duplication of powers and procedures must be countered to avoid confusion as regards the aims and responsibilities of the two bodies, so that we can achieve harmonious cooperation between them. This must be reflected, above all, in the Agency’s annual work programme, and in the strengthening of cohesion and complementarity between the two institutions.</p>
      <p sl="el">As regards the exchange of information between the Council of Europe and the Agency for Fundamental Rights, it is of the utmost importance, as far as possible, that such exchange should take place under conditions of absolute confidentiality observed on both sides. The Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe should agree on more precise rules regarding the implementation of Article 15 of the Agreement, which provides for grants to be received by the Council of Europe from the Agency, with the aim of achieving full transparency and avoiding any insinuation of excessive interdependence between the two institutions.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is also essential to implement Article 7 of the Agreement in a way which will allow the two institutions to exchange, by mutual consent, as much information as possible, with due regard to their rules of procedure, as far as this is possible under the confidentiality rules in force. This information should not be used by institutions other than those directly involved in the examination of the issues at stake, nor should it be made available to institutions or agencies of third countries, in the absence of guarantees and controls regarding its use.</p>
      <p sl="el">As I have said, the cooperation between the Commission and the Council of Europe during the negotiations for the Agreement has proved fruitful, and it is expected that the two institutions will continue in future to work efficiently together, in the same spirit of cooperation, transparency and complementarily. However, it is enormously important that the European Parliament should participate in this process, through periodic reports, and that the Council of Europe should be called on to state its opinion on all the surveys and assessments carried out, with a view to complementarity, non-duplication of work, and the transparency of the operations of the two institutions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I am glad to speak today as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group concerning this report on the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the Council of Europe on cooperation between the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have had long debates and a lot of questions whether there is a need for an Agency; whether the Council of Europe can accept this; whether there will be real, useful cooperation between the two.</p>
      <p sl="de">All the time both Parliament and the Commission said clearly: yes, we need the Agency, we see the sense of this institution and we foresee good cooperation between the Council of Europe and the Agency.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore I welcome the fact that, now this Agreement is here, we can talk about institutionalised cooperation. On the other hand, I am sorry that we could not really improve this text by amending certain aspects, because I would have underlined the need to take into account, whenever the Agency is dealing with concrete issues, all the experience, the expertise, gathered by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, with its reporting system in its various committees, for example in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights where there is excellent expertise and experience in dealing with these issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">But nevertheless I am glad, because the conclusion of this Agreement is signalling the need for this body, for the Agency, to start its work as soon as possible. The Agency was officially inaugurated on 1 March but it still does not have its operating and management structure in place. It is imperative to proceed and improve the situation so as to go further.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have been following this dossier since the very beginning of my mandate, noting the extreme difficulties of designing its scope, area of competence and decision-making structures to the satisfaction of all actors involved.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are all concerned since the Agency will gather and compile data and prepare recommendations to the institutions in the field, a remit that is hard to define in its boundaries, which is horizontal and which cross-cuts all Community policies.</p>
      <p sl="de">We can only be satisfied if we create a credible and responsible Agency that is entrusted with enough power and an adequate budget to cope with its task. This Agreement can help this.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will ensure that any overlap of these tasks and duplication of work is avoided. Let us hope that the solemn proclamation of the Charter on Fundamental Rights today will stand as one side and the Agency will stand as the other side of the same coin: a first practical step towards a future Union policy on human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, what we are discussing today is an atypical procedure, as the European Parliament is pronouncing on the advisability of a cooperation agreement between the European Union and the Council of Europe. We have no opportunity to intervene in this agreement: we are simply assessing it and giving our opinion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Council of Europe is the oldest European organisation concerned with human rights and the promotion of democracy. No one here needs reminding that cooperation between the Council of Europe and the European Union − and previously the European Communities – has existed since the beginning. Accession to membership by a state wishing to join the European Union is conditional upon respect for values that are inscribed in the Statute of the Council of Europe: the rule of law, democracy and, above all, respect for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is thus good that these two institutions, the European Communities − now the European Union − and the Council of Europe, should cooperate, not only by sitting side by side in Strasbourg but by engaging in common fields of action. The agreement we are discussing today is neither highly original nor new, just as the Agency for Fundamental Rights is not an entirely new institution.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As we know, the Agency for Fundamental Rights replaced the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, based in Vienna, and the Centre had a similar cooperation agreement with the Council of Europe. That agreement, concluded in 1999, respected both sides and was in force to the present time, i.e. to the moment when the Centre was replaced by the Agency for Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, since a new EU body is involved, we must examine the new agreement on cooperation with the Council of Europe to ensure that what appear to be two similar institutions do not compete with each other but cooperate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have to say that the agreement was negotiated quickly but well. We have no great reservations concerning its content, nor could we have. It establishes a framework for cooperation, provides for regular contacts and, most importantly, creates personal links, since it provides for the Council of Europe to call upon an outside person – and a deputy for that person – sitting on the Agency’s management and executive boards. All of which inclines me to full support for the motion and acceptance of the agreement, which will serve both institutions well.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the opportunity to speak. The report deals with possible conflicts of interest between the European Fundamental Rights Agency and the Council of Europe. In my view, this issue is secondary. The real difficulty arises between the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Both these Courts have the authority to act in the area of breaches of human rights and there are some rulings where the two bodies contradict each other. The majority of these cases relate to Articles 6 and 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and concern proceedings on infringements of competition rules, such as the cases involving National Panasonic, Hoechst AG, Niemetz, etc.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Finally, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, endorsed by the European Union, are two similar yet distinct documents. The European Fundamental Rights Agency’s competences focus on monitoring and support. The Agreement concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which will clarify individual competences, is therefore to be welcomed. The fact that the Council of Europe will have a representative on the Management Board is also to be welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As the Agency’s competences are limited, I believe that its activities will complement rather than compete with those of the Council of Europe. In any case, we will have to continue debating this topic in the light of the changes to the legal status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, in recent months, four decisive steps have been taken by the European Union to promote and protect human rights. Firstly, the special Agency for Fundamental Rights has been set up. Secondly, a clause on the legally binding force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and a clause on the accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights of 1950 have been included in the Reform Treaty. Thirdly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been solemnly signed in Parliament today; with its formal proclamation, it becomes part of the European acquis. A modern code of human rights! Fourthly, the conclusion – which we are discussing today – of the agreement between the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe, signals exactly what the European Union stands for – the promotion of human rights – and shows that this element is fundamental to every modern society, to every modern state.</p>
      <p sl="el">We see no subordination, no duplication, no replacement of the role of the Council of Europe, which is secure in its place as an international guardian of human rights. On the contrary, a new phase of cooperation, not antagonism, has been initiated. I therefore agree with my compatriot, the rapporteur, on everything he has said on this issue, and fully endorse his report, and I congratulate him on this.</p>
      <p sl="el">I am an honorary member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which I feel to be an honour; but today I also feel great pride and joy because the two institutions, the European Union and the Council of Europe, are inaugurating their cooperation in this area, and I hope this century will earn its place in world history as the century of human rights.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna is yet another costly institution that, in addition, arrogates to itself the right to monitor and lecture the Member States on compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and other matters.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is hard to resist the impression that European taxpayers’ money is being given over to yet another agenda for strengthening the authorities in Brussels and the emerging Eurostate. The Council of Europe and the OSCE are existing institutions that deal with the same matters at international, not supranational, level. What we are seeing is a duplication of already existing institutions that increases the powers of the European Union and the EU bureaucracy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The countries of Europe – including my own country, Poland – are obliged to protect and promote human rights by complying, inter alia, with the European Convention on Human Rights.

      <p sl="ro">Ladies and Gentlemen, this plenary session was marked by various European actions in the field of human rights, as well as by the possibility to achieve their assessment for the year 2007.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, with the creation of the Agency for Fundamental Rights and the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the decision to conclude a cooperation agreement between the above-mentioned agency and the Council of Europe is part of the European Union's efforts to consolidate its performance and role of human rights promoter, both internally and externally. I would like to point out two aspects I believe important in this field.</p>
      <p sl="ro">First of all, I welcome the intention to achieve a double objective by this agreement, namely, on the one hand, the efficiency and consolidation of the European policy in the field of human rights and coherence and avoidance of duplication, on the other hand. This is the only way in which we will be able to continue to promote the respect of the fundamental principles established by the European Convention for Human Rights and supplemented by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, including by consolidating our own mechanisms for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Secondly, I welcome the intention to consolidate cooperation in the specific human rights protection projects launched by the Council of Europe. This type of interaction will allow us to further contribute to improving the human rights situation, acting in specific cases, both internally and externally. I would like to draw attention to the fact that such cooperation should be promoted especially in the European countries bordering the European Union, in order to create a true area of democracy at the external border of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As rapporteur on the Black Sea regional cooperation, I ask the European institutions to support the regional cooperation projects. I consider the initiative to create a Black Sea Euroregion for promoting democracy at regional level, which was launched by the Council of Europe, a good starting point in this direction and I invite the Commission to manifest its entire support for their success.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Genowefa Grabowska, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation on international jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations (COM(2005)0649 - C6-0079/2006 - 2005/0259(CNS)) (A6-0468/2007).</p>

    <intervention id="3-391" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Franco Frattini" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, the proposed instrument on maintenance obligations seeks to improve the precarious situation of people who depend on maintenance to meet their everyday needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the European Union, where people are increasingly mobile, maintenance creditors – especially children – should not face obstacles to recover money due to them, particularly when the debtor, such as a parent, leaves or has moved abroad.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Ms Grabowska, as rapporteur, for the efforts she has made to give a voice to stakeholders such as non-governmental organisations assisting maintenance creditors during the very important public hearing on 11 September.</p>
      <p sl="en">We generally welcome Ms Grabowska’s report, which supports the proposal in its essential elements.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have just a few remarks on some proposed amendments. First of all, on the legal basis. We are of the opinion that the current instrument relates to family law. However, I understand Parliament’s concerns, given the existing legal context. That is why we have invited the Council, in a communication adopted at the same time as the proposed regulation, to decide – in accordance with Article 67(2) of the Treaty – that the present instrument be adopted according to the codecision procedure. That is my opinion, and I will continue to ask Council to act on this invitation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the other amendments on the rules on applicable law. Last month, negotiations on a worldwide convention on maintenance obligations were finalised successfully at the Hague Conference on Private International Law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given the satisfactory results of the Convention and the accompanying protocol on applicable law, the Community and its Member States would like to adhere to those international rules. Consequently, the rules of the regulation and related amendments proposed should be revised in order to ensure consistency with the international rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report proposes allowing the courts to apply their own law when cases come before them and when this would accelerate the resolution of the dispute. While we recognise the concern to speed up litigation, we believe that the proposed solution does not allow for sufficient legal certainty, and there is the danger that it would not serve the interest of maintenance creditors, who should be protected by application of the same substantive law, regardless of which court is considering the case.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Parliament is now voting on its report. An international legal context has become clear. I strongly hope this project will be resumed at full speed in 2008. I very much trust that the Council will give it the highest priority in the coming months.</p>

    <intervention id="3-393" speaker_id="23717" name="Genowefa Grabowska" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, let me begin by expressing my thanks. I want to thank the European Commission very much for its excellent cooperation at working level. I also thank the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the shadow rapporteurs, especially the Committee on Legal Affairs and Diana Wallis, who drafted its opinion, for their truly excellent cooperation. Mrs Wallis took on the heavy burden of convincing the Commission of the need for amendments to the legal basis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should perhaps start with the legal basis, given that the proposed resolution was referred to us under a procedure that is not acceptable to Parliament. We wanted the regulation to be adopted according to the codecision procedure, rather than the consultation procedure. I was therefore pleased to hear what the Commissioner told us, and I am aware of the Communication to the Council inviting it to give us that opportunity. I would add only one thing to what the Commissioner said.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I do not question the fact that the maintenance relationship arises out of family law. I would argue, however, that, taken as a whole, the maintenance relationship has a mixed character. The fact that it originates in family law does not mean that it remains within those bounds. It has consequences for the common market and the economic situation of both parties, i.e. that of the maintenance creditor and that of the debtor. We are accordingly entitled to extract the maintenance relationship from its origin in family law and associate the execution of maintenance obligations, not with family law, but with areas in which this Parliament holds itself competent, namely the common market, family care and human rights. In which case, it seems to me, there should be no difficulty in changing the procedure.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore consider that this proposal warrants not only Council’s attention but acceptance by Council. In preparing this regulation we held hearings that were, in truth, one uninterrupted lament. Women, mainly, told us of the difficult situation in which they find themselves when they try to enforce maintenance payments for children whose other parent lives in a different country and appears not very interested in raising his child or paying for its upbringing.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Many different tricks are employed. I shall not mention them all but confine myself to one example. It is enough to change a single letter of ones surname in order to disappear in Europe almost without trace, and the maintenance obligation vanishes along with the debtor. By means of this regulation we seek to ensure that no maintenance debtor in Europe feels safe in thinking that by leaving the country in which a child remains for whom maintenance is not paid, by moving away into the open European Union in which internal borders have been lifted – especially now when the new Member States will be joining the Schengen area in a few days’ time – he can take advantage of a situation that works in favour of a person who does not take responsibility for his family.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let me mention the two measures in the resolution that seem to me the most important and constitute an innovation. A maintenance order issued in the state in which the creditor normally resides will not have to be confirmed in the state in which the maintenance debtor is living. The regulation thus proposes abolishment of the ‘exequatur’ procedure. I realise this is something new, but if we want to ensure effective enforcement of maintenance obligations we must take that step. If we keep ‘exequatur’, the whole attempt to achieve effective enforcement falls by the wayside.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I realise we shall be respecting all the provisions adopted in the framework of the Hague Convention and Conference, but the international system grinds exceedingly slow, and the ratification of agreements in the sphere of private international law can take years. The European Union must go forward and ensure that children are provided for when their fathers or mothers forget about them. This regulation must therefore be implemented quickly for the good of the children. It not only takes care of the children but also protects the creditor. Therefore, thanking the Portuguese presidency for the work it put into preparation of the text, I place the matter in the hands of the Slovenian presidency in full confidence that it will see the text through to conclusion and that we shall obtain a good regulation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. − Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very positive statement. I should also like to thank Ms Grabowska for her wonderful cooperation on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is one of those proposals that could make Europe a reality for those we serve. It could add practical value at difficult times in their lives. I do not know how many times, as an elected MEP, I have been contacted by constituents who are having difficulties getting maintenance from somebody in another Member State. All too often, I have been unable to give a practical and positive answer.</p>
      <p sl="en">With this regulation, I hope that in most circumstances we would be able to do much better. The proposal potentially allows the EU to go much further than states can through the Hague Conference process, which has already been mentioned. We should indeed be able to go further. After all, we have encouraged our citizens to move freely across old national borders within the EU, and should be able to provide an answer, in the form of a good, simple, functioning justice system, when they hit rough times in their marriages or partnerships breaking down. Above all, we should be able to offer help to children suffering the financial consequences of marriage breakdown. This proposal would give us a simplified one-step process, instead of the current nightmare of applying in one court and then having to go through more or less the same process of enforcement in a foreign court. That is too much for people at vulnerable and desperate moments in their lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Legal Affairs Committee has been happy to endorse most of this proposal, whilst trying to make some technical improvements. In this respect I am very grateful to my colleague, Mr Casini. However, like the rapporteur, we cannot accept the choice of legal base. It should have been codecision, not consultation. I believe the Member States have been entirely unreasonable, both in terms of the content of the legislation, and as regards the implications for our citizens. I hope they will respond to the Commissioner’s appeal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Speaking on behalf of my Group, we do not want to see the effectiveness of this one-step system undermined. We must, of course, respect the rights of the defence – the judgement debtor – but this should apply to the originating court. We should not allow the re-opening of the case in the enforcing court, or we will destroy the very benefits we are seeking to deliver. We therefore want to see deletion of Article 33(a), and have grave doubts about amendment 61, which still leaves the door open too wide.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I want to make some comments as a UK Member of this Parliament. The UK opt-out or failure to opt in to this instrument is bad news for many EU nationals from other Member States now living in the UK, and is also bad news for many Brits whose partners move to another Member State. Indeed, there are all sorts of permutations where the opt-out will create chaos and confusion. People will be second-class citizens in respect of the justice system available to them.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, what I most regret is the failure of the British Government to appreciate the untenable position of British MEPs in these issues. Should we actually be working on, speaking on – and, more importantly, voting on –proposals on things that, as they currently stand, will have no application to those who elected us? Others are beginning to question the legitimacy of our position. These opt-outs are democratically untenable and destructive to the coherence of the EU civil justice system. Pick-and-mix, opt-in and opt-out merely hits those who are vulnerable and in most need of the law’s protection.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Grabowska, on her initiative in raising this issue and on the very positive view she has expressed this evening.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fellow Members, the round of consultations of the Hague Conference, which began seven years ago, is drawing to a close. The question arises: what progress has been made on the issue of mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments in international private law? Where is the declaration that the principle of mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments is the cornerstone of judicial and police cooperation in the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice? The answer is that no great progress has been made in this direction. The 2004 Hague Programme has not been promoted to the degree that was needed, despite the efforts and initiatives of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Frattini.</p>
      <p sl="el">Unfortunately, the misuse of appeals to national sovereignty by some Member States is a hindrance to the harmonisation of the law, not only on substantive matters, but also on questions of procedure. These general observations do not, of course, negate the value and significance of the proposal we are discussing. On the contrary, they underline the need to adopt further proposals for Council regulations, covering the whole field of family law: divorce, separation, maintenance and property matters. Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 on recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility is in need of radical reform and modernisation. This need is indeed being addressed to a large extent with the proposal for the amending regulation, but unfortunately only on the question of maintenance. The differences in the substantive law of the Member States, under the vital heading of justice, remain. There is still a long way to go. Even so, where there is scope for convergence, this harmonisation of the law should be pushed forward.</p>
      <p sl="el">The amendments proposed by the European Parliament fill many of the gaps in the proposal and improve its content. Above all, they overcome many obstacles which hinder the enforcement of maintenance judgments anywhere in the European Union, and they limit the debtor parent’s or spouse’s scope for evading justice when he or she has moved from one EU Member State to another. Precisely this point is addressed by the amendment which I have tabled to Article 33a, in which I attempt, firstly, not to leave unlimited scope for non-enforcement of an order on grounds of a change of circumstances and, secondly, to allow latitude for dealing with the situation in this way when there are serious, really serious, pertinent circumstances which give the court precisely this right to revise its opinion.</p>

    <intervention id="3-397" speaker_id="28382" name="Andrzej Jan Szejna" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Genowefa Grabowska, most warmly for the work she has put into the regulation before us and her report. The splendid result does not surprise me, as Professor Grabowska is one of Poland’s leading experts on European law.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Bearing in mind that the number of divorces and separations in the European Union is rising, the problem of legal impediments to the recognition and enforcement of decisions on maintenance obligations is increasingly important. Furthermore, given the degree of integration of the Member States and the still large number of binding legal sources within the European Union, an advanced legal system is essential.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is no harmonised system in force in this field at European Union level at the present time. I am therefore in favour of the regulation, which contains highly pertinent proposals concerning the problems we are discussing. It should be noted that it is the outcome of a long-term programme of work, the Hague Programme for strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union. I agree that effective enforcement of maintenance obligations will improve the living conditions and education of many children who are first-line maintenance creditors. That is a very important matter for European socialists.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The proposed regulation not only tackles certain problems of modern society: it can also help improve the operation of the internal market, specifically by removing barriers to the free movement of persons who could suffer as a result of differences in Member States’ legislation on the execution of maintenance obligations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For the good of all citizens of the European Union, we must strive to achieve rapid and, if possible, cost-free execution of maintenance payments. At present, institutions must sometimes resort to drastic measures to enforce the payment of maintenance, while creditors often live in reduced circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also support the idea that court decisions should have the same force as they have in the Member State in which they were issued, without any additional formalities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would stress the need for greater involvement of the European Parliament in the adoption of decisions on matters of such importance for the future functioning of the European Union and the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the report we are examining is to eliminate most of the obstacles to the recovery of maintenance in Europe, making it possible to establish a legal context in keeping with the legitimate expectations of maintenance creditors.</p>
      <p sl="it">The most significant starting point is that in the vast majority of cases the maintenance creditor is the weaker party and therefore needs very vigorous protection, and it is evident that the main problem lies in the actual circumstances of maintenance debtors. However, it is advisable to do at least what is possible, i.e. to eliminate any unnecessary red tape and to make the applicable law certain, to establish a preference for the law of the place of residence of the creditor and to give immediate effect to the legal decision under which maintenance has to be paid, even in countries other than the country in which the decision has been given.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Committee on Legal Affairs, called upon to give an opinion under the enhanced cooperation procedure on jurisdiction, applicable law and enforcement of decisions in matters relating to maintenance obligations, has played an important role in the drafting of the text, achieving a major compromise agreement between the main political groups, for which I should like publicly to thank Mrs Wallis. The main aims of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs are to draw up a clear definition of maintenance obligations, extend the scope of application, protect the most vulnerable parties involved and simplify the proposed text.</p>
      <p sl="it">It has been necessary to draw up an unambiguous definition of maintenance obligations and to include in the scope of the regulation all orders relating to the payment of lump sums. Particular attention has been paid – as I have said – to the most vulnerable parties and, here, the text of the regulation needs to be further simplified. In conclusion, as my speaking time has come to a end, I am sure that the PPE-DE Group will give this decision its full support.</p>

    <intervention id="3-399" speaker_id="28301" name="Tadeusz Zwiefka" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the regrettable increase in marital breakdown, coupled with the growing mobility of people living in the European Union, is inevitably leading to an increase in the number of cross-border conflicts concerning maintenance claims. At the present time, in order to enforce a claim against a maintenance debtor living in another Member State it is necessary to apply to the judiciary of the state in which the decision is to be executed. Unfortunately, that does not always work, so there is clearly a real need to lay down detailed rules on jurisdiction in regard to maintenance claims.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The purpose of the draft resolution is to reduce the formal requirements for a court decision to be delivered in any Member State and to ensure its effective execution. Upon entry into force, the new regulation will enable an entitled person to obtain a binding enforcement order anywhere in the European Union. It will also simplify and unify the enforcement system. While welcoming the measures adopted by the Hague Conference, I fully agree with the rapporteur that the regulations applying in this matter in the European Union must be more progressive and more rapidly implemented.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The increasing mobility of EU citizens is leading to any increase in the number of marriages in which spouses are of different nationalities and live in different states, or live in a Member State of which neither is a national. Where an international couple decide to divorce, they may therefore invoke different laws. The broad subjective and objective scope of the regulation is justified by the frighteningly low rate of obtention of maintenance payments in certain EU Member States. In my own country, Poland, for example, the figure is just 10%.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The regulation will also enable the mother of an illegitimate child to claim from the child’s father payment of the costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth, as well as the costs of her upkeep during childbirth. At present such a claim is not recognised in many Member States as a claim for maintenance, which makes it considerably more difficult to pursue.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Before my country joined the European Union, more than one thousand claims for maintenance from abroad were lodged in the courts every year. As a result of the opening of borders, all forecasts predict a drastic rise in the number of such claims, both in Poland and in other countries. The opening of borders and labour markets may lead some fathers to run away from their maintenance obligations, and it is mainly the children who will suffer. This we cannot accept.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief. I would like to thank all those who have spoken, the rapporteur and Members who have taken part in this work. In forthcoming months, we shall, in my view, have three objectives before us and I hope that the Slovenian Presidency will be able to take them forward successfully.</p>
      <p sl="it">First: to convince the Council that if we feel it is useful to amend a legal base under Article 67 of the Treaty, we do so to give a better democratic basis to an initiative which objectively protects vulnerable groups of people, especially children following the breakdown of the family unit.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second objective is to ensure that creditors receive the same protection irrespective of the place at which the matter has been brought before the courts: it would be very odd if the so-called lex fori criterion led to a substantial variation in the protection afforded to creditors. Another essential objective is therefore to try to harmonise the rules.</p>
      <p sl="it">The third objective, where, in my view, work is needed, is that of actual enforcement: in too many cases we affirm the principle of protection of creditors in family matters, but then we do not ensure that it is enforced, or we allow the substance of the case to be reopened when a payment order should be made. That does not work in the case of maintenance; were it the case, the measure would be deprived of any meaning.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have drawn up fairly innovative proposals: temporarily freezing a proportion of the debtor’s bank account if the debtor does not want to pay, or a mandatory periodic payment order against the debtor’s assets for the sum that the debtor should pay. As you know, there has been dissent and opposition from the majority of the Member States in the Council because that is what really makes a difference for a regulation: either the measure can be genuinely enforced or it is pointless to continue to affirm the importance of protecting children or separated spouses who are maintenance creditors!</p>
      <p sl="it">We shall have to work on these three issues in the coming months and, clearly, in this case, more than in others, the Commission and Parliament are in agreement and we shall have to persuade the Council that this is the right road to take.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Thus has ensured the simplification of citizens’ lives, namely the recovery of child maintenance from the parent or other debtors when such persons reside in a different country to the child, implementation of one of the European fundamental rights, the right to private and family life and child protection, homogenization and simplification of the European legal norms on the entire EU territory and construction of the European space of freedom, security, justice and facilitation of internal market operation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the courts notified should check the independent status and competence of legal consultancies and take into consideration the situation of the parties during the proceedings. The creditor of the maintenance obligation should benefit from the legal provisions in the country of residence, litigations in this field should be solved less expensively and searching for the most favourable jurisdiction should be avoided.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0501/2007) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 as regards the date of introduction of electronic identification for ovine and caprine animals (COM(2007)0710 – C6-0448/2007 – 2007/0244(CNS)).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as we all know, traceability is a key element of ensuring high standards in animal health and food safety.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have had recent experience with certain diseases in the European Union, such as foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue, which has once again shown the importance of efficient identification systems. Individual identification cannot function properly without electronic identification.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission was requested to confirm or amend, in its report, the date of implementation of electronic identification, not to question the principles of the regulation. That is why it is a technical report on the various methods and technology involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission report only focuses on the best way to implement electronic identification. However, in order to produce a report, we needed data and input from the Member States, and in particular those Member States already working on the system. The studies and trials necessary for the preparation of the report lasted much longer than was originally foreseen, which explains the delay in the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">We strongly appreciate and thank Parliament for agreeing to handle this matter as urgent. That will prevent a situation of legal uncertainty in January 2008.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report concludes that technical conditions for electronic identification of sheep and goats have been fulfilled, but that Member States need a reasonable time frame to prepare the implementation of electronic identification.</p>
      <p sl="en">We agree with, and accept, Parliament’s position to have a fixed date for introduction of the system. On the other hand, we cannot accept the other amendments proposed, which would call into question the very principles of the regulation, since the question now is what the actual date of implementation should be.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the speedy work he has done, and Parliament for agreeing to treat this matter as urgent.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-406" speaker_id="1040" name="Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Kyprianou, we have complied with the request to handle this matter swiftly. We are dealing here with something urgent, which is precisely why we are still here at this late hour.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question is, of course, how this urgent situation arose. You have said something about that. I had a look through the documentation and came across the very regulation that we want to amend today. It dates from 17 December 2003. That regulation prescribes that, with effect from 1 January 2008, ‘electronic identification according to the guidelines referred to in paragraph 1 [ …] shall be obligatory for all animals’. There are one or two exemption clauses, which I shall omit, and then it says, ‘The Commission shall submit to the Council, by 30 June 2006, a report on the implementation of the electronic identification scheme, accompanied by appropriate proposals, on which the Council shall vote by qualified majority’.</p>
      <p sl="de">In short, the matter lies very far back in the past. The Commission’s report to the Council was evidently never submitted, and there was no comeback from the Council. Are you signalling something? If you did submit the report, all the better, but then there was no response from the Member States. And then we got into this pickle, realising that the deadline could not be met. So far, so bad, but then you proposed that, instead of perhaps setting a new deadline, we should leave it to the comitology procedure to set the date. In other words, the setting of the deadline would be your decision. We should then have taken all this trouble for nothing, and so the committee decided that the provision on compulsory electronic tagging should enter into force on 31 December 2009 and be applicable from 1 January 2010, two years later than prescribed in the original regulation. Be that as it may, the important thing is that we have a date. The committee also said that a report should be submitted on this matter too.</p>
      <p sl="de">The problem with your proposal, of course, is that you are drawing more and more decision-making into the realm of comitology, just as you did with the old regulation of 17 December 2003, in which the provisions and application arrangements relating to the regime of electronic identification were delegated to the Commission through the comitology procedure. At that time there was also to be a report to the Council but no report to Parliament. As a result of this practice of subjecting everything to comitology, Parliament is divested of its decision-making rights and its powers of scrutiny, and so we only discover at some later date that obligations have not been honoured.</p>
      <p sl="de">If you had not come with these amendments now and requested urgent treatment because you were under pressure to meet the deadline, we should have thought that everything was alright. But things were not alright! That must be a warning to us in Parliament not to delegate too much to the Commission but to continue exercising our powers of scrutiny.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now there have been a couple of amendments. You said you could not accept them. The committee stipulated that the rules should be binding. That, in fact, is also laid down in the basic regulation, which, as we all know, is not being repealed but only amended. Now there are amendments tabled by you, Mr Stevenson, one of them jointly with Mrs McGuinness, which propose that the system be made voluntary. Well, if we make it voluntary, we might as well forget the whole thing. What would then be left to prescribe? We could resign ourselves to the fact that all cats are grey in the dark. I therefore believe that we must stick with compulsory rules and that these compulsory rules must include a date and a report to the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">It will be a lesson to us that this report has made us stumble more or less by chance across this truly unusual way of proceeding on the part of the Commission and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope, Mr Kyprianou, that I am not being unduly harsh in my criticism, but you can imagine that, as I drafted the report and prepared myself for this evening and consulted the relevant documentation, I had to rub my eyes when I saw all the things that can happen in our European institutions. Both Parliament and the Commission – and we as individuals too, as far as I am concerned – surely have an interest in ensuring that this sort of thing does not recur and become a habit.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, let me start by answering a question that was put to me by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. He was asking why my amendments seek to make this system voluntary. I can tell Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf very quickly why I seek to make it voluntary.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last week in my constituency in Scotland, cast ewes – for the non-agricultural people in the Chamber (there are not many people in the Chamber), they are old female sheep – were selling for GBP 2 a head. A year ago they were selling for GBP 60 a head; this year, GBP 2 a head. I ask the rapporteur: how is a farmer who is only getting two quid a head for his sheep supposed to fit microchips and buy expensive scanners and readers that can comply with a mandatory electronic ID system? This is the economic problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">The original Commission proposal was perfectly correct in seeking stakeholder consultation and in seeking economic-impact cost-benefit analysis. I have not seen all the figures. I do not know what the intention would be for the sheep farmers in my constituency. I have to remind the Members in this House that the UK has the biggest sheep flock in the whole of Europe – by far the biggest. The impact of this would be catastrophic with the economic situation the way it is. It would actually mean – if this becomes mandatory and we go by the dates set by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in their vote on Monday night, and we set 31 December 2009 as the mandatory introduction – that a whole group of sheep farmers in Britain will close down and go out of business. The upland areas and the hills that have been looked after by sheep farmers and grazed by sheep for centuries will go wild and then the public will realise the damage that has been done.</p>
      <p sl="de">While we are wreaking this damage in a flock that already has the best traceability in Europe – we have absolute guaranteed traceability in the UK at the present time and the sheep farmers cannot understand why we want to impose a new system of electronic identification when they already have high-quality traceability – we are importing sheep meat into the EU from outside, from countries that do not respect our levels of hygiene and welfare and the rigorous regulations that we apply to our sheep farmers.</p>
      <p sl="de">So, let us have a little bit of sensitivity here. I hope that when we come to vote on this tomorrow the Members will see the reason why we are asking for a voluntary system and not yet fixing a mandatory date for the introduction of electronic ID.</p>

    <intervention id="3-408" speaker_id="4349" name="Rosa Miguélez Ramos" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I am one who always listens carefully to Mr Stevenson whenever he speaks, and I have been listening to him for several years now, but this speech surprises me, because it is one which would have been better made in 2003 and not 2007, nearly 2008 in fact.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf put it very well: this is a 2004 regulation, we debated it in Parliament in 2003, and the regulation provides that the date of entry into force for the system of electronic identification for ovine and caprine animals is to be 1 January 2008.</p>
      <p sl="es">So, Mr Stevenson − I have no doubt whatever that you have ovine animals in your constituency, as I do myself − the five Member States with the biggest ovine and caprine flocks are, besides your country and mine, France, Italy and Greece. Well now, these four Member States have undertaken the task, which seems so abhorrent to you, of convincing their farmers to tag ovine and caprine animals, because we were told that the regulation said that electronic identification was going to be obligatory from 1 January 2008.</p>
      <p sl="es">I, as a Member of this Parliament, entirely understand this. I also understand that there are Member States – such as yours, which is why I have just been listening to you – which have not fulfilled their duties, and with this in mind, I voluntarily proposed a date – which has moreover been accepted by the Committee on Agriculture – extending that time-limit slightly, but, as you know, whereas they might pay two pounds an animal in your constituency, in mine they only pay one pound.</p>
      <p sl="es">At this point in time, with animal disease problems being prevalent in Europe, I think that a system such as this provides a guarantee and a way of enhancing the value of what our farmers are producing. It is an identification system which enables us to know the provenance of any animal transiting Community territory and be assured that it is in good health; it is a guarantee for the consumer and that has to be good for the farmer, because he is going to get more for his meat.</p>
      <p sl="es">If they are not going to get any more for their meat, that is just where we are now with bluetongue, foot-and-mouth disease and the chikungunya mosquito. If that is the case then there is no hope for us. So, please, let us just get to work, let us be coherent and read and examine the regulation referred to by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf –which I would repeat is a 2004 regulation – let us read it carefully, let us recognise that there are a few exceptions in it, but it is not a matter of do-as-you-please, because the date cannot be voluntary. It cannot be voluntary because we, the Commission and the Council decided that it was obligatory.</p>
      <p sl="es">In other words, I cannot turn the clock back to three years ago and tell my farmers that all their efforts up until now are completely pointless because the British forgot to ask their farmers to do the same. Do you understand me?</p>
      <p sl="es">I am asking you to read my amendment carefully. My group is definitely not about to question the obligatory nature of the system, because that would create unlawful discrimination between Member States and within the European Union itself, although it would not surprise me – and I am not referring to you, Mr Stevenson – that someone who had the gall to reject the Charter of Fundamental Rights in this House today could display equal or greater gall in rejecting the identification of ovine and caprine animals.</p>
      <p sl="es">Here we are then: I think we have a regulation, the Commission has made us a reasonable proposal, we have also made a reasonable proposal to the Commission, so let us try to finish this matter this morning without too much damage on either side.</p>

    <intervention id="3-409" speaker_id="4528" name="Neil Parish" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I rise very much to support what Mr Stevenson has just said and also very much to support what the Commission is trying to do. I think we do have to realise the scale of sheep farming and the number of animals involved. You are talking about 25 million sheep in the UK, 8.5 million in France, 3 million in Ireland and significant numbers in Spain and other countries. The system has got to be right. If we are going to introduce an electronic system, it has got to be practical and cost-effective, and farmers have got to be able to use it practically. As Mr Stevenson has quite rightly said, the sheep is an animal that is not of huge value, so all of this is not going to be done by veterinarians. A lot of this is going to have to be carried out by farmers, and when they come to read those tags, it is has got to be practically done up the side of a mountain in wet conditions, and all sorts of things.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have seen a lot of these electronic systems work in hotel rooms as you move people through different doorways, and they say there is no collision between the different tags. You also want a system where, when a lorry-load of sheep drives into a market, in ideal circumstances, you want to be able to electronically check every sheep that is in that lorry. This is the ideal system. What I say to you quite clearly is that there is no point in moving forward on electronic tagging until we have got a practical system, cost-effective and ready to use. Therefore, I think you are absolutely right to say, ‘Come back at the end of 2009 and see where we are’. As Mr Stevenson has quite rightly said, let us use this as a voluntary system when Member States are ready, when there is a lot of movement of sheep, and when we have got a system that works. Please do not bring it in too quickly, before we are ready.</p>

    <intervention id="3-410" speaker_id="1318" name="James Nicholson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, once again we are here to debate the tagging of sheep. All I can say is that it is an awful pity that the Commission did not listen to us way back in the early days when we questioned what they were proposing then and advised them. I would say to Ms Miguélez Ramos: yes, we did make these speeches way back at the beginning when there was the discussion on tagging sheep. But unfortunately what we said was not listened to, even when we said it would be unworkable.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we did warn you and you would not listen. The reality is that sheep farmers could never afford the cost of electronic tagging because they are receiving less now for their lambs than they were 20 years ago! You tell me of any other part of any other business of any other industry that is asked to put out tremendous expenditure and receive less for what they are producing than they did 20 years ago. I know this is the case from personal experience.</p>
      <p sl="en">The present system we have is sufficient. So, let us kick this very much into the long grass for the future. I can accept coming back and looking at it in 2009. Maybe, over that period of time, the electronic tagging technology, which at the moment is far too expensive, may, like many other areas of technology, become more affordable with a combination of lower costs and better returns to the sheep producer. Then we could examine this all over again.</p>
      <p sl="en">The big challenge to sheep production is to achieve profitability and when that happens we can move forward with confidence. I must say it was with great interest that I heard Ms Miguélez Ramos and Mr Stevenson having an exchange of views over sheep because they usually have an exchange of views over fish, which is totally different! It is probably even more argumentative than over sheep as they are doing tonight.</p>
      <p sl="en">But for sheep farmers, receiving such small rewards for hard work, as has been outlined by Mr Parish, makes this is a very difficult job. There are thousands of sheep on the top of mountains for all of the summertime. You try and catch them; you try and tag them; you try and follow them. I have to say to the Commissioner: I just wish you would send some of your officials who draw up some of these plans out to these areas and see what the sheep farmers have to put up with, see what they have to go through. Then you might understand how we feel and why we put forward these views.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, let us do it on a voluntary basis. Let us do it when we are ready. Let us move at a proper pace and let us take it at a speed which we can afford.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will be very brief, as it is late. I would like to remind the honourable Members that what we are discussing today is the date of introduction of the system. A decision was correctly taken to put the system in place, but the date was left open, or rather a date was fixed which, it was decided, we should subsequently amend or confirm.</p>
      <p sl="en">The data from a number of Member States showed two things. First of all that implementation was feasible, both technically and economically – as is stated in the report – and also that more time was needed for the Member States to introduce the system, meaning that a more realistic date was needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The truth is that the Commission did propose to have this date set at a later stage. I can assure you there was no intention to circumvent Parliament, and that is precisely why we chose this way of proceeding – having this debate, and not inserting an article in the regulation, which would have allowed us to take a decision with the Council alone.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was never any intention on the part of the Commission not to include or involve Parliament in these decisions. The setting of a date was considered to be a technical question. Since the principle had already been adopted, we thought that this technical question could be adopted through comitology and, to repeat what I said earlier, we have no problem in accepting the amendment setting a specific date, which I believe allows Member States enough time – two years – to prepare.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we would be reluctant to agree to voluntary systems, since the regulation concerns traceability, and traceability has to be effective and applied equally in the Member States. It is also a specific reflection of the animal health situation in the European Union. One can look at the direct cost of the system as it appears, but, if you take the longer-term benefits of the savings generated by the reduction in losses and animal diseases, we believe it will eventually be of benefit from the economic point of view.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, we are ready to accept the amendment by Parliament, which we believe will also be adopted by the Council next week.</p>

In certain circumstances – and these must not include voluntary arrangements, which would render the whole exercise pointless – it would be possible to give some consideration to ways in which the concerns that my fellow Members have expressed here could be met in practice.

Furthermore, I believe that an economic assessment, notably a cost-benefit analysis of the impact on producers, is necessary before fixing a date for the introduction of EID.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not believe there is any justification for setting a date for the introduction of this scheme until the impact of EID, particularly in relation to traceability and disease control, has been assessed.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Ireland, the sheep sector is melting down, with many farmers exiting the industry and therefore the imposition of these measures and costs on this sector at this time is unwelcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">If there is a legitimate justification for EID in this sector, stock owners would be responsive and would set about introducing it themselves on a voluntary basis. If and when this EID scheme is introduced it should take place on a voluntary rather than a compulsory basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, should EID be introduced it should only apply to animals born after a certain date and should not apply to existing stock.</p>
