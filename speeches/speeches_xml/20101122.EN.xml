      <p sl="unknown">It was with great satisfaction that I received the news concerning the release from house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the Burmese opposition. Mrs Suu Kyi was one of the first winners of the Sakharov Prize, awarded by the European Parliament since 1988. However, she was unable to collect it in person 20 years ago. I would like to inform you that I have already sent Mrs Suu Kyi an invitation to visit the European Parliament and to address one of our plenary sessions.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">25 November is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, as instituted by the UN 11 years ago. Every day, all over the world, many women are victims of rape, humiliation and domestic violence. A particular atrocity practised in many areas of the world is the circumcision of young women. It is estimated that 8 000 girls fall victim to this every day. To show solidarity with the campaign to stop this barbaric ritual, I would encourage you all to wear a rose petal today to symbolise our opposition to this practice. I would also like to stress that the European Parliament has continued in its efforts to appeal for a complete stop to physical and mental violence against women for many years.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on the agenda for Tuesday, there are six reports by Mrs Matera concerning mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in the Netherlands. I am taking the floor on this because I think that the way Mr Daul has been attacked on this matter in the Dutch press is not right. At the Conference of Presidents, Mr Daul raised the question that had been discussed by the heads of the various groups concerning whether these reports should not be dropped in the light of the budget debate. I would like to make two comments on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, we should leave these reports on the agenda. We should also vote them through and transfer this money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to the Netherlands.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, however, Mr Daul suggested it in a comment made at the Conference of Presidents. If it is then taken from the Conference of Presidents into the public domain without him even being given an opportunity to answer questions and explain it himself, then, as the chair of a group, one has to consider very carefully what in fact one can say at the Conference of Presidents. That is the first point.</p>
      <p sl="de">My other point is that it is not the European Parliament that is claiming that money is being squandered here. It is an element of the Dutch Government – not all of it – that is constantly claiming that money is being squandered in Europe and therefore Europe should get less money. The Matera reports show that, on the contrary, money from this budget is being used very responsibly and – in my opinion – for very important projects in the Netherlands. Consequently, adopting these reports would show that the criticism in the Netherlands in respect of this budget is not justified.</p>

However, I would like to assure you that the vote on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for the Netherlands will proceed tomorrow as planned. Nothing has changed. Voting will take place tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Wednesday:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I have received a request from the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left concerning the debate on the situation in the Western Sahara, namely, that voting on the motions for a resolution on this matter should take place during this session and not the December session, as is currently intended.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-023" speaker_id="96706" name="João Ferreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the situation in Western Sahara is serious enough for Parliament to hold off on taking a position on this matter. The facts are undeniable and are plain to see. We have seen images of destruction in the Sahrawi camps, and we know that this destruction has resulted in deaths and injuries, with many people still missing. We know that a Member of this House was prevented from going to the camps and was expelled by the Moroccan authorities, and we know that the same thing has been happening with members of national parliaments, journalists and members of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Knowing all this, we cannot simply ignore it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Not taking a position on this matter would now be an incomprehensible and unacceptable attitude of complacency, and even complicity, and it would only detract from the dignity of this institution and the values it claims to defend. I would therefore like to call upon everyone to make the sensible decision of supporting the vote on a resolution on this issue during this sitting, voting in favour of this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I must ask Mr Ferreira to pay attention for a moment. We discussed this topic in great depth at the Conference of Presidents and during the preparations for the Conference of Presidents. On behalf of my group, I would like to say that we are very concerned about what is going on in the Western Sahara. If the pictures that we have seen are accurate, then this must give rise not just to serious debate, but also, if necessary, to consequences. This means that we must proceed properly, however. Proceeding properly includes discussing the events this week. At our request, the Moroccan foreign minister has now stated that he is prepared to attend a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He does not have to do that. The Moroccan foreign minister does not have to appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament. As far as I am concerned, we should take advantage of the fact that he is doing so in any case to first confront him with the reproaches made, and only then adopt a resolution. I believe that is a much more proper way to proceed, rather than adopting a resolution now and then listening to what he has to say afterwards. Let us adopt the resolution in the light of the information and the questions that we will have the opportunity to ask the Moroccan foreign minister in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I personally consider that a more proper way to proceed. Moreover, until this afternoon there was consensus on that among all the groups.</p>

      <p sl="fr">An emergency? Very well. If the majority wants to tackle this issue from that perspective, that is fine.

      <p sl="unknown">the report by Mr Balz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the ECB annual report 2009 (2010/2078(INI)) (A7-0314/2010), and</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-031" speaker_id="96997" name="Burkhard Balz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just had a request for everyone to quieten down a bit. Perhaps certain Members could comply with that request.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, my report today essentially concerns the performance of the European Central Bank in 2009 – in other words, during a period in which economic, financial and, increasingly, also political actions, were substantially dominated by the economic and financial crisis. The crisis, which started off as a purely financial crisis, spread, and also affected the entire real economy in a second wave. Economic activity diminished worldwide, while falling tax revenues and increasing welfare expenditure as a result of the crisis led to increasing public deficits. Further measures to stimulate the economy also contributed to the level of debt. As a result of these increased deficits, governments throughout the European Union passed extensive austerity packages. In my opinion, these packages were necessary and, in some cases, even overdue. However, they constrained the capacity of the governments to act.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although economic activity began to recover in the second half of 2009, the financial and economic crisis then threatened to evolve into a public debt crisis in a third wave in 2010. In my view, this danger has not yet been averted. In recent days, we have been reminded all too clearly by the case of Ireland that the problem of over-indebtedness in the Member States has by no means been resolved, and I therefore also agree with President Van Rompuy: the failure of the euro is out of the question. That is the current situation, however. My report deals instead with 2009, about which we can say that the ECB reacted appropriately – even well, in fact – to the challenges. Its measures proved to be widely successful and kept many financial institutions from collapse. However, the financial institutions did not always pass on the liquidity in full to the real economy, with the result that the full recovery potential of these measures could not be exploited.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since these measures involved extraordinary steps, it is now essential that the measures are lifted judiciously and with careful planning. The problems in Greece and other euro countries may be, in part, home-made, but they also brought to light fundamental problems that existed within the economic and monetary union. The principles of the Stability and Growth Pact were infringed. We are now living through the consequences, and that includes what is going on in Ireland. These infringements must now be removed and new infringements must be prevented. The Stability and Growth Pact needs to be strengthened, and the economic and monetary union needs to be more in balance.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the past, insufficient coordination of economic policies within the monetary union allowed considerable economic imbalances to arise between the euro area countries and left the euro area without a predefined crisis management mechanism. The euro area will have to resolve these imbalances if it is to prevent a new crisis. In the final event, however, the structural reform process – combined with the revision of the regulatory framework for financial policy – may strengthen the euro area. The issue of the independence of the European Central Bank will also be a significant aspect of the new economic governance, particularly as regards the recently established European Systemic Risk Board. Consequently, Parliament will continue to take its duty to review the performance of the ECB very seriously.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am absolutely convinced that the European Union and the euro area will find a way out of this crisis and could emerge from it even stronger than before. However, in the coming months, we need to learn the right lessons from what has happened. This is a major challenge, but in its history to date, the European Union has constantly demonstrated that it develops best when it has to overcome challenges. This crisis therefore also represents an opportunity that we should exploit.</p>
      <p sl="de">In closing I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their extremely pleasant and constructive cooperation on this report. It is not something that can be taken for granted, but it deserves particular emphasis in this case.</p>

    <intervention id="1-032" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jean-Claude Trichet" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the ECB">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Balz, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting to you, as provided for by the treaty, the European Central Bank’s Annual Report for 2009. Due to the schedule having been somewhat thrown out by the European elections in particular, I spoke to you last March about the previous annual report. This is therefore the second time I have addressed Parliament this year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, allow me to say how pleased I am about the support once again expressed by the European Parliament’s motion for a resolution in favour of regular hearings before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, more generally, in favour of maintaining close relations with the European Central Bank. I welcome this even more since, this year, the European Parliament has demonstrated very convincingly its willingness and ability to assert the overriding European interest, especially with regard to the financial supervision package.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to start by giving you a brief overview of the monetary policy measures taken by the European Central Bank during the financial and economic crisis. Beyond the crisis period, I would also like to look back on the ECB over the first twelve years of its existence. Finally, I would like to look at the most pressing challenges that await us in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, let me first mention the action taken during the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">2009 was a most challenging year for the ECB’s monetary policy. It started with a severe economic downturn worldwide following the outbreak of the financial crisis in autumn 2008. In this environment of subdued inflationary pressures, we continued with our policy of lowering our key rates further. Overall, within a period of only seven months – between October 2008 and May 2009 – we lowered our main refinancing rate by 325 basis points. This brought our main refinancing rate to 1%.</p>
      <p sl="de">To ensure that households and firms in the euro area would benefit from these most favourable financing conditions, in 2009 we also continued with – and even extended – our enhanced credit support to euro area banks. We did this in response to dysfunctional money markets that had weakened the ability of monetary policy to influence the outlook for price stability by means of interest rate decisions alone. Among those non-standard measures – as we used to call them – the most prominent is the full allotment liquidity provision through our refinancing operations with euro area banks against good collateral and at the main refinancing rate prevailing at the time for several maturities extending well beyond the weekly operations. In 2009, we also extended the maturity of our longer-term refinancing operation to one year. These were, of course, decisions of extreme importance.</p>
      <p sl="de">As rightly emphasised in your draft resolution on the ECB’s annual report, this enhanced credit support has been successful in avoiding what would have been – if additional dysfunctional tensions had been observed – a depression or a much deeper recession. Let me emphasise that all our action was fully in line with our mandate to deliver price stability in the medium term for the euro area as a whole. That we have been able to credibly deliver on our mandate is reflected in a favourable inflation outlook and well-anchored inflation expectations in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="de">Following some improvements in financial market conditions in the course of 2009, renewed market tensions erupted in a number of segments of the euro area bond market. Since the smooth functioning of the bond market is essential to the transmission of the ECB’s key interest rates, we decided to intervene in the euro area’s debt security markets with the aim of helping restore a more normal transmission of monetary policy to the economy. To this end, we introduced our Securities Markets Programme. To ensure that this programme does not impact on our monetary policy stance, we re-absorb all the liquidity injected.</p>
      <p sl="de">To sum up, let me emphasise that all the non-standard measures we have adopted during the period of acute financial stress are temporary in nature and were designed with exit considerations in mind. Some of the non-standard measures initiated in 2009 and early 2010 have already been phased out in view of improvements in conditions in some financial markets and taking the ongoing recovery of the euro area economy into account.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me share with you for a moment a few thoughts on the track record of the euro. In my view, three elements are fundamental.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, the ECB has delivered what it was expected to deliver according to its treaty mandate, namely, price stability. Indeed, euro area average inflation over the past almost 12 years stands at 1.97%. This fully reflects our definition of price stability, namely, our aim to keep annual inflation rates in the euro area below 2% and close to 2% in the medium term. In this sense, the euro system over the past 12 years has operated as an anchor of stability and confidence and has done so during the most recent times, despite the challenging environment created by the global financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly – and reflecting favourably on the credibility of the ECB’s monetary policy – inflation expectations have, as I have said, remained solidly anchored at levels in line with price stability.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, this success is grounded, we trust, in the full independence of the ECB from political influence, in its primary mandate to maintain price stability and in its transparent communication, particularly concerning the definition of price stability. The ECB’s two-pillar monetary strategy allows for a forward looking and medium-term oriented course of action that is underpinned by a solid analytical framework. That framework includes a thorough analysis of monetary and credit developments, taking the monetary nature of inflation over the medium to longer term into account.</p>
      <p sl="de">We consider that this comprehensive approach allows for well-informed and consistent decision making, whilst being steady and looking beyond short-term volatility.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards the external dimension of the euro, let me only say that our currency has established itself internationally. In 2009, the euro represented around 30% of the stock of international debt securities and the stock of global foreign exchange reserves.</p>
      <p sl="de">Speaking of the external dimension of the euro, I will say a word on the present foreign exchange rate issues, domains where I would call for great prudence.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two major topics. One is the relationship between the major floating convertible currencies of the industrialised countries, such as the dollar, the euro, the yen, the pound sterling and the Canadian dollar. These currencies have been floating since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system at the beginning of the 1970s. I should underline the strong view of the international community that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me say that the ECB appreciates the recent statements by the US authorities, namely the Secretary of the US Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, reiterating that a strong dollar vis-à-vis the other major convertible currencies is in the interests of the United States. I share this view entirely. A dollar that is credible among the major currencies of the advanced economies is in the interests of the United States, of Europe and of the entire international community.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second topic concerns the currencies of emerging market economies which have current account surpluses and exchange rates that are not sufficiently flexible. On this issue, the international community agrees – and this was restated in Korea last week, as well as by the Commission – that moving towards more market-determined exchange rate systems, enhancing exchange rate stability to reflect underlying fundamentals and refraining from competitive devaluation of currencies are in the interest of the emerging economies concerned and of the international community.</p>
      <p sl="de">The ECB used to say that this is no time for complacency. This is truer now than ever. The challenges lying ahead of us are manifold. All relevant authorities as well as the private sector must assume fully their responsibilities, and this is true for executive branches, central banks, regulators, supervisors, the private sector and the financial industry. In particular, the current crisis has clearly demonstrated that implementing ambitious reforms in economic governance is in the interest both of the euro area countries and of the euro area as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">The proposals put forward by President Van Rompuy on the reform of the EU’s economic governance and approved by the European Council meeting of October 2010 represent an improvement to the current surveillance framework at EU level and seem broadly appropriate for the EU countries not participating in monetary union. However, as regards the specific requirements of the euro area, in our opinion, they fall short of what we view as necessary to ensure the best possible functioning of the single-currency economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am convinced that, over the coming months, the European Parliament will help Europe make the necessary quantum leap in economic governance a reality. With its legislative role concerning financial supervision and the ESRB, Parliament has shown its determination when it comes to major issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for this and to express again my conviction that the influence of Parliament will be decisive in the economic governance debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another important challenge relates to financial regulation. We should take full advantage of the lessons of the crisis and maintain the momentum for financial reform. As advocated in your draft resolution, a speedy implementation of Basel III is of crucial importance. The Commission’s legislative proposals on short selling and over-the-counter derivatives are also indispensable to making the financial system more transparent and resilient.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are facing a decisive year. 2011 should see the adoption of the revised governance framework, in-depth discussions on the crisis management framework and possibly the launch of the procedure for a treaty change. We need to get all these reforms right, so as to ensure that Europe as a whole and the euro area can meet future challenges with even greater capacity and conviction.</p>
      <p sl="de">2011 will be also the first year of the existence of the European Systemic Risk Board. As is called for in your draft resolution, we are doing our utmost to support the new body. At the same time, of course, the complete independence and the primary mandate of the ECB, enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, are unchanged, and I have already stressed this point before Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will continue to deliver on our mandate. This is what the treaty requires from us. You can trust that we will deliver what our fellow citizens expect.</p>

    <intervention id="1-035" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first thank the rapporteur, Burkhard Balz, for the solid and comprehensive report on the ECB annual report 2009. The Commission welcomes the report, which reflects the key issues appropriately. The report recognises and praises the work done by the ECB in managing the crisis. The Commission shares this view; the ECB, under the leadership of President Jean-Claude Trichet, has navigated in this difficult situation skilfully and with a steady hand.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to use this opportunity to thank Jean-Claude Trichet for an excellent cooperation and especially for his crucial role during these turbulent times. The ECB has, both through its monitoring stance and its non-standard measures, been instrumental in the fire-fighting to overcome the crisis and thus in laying the foundations for sustainable growth and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your report rightly stresses that the financial crisis has exposed the need for reinforced economic surveillance in the euro area. The Commission agrees with this, which is precisely why we have put forward several legislative proposals to reinforce economic governance in the EU, especially in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also taken on board several suggestions presented in the Feio report to strengthen and broaden economic governance in the Union. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has received the Commission’s proposals and is currently working towards achieving the ambitious deadline of June next year, which I appreciate and welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to the second part of the debate, which is the latest developments in the international exchange rates. It is correct that volatility in foreign exchange markets has increased in recent weeks, with significant shifts in the value of major bilateral exchange rates.</p>
      <p sl="en">The euro appreciated against the dollar since June this year due to stronger data for the euro area economy and due to further expansion of the US monetary policy. More recently, however, the euro has somewhat weakened against most currencies, as increased worries about the Member States’ public finances – above all in Ireland – have affected the euro. In real effective terms, the euro is currently close to its long-term average following an overall depreciation this year from an overvalued level at the end of last year. Compared to the beginning of the year, the euro depreciation in real effective terms amounts to around 7%.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the context of a slow recovery in advanced economies and large capital flows to emerging economies, many countries have aimed at weakening their currency or at least resorting to competitive non-appreciation. It is therefore important that leaders in the G20 Seoul Summit last week very clearly and strongly committed themselves to abstain from competitive devaluations of their currencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The G20 summit also agreed to work further on the rebalancing of global growth. An agreement had been reached to work on indicative guidelines. It is clear that exchange rate flexibility must play a role in the necessary rebalancing so that exchange rates reflect economic fundamentals, as was underlined by President Trichet. The Commission will continue to support this important strand of G20 work, which will also be one of the key focuses of the French G20 Presidency next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I need to inform you about an important development concerning the euro area. Yesterday, when the ECOFIN Council welcomed the request of the Irish Government for financial assistance from the EU, ministers concurred with the Commission and the ECB that providing assistance to Ireland is warranted to safeguard financial stability in Europe. EU financial support can be provided under a programme with a rigorous policy conditionality which is being negotiated currently with the Irish authorities by the Commission and the IMF, in liaison with the ECB. The programme will address the fiscal challenges of the Irish economy in a decisive manner and the programme will also include a fund for potential future capital needs of the banking sector. To redress stress in the banking sector, a comprehensive range of measures including deleveraging and restructuring will need to be taken to contribute to ensuring that the Irish banking system performs its role properly in the functioning of the overall economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The technical talks on an EU-IMF programme are now well under way and the negotiations can be concluded by the end of November. Apart from EU and IMF financing, I can inform you that the United Kingdom and Sweden have indicated that they stand ready to contribute to the programme through bilateral loans, which is welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">All in all, yesterday’s decisions are a critical step forward in the joint efforts to stabilise the Irish economy and thus safeguard financial stability in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Trichet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, I join the chorus of praise for the ECB’s work, and I shall not repeat what my colleague, Mr Balz, said or what is said in the resolution. In the short time allotted to me, I would simply like to say that we must consider our fellow citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why do I say that in this way today? Because, yesterday evening, on all the French television channels, a future presidential candidate made a spectacle of himself by tearing up a EUR 10 note that he had photocopied and enlarged, and showing that, by tearing up that note, he was tearing up the cause of all our ills.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, that is not true. All that is needed is for us to make an effort, together, to communicate. The work that has been carried out in terms of supervision, organisation and regulation, to which you have referred, Mr President, is excellent. You know you have Parliament’s support: you said so yourself. However, we have a real task on our hands with regard to those of our fellow citizens who do not understand the messages that are being conveyed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Every day, the headlines in the press are of increasingly grim solutions and unlikely situations, and I can tell you that, on Friday, when I was out in the field, as we say in politics, I saw nearly 100 to 150 people. They all asked me the same question: what is going to happen with the euro? The fear felt by our fellow citizens is out of sync with what is being done, and done well, by the European Central Bank.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Balz, for his cooperation. I also welcome the fact that the European Central Bank has been granted the status of an EU institution following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Secondly, I would like to point out that there are considerable macro-economic disparities between the economies in the euro area, highlighting the need for closer harmonisation between economic and monetary policies. The Growth and Stability Pact is not an adequate instrument for resolving the current economic imbalances. One solution out of this deadlock could be to issue government bonds at EU level. This solidarity mechanism would provide stable financing for Member States in dire straits, would make budgetary supervision more effective and would significantly improve liquidity. The single currency should be supplemented with fiscal tightening and joint long-term debt.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The reckless behaviour of financial operators helped trigger the economic and financial crisis. In addition to this, the recent speculative attacks against certain Member States have made it difficult for the latter to borrow money on the international financial markets, thereby virtually affecting the stability of the whole euro area. I therefore think that a permanent mechanism is required to protect the euro area against speculative attacks. It is the European Commission’s duty to monitor the activity of current credit rating agencies and to devise a structure for an EU-level credit rating agency.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We must also bear in mind that the austerity measures adopted by national governments could significantly reduce the chance of the European economy’s recovery. This is why an EU-level economic governance model is required which will combine fiscal consolidation with the creation of new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Commission must also propose specific targets for narrowing the competitiveness gap between EU economies and, last but not least, go ahead with investments in green energy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I join the chorus of praise for our rapporteur, who I think has outlined the issue very clearly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In his report, he stresses the innovations afforded by the Treaty of Lisbon, and I really want to thank you, Mr Trichet, for having once again this evening reminded those of us who seem to be unaware of the fact – including, incidentally, those who signed it and had it ratified – that the Treaty of Lisbon includes a major innovation: we are going to be able to debate publicly, in this Chamber, the reform of the Stability Pact.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Under Mr Rehn, the Commission has drawn up a set of proposals that are on the right track and are rather courageous, especially in calling for discipline to be strengthened by taking account of the macro-economic imbalances that Mr Balz had, in fact, mentioned in his report. What is more, you refer several times, Mr Trichet, to a ‘quantum leap’, in other words, a real step forward in this governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I agree entirely with what Mr Gauzès said; when one goes out into the field, one almost wonders whether the proposals put forward by the Commission in September are completely relevant, whether account ought not to be taken of the crisis that is currently occurring in order to allow for as much progress as possible to be made. I would like to point out here that those who designed the euro never thought that we would simply coordinate economic policies in the long term. What was envisaged was political union, namely, an ability to take decisions while being supervised by Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For my part, what I find rather striking, when we speak to the citizens, is that we ultimately have motorists – the Member States – who are, at the same time, behind the wheel and by the side of the road acting as policemen. That is rather how the current system works; in other words, we are, at the same time, the driver, the person who issues fines and the person who is supposed to supervise the other cars. I do not think that there is a single country with road traffic like that. We would therefore like to raise the cost of fines a little and we shall work towards that. Thank you for having reminded us that we have already done so in practice with regard to the reform of financial supervision, in the general European interest.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly, on behalf of my group, may I express my thanks to Mr Balz for the cooperative manner in which our deliberations were conducted. We were able to contribute certain suggestions to make the report even more balanced. The period 2009-2010 was characterised by extraordinary measures on the part of the European Central Bank, and in view of these extraordinary economic developments, I would like to thank Mr Trichet once again for taking these measures, particularly since they were not always well received within his own institution.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have seen during this period that the Stability and Growth Pact is inadequate. Instead, we need effective coordination of economic policy that takes into account not just public debt but also private debt, and that deals with economic imbalances not just in deficit countries but also in countries making a surplus. Where prices are concerned we need to focus not just on consumer prices, but also on property prices, their speculative development and the creation of bubbles.</p>
      <p sl="de">Above all – and we are constantly urging this – we need once and for all a framework for tax competition in the European Union. It is unacceptable to have huge austerity programmes on the expenditure side while countries continue to have unconstrained tax competition on the revenue side.</p>
      <p sl="de">In particular, it is unacceptable – and impossible to explain to our citizens – that in such a situation as we now have, we are rescuing Ireland’s banks, but not at the same time ensuring that its scandalously low rate of corporation tax, which stands at 12.5%, is corrected to the usual European rate of 25%. We need to have some straight talking here.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to ask Mr Trichet to comment on two matters in the report: the issue of transparency, as mentioned in paragraph 21, and the issue of the security accepted, as mentioned in paragraph 39. You have not yet commented on these issues. On behalf of all the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, I would be grateful if you could comment specifically on these matters.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Balz on his report. However, at a time when the euro is facing new crises every day and it is generally accepted that new forms of governance and new rules are required for survival, it is hard for the ECB to weigh in on outside global issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet that could be precisely the problem. Until now, most of the large global players have succeeded in working together to seek solutions to the problems of the global financial crisis. The coordination in areas of financial services regulatory reform, particularly in areas like derivatives, has been unprecedented. But when it is national currencies that are being defended as opposed to multinational banks, there is a strong danger that multilateral coordination is going to break down.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the ECB looks to protect the euro above all else, the Fed to protect the dollar and the Chinese the yuan, we will all lose out.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since its inception, the ECB has done the difficult job of balancing different cultures and methods of monetary policy. I hope that, even while it is under intense internal pressure, it can use its expertise in these areas to enhance cooperation beyond the EU to a global level.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would first like to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr Balz for such constructive cooperation. I can only emphasise the fact that despite coming from different positions, working together was a positive experience.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many people thought – and I would like to underline this fact again here – that the crisis in the euro area was over. Ireland shows that this is not the case. Just as before, Europe is voluntarily offering itself up to the financial markets. The EU Member States are still having to offer their treasury bonds in the bazaar of the financial markets and try to gain the confidence of the speculators by adopting suicidal austerity packages. At the weekend, we saw once again where that leads us. This time it was not the Greeks, who were supposedly out to deceive everyone, but rather Ireland – the star pupil – that was forced to turn to the European bail-out fund in order to rescue its banking system – a system which had also long been held up as a shining example of deregulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the meantime, the financial sector is already eyeing up Portugal for capitulation as its interest rates continue to rise. The European Central Bank must share the responsibility for this drama. It has failed and continues to fail to use eurobonds in order to offer a civilised alternative to this casino approach. While half of Europe is recovering from the crisis, the ECB idly stands by as the remaining part falls further and further into poverty and uncertainty. Ruinous cuts across the board by national economies may be to the taste of the European investment and banking giants, but they do nothing to help either Ireland or the monetary union and the ECB.</p>
      <p sl="de">Please pay no attention to Mrs Merkel’s simplified financial ABC, Mr Trichet. If you want to save the economic and monetary union, do not leave European treasury bonds hanging in the air. Introduce eurobonds before the speculators claim their next victim.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I read the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs’ report on the European Central Bank’s annual report with great interest. The report acknowledges that huge disparities between Member States of the eurozone contributed to the problems we are witnessing. The report states that ‘these imbalances pose considerable difficulties for a suitable monetary policy within the eurozone’ and reiterates that ‘the financial crisis in some countries within the euro area is a serious matter for the area as a whole’, reflecting this ‘dysfunction of the euro area’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I strain to see the sense in calling for stronger coordination of economic policies within the euro area. The knee-jerk reaction has been to increase economic governance, but it is limitations of enforced commonality that have led particular Member States into financial crisis, combined with extraneous reasons as yet beyond our control. Perhaps the system does not allow for the necessary economic elasticity and self-determination to enable governments to deal with idiosyncratic problems effectively, such as rates of inflation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report lights upon this point, noting that the crisis and subsequent bail-outs and stimulus packages ‘led to far-reaching austerity measures which … heavily constrain the capacity of governments to act’.</p>
      <p sl="en">One argument is that you cannot have a single currency without further homogenisation to iron out differences between Member States and levels of wealth. Yet any realist knows that this will not happen. It is contrary to human nature, which logically should shine forth in a democracy, however inconvenient.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is the eurozone ready for Estonia in January? I raise my eyebrows at the statement that ‘the adoption of the currency by Estonia shows the status of the euro’, suggesting that this will ‘encourage (other) Member States to seek membership’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ideological clinging to the euro will see monetary problems resurface in boom time and bust. A single currency only works in a tight-knit federal environment. Perhaps, with this being the Commission’s ultimate intention, they have put the cart before the horse.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although the UK is not in the eurozone, we suffer the effects of contributing to bail-outs and through the intricately entwined economics inside the Union, it is no use waiting for the ‘I told you so’ moment. It has already passed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, it would be good if this report by Mr Balz could be presented subject to a reservation, and that would be a reservation as regards memoirs. I think we might learn a lot more if you would present the chapter on the years 2008-2009 from your point of view, Mr Trichet. In the absence of such knowledge, we are working somewhat in the dark here, and there is reason to believe that there are many extraneous circumstances of which we are unaware at the present time. Nevertheless, you have stated that the longer-term financing measures have been extended once again, Mr Trichet. Perhaps that is a good thing. History will show us whether it was really such a good idea. We do not always have to point the finger straight away at Alan Greenspan.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is just something that I am concerned about, and that is that our citizens are simply not being told what this liquidity aid is actually being used for, and the lack of transparency as regards the way that the Irish are being forced – in many people’s eyes – under this umbrella. We know that Ireland has already received EUR 130 billion, EUR 35 billion of which has gone to the subsidiary of a German business – Hyporealestate. Just why is so much pressure being piled on at present? Why are we not in a position to say who the real creditors of the Irish banks are? Is it my life assurance with Allianz? Is it, in fact, the German banks, as is always being claimed? If that is the case, are we not having the wrong debate here? In which case, we should be honest enough to tell our citizens that it is they that we are bailing out, that it may be your own money that you made the mistake of investing in Ireland, in a banking world built on false foundations. This, of course, also raises the question of whether every Irish bank is really essential to the system. Why do we not have the courage to accept that one or other will fail? The Leman Brothers solution cannot always be the answer. We need the risks to be distributed fairly, because a large proportion of the earlier gains undoubtedly went into the private sector.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The financial economy is global in nature. The crisis, too, is global. It is precisely for this reason that the solutions to the crisis must also be global. We cannot ignore the fact that the Member States’ economic and financial problems still affect the euro in all its aspects. I once again agree with the rapporteur. Unfortunately, the EMU has not complied with nor held Member States accountable for compliance with all the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is why we speak of government debt growth, and this is why we now see a new wave of the crisis, which is a government debt crisis.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I trust that the issues regarding the ECB’s independence and its responsibility for decision making will be resolved in a reassuring manner, and that this, along with the reform programme aimed at creating a successful economic union, will help strengthen the European Union and the euro area within it.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro is experiencing problems, but what convertible currency is not after the systemic crisis caused by crazy finance?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Government debt is a serious problem. Nevertheless, the increase in public deficits is a result of the public bail-out of private banks. What is more, the economy needed to be revived. The financial crisis has spread rapidly to the real economy, leading to a sharp downturn and unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It appears that the world of crazy finance has not learnt from the crisis. Wall Street and City survivors are speculating on the currency markets and short selling CDSs that they do not even have. The lending rates for States it is suspected may default must be raised by indirectly imposing austerity policies on them, which will make it even more difficult for them to recover.</p>
      <p sl="fr">European solidarity is being shown with difficulty and sparingly. The bail-out of Greece means, first and foremost, the bail-out of French and German banks holding a significant portfolio of Greek debts. The support given to Ireland is, above all, a bail-out of British and German banks that would suffer deeply if Irish banks were to go under.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact that the rate of the euro remains volatile is not a sign that the common currency is weak. It is a reflection of the tension in the markets, especially in the face of a currency war between the Americans and the Chinese.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since the start of the year, China has no longer been borrowing in dollars, but has been selling them. The tax situation in the United States is worse than that in Europe. On top of federal public deficits, there are enormous private deficits. Forty-eight of the 50 states in the American Union have a deficit budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Van Rompuy spoke about the euro struggling to survive. He is wrong. The euro, that beacon of stability that Mr Trichet has just spoken about, will outlive Mr Van Rompuy, because the Union and its supporting structure, the Euro Group, are the most important economic unit in the world. In spite of real problems, to which Europe is responding with continual shilly-shallying, it should be pointed out that, at world level, the 27 are the biggest exporters of goods, the biggest importers of goods, and the biggest exporters of services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have the most solvent internal market in the world. Furthermore, European companies export twice as much within the internal market as they do to world markets. The Union is the main destination for third-country direct investments. Companies in the Union hold the biggest investment stocks worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With 500 million citizens, or 7% of the world’s population, the Union generates 30% of gross world product. The United States generates 25%, Japan 8% and China 8% of world product.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our European Union, which also provides 55% of world development aid, could have more of an influence if our leaders had a little more political courage, if they used Europe’s strength.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will just end by saying that a strict and transparent framework must be imposed on international finance. We must work together to overcome our problems.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as has been highlighted by our colleague Mr Gauzès, some people hate the euro; they see it as the root of all evil and they cheer at the prospect of the collapse of the eurozone. But these people are wrong and they live in the past. The current troubles are not caused by the euro; on the contrary, the euro protects us from even worse. We need the common currency but we also need proper governance of the eurozone; loose cooperation on the basis of unanimity is not an option anymore.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colleagues, we are on a ship with a giant hole in its side; it is sink or swim at this moment. But national governments still seem to think that it is enough to set up task forces and working groups and talk about maybe seeking closer cooperation, and then again maybe not. The good news is that they seem to be acting more decisively and more quickly in the case of Ireland, because swift action is needed and very welcome. This is not just about rescuing single countries: it is about the credibility of the eurozone. It is about the world testing us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Are we willing and able to act? The confidence of the world in the eurozone is essential for the stability of our currency; the money in our pockets depends on the confidence that others have in us. So I therefore urge national politicians to stop playing the populist card, or indeed publicly tearing up euro notes, and instead take ownership and take responsibility for our shared currency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a word about the austerity measures. They are much criticised, and some people even say that they will damage the economy. Of course we have to act with caution, but these measures are necessary to sanitise public finance in the long term and are also a sign of solidarity between countries in the eurozone. I think we should talk not only about the expenditure side but also about the revenue side, because there too, reforms – whether of the labour market, pensions or social security – are necessary and long overdue.</p>

Tackling the crisis has cost a great deal of effort and this is still continuing. I think that we should have a better and stronger approach to tackling the crisis. The establishment of the European Emergency Fund is no structural solution. We will still have huge debts which countries like Greece or Ireland will never be able to repay. What really helps, however, are stringent, strict budgetary discipline and the accompanying automatic penalties. Fortunately, Mr Balz’s report is very clear on that point. The Council should take the same approach in adapting the Stability and Growth Pact. Cutbacks are needed if we are to overcome the crisis. The majority of this House should also apply that principle to the European budget. The acceptance of the 2.9% budget increase is a very broad compromise already. No citizen will understand Parliament wanting still more and wanting further compromises. Therefore, do not do it!</p>

The project in question had the aim of protecting large financial institutions from extensive losses arising from Greece’s inability to pay its debts, and, as far as I remember, you explicitly referred to it as a manifestation of voluntary solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the intervention in Ireland ultimately proves that the EU should have come up with a common solution for European banks, particularly the large banks, almost before dealing with any other matter. In practice, today we are openly discussing the failure of states, yet we still do not have a clear proposal for a solution for European banks.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The intervention in Greece and the way it has developed prove that Europe needs European solutions, and the solution identified thus far is principally based on bilateral aid, whereby every country is subjected to the judgment of its partners based on criteria that are neither clear nor stable. The European Central Bank (ECB) has acted as an anchor in this situation, filling some of the gaps, particularly in terms of the vulnerability of sovereign debt. Make no mistake, however: we cannot continue like this in the medium term.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would therefore like to ask the President of the ECB the following three questions. Firstly, what is the ECB’s position on a stable model for constructing a true system of solidarity between the Member States with regard to sovereign debt? We need this, and we should not refuse to face up to reality. Secondly, what were the differences, if it is possible for us to identify them, which prompted the ECB not to endorse all the recommendations of the report compiled by the task force led by Mr Van Rompuy? Thirdly, does the ECB believe that the EU can survive with the increasing divergence of growth suffered by the Member States, and without a common instrument that restores some convergence in these growth strategies?</p>

Thirdly, I just want to ask people to lay off a little with regard to corporation tax because, firstly, it is a matter of subsidiarity; secondly, other countries in the EU have similar rates; and thirdly, it would exacerbate a very difficult situation in Ireland at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="ga">So, I know that the people of Ireland are eager to get on with the job and that things will improve in due course.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Commissioner Rehn and Mr Trichet have given us more information here this evening than the Irish Government, which has misled us and lied to us for months. They have been more concerned to defend their historical legacy than to defend the future of our people’s livelihoods, and indeed Ireland’s and Europe’s currency.</p>
      <p sl="en">My appeal to Commissioner Rehn and Mr Trichet tonight is that they ensure that the timeframe for aid and the targets for deficits and debt are such that the social objectives of Europe are taken into account, as well as the need to ensure that Ireland’s capacity to grow its economy and create jobs is not undermined.</p>
      <p sl="en">Will you confirm also that you fully understand that increasing Ireland’s 12.5% corporation profits tax is not a solution to Ireland’s crisis, nor indeed Europe’s current crisis, but could, in fact, create an economic and jobs wasteland in Ireland?</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Trichet and Mr Rehn very much for their absolutely excellent work in these turbulent times. I have a very specific question for you both. Back in my country, which does not belong to the euro area, there is currently a discussion taking place along these lines: ‘This demonstrates precisely what we said when voting against the euro in 2001. It shows that we were right – the euro cannot work’.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This is, of course, an erroneous claim. I will therefore ask you two gentlemen a question. I believe that it is a key question and a key responsibility for the two of you to explain why Europe and the euro area have ended up in these difficulties. Is it because the euro area and the common currency have problems? Or is it because we have a number of politicians in the individual countries, in other words, in countries such as Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece, who have not actually done their job? Gentlemen, you need to explain this. Otherwise, I will never be able to explain it back home in my country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to put a question to Mr Trichet. As President of the European Central Bank, why have you and the European Commission utterly capitulated to the speculators and assorted sharks on the international financial markets? You allowed them to engineer a panic in the markets over the Irish crisis – a panic designed to get you to intervene to guarantee the bond holders the billions that they gambled in bad debts. Because they threatened you that they would attack Portugal and Spain next, you and Commissioner Rehn utterly capitulated to a market dictatorship that is unelected, faceless and unaccountable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I ask you to justify this? Private speculators and bondholders gamble tens of billions in private deals with private developers and private bankers in Ireland for private profit, and when the gamble fails, you support the pathetic government in Ireland to saddle working people, pensioners and the poor with the cost of this gamble. Now you have sent in the IMF as the shock troops for neoliberal capitalism to make the Irish people pay.</p>

The Irish are the authors of their own misfortune: their government mismanaged their economy and fuelled a house-building boom unrelated to reality. But worst of all, they joined the European single currency.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first step in solving their problems is to leave the euro; instead, Ireland has chosen to subject itself to financial governance from the European Union. The longer it takes to leave the euro, the worse the consequences of the exit will be. The same applies, of course, to Portugal, Italy, Spain and Greece and, no doubt, others. The only sensible thing that the late and unlamented Labour government did was to keep Britain out of the euro. A sensible thing that the coalition government can do is to stop throwing good money after bad.</p>

The Irish Government horribly mismanaged our country, and it is a sad day for the Irish people that we are mentioned in this Chamber in these particular circumstances. But we are in a situation where we need solidarity. Perhaps Mr Batten does not understand that word, or that Ireland needs England as much as England needs Ireland and its economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are all very much interlinked: let us not forget that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Secondly, there is a question for the ECB to answer about what its mandate is. I think that was inferred in the opening remarks, because there are interlinked relationships between all banks. Those banks from Germany and France and other countries who invested in Irish banks need to look at what they did and why they did it.</p>

      <p sl="fi">It has to be said that Ireland’s problems are partly due to the fact that the country has a weak government. The political establishment now has to be careful that the cure is not worse than the disease. For example, the representative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance said here that the corporate income tax rate in Ireland should be raised to the European level, but that might actually be a death blow to Ireland, its growth and employment. The idea is to get the money back, in the form of growth and employment for Ireland, and not to punish the country. We need to help Ireland, not punish it.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, honourable Members, first of all, I wish to thank you for a very responsible debate.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Mrs Jaakonsaari said that the European Union has always developed through a series of crises. That is largely true, and that is also the case this time, in the short term, while we have to be like the fire brigade and put out the fires that now blaze and threaten financial stability in Europe. At present, we are working mainly in Ireland to safeguard the stability of the European economy. At the same time, we are trying to build a longer-term European architecture that will actually strengthen economic union and reinforce monetary union, which is already sturdy at the moment, by means of robust and genuine economic union, which, in other words, means the implementation of the original objective for economic and monetary union.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Both are important tasks, and we cannot afford to neglect either. Instead, we have to be like the fire brigade the whole time, putting out the forest fires and, at the same time, building a new European architecture for better regulation of the financial markets and for economic union to function more successfully.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Ireland is in difficulties. Mrs Jaakonsaari is well aware that we in Finland have a saying that translates roughly as ‘Help a man when he is in trouble, not when he is not’: this also applies just as well to women, of course. It is now very important that we all keep a cool head and try and support Ireland while it is in difficulties. This is not just for Ireland itself but also for European economic stability, so that we do not allow the first green shoots of recovery to be harmed by this situation. It is important that we make it possible for the European economy to grow sustainably and for us to be better capable of ensuring employment. This is the very issue: sustainable growth in the European economy, and employment.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I want to thank you for the substance of the debate and indeed, I agree with Mr Gauzès that yes, we need to explain better why we are doing what we are doing, and we have to reassure our citizens. These are tough and confusing times. They are prone to nervousness and misinformation, and therefore we all need to do our share in communicating properly on the challenges. Here the European Parliament and all of you, as citizens’ representatives, have a key role to play.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is not about finding someone to blame: it is about strengthening the European construction that has protected European citizens from much worse consequences. Any talk of deconstruction of the European project is irresponsible. All the Member States would have been in a much more difficult situation without the European Union and its protective shield. The euro is, and continues to be, the cornerstone of the European Union; it is not only a technical monetary arrangement, it is indeed the core political project of the European Union. Therefore, it is indeed essential that we do our best, do our utmost, to protect and reinforce this European construction.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I want to conclude by saying that Mrs Goulard made a very important point when she referred to the original objective of those who created the Economic and Monetary Union: to have a very strong political dimension, in fact, a political union. President Trichet is better placed to testify on that than me because he was there then, but I would tend to agree, and that is why in our legislative package, which is now in your hands and in the hands of the Council, we want to supplement the strong monetary union by finally creating a genuine and strong economic union. To my mind, it is indeed now high time in the EMU to fill the ‘E’ with life, and that is what the legislative package on reinforcing economic governance in the end is about.</p>
      <p sl="fi">(in response to Mr De Rossa, who had spoken with the microphone off.) Madam President, as you well know, I am ready to meet with the Irish MEPs to discuss issues related to Ireland, but – no matter how important and difficult the situation in Ireland is at the moment – this debate is about the ECB and Parliament’s report on the ECB.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There have been so many questions during this discussion concerning Ireland that it is simply not possible to respond to all of them. As I said, I am ready to meet with the Irish MEPs and I hope I can meet with all of you tomorrow so that we can discuss this more precisely.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-067" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jean-Claude Trichet" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the ECB">
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, let me say that the questions that have been asked are extremely pertinent and cover all the issues that are important today in great depth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will respond simultaneously to the Members of Parliament because a number of your questions converged.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, I would like to restate: we are responsible for the ‘M’ of EMU, the monetary union. We have a sentiment on the ‘E’, economic union, but we are responsible for the ‘M’ and what we have been instructed to do by the people of Europe, by the parliaments that voted the Maastricht Treaty, is to deliver price stability. This is our mandate. We are independent to deliver price stability to 330 million fellow citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I explained a moment ago, we have delivered price stability in line with our definition, which was in the continuity of the best definition in the world, and let me say that our definition of price stability now appears to be the global benchmark. We have delivered price stability over the nearly 12 years of the euro and we are credible for the next ten years according to all the information we have.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So I want that to be very clear, because – as Olli Rehn said – many of the questions I have are questions that deal with the economic union, which is, of course, part of EMU, but we are not responsible ourselves for economic union. We have our ideas; we have our recommendations; we have our diagnosis and analysis and I will come back to that of course.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second major remark: we are experiencing the worst crisis since World War II at a global level. Had we – both the central banks, including the ECB, and governments – not reacted rapidly and boldly, we would have experienced the worst crisis not since World War II, but since World War I, because we would have had a great depression and this fact – that we have avoided the great depression at global level – has called for immense action by governments and parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In our own analysis, the taxpayer risk that has been mobilised to help avoid a dramatic depression is approximately the same on both sides of the Atlantic in terms of GDP, approximately 27% of GDP. It was not, of course, utilised in terms of spending, it was even less utilised in terms of losses, if I may say, but nevertheless, it is an immense effort that has been made. Otherwise we would have had a dramatic crisis. Of course, this means that the global finance and the global economy is extremely fragile and we have to find ways at a global level to avoid this fragility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">But this is not a European crisis. It is the repercussion on Europe, on European governance, of a global crisis, and there is exactly the same kind of meditation and reflection on what to do in the US or in Japan, to mention only two other major advanced economies. They also have problems of the first magnitude and I would like us not to transform what is a legitimate reflection on how to run major advanced economies better into a criticism of the euro which, as I said, has delivered exactly in line with what was expected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me also say that when I look at the finance and fiscal position, the fiscal position of the major advanced economies, I can say that Europe as a whole and the EU area in particular is in a better situation – Mr Goebbels said this – than Japan or the US in terms of public financial deficit. Perhaps something like around 6%, even a little bit less, as a consolidated fiscal position next year, when it is of the order of magnitude of ten or more in the two other major advanced economies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I say that also for us to have an idea of the order of magnitude. So what we have is bad behaviour on the part of a number of countries that are creating problems in their own country and are creating financial instability. It is not the euro which is at stake; it is financial instability driven by bad behaviour of fiscal policies, of course, with the interaction with markets which is always there, as we are in market economies. Again, fundamentally, our diagnosis is that what was abnormal in the functioning of Europe was that we had poor governance, poor governance of the economic union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I can say, sadly, that this is not surprising because the Stability and Growth Pact has been criticised wrongly by some since the very beginning. And I have to remind you that I was myself reporting in Parliament on our battle because major countries wanted to blow up the pact, or at least to considerably weaken it. Sadly, I have to say that this was the major countries inside the euro area and that the small and medium-sized countries were resisting this tendency. This was in 2004 and 2005. You will remember it was a fierce battle because it went up to the Court of Justice, and the Commission – and I have to pay homage to the Commission – was lucid, more lucid at the time than the Council, and we were fully supporting the Commission. So I have to remind all of you of that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now I have had a number of questions on precisely what we are calling for at this stage. I have to say that we already said, when the Commission made its proposal, that we thought it was not enough.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Taking into account what we feel, taking into account what we see, in the functioning of Europe as a whole, the 27 and the 16 (and tomorrow 17), we considered that the first proposal of the Commission was too weak in terms of automaticity and in terms of rigour of the governance, both for the fiscal surveillance and for the competitiveness indicators, the imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, to the extent that the present state of the proposal which is made by the Council is even weakening the Commission proposal, we cannot say anything to you, honourable Members of Parliament, but that we trust that we are up to the demands of the situation; and the demands of the situation are that we need very strong surveillance, very strong governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In 2005, on behalf of the Governing Council, I said that we were not satisfied at all by what was, at the time, the position of the Council, and what was finally accepted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So I do not want to go further because we will have a number of occasions to be in contact with Parliament. I have, of course, noted what Mrs Goulard said in terms of very hard work of Parliament, together with the Council and the Commission, to work out what will finally be the position of Europe. But again, our message is very clear on that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now let me turn for just one minute to the issue of communication. We have, of course, to permanently improve our communication. We try to do that. Let me only say that as regards our own communication, we are giving the clear definition of price stability which permits everybody to judge what we are doing permanently in real time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to say that we were the first big major central bank to introduce press conferences immediately after the Governing Council. We were the first to publish an introductory statement which is our diagnosis of the situation. So we try to be as accountable in terms of communication as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The only thing that we do not do is to publish the individual position of the various members of the Governing Council. We trust that it is very important that for the institution which is issuing a currency for 16 states that are united in Europe, but are still sovereign states, it is better that it is the Governing Council as a whole which appears to be the pertinent entity in terms of our decision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now there were a number of very important questions. Let me only mention the remark that we are responsible for the ‘M’, but to the extent that the ‘E’ is in the hands of the governments and of the Commission, we have in this domain, of course, to take into account the ‘E’, as always, as any independent central bank does: if the fiscal policy is sound and reasonable, the burden on the monetary policy to deliver price stability is light. If we have a bad fiscal policy, then we are overburdening the decisions that have to be taken by the central bank.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would say it is the same for us in terms of interaction with the governments, but we are fiercely independent and the fact that we have had to embark on a number of non-standard measures, as I have explained, was to allow us to transmit our monetary policy impulses as well as possible in circumstances where markets were not functioning correctly and therefore, the decisions that we were taking on interest rates were not transmitted correctly to the economy as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the essence of the non-standard measures, to help restore a more normal functioning of the monetary policy transmission channels and we very clearly made the distinction – I repeated that in a recent colloquy we had in which Ben Bernanke participated – between the standard measures that are really what counts in terms of monetary policy stance, and the non-standard measures designed to help the transmission of monetary policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now let me only say that I also noted the important question …</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to Mr Gauzès’s question on communication, which I believe others have repeated, there is a tendency, in some communication channels, to consider Europe as some sort of scapegoat. If things go wrong, it is Europe’s fault. We know that this is not true, and the European Parliament, of course, knows it better than anyone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is also a tendency to say that if things do not go well, it is the Commission’s fault or it is the fault of the European Central Bank or, better still, it is the euro’s fault. This is the classic scapegoat phenomenon. The euro is the currency that has maintained its internal and external stability remarkably well. Moreover, I have not yet said that it is more remarkable than anything a central bank has ever done, within the founding countries of the euro, over the last 50 years – I saved that for last, if I may say so. I believe that we have here a currency that is, in fact, solid, and solid in historical terms, too. Therefore, let us beware of the scapegoat phenomenon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have to say that we all need to work very hard in terms of communication, but I also address that message to the European Central Bank and to the euro system as a whole; in other words, to all the national central banks that belong to the euro area. Moreover, I would say that this is also undoubtedly a problem faced by the 27, and hence a problem for the European Union as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I, too, would like to express my great thanks to Mr Trichet, Commissioner Rehn and, above all, the Members of this House for such an open and comprehensive debate. It has been highly objective, even if, towards the end, our honourable Members from Ireland sometimes let their emotions show through – which is quite understandable.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the brief time that I have available, I would like to mention three points. The first is the independence of the European Central Bank. I believe it was right and vital for the Heads of State or Government – under the general leadership of Helmut Kohl, a revered citizen of Europe and, at that time, the German Chancellor – to have instigated the independence of the ECB. The European Central Bank is the guardian of the euro. I believe that the euro has been as stable as it has in the recent months of the crisis precisely because, in the final event, we have such an ECB. I would therefore ask you, Mr Trichet, to continue to act as independently as possible in the months ahead. If people express their opinions to you, by all means listen to them; but in the final event, the president and managing board of the ECB must safeguard this independence.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we need to be more open with the citizens of the European Union. This is a important point. Above all, we should not always provide them with information in the language of Brussels, for which we have come in for some criticism, but in such a way that it is genuinely understood by those to whom we are sending the message – the people of Europe. As far as I am concerned, that is a very important point.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, Mr Trichet mentioned Basel III. This is another thing that I would certainly emphasise. We want to implement Basel III promptly. However, I only want to implement Basel III promptly if everyone at G20 level implements it simultaneously. We cannot have Europe taking the lead once again and being the sole trailblazer, to the great detriment of our international competitiveness. I would therefore argue that Europe should actually implement this together with its partners worldwide, or else consider what the alternatives are.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Balz for all his efforts in compiling this report. The austerity packages proposed for exiting the crisis should not result in measures which could jeopardise economic recovery. I believe that a balance needs to be struck between the economic consolidation process and the protection of investments through jobs and sustainable development. The lesson provided by the Member States which have entered the euro area unprepared must make us think seriously about setting realistic deadlines over time. In the current situation, a delay of one or two years may be acceptable. Enlargement must continue, with the prerequisite of meeting the Maastricht criteria. In this respect, I believe that adopting the euro should not be seen as a momentary solution, but as being part of a medium-term wide-ranging political strategy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome and support this report. However, we should keep in mind that, once all the talk about fiscal consolidation, regulation and macro-economic governance ends, we must examine what effect this has had on economic activity – which is the bottom line of any discussion. The reality is that we need good and effective regulation and better economic governance so that small and medium-sized businesses, which are the main driver of economic growth, develop and grow. The sad truth is that these businesses have suffered greatly in the past two years. As a result, we have high and rising unemployment. The ECB’s policy of pumping in billions of euro to help save indebted banks was the right thing to do, but many banks have become over-reliant on the ECB’s liquidity. So now we have a situation where banks which provided credit too readily in the boom years are refusing to grant credit to small businesses. If this continues then we will not have the growth needed to reduce budget deficits and government debt levels. Unemployment will rise, and our economic performance will stagnate. Let us act wisely if we do not want to fail the people of Europe again.</p>

The transitory system that has been used since 1993 is continuously being extended, and we all know that this situation is not a sustainable one and that we need to find a more lasting solution.</p>
      <p sl="mt">The current transitory system is not yielding the desired results when it comes to the internal market. This system diminishes businesses’ efficiency and also restricts their effectiveness between borders. It is also worrying that this system gives rise to complex forms of fraud, such as carousel fraud, which we discussed recently within this very Parliament. These bear a seriously negative impact on the Member States’ income. The solution facing us is not an easy one, and the right solution can be adopted only after an in-depth debate and long consultation periods have taken place.</p>
      <p sl="mt">We are all aware of the Commission’s recent commitment to draw up a Green Paper in the near future in order to stimulate a discussion on this issue. The report I am in charge of urges the Commission to ensure that the process is an efficient one and that we do everything in our power to ensure that, firstly, the new system will improve the internal market’s effectiveness; secondly, that this new system reduces the burdens on the business sector; and thirdly, that it combats fraud as effectively as possible.</p>
      <p sl="mt">This report, which, as we know, has already been approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, also urges the Commission to ensure that the concrete proposals will be made public by 2013. Let me underline this last point: I am not proposing that they should have a system that is adopted and in place by 2013. I am saying that the proposals must be made public by 2013.</p>
      <p sl="mt">What I would like, however, and I believe I am expressing the viewpoint of the Members in this Chamber, is for this new system to be up and running before the end of this legislature, so that the current transitory system need not be re-extended. Whilst we will approve the extension of the new system, we expect concrete steps to be taken without delay in reflecting upon these new proposals.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I would like to thank my colleagues, especially the shadow rapporteurs, for this report, and I augur that more fervent discussions on this topic will take place, which will give way to a speedy solution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, David Casa, for his constructive and quick report on the Commission’s proposal to extend by five years the existing rules on the minimum standard VAT rate. This proposal is simple and is not controversial.</p>
      <p sl="en">A quick opinion of the European Parliament on the Commission’s proposal will allow the Council to adopt the proposal before the end of the year – just in time, before the current rule expires. The proposal has indeed already been discussed in the Council working party. No obstacle appeared to a speedy approval.</p>
      <p sl="en">As stated by David Casa, the Commission’s proposal will give businesses the necessary legal certainty and allow further evaluation of the appropriate level of the standard VAT rate at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will indeed launch very soon a broad debate on the future of VAT in order to evaluate and address the numerous shortcomings in the EU VAT system such as its complexity, the high level of administrative burdens for businesses, and fraud.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before the end of the year, I will propose to my fellow Commissioners the publication of a Green Paper on the evaluation of the current system and preferable ways forward for the future. I am looking forward to reactions as regards such issues as how to achieve a simpler, more robust and modern VAT system and how to reduce collection and compliance costs for businesses, in particular, SMEs, whilst limiting fraud and providing flexibility for Member States. On the basis of the results obtained, the Commission will define its future policy in the VAT area in a Communication on the way forward at the end of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">The amendments tabled clearly demonstrate the Parliament’s interest in participating in this discussion on the future VAT strategy. I welcome this sign of interest and hope to have a fruitful debate with you on this important issue at a later stage. However, I consider that these amendments are outside the scope of the proposal discussed today, which is limited to extending the period during which the minimum standard rate applies. Moreover, some of the amendments pre-empt a debate we should have on the basis of the Green Paper. This applies, in particular, to the amendment which requests the Commission to come up with a proposal on definitive rules on VAT rates by 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">At this stage, the Commission cannot commit on a date to table a proposal on VAT rates. It cannot predict the outcome of the consultation, whose scope will be broader than the VAT rates. I hope that this consultation will give a clear idea of the priorities for the future of VAT. The Commission’s planning for future legislative proposals will therefore depend to a great extent on the outcome of this consultation.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the Commission’s proposal focuses on allowing the current system to continue to run until 2015 and an endeavour to restrict tax rate bands to 10%. This is very important, because otherwise, competition between Member States might be distorted in certain sectors.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Central to this parliamentary report is the notion that it will not be long before the Commission initiates a broad programme of consultation to establish a new system of value added tax. In my opinion, the amendments that Members have tabled are, contrary to the view of the Commissioner, extremely important, as even at this stage, we want to mark the direction in which we hope that this new VAT system will go. In future, we need to be able to lighten the administrative burden associated with VAT and make it as easy as possible for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, to produce reports, though at the same time effectively combating VAT fraud.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The public economy in many European countries at present is in a mess, and one solution proposed is to start to raise VAT rates. However, that will not be of any help in countries where it is common to avoid paying VAT. Here, I would like to refer to the report by Mr Casa adopted earlier on here. It focused, in particular, on ways to combat VAT fraud in connection with goods and services that were prone to this sort of abuse. I hope that the Commission will actually start to do something about this in the future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, as indicated in the Council’s proposal for a directive, the minimum VAT rate has helped keep the system operating at an acceptable level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that we should consider having a common regulatory framework which would include the conclusions reached following the experience of the budgetary imbalances highlighted by the financial crisis. A new European VAT strategy is required, focused on reducing red tape and the fiscal obstacles which hamper businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. We must also consider the need to prevent and combat fraud. However, until this strategy has been finalised, I believe that the decision to extend the transitional provision on the minimum VAT rate until 31 December 2015 is intended to reassure the business community, prevent structural imbalances in the European Union and encourage harmonisation of fiscal legislation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Pending the Commission Green Paper on the review of the VAT system, I would like to highlight the tendency of some governments facing recession to increase the VAT rate to 24-25%, as has happened in Romania and Hungary. The relative commitment to keep the maximum VAT rate within a 10% range above the 15% limit has been observed up to now. However, I believe that we need an absolute ban in this respect to prevent any breaches of the 25% threshold. Let us not forget that beyond these statistics, we are dealing with ordinary citizens whose standard of living is being increasingly affected by austerity policies and excessive taxation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to end by saying that overtaxation is not a remedy for an ailing economy. It only serves to prolong the agony.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much. As a matter of principle, I believe that we should avoid controlling consumption by means of VAT rates. However, as long as exceptions and reduced VAT rates do not obviously interfere with the free market, we have hitherto chosen to accept differences between EU Member States. However, as you well know, Professor Monti states in his report on the single market that current differences can also adversely affect the single market. It is therefore important for us to call for a definitive system of VAT rates and to clearly point out that a review of the VAT Directive should use the single market strategy as a guideline rather than the separate interests of the individual countries.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is also important, as the Commissioner says, for us to focus on reducing the administrative burdens, removing tax barriers and improving the business environment, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, while at the same time ensuring that we create a system that stands firm against fraud.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Taxes are, of course, a very national matter and one in which the nations’ self-determination is important. At the same time, it is important to remember that a well-functioning internal market probably requires more and closer cooperation, including with regard to matters of taxation, than we have today. I therefore hope that the Commission – and the Commissioner – will have the courage to tackle these issues in its forthcoming proposals and that these proposals will actually take as their starting point a well-functioning internal market, despite national opposition. Difficult questions in difficult times require detailed analysis.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, in the submitted proposal, the Commission proposes applying a minimum standard VAT rate of 15% for a further 5 years up to 2015. Even though I understand the Commission’s argument that it wants, through this directive, to provide companies with legal certainty, I think that the VAT analysis requires some very intensive work. The reason for this, in my opinion, is that many companies and many cases of tax losses in cross-border trade show that the VAT system in Europe is very badly organised.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is not just a problem of the actual rate; it is a problem of the rules applied on the national market and in international trade, which allow these scams to operate quite legitimately in many cases. I would therefore like to use my speech to make a call for the review of the entire VAT system, which I think would be in the interests both of our economies and of our businesses. I consider a deadline of 2013 to be quite realistic, and we should simply move forward on this problem not by sorting out the rates, but by sorting out the rules.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, taxes are, at best, a necessary evil, and should always reflect spending needs. A tax rate that is set before spending needs are decided is a recipe for taking people’s money and then deciding what to spend it on. It is a recipe for profligacy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Harmonisation of VAT rates to a common standard and a common reduced rate, which was the proposal of the Commission back in 1993, would take yet more power out of the hands of Member States. The levying of taxation is one of the defining characteristics of a sovereign state. It will be yet another step towards the sovereign state being the European Union, and Member States simply being powerless appendices to it. Combating fraud and easing burdens on SMEs are red herrings. VAT harmonisation is about centralisation and the consolidation of EU power.</p>

There is a noticeable degree of imbalance in relation to the development of the internal market. For this reason, European businesses have been put at a disadvantage. In addition, the VAT system, as currently designed and implemented by Member States, has weaknesses that fraudsters use to their advantage.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to call on the Commission to present the results of its analyses. It will also have to arrange consultations on the new VAT strategy with all stakeholders. In this respect, common aspects will have to be dealt with, such as reduced VAT rates, exemptions from the scheme, the option to set a maximum rate and, last but not least, the place of taxation of intra-EU supplies.</p>

      <p sl="en">As I indicated in my opening remarks, I welcome the spirit of the amendments relating to the future of VAT. Nevertheless, the Commission considers that this technical proposal only concerns the periodical extension of the minimum level of the standard VAT rate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The outcome of the consultations on a new VAT strategy is only mentioned in order to justify the reason why it is premature to set a permanent standard rate level. There is therefore no need to refer to the aims and the framework of the new VAT strategy in this context at this stage.</p>

      <p sl="de">For most EU Member States and third countries with internationally interlinked markets, VAT (or sales tax) is one of the main sources of financing for the state. Sales tax is therefore at least as important as direct taxes. Maintaining a minimum standard rate of 15% for the next 5 years will aid competition in the internal market and will provide legal certainty for companies. With regard to the reduced VAT rates in the EU, in the case of reduced VAT rates on certain services, such as repairs, hairdressing or beauty treatment businesses, the Commission must also take care to avoid distortions of competition. Such forms of tax relief have a negative effect on Austrian small businesses, for example, which may not be able to stand up to competition from Slovakian or Hungarian service providers. The solution to this is as follows: YES to the targeted subsidising of SMEs, including by means of sales tax, BUT while avoiding distortions of competition between the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission is deeply concerned by the deterioration of the cholera situation in Haiti.</p>
      <p sl="en">The number of casualties among the hospitalised cases is increasing sharply day by day. The number of people admitted to hospitals comes to more than 20 000. At the end of last week, more than 1 100 people had already lost their lives. But it is feared that these figures are severely underestimated. The fatality rate is very high and shows that people arrive too late at health centres.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cholera treatment is simple, but early access to treatment is key to limiting fatalities. Treating cholera patients also requires considerable human resources. The Haitian public health system is now seriously overstretched, despite substantial support from the international community.</p>
      <p sl="en">Médecins sans Frontières, as one of the front-line medical actors, is calling on all groups and agencies present in Haiti to step up the size and speed of their efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">The whole country is now affected. The epidemic is spreading at an alarming rate in the capital, Port-au-Prince. Slums such as Cité Soleil are especially prone to contagion due to very bad hygiene conditions and poor access to clean water.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are focusing on saving lives through prompt treatment of those affected, increasing access to clean water, promoting better hygiene behaviour and supporting epidemiological surveillance in order to know where and how the epidemic is evolving.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has reinforced its humanitarian presence with relevant medical expertise and mobilised funds – EUR 12 million – to support partners in Haiti.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European mechanism for civil protection has also been activated through the Monitoring and Information centre of the European Commission and has already cofinanced the transport of in-kind assistance provided by France.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another offer from Austria has just entered the pipeline. An EU civil protection and technical support team with Member States’ experts is to be deployed early this week. Experts from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have been deployed by DG SANCO to assess the best way to reinforce epidemiological surveillance in Haiti, and further cooperation is under consideration.</p>
      <p sl="en">After the recent incidents related to civil unrest in Cap Haitien and Port-au-Prince, we are following closely the security situation with our partners and the relevant UN agencies, particularly ahead of the presidential elections of 28 November.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission was in touch with the UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordination, Baroness Amos. We fully support her in stressing the importance of allowing national and international aid workers to continue lifesaving activities without disruption.</p>
      <p sl="en">Considering the serious and rapid deterioration of the cholera situation, further contributions are urgently required to fill gaps in health, water, sanitation, hygiene and logistics. Priorities include medical personnel and other personnel specialised in water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as medical supplies, beds, water purification units and tablets. The Commission is therefore in contact with the Belgian Presidency and the Member States to encourage further EU support to help Haiti at this very critical and difficult time. EU support can be channelled through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">The endless efforts of Haitian and international aid workers to meet the current challenges on the ground are commendable, but it is clear that the sheer scale of the crisis requires even more assets and resources. We are therefore now working hard on stepping up our emergency response together with our partners, but difficult times are certainly ahead, due to the rapidly evolving situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The continued solidarity of the international community with the Haitian people remains absolutely essential. This is why I call upon you all to do your utmost to scale up the support of the Member States in order to avoid a major humanitarian disaster.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, the cholera epidemic has already claimed more than 1 200 lives, and more than 52 000 people are infected. Thus, in spite of the strong presence of international organisations in Haiti, the situation is deteriorating daily, and the epidemic could infect some 400 000 people in the next few months.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am, of course, delighted at the EUR 12 million released by the European Commission, and I support Mrs Georgieva’s appeal to the Member States to provide aid in kind so that water can be purified, and to supply equipment. Providing drinking water and toilet facilities is the only way to reduce the number of people infected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One of the priority actions is to reassure the population frightened by this disease, which is unknown in the country. Communicating with the populations is essential in order to provide information about the disease and to avert it, but also to prevent internal violence from spreading, especially since the country is in the middle of elections.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This new crisis has once again highlighted the inability of the Haitian authorities and of the health system to cope with this crisis. The country has suffered numerous disasters for years. The earthquake in Haiti demonstrated the almost total incompetence of the local authorities. Following the earthquake, there was genuine political will to reconstruct Haiti differently, and there were many promises of donations. Almost a year later, reconstruction has hardly begun, and those involved in development are pessimistic. The European Commission must act as a driver in the reconstruction process so that Haiti finally emerges from this chaos.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I welcome once again the swiftness of the European Union’s humanitarian intervention. However, at the same time, I believe that our efforts in this country must focus on building a minimum operational state structure at a time when the state of Haiti is just a sham. It is failing to fulfil its basic duties such as organising refugee camps, maintaining order and providing hygienic conditions and drinking water. This vulnerability has facilitated the rapid spread of disease and the death of more than 1 200 people.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Haiti needs a state which can do something for its poor. Three out of four Haitians are surviving on less than USD 2 a day. More than 1.5 million citizens are living in refugee camps, posing a serious source of risk to public health and safety.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the Haitian state’s weakness is now the main risk factor. Its lack of authority means that the population’s discontent is being targeted at UN forces. Indeed, NGOs risk no longer being able to accomplish their mission. This is why the elections on 28 November are vital and must not be postponed, despite calls from some quarters.</p>

      <p sl="fr">For the moment, the aid workers on the ground have confirmed to us that soap, substances to make the water fit to drink, and proper hygiene education are needed. Preparations are being made in the present situation for the long term as well. In a country in which everything is still to be done or redone, reconstruction is necessary after the earthquake, and priority must be given to building infrastructure that is designed to improve both individual and collective hygiene.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that, eight months after the New York conference on the reconstruction of Haiti, it will no longer be possible to cite a lack of funds as an excuse for the little progress recorded to date, given that all the speakers agreed that the humanitarian phase must continue for many months yet.

      <p sl="en">Apart from being an individual disaster for millions of people, a failure would also be a backlash for the international community’s effort and capacity to conduct a joint effort in humanitarian aid. I believe that we have to put all our experience, all the lessons we have learnt in Haiti and elsewhere, and also enough money, into the pot. Therefore, I very much welcome the Commission’s announcement that it will put an additional EUR 12 million into the fight against cholera.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to make sure that this support reaches Haiti immediately, that it arrives in full and not just in part, and that we support the right initiatives in order to make it effective.

This is not a terribly hard disease to cure. But you have got to be there to see the conditions under which the aid workers are working and when you talk about a health service, I am sorry, Mr President, Haiti does not have a health service like the rest of us and you know it: they are dependent on Médecins Sans Frontières, the British Red Cross and many other organisations from all around the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as the election is concerned, it is true that Haiti does not need an election at this moment. But until they get a President and a Prime Minister who can lead them, they will have no chance of moving forward.

      <p sl="fr">Last January, after the earthquake, the international community rallied round strongly in support of Haiti. However, it seems that there was a gap, not to say a gulf, between the promises made and the aid that in fact arrived on the ground. Last March, Baroness Ashton made a commitment, on behalf of the European Union, to provide aid worth EUR 1.235 billion to help the people of Haiti to build a better future.</p>

The situation has scarcely changed since then, yet people are amazed that the cholera epidemic is spreading very fast, and the international community is again beginning to feel pity. There have already been more than a thousand deaths, and the number of people affected is increasing all the time, even though specialists say that the measures to prevent the disease from proving fatal are relatively simple to take. However, health workers have little training in this disease, and there are problems in getting basic healthcare products to where they are needed.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Where exactly is all the aid that the European Union promised to Haiti, and not just the humanitarian aid?</p>
      <p sl="fr">If it had arrived sooner, do you not think that this further tragedy could have been avoided?</p>
      <p sl="fr">How is it that, once again, international conferences seem to have resulted only in unkept promises?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why are President Préval’s efforts to turn MINUSTAH into support for reconstruction not meeting with any response?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the Haitian population wants the elections to take place, but under what conditions will they take place and what sort of support will the European Union provide?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite all the warnings which were made against neglecting the future of Haiti following the earthquake in January, the news in recent days seems to show that the island has been abandoned by the international community at the most critical moment, that of reconstruction.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, cholera, something which few people in Haiti know about and which is ultimately given a mystic, religious significance, is now spreading. The United Nations peacekeepers have been accused of spreading this contagion. It took just one Nepalese soldier on the island to become infected for hundreds of people, women and children, to besiege the general headquarters of the peace force. Humanitarian workers have also felt threatened and many are leaving the country.</p>
      <p sl="it">The tension is extremely high, and much of the rubble caused by the very violent earthquake of 12 January remains on the streets and in the town squares. We have heard that there is not enough water and that it is therefore impossible for people to wash and to protect themselves against infection.</p>
      <p sl="it">The vibrio is spreading rapidly, and the number of dead is rising exponentially. The figures have already been given, but I want to repeat them: to date, there have been 1 130 victims, and the number of hospital admissions has risen to more than 18 000 in one month. However, there are thousands of others who report symptoms of infection every day.</p>
      <p sl="it">The international community cannot delay any longer. A solution must be found immediately, otherwise any further infection will remain forever on our conscience.</p>

      <p sl="en">The easiest and cheapest thing for this House to do now is to criticise. I would like us to be positive and place the pressure where it needs to be. I say this to all Members of this House. We need to put pressure on our own Member States to bring forward more aid, and more aid in kind. If you look at the list of countries, these are countries – such as Spain, Ireland, Italy, France, Austria, Hungary – currently facing grave economic situations, yet they have dug deep. Therefore, I urge each and every one of us to contact our own governments and ask them to commit. If there are questions as to whether aid is getting through or not, let us build the capacity to get the aid through.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I should like to thank the Commissioner and congratulate her on the commitment of the extra EUR 12 million. The great tragedy is the earthquake. The even greater tragedy now is this cholera epidemic.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first the epicentre of a terrible earthquake, in precisely the poorest and worst-governed area in the American hemisphere, and now cholera in the country which receives one of the highest amounts of per capita international aid. What a contradiction! It is not just a terrible combination of bad luck: in Haiti, in the streets crowded with children and tents crammed in amongst the rubbish, no one knows where to begin.</p>
      <p sl="it">The local political class is often greedy and focused on power games rather than taking control of the reconstruction efforts, and the bureaucratic machine, decimated by the earthquake, has a weak administrative culture and, in some cases, has even obstructed the distribution of aid. There are many, often badly run, international organisations and, in fact, they have failed to protect the population.</p>
      <p sl="it">Visiting the country with the European Parliament delegation in June, the concentration of abandoned fields, rubble which had not been removed and rubbish already gave a clear indication of how bad the situation could become. Now cholera is here.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission and the Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) have so far done what was required, but they must now redouble their efforts. My feeling is that now, as well as strong recovery action, Haiti needs greater protection at the international political level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is a tragedy that does not bear talking about. When the disaster struck in January last year, the international community descended on Haiti with great fanfare. Military helicopters came to lift heavy pieces of masonry that had fallen down. They have all gone. They suddenly left. Those pieces of masonry are blocking roads and there is no access, and the road network has broken down. Commissioner Georgieva has been trying hard to coordinate the activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why did this happen? Why did all those people – including Secretary of State Clinton, who suddenly turned up there in January – suddenly disappear? Why is the United Nations now being asked to disappear? When are they going to ask the EU to disappear? This is ridiculous.

The outbreak of another epidemic in Haiti was to be expected. Since the start of the year, and since the earthquake, we have been working hard, but the work has not advanced as quickly as we hoped. We have spoken often about the situation prevailing in Haiti before the earthquake.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It would certainly have helped us if Haiti had been a functioning state, but it is not, and nor will it be for a long time yet. There is much ground to be covered. There is now a need for urgent action, as we are risking further epidemics and further violence.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this afternoon, I received the latest information from a Dutch aid agency which has had a presence in Haiti for many years, and that information actually confirms the sombre, but realistic, picture that the Commission has described. At the same time, the Dutch aid agency have told me that they have put their trust in Europe, in particular, as a major donor. What is it then that they are relying on us to do? Well, although a huge amount was pledged at the international donor conference, only a fraction of it has been received. Now the United Nations has requested additional funding, but a large part of the money that has been pledged has not yet been received. I hope, therefore, that the European Union will take the lead in ensuring that the money really comes through because the situation in Haiti is distressing. Of course, prevention and clean drinking water are the priorities. I hope that the European Union will take the initiative to ensure good water supplies for Haiti. Experts, the digging of water wells, clean drinking water and also medical care are particularly important. All of these are in short supply. I appeal to the Netherlands, but also to the European institutions, to ensure that they actually come to Haiti’s aid immediately in this acute emergency.</p>

It is very important that the European Union has a very strong and visible role to play in Haiti. However, this is about our fellow human beings, our fellow creatures. We also have a responsibility for them, as they have been the victims of an unparalleled catastrophe: first an earthquake and now a cholera epidemic.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is important that when we send money and aid there, it gets to its destination quickly. Many Christian aid organisations have been doing a good job there, and it appears that they also have effective channels for delivering aid promptly to those in need of it.

This way, it will be possible to get the aid to its destination and achieve the best possible result.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you all for your engagement and discussion on a topic that is, unfortunately, going to be with us for quite some time to come. This is not an easy crisis to resolve.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have had some estimates about the scale of the problem over the coming months – including from our own experts – and I agree very much with those who said we need to deploy expertise from the European Centre for Disaster Control in Haiti. The estimates are that somewhere between half a million and 720 000 people will be infected before this wave of epidemics is over.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Pan American Health Organisation estimate of 400 000 is a little lower but of the same order of magnitude. So we will have to mobilise. I agree with each and every one of you who spoke about immediate mobilisation and the need to help right now.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me make four points. The first is how we can best help. This is a time when we have to deploy true partner organisations and immediately give them the resources to act. We also have to call on the Member States to provide in-kind assistance. Since Thursday, when I addressed the Member States, we have been seeing support coming through, but more is needed in terms of healthcare professionals, water purification tablets and support for an awareness campaign, because – as many here have said – there is widespread misunderstanding of what this disease is and how it can best be treated. As a result, people die unnecessarily because they are scared to go to treatment centres: they are afraid of catching the disease there rather than being treated for it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, a number of speakers have talked about the pledged money and what is happening with reconstruction in Haiti. The pledge made by the Commission has been honoured. The Commission committed EUR 460 million and is delivering according to the timetable which it announced, and the High Representative and Vice-President, Cathy Ashton, and Commissioner Piebalgs are about to take stock with Member States on where we stand with the money we have promised to provide. I can assure you that this is going to be taken very seriously, because the reputation of the international community is at stake at a very difficult time.</p>
      <p sl="en">However – and this is my third point, which is a very important one – there is a limit to the absorptive capacity in Haiti, which I believe I talked about with some of you. When I first arrived in Haiti, I thought that, terrible as this disaster was, it was not Haiti’s worst problem. Haiti’s biggest problem was the many decades of lack of development and the absence of a functional state which, among other things, also means the absence of a functional health service.</p>
      <p sl="en">I saw people in camps queuing in front of a doctor, not because they were sick, but because they had never seen a doctor in their lives and were taking advantage of a health service being offered in the camps.</p>
      <p sl="en">This total lack of the skills and capabilities of a functional state creates problems that are making this epidemic worse. We are still struggling to get the government to authorise space for the disposal of dead bodies – without which the epidemics can, of course, spread further – and to dislodge latrines so that sanitation can improve. So I cannot stress strongly enough how critical it is for us to understand that Haiti’s problems are not easy to resolve, because at the heart of this problem is these decades of lack of development and the absence of a functional state.</p>
      <p sl="en">A question was asked about the elections and whether they should still be held. The Haitian authorities prefer to stick to the timetable. It is difficult for me to give an answer. I have not yet been to Haiti, but my feeling is that cancelling or postponing the elections might actually destabilise a very difficult situation. There may be something to be gained by holding the elections but, as I have said, this is based on what I have heard, not on what I have seen.</p>
      <p sl="en">My fourth point concerns engagement. You called for the Commission to be very directly engaged: we are, and will continue to be so. Baroness Ashton will very probably be in Haiti tomorrow, and I am planning to go myself because at this point, mobilisation, good coordination and, frankly, also giving hope to people there, and to our own staff, are important. Our own people are struggling with a very difficult situation: they are in places where the Haitian health officials become scared by the epidemic and just leave, and they then have to handle a massive increase in cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we need to do now is to make sure that we retain a calm presence and try to steer the course for people which gives them the most hope. One Member spoke about the Haitian people being very resilient. They are, and they deserve all our help at this very difficult time.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would firstly like to acknowledge, thank and congratulate the inshore fishing sector of the Bay of Biscay for its responsible behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, the sector urgently needs this plan if it is to achieve its objective, namely, to carry on a profitable activity without jeopardising the future of the fishing ground. This requires maintaining anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay at a level that allows for sustainable exploitation in economic, environmental and social terms. This can be done much more effectively by calculating yields on the basis of scientific reports rather than allowing total allowable catch (TAC) calculations to become subject to obscure political negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="es">The rules of exploitation must therefore be addressed in the plan, and this means that fishing quotas must be established on the basis of stock estimations obtained from scientific reports.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, this initiative was tabled by the Commission in July 2009. We started working in September. We established a work procedure together with the entire Spanish and French sectors represented by fishermen’s organisations, scientific institutes and the South Western Waters Regional Advisory Council. Following this method, we worked on a joint proposal that received broad support in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">Having achieved a high level of consensus and being conscious of the impending entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the uncertainty surrounding how it should be applied to cases that were already open, on 30 November, we held an indicative vote in the Committee on Fisheries. This open and inclusive approach has run up against a very different attitude on the part of the Council and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">For a start, we learnt in the course of our work that a control regulation was being prepared which would affect this report, although we only received limited information on this matter. This plunged us into uncertainty in a way that could quite easily have been avoided. Following the vote in the Committee on Fisheries and during the Spanish Presidency, I negotiated the initiative with the Council. We decided to call a trialogue meeting but, to our surprise, on the same day of the meeting, the Spanish Presidency unexpectedly announced to us that, at the request of the French Government, the Spanish Government had decided to postpone the issue as it was unsure about its legal basis. After months of work, we had stalemate. The Spanish Presidency had no agreement and no possibility of a trialogue.</p>
      <p sl="es">I asked the new Presidency whether it was willing to continue negotiations. They told me not to be impatient, not to hurry. In view of the Council’s utter unwillingness to move forward, we took a new vote, following advice from legal services.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this second vote, three amendments were rejected which had been adopted in the indicative vote and which were of crucial importance to the sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first one relates to exploitation rates and proposes 0.4 as a more appropriate rate.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second amendment refers to the inclusion of live bait in the TAC. It would be a mistake to count it as part of the caught quota.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, the third amendment refers to the review of catches.</p>
      <p sl="es">If the Scientific Committee is unable to produce an estimate of the current biomass because it lacks sufficient information, the sector must not be doubly penalised with a 25% reduction of the TAC on the previous year. The Commission had already considered it more appropriate in this case to reduce the TAC by 10%, in no event less than 7 000 tonnes. As regards the powers of this institution, they have been consistently disregarded by the Council and the Commission. The fact that even as we are debating this initiative, we have heard unofficial news that the Council has requested its withdrawal, gives a clear indication of its attitude.</p>
      <p sl="es">Is this true? I am asking you now, Commissioner. Why? What do you intend to do? I would like an answer today. I would also like the Belgian Presidency to tell me why it has requested the withdrawal of the initiative. I would like some clear answers on these issues. We have been working for 14 months and all we have is confusion.</p>
      <p sl="es">The actions of the Council and the Commission are damaging the credibility of the European institutions in the eyes of a sector that is tired of this way of doing things and needs solutions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Strengthen your credibility in this sector! Or at least win back the credibility you have lost since September 2009!</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament is determined to exercise the codecision powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon. You must respect them. Your actions do not match up to 21st century leadership. Our guiding principles have been transparency and participation. Please adopt these principles. This is how the European project must move forward.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I wish to sincerely thank all those who helped me during the preparation of this important report on Atlantic Horse Mackerel: the shadow rapporteurs, the secretariat of the Committee on Fisheries, the Pelagic RAC, the group policy adviser and the adviser from my own office. I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council for their help and support. The collaboration and discussion, and the input of ideas from all these people, ensured that I was able to place this report – which I would hope would be generally accepted – before you today.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The western stock of horse mackerel is one of the most important stocks for the fisheries sector in Europe. The proposal is based on the implementation plan agreed by the European Commission and the UN world summit on sustainable development in 2002.</p>
      <p sl="ga">At this summit, the Commission agreed to maintain or to restore fish stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield. The subsequent proposal by the European Commission was drafted in close cooperation with the pelagic Resource Assessment Group (RAG), which had originally put forward this proposal. Egg surveys for horse mackerel have been conducted every three years since 1997. The data collected was insufficient to allow the scientists to make a full assessment as to the health of the stock.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The proposed management plan addresses these difficulties by establishing a formula for vessels in the horse mackerel fishery, known as the harvest control rule. This rule provides for a mechanism for calculating an annual ceiling of maximum allowable landings of horse mackerel harvested from the defined area. The plan was expected to come into operation in late 2009 but was delayed due to the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Of course, I fully respect the rights of the Council to set and to allocate fishing opportunities. I met with representatives from the Belgian Presidency prior to the adoption of my report in the Fisheries Committee. They suggested a proposal which would provide the Council with a degree of flexibility in terms of the total removable amount when setting the total allowable catch. I believe that this proposal by the Belgian Presidency, which was subsequently adopted by the Fisheries Committee, protects the Council’s exclusive right under the treaties to set and to allocate fishing opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I would like to discuss the amendments proposed by the PPE, the S&amp;D and the GUE/NGL political groups in relation to Area 8C – in other words, the Bay of Biscay. I would like to inform the House that, as rapporteur, I support the amendment tabled by the socialists but cannot accept the PPE and the GUE/NGL amendments. I will give my reasons for that.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The scientific advice is clear. This is one stock which covers the entire geographical area. Should Parliament adopt the PPE and GUE/NGL proposal, it would make a nonsense of the management plan to introduce two separate tagged areas for one stock. If we did this, it would establish a very dangerous and a very serious precedent for future mackerel management plans. We could not agree to the splitting of a single fisheries stock.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Those who wish to support this will be doing so for their own personal reasons and for the reasons of their Member States, but this is a common fisheries policy and we must adhere to this. I appreciate that our Spanish and Portuguese colleagues may have concerns, and I have included those concerns in Amendment 7 in the draft report. It states that this plan shall be implemented taking account of artisanal fisheries and historic rights.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In conclusion, this amendment is acceptable to the Council and the pelagic RAG and takes into consideration the views expressed by the Spanish and Portuguese colleagues. But let us keep the policy as it is.</p>

    <intervention id="1-114" speaker_id="96790" name="Marek Józef Gróbarczyk" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to start my speech by expressing my very sincere thanks to everyone who helped in the preparation of this report: the European Commission, all the shadow rapporteurs and the members of the Committee on Fisheries, for their support in drawing up this report. We achieved complete agreement, as the report was adopted unanimously by the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries. Once again, I would like to express my very sincere thanks.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report, which aims to regulate fishing of flatfish in the Baltic Sea and to stop the practice of discarding while maintaining the model of fisheries management known as total allowable catch (TAC), indicates that this system is functioning properly and has a practical application for certain species of fish. This is why the significance of the introduction of Article 15a into Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 should be highlighted. The species of fish caught may have a low market value or may not be fit for human consumption. It should also be stressed that this provision allows for the removal from deck of live flounder which have been caught and which have no market value during the period when protective restrictions are in force. This is why this article will allow the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The action plan adopted on the basis of my report must eliminate discards in the Baltic Sea, for example, by the introduction, where appropriate, of a complete ban on discards in the Baltic Sea fishery. This must result in sustainable and more efficient management of marine resources. Bringing in a complete ban on discards in the case of flounder or other flatfish is not justified, as this will have a negative impact on their stocks. Bearing in mind the need for the fishery to remain stable and predictable, and for fish stocks to be exploited within established limits, concern should be expressed that a ban on discards might be used to legalise the large-scale industrial fishing of under-sized cod in the Baltic Sea. Due to a lack of reliable scientific data on the basis of which cod by-catches in industrial fisheries can be assessed, it is essential that full documentation of catches should be introduced immediately, together with full monitoring of the vessels engaged in these fishing activities. There must be 100% monitoring of industrial catches at landing, otherwise the policy of protecting Baltic fish stocks would be unrealistic and the long-term cod management plan pointless.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Union must take immediate action under the common fisheries policy to settle the issue of industrial fishing in the Baltic Sea, bearing in mind that, from an environmental point of view, such fishing is harmful to the Baltic’s ecosystem, particularly as the Baltic Sea has been classified as a ‘particularly sensitive sea area’ by the International Maritime Organisation’s Marine Environment Protection Committee, and is therefore among the most precious and most sensitive marine ecosystems in the world. In view of the climate changes in the Baltic Sea which are causing different species of fish to adapt to this, meaning that their migration and spawning patterns are also changing, a review should be carried out of the marine protection areas in the Baltic Sea and a long-term management plan for flatfish species drawn up in this area. In view of a lack of reliable and up-to-date data on the basis of which a decision can be taken to leave certain areas of the Baltic Sea unprotected, the changes which are occurring should be taken into consideration and a review of protected areas carried out.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As the Commission itself notes, the introduction of alien species into Europe’s coastal seas and inland waters is due in a great many cases to aquaculture and stocking practices. The Commission’s proposed amendment to the regulation concerning the use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture is based on the results of a research project, the IMPASSE project, which has brought together various European institutions in a concerted action focusing on the environmental impacts of alien species in aquaculture.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This project proposes an operational definition of a closed aquaculture facility, giving greater detail to and expanding the definition currently in use. In line with this definition and according to the conclusions of the project, ‘the degree of risk associated with alien species could be reduced considerably, possibly to an acceptable level, if the potential for escape of target and non-target organisms is addressed during transportation and by well-defined protocols at the receiving facility’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In view of the results of this project, the Commission is proposing to ease the unnecessary administrative formalities required of operators by proposing to dispense with the permit requirement for introductions and translocations for closed aquaculture facilities. It should be stressed here that, while the risk assessment process is based on scientific and technical analyses, the verdict on the acceptability of risk is the subject of a political decision. We therefore believe that relaxing the introduction procedure for alien species in aquaculture must go hand in hand with the most stringent definition possible of the requirements with which closed aquaculture facilities will have to comply, in keeping with the results of the IMPASSE project.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The need to supervise the facilities must also be established, with the aim of ensuring that all technical requirements put forward by the experts are actually taken into account and complied with during the operation of the facilities. This also applies to the care to be taken in transporting target and non-target species to or from the facilities. These were the main concerns in drawing up the report and the proposed amendments to the Commission’s original proposal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Allow me to make one further comment: The sustainable development of aquaculture demands substantial support for scientific research and technological development in the area of farming native species, so as to enable production and diversification in the supply of foodstuffs, along with an improvement in quality, while also guaranteeing greater environmental security.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This legislative initiative should therefore be backed up by strong backing for this area. It is necessary to explore the potential of aquaculture, but there is also a need to overcome its limitations in an environmentally sustainable way. Among other things, it will be vital to refocus the priorities of the Framework Research Programme, so as to enable adequate coverage of this important area of research.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It only remains for me to express my gratitude to all the shadow rapporteurs for their help, thanks to which it was possible to complete a fruitful piece of work, and to the services of the Commission and the Council, including the Spanish Presidency and now the Belgian Presidency, for the work that we have carried out over these months.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the long-term anchovy plan, but I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Bilbao, and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries, for their work on this proposal. I would like to say to Mrs Bilbao that there was indeed a delay in adopting this proposal, but I would like to say that it was clear enough that the Commission has done absolutely everything to unblock the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay was threatened with collapse and the fishery was therefore closed in 2005. It was reopened in January 2010, just five years later. Last July, scientists confirmed that the stock was safely above precautionary limits. This allowed me to propose a TAC of over 15 000 tonnes, which is in force now. The TAC follows the harvest rules of the plan and I am happy to see that this proposal is already helping us to manage the stock properly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clearly, the long closure caused serious financial damage to those depending on this fishery. We absolutely need to prevent this happening again. The only way to do that is to exploit the stock consistent with maximum sustainable yield and keep a low risk of fishery closure. Our proposal shows that this can be done while, at the same time, providing sustainability for the industry. If we want to avoid closure, then we need to keep the exploitation rate at 30%.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the Committee on Fisheries for its support both on the substance and in relation to the delegation of powers to the Commission. I can support these amendments. I can also support those amendments related to the alignment of the proposal with the new control regulation, in force since January 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is only one exception, however. It relates to reducing the delay for notifying entry into port from four hours to one hour. This amendment changes the four-hour rule which is in the new control regulation. You know that this new control regulation has been in force since the beginning of this year. I am not in favour of amending it so soon, especially since the control regulation itself allows coastal Member States to apply specific exceptions when justified. So we have this margin. We really do not need to change this control regulation so soon but, of course, it is for you to decide.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will turn now to the second report, the multiannual plan for horse mackerel. Let me say that Mr Gallagher, as rapporteur, and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries, have done excellent work on this proposal and I would like to pass on to you my sincere thanks for all your hard work and your constructive approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">Western horse mackerel is by far the most important of the three horse mackerel stocks in EU waters. The stock is currently stable at a good level, which means the TAC for 2011 is almost unchanged. The annual TAC decision on this stock, which is based on recent scientific advice, does not correspond to our objective of having binding, predictable long-term management. Therefore, this plan, like other long-term plans, is dear to me because I want us to move away from the annual haggling in Council on how much can be fished. We owe it to the industry to give them more planning and stability by agreeing on long-term plans.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your general support, both on the substance and on the delegation of powers, shows that we have the same goal. I can support your amendments and those related to the alignment of the proposal with the new control regulation, in force since January 2010. Other than this, the plan itself should not fix TAC areas, leaving the possibility of adapting these in the annual TAC decisions following the relevant scientific advice.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is one amendment, however, that does not go in the right direction, namely, your acceptance of the Council Presidency’s compromise of around 5 000 tonnes. The figure of 5 000 tonnes is simply not science-based. How has it been decided upon? Why not 6 000 or 7 000? Having discretion to move the TAC up and down to the right levels in a long-term management strategy does not seem to me a robust approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will turn now to the third report on the Baltic technical measures. I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gróbarczyk, for his very good work on the report, which was adopted unanimously. Once again, I thank the Committee on Fisheries for fully supporting it. With this proposal, we are ensuring legal continuity in respect of our policy on high grading, which was introduced in the Baltic Sea last year, as well as on fishing restrictions for some species.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will now focus on the last report: the use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferreira, for his work, and the Committee on Fisheries as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the Commission is committed to promoting the sustainable development of aquaculture in the EU through the new aquaculture strategy. This implies a high level of environmental protection, but also the establishment of the conditions to facilitate aquaculture operations. We need to do that. Amending the regulation on the introduction of alien species in aquaculture closed facilities will certainly facilitate aquaculture activities by eliminating unnecessary administrative burdens whilst, at the same time, ensuring adequate protection for aquatic habitats. This is not all that we can do, of course, so I very much welcome the proposal by Mr Ferreira to enhance our research efforts on aquaculture. We are going to do our best by means of our budget and by means of CFP reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very pleased that the discussions in the Committee on Fisheries have resulted in a better definition of ‘closed aquaculture facility’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to stress that the initial proposal was adopted by the Commission one month before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, so we had the same problem here. The Committee on Fisheries tabled amendments aiming to bring the basic regulation into line with the new comitology provisions of the Lisbon Treaty. We considered it opportune to carry out this alignment as proposed by Parliament. On the other hand, it was necessary to modify our proposal formally to introduce such substantial amendments, and this accounts for the delay we are talking about.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would like once again to thank all the rapporteurs in the Committee on Fisheries for their reports and for their work on these relevant issues.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, thank you very much to the authors of the reports for their excellent work. I would like to focus on management plans, although I will not go into any substantial aspects, as they have already been highlighted by the rapporteurs. Instead, I will refer to the significant institutional challenges they are creating, which must be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="es">After more than a year of negotiations with the Council, Parliament has quite responsibly decided to bring the reports to first reading with the aim of exerting pressure to break the current deadlock, which affects not only these two proposals but also all the others that are to be put before us in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament is willing to find a compromise solution with the Council and the Commission but the key requirement for that to happen is for the Council to acknowledge and accept that the basic core of long-term management plans must fall under the ordinary legislative procedure, that is, under the legal basis of Article 43(2) of the treaty.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is incomprehensible that before the Treaty of Lisbon, when the Council also had exclusive competence in matters of TAC and quotas, Parliament was asked for its consultative opinion, whereas now, the Council claims exclusivity on these same matters, even though, according to all legal advice, Article 43(3) must be interpreted restrictively.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore urge the Commissioner to take account of Parliament’s position, even if any proposals – and I believe Mrs Bilbao’s question on this particular point has not been answered – were to be withdrawn or replaced by new texts. Failure to do this will compel us to refer the matter to the Court of Justice and to block future long-term plans, which is to be avoided insofar as it is a basic instrument of fisheries management.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, there are a great many technical details in the texts we are debating today. However, behind them stands a clear instruction: the European Parliament is calling on the other institutions, the Commission and the Council, to pay attention to scientific data whenever we pass decisions on fisheries issues and how we fish.</p>
      <p sl="el">We cannot negotiate along political lines when deciding how to fish each species of fish. The Council and Parliament cannot negotiate along political lines issues which need to be judged on the basis of scientific data. It is only on the basis of scientific data that we can establish the surpluses in our seas and what we can fish without having an irreversible impact both on marine life and on fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="el">We have before us the revised common fisheries policy. What we are asking in these reports is that you act boldly when revising the common fisheries policy, by ensuring that decisions taken to safeguard a viable future for our seas and fisheries are taken on the basis of scientific data.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will concentrate on the report on anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay and our group’s view on this matter. This is an issue that is extremely important and it is an example of how we should approach sensitive matters relating to fisheries. It is important to remember that the fisheries that we are talking about collapsed in 2005 as a result of overfishing.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Now that fishing is permitted again, it is carried out on the basis of the precautionary principle, and that is the way it should be done. It is the only long-term and sustainable way to do it, which was also our group’s view on this matter. The fact is that the fisheries industry may perhaps hope for a larger quantity of fish to start with, but in the long term, it is better to do what we will probably opt for now. This is also the way that our group believes we should handle this type of question, both today and in the future.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has altered Parliament’s power when it comes to fisheries policy. The management plans that we are to vote on tomorrow will be the first test of how well Parliament is living up to this responsibility. I think that, in the main, we have coped well with the challenge, but it has not been without its false alarms. There is always a temptation for the decision makers to compromise on scientific advice out of a misguided consideration for the fisheries industry. Moreover, people have short memories. Despite the fact that anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay collapsed as recently as 2005 and the fisheries industry had to stop fishing completely, there are still short-sighted financial incentives that jeopardise the long-term sustainability of the stocks. However, caution won out against games of chance in committee.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Counting fish is not difficult; it is like counting trees. It is just that fish move around and they are not visible. Thus joked the world-leading marine biologist Willy Kristensen in the film ‘The End of the Line’ on the depletion of fish stocks in the world’s oceans. What he was trying to say was that there is a large degree of uncertainty in stock estimations. This is important to remember now that the EU and the world have decided to achieve the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in respect of all commercial fish species in approximately five years.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to point out that it is an utterly impossible task to achieve the MSY for all fish species everywhere at the same time. We therefore need to have safety margins. Ecosystems must be considered as a whole and the MSY must be regarded as an upper limit, not as a goal. I hope this will be taken into account in the forthcoming fisheries policy and respected in the management plans, both in Parliament and in the Council. We need to get long-term management plans in place quickly for all of Europe’s marine ecosystems. Finally, I would just like to say that I totally agree with the rapporteur, Mr Gallagher, that splitting up a quota for a single stock of horse mackerel goes completely against scientific advice.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the issues raised in this debate are not specific to the area specified. There are also issues affecting vessels in the North Sea.</p>
      <p sl="en">I had a meeting with fishermen from Whitby in Yorkshire on Friday. They are just as concerned with issues that are likely to drive out of business the remaining vessels in the British fleet. The immediate threat is of a proposed reduction in the number of days they are allowed to fish, from 135 days possibly down to 90 days. I asked the trawlermen how much of a reduction they could bear before being driven out of business, and they replied that any reduction would have that effect.</p>
      <p sl="en">The policy of forcing trawlers to discard dead and dying fish to avoid landing under-sized fish or exceeding species quotas is absolutely monstrous. All fish that have been caught and will not survive must be landed. Discarding is not conservation, it is waste. High grading is a response to the unfair quota system. Reform the system and it will disappear. Quotas are bought and sold on the open market and speculated by the rich and powerful. This pushes up the price of quotas, which are rented to fishermen for extortionate amounts. Speculation must be ended completely.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the Gallagher report and, in particular, the multiannual plan for the stock of Atlantic horse mackerel, it is vital to advocate the amendment proposed by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which was drawn up by Mrs Patrão Neves, focusing on the three objectives of the Green Paper and the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP): the environmental objective, which is well respected in this report, and the economic and social objectives, whether they focus on economic viability or a decent living for professionals.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is very important that we make a distinction here. When we talk about the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel, it is important to distinguish between Zone VIII C, the area around the Bay of Biscay, which is essentially geared to artisanal fisheries and which forms the livelihood for a significant part of the Portuguese, Spanish and French populations, in particular, and the zone further north, which is focused on industrial fisheries, and is thus essentially geared towards economic profitability. For this very reason, there needs to be an amendment to this report so that it is harmonised not only with the fundamental objectives of the Green Paper on the CFP or on the reform of the CFP, but also with the recommendations presented by the Council on the Regulation on total allowable catches (TACs) for 2011, in which Atlantic horse mackerel in International Council for the Exploration of the Sea Zone VIII C is essentially seen as geared towards artisanal fisheries, while the north, within this western zone, is mainly focused on industrial fisheries. This approach, which looks at the specific nature and purpose of each area where the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel lives, is the only one that can truly protect all the aims of the CFP.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, congratulations to the four rapporteurs. I, too, am going to address the issue of management plans for anchovy and Atlantic horse mackerel stocks.</p>
      <p sl="es">The proposal on the exploitation of anchovy stocks, which was initially going to be a proposal for sustainable anchovy exploitation, has proved a complex proposal which is currently blocked by the Council. This is the sector that has suffered the greatest damage. We are at a standstill because the situation has not been unblocked due to a failure to take decisions on the part of the Council and also the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to highlight the position of the Spanish socialist delegation, which has supported the sector’s unanimous claims throughout this process, backed – and I stress, backed – by scientific reports and by the Regional Advisory Council. This same position is maintained in relation to the new issues raised by the upcoming reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the face of this stalemate, we request that the Commissioner withdraws the proposal if necessary, takes into account the position of Parliament, and puts forward a new proposal.</p>
      <p sl="es">As for Atlantic horse mackerel, Mr Gallagher has outlined several issues on which we also agree, such as the introduction of multiannual programmes, total allowable catches and scientific recommendations. He also proposed an amendment that the Socialist Group regards as significant and which the Spanish Socialist Group also regards as significant, as Spain has a traditional horse mackerel fishing sector, the produce of which is consumed fresh on the same day it has been caught. The lack of recognition of this sector will result in socio-economic damage and will certainly weaken the prospects for improved management.</p>
      <p sl="es">For this reason, we believe that Mr Gallagher should have taken our proposal into consideration, differentiating the case of coastal fishing.</p>

We urgently need improved catch methods in order to secure the long-term livelihood of both our seas and our fishermen.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is equally essential that we enable aquaculture to expand further. We are in urgent need of more effective data collection and more intensive research, since only once we know what is actually going on will we be able to make the right decisions for the future.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, with regard to the debate on anchovies, I would also like to highlight how important it is and the fact that it is a turning point, not only for the sector, and for the subject of anchovies in particular, but also for relations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this respect, I would also like to make it very clear that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the proposals that were made by the Commission from a more precautionary perspective.</p>
      <p sl="es">We fundamentally support the proposals on three points:</p>
      <p sl="es">the first is the exploitation rule, which we – like the Commission – consider should not be greater than 0.3; the second is the total allowable catch (TAC), which we also consider should take into account live bait; the final point is the reduction of the TAC, which must be at least 25%, if it is deemed necessary.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have supported the Commission on these three matters, and we think this is reasonable, precisely because what we want to do is act, for once, like holistic doctors who cure, rather than forensic doctors who simply certify deaths. I believe it is important that we make this message clear and I think that this is a good opportunity to do things properly.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my contribution concerns the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the prohibition of highgrading and restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound. What we are concerned with here is not simply the amendment of a regulation, but two very important and excellent species of food fish that we urgently need in Europe for our internal market. Once again, it is clear that science and the industry need to work together to ensure that their experience – particularly in the areas of discards and the management of stocks, but also as regards what happens to by-catches – is evaluated and assessed sensibly. We know all the options for imposing restrictions here; Mr Gróbarczyk has set them out excellently. It is essential that Article 15a is included in the regulation. You have heard why – the rapporteur has once more stated it quite clearly. Our common aim is to minimise by-catches and discards, and we achieved this in committee.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, for some species of fish – and flounder and turbot are among them – it is the case that juvenile and under-sized specimens can be thrown back if they have been taken on board with the catch. Naturally, it is also essential to work with excellent fishing gear here, to fish selectively and to respect closed seasons. These two species of fish have constantly changed their spawning grounds, so naturally, the fishing areas have also been clearly defined, and the spawning times and spawning grounds described precisely.</p>
      <p sl="de">The marketing parameters must not be revised downward so that the only possibility left is to make fishmeal from such excellent stocks. That is not our aim. We want to serve the market, which is why we have amended this regulation in this way.</p>

      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the two regulations on long-term management plans. The right formula for management of sardine stocks has always been subject to considerable argument among the committee.

But, in general, there remain some very negative aspects of EU fisheries management, as you are aware. I strongly believe that it is the fishing nations themselves – those who have entitlement in particular sea areas – who should be making the decisions on stock conservation and management.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, in my speech, I am going to focus on two reports whose procedure and final results are an example of what to do and what not to do. I am referring to the plan for anchovy stocks and the use of exotic species in aquaculture.</p>
      <p sl="es">Regarding anchovies, an example of how not to do things, the subject has been under discussion for more than one year and, unfortunately, it has become a debate on the powers that the Treaty of Lisbon grants to Parliament and on the legal basis for the Commission proposal, rather than a debate on what is better for fishermen, industries and fisheries. It has been a long and futile debate, the victim of which has been the sector, which has looked on in astonishment as we have become lost in discussions while the long-awaited management plan has yet to move forward and is in danger of never seeing the light of day.</p>
      <p sl="es">People who work in the anchovy sector are rightly complaining about the administrative hindrances that this plan is facing, when it is so essential for avoiding further interruptions to the activities of this fishery.</p>
      <p sl="es">I sincerely believe that, given this background of uncertainty, the Commission should seek to send a positive signal to the sector today in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">On the contrary, with regard to the use of exotic species, the agreement reached by Parliament at first reading is a good compromise. The Commission, the Council and Parliament have succeeded in reaching an agreement quickly and without major disagreements over law or fact.</p>
      <p sl="es">The agreement not only establishes a strict definition of closed aquaculture facilities, but also achieves greater legal clarity for the businesses in the sector and, more importantly, removes a piece of the bureaucracy that Europeans have had enough of.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am convinced that the administrative processes need to be reduced to an essential minimum. Europeans have to deal with excessive bureaucracy, which makes it extremely difficult to start up or operate any activity. Therefore, reports such as today’s that remove administrative procedures are not only good news for the aquaculture sector but should also be a constant feature of the way in which we work.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I would like to say how pleased I am to see Parliament conclude its first reading on the two long-term plans for anchovies and horse mackerel. In fact, with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has become a joint decision maker on these matters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the anchovy stock, I am delighted by the text adopted in the Committee on Fisheries, which is aimed at long-term management of a much fished species. This plan will allow for joint management measures between the main fishing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Live bait will be taken into consideration in the quotas, making it possible to check the quantities fished in the fairest way. Moreover, I welcome the measures for supervising control of this fishery. The system for controlling vessels absolutely must be the same in the various Member States exploiting this stock.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to congratulate Mr Gallagher on his report. I know we shall adopt it tomorrow: it makes the socio-economically and environmentally sustainable exploitation of the mackerel stock possible. This plan comes up with a new decision-making method concerning the total allowable catch that will make it possible to ensure the sustainability of the stock in the long term. I would also like to remind you of the importance of the principle of relative stability, which is particularly close to my heart.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The rapporteurs stress the need to tackle discards, and this can only be welcomed. However, like my fellow Members, I find it regrettable that the Council is challenging Parliament’s new joint decision-making power concerning the long-term management plans. I think that this issue of a legal basis needs to be resolved as it is delaying implementation of the plans, which is essential for conserving the resource and regulating fishing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must also define, once and for all, the notions of non-industrial fishing and industrial fishing. This will ensure that the reform of the common fisheries policy is undertaken on a sound and firm footing. This is also what is suggested in the report by Mr Gróbarczyk, whom I thank for the quality of his work. Moreover, a total ban on discards is not realistic, as we know. I hope that the European Commission will support the sector, which is introducing selective gear and ensuring economically and environmentally sustainable fishing.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one minute is not long enough to cover four reports. I therefore congratulate the three other rapporteurs, but I will only comment on Mr Ferreira’s report.</p>
      <p sl="it">Adherence to the principles of biodiversity must be central to the actions which the European Union undertakes with regard to fishing and aquaculture. The compromise amendment is the result of the good work carried out by Mr Ferreira, who has clearly understood these concerns.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must not have preconceived ideas when looking for ways to improve fish farming standards, but we must be rigorous in the control and application of regulations which are as precise as possible, in order to avoid the risk of altering the environmental balance.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this way, the greatest support for organic production is a decision which is made in the general interest and which encompasses the protection of biodiversity. That, in fact, is the best way of optimising the production of native species.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, I hope that, as part of the common fisheries policy reform, this further measure with regard to aquaculture can be included in one simplified regulation. This will simplify matters greatly, and I hope that a single regulation on aquaculture will make the procedures as a whole even simpler.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Gróbarczyk for his help. I am very pleased that it was possible to include a very significant point in the report, calling on the Commission to prepare a comprehensive management plan for flounder in the waters of the Baltic Sea.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to take the opportunity to bring to the Commissioner’s attention the fact that the Polish authorities have been proposing the adoption of a comprehensive management system for flatfish stocks in the Baltic for many years, and have not obtained any tangible results from the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A uniform system for the management of flatfish, wherever they may be located, must be drawn up. They have great economic importance for Baltic fishermen, including those from Poland, which is why they merit greater attention from European institutions responsible for fisheries than they have enjoyed so far.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their reports and, in particular, Mr Gallagher. Two things jump out at me immediately in hearing the discussion that has gone on. The first thing is that the whole concept of creating an opportunity to allow for a split within the TACs in one fishery is irresponsible to the extreme. We should strongly oppose that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, with regard to the issue of discards, maybe now is the time to look at creating a grey market for those discards. They are by-catches to normal fishery operations and instead of them being thrown back into the water, why not allow them to be landed and pay for the cost of catch – not a market price, but the cost of catch. This can be used as a replacement for the thousands of tonnes of imported fish, coming from the Far East and other places, to fill other markets within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">This can be a win-win situation. It can reduce the amount of discards and also ensure that fishermen are not throwing back a valuable product.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is good that the EU is trying to preserve endangered fish stocks, but before there is too much self-congratulation on these proposals, we must remember that many past EU fishing rules have been appalling failures. Britain’s home waters have been fished to near extinction under European fisheries policies. The reality is that the protection of fish stocks is best left to local fishermen and national government marine scientists, not EU bureaucrats.</p>
      <p sl="en">The advice from the men working in the broken remnants of Britain’s fishing fleets is simple: scrap quota systems, which lead to discards and high grading, and replace them with weight-based catch limits so that all fish caught are landed for human consumption or for processing into animal and fish feed. We need to replace the system of openly tradeable quotas and so stop financiers, supermarkets and the super rich from speculating in fishermen’s livelihoods. Quotas of all kinds – and in whichever seas – should be owned by fishermen from ports with traditional connections to those waters and be tradeable only between fishermen who are likewise entitled to fish by personal, family and community connections.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I am no authority on this matter, but since I come from an island nation, I know that fishing is very important for coastal communities throughout Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="ga">My esteemed Irish colleague, Mr Gallagher, who is an authority on this topic not just in Ireland but beyond, made some very pertinent points when he spoke about the nonsense of shared quotas for two separate areas for the one stock. My group, the PPE Group, has a different view. At the same time, what Mr Gallagher says seems to be logical, as horse mackerel is a transient species. So I would like the Commissioner’s response to that in particular: not a personal response but one based on scientific evidence. I would also agree with colleagues regarding discards, and I would also like to see us developing aquaculture much more …</p>
      <p sl="ga">because there will be more and more demand for fish in the future, and I hope that every kind of fish will be available to all.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have recently been trying to establish the cost of the common fisheries policy to the British economy. The best estimate in lost catch alone is at least GBP 3.6 billion per annum; the cost of higher food bills is put at around GBP 4.7 billion per annum; the cost of subsidies, unemployment, wasted resources, red tape, etc. is put at about GBP 2.8 billion per annum. This makes an annual total upwards of GBP 11.1 billion.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fishing industry has been devastated, with over 97 000 jobs lost since 1973 in fishing and dependent industries. The knock-on economic and human costs are incalculable; the ecological impact of the common fisheries policy is a disaster. Over 880 000 dead fish are dumped into the North Sea every year. The solution for Britain is, of course, to leave the European Union, regain control of our territorial waters and restore sanity to a revitalised national fishing industry.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay ceased in 2005 due to the poor state of stocks.

I ask the Commission to withdraw this proposal and to take account of Parliament’s initiative.</p>

    <intervention id="1-142" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all the honourable Members of Parliament for their contributions. The discussion was very interesting indeed.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, I would like to react to the remarks of Mrs Fraga, on behalf of the EPP and of other Members, about the institutional problems we have now, referring to the new institutional environment we have under the Lisbon Treaty. I have to admit that the enforcement of the Lisbon Treaty has created a new era, and we would like to adapt to this new era. I would like to say in a very clear way that the Commission understands and supports the idea that Parliament has to have a say in terms of the harvest: the role of the long management plan.</p>
      <p sl="en">We think that the treaties are very clear when they refer to this issue. This is our position but, as you know, there is a reaction in the Council. Some Member States have reacted in a very strong way, but also there is a general reaction to this approach. We have to find a solution here, because otherwise we cannot go on to enforce long management plans and, as you will understand, long management plans are our future. We cannot go on with a new policy dictated by short-termism and all these political bargains we are used to.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we have to find a solution to unblock the situation. I have in mind to try to find a way out by means of a trilateral meeting. I am going to propose to Parliament and the Council that we all sit together in order to find at least a compromise solution, which we need as soon as possible because we cannot go on in this way.</p>
      <p sl="en">All the long management plans are blocked now, and I have some new proposals about some new management plans, which are very important for salmon, for example, and for pelagic stocks. These are very important long management plans. They are ready and we are waiting to find an institutional solution to these very sensitive problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">Referring to the contributions of the other groups, I would like to welcome the contributions of Mr Arsenis, Mr Haglund and Ms Lövin on behalf of their groups and to agree with them that what we need is long management plans and scientific advice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand and I would like to be very clear on the demands of our fisheries and the problems of our fisheries sector. But I would like to tell you that we are now discussing a clear example of the situation. The anchovy plan and the fact that we had to close the fisheries there for some years is clear proof that we cannot go forward while ignoring scientific advice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand the problems, and we have to find a synthesis and a solution. My idea – and this will be one of the main themes of our fisheries policy reform – is to continue heeding scientific advice and also try to find a solution in case that advice is not clear enough and we do not have enough data to form a clear opinion.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to say that the report by Mr Gróbarczyk is very important, and that technical measures concerning how to avoid upgrading are very important for our policy. I would also like to underline that we need a policy on flounders and flatfish, as we have already said. We intend to produce such a policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need a very brave policy regarding discards, to which a lot of you referred. I do not think we can afford to throw fish back in the sea when they are so valuable. We cannot afford this any more. Perhaps it was a solution when we had plenty of fish in our waters, but now we have real problems. We cannot throw fish back in the sea.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we have to find a solution here, and I very much welcome proposals such as compensating fishermen for the cost of the catch in the case of by-catches. We can find solutions, but what we have to do through our policy reform is move towards a target of eliminating discards. Of course, we have to bear in mind all the technical measures needed for this, but we have to move in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">One last remark about the aquaculture problems. We have to reduce the burdens which create obstacles in aquaculture. I can agree with that. I can agree with the rapporteur and Mr Milana and other speakers who have spoken about it.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I can say is that we are trying to achieve this as part of our CFP reform. I would also like to reiterate that we are going to increase scientific research into aquaculture species, because we really need to proceed to mass production of these aquaculture products if we really want aquaculture to be an alternative to our fishing sector.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, first, I would have appreciated a clear answer from you as to whether it is your intention to give in to the Council’s wishes, acknowledging – which I am grateful for – the problems regarding acceptance of the powers that the Treaty of Lisbon gives to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Committee on Fisheries has voted for a second time and has not asked the Commissioner to withdraw the proposal. What we are asking the Commissioner to do today is to give us an answer as to whether or not she is going to give in to what the Council wants.</p>
      <p sl="es">The sector needs a plan. The sector has been responsible and has worked for more than two years with scientific institutes and the Commission in order to establish and set out the exploitation rule in the proposal. It is a responsible sector which has been closed for five years, and let it not be forgotten that it was the sector itself that asked for the closure. The year before the closure, it was able to fish 7 000 tonnes and each day it established and set the quota that could be fished in order to make that small quota more profitable. It then unilaterally decided to notify the Commission that it was stopping fishing because it had reached the limit set.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is the sector that we have. It is a sector that has asked us more than once to make a decision and to be transparent, and one that I can personally say has worked responsibly and rigorously to get to this much needed plan.</p>
      <p sl="es">Adopting this plan means moving away from obscure political decisions on quotas and total allowable catches, the basis for which is sometimes unknown. We have lived for many years with this lack of transparency. The 21st century is not the century of non-transparency and that is not what the European people deserve, nor is it what is deserved by a sector that has proved itself to be responsible.</p>
      <p sl="es">Fortunately, the latest report conducted by AZTI (Basque Scientific Institute) and the Juvena study have shown us that there are much greater anchovy stocks for the coming year. I would, however, like a clearer answer, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and colleagues for their contributions, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, the secretariat of the Fisheries Committee, the Council, the Commission, my group’s policy adviser, and indeed my own adviser.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand that the Council, at a technical level, is divided as to whether or not the harvest control rule should be exclusively decided by the Council. I also understand that the 27 Ministers have yet to discuss this dossier in full, and this issue in particular. I hope that common sense will prevail.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the Commissioner’s difficulty with +/-5 000 tonnes, I would say to you, Commissioner, that this was a pragmatic solution. We have been dealing with this dossier for over a year now and it was a way forward. I believe that at times, we have to be pragmatic in order to overcome the difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say to those in the S&amp;D Group that there is absolutely no ambiguity about my position in relation to your amendment. I will certainly be recommending that we support that amendment. In relation to the PPE Group’s proposal, I would say that the PPE Group should reflect on this. I was very careful to include its concerns in Amendment 7, which deals with the Bay of Biscay. It deals with artisanal fisheries and historic rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Anyone who supports that must remember that we will have many more reports in Parliament. If you support something that is wrong now, it may well be that, if you are to be consistent, you will have to support something that is wrong in the future. Scientifically, it is totally wrong to split a TAC, and that is not just my personal opinion. If we do it now, we may well have to do it in the future in a one-stock fishery. Multiannual plans are vital to allow the sector to plan forward. Hopefully, good sense will prevail tomorrow and we will put in place a report that we can stand over.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would like to express my thanks for the comments that were made on my report and use my floor time to make a few remarks about the multiannual plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel and the proposed amendment to Mr Gallagher’s report that I presented on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The purpose of this amendment, which the rapporteur’s Amendment 7 does not completely ensure, is to clarify the specific nature of the different fleets and make clear that these specific points and the ultimate destination of the fish should be taken into account when defining the total allowable catches (TACs). Small-scale coastal and artisanal fisheries have economic and social characteristics that are distinct from those of industrial fisheries, among other aspects. When setting limitations on fisheries aimed at supplying fresh fish to the public for consumption, these should not be treated in the same way as industrial fishing, which is geared towards processing fish.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to the different fleets and the technical issue that was raised, I still do not agree with the rapporteur’s position. We are effectively talking about the same stock, from the same source, but, as has already been mentioned, this is a source that is developing in distinct fishing areas. Coastal and artisanal fishing ideally operate in a specified fishing area, with industrial fishing in another. We are therefore talking about areas that have clearly defined boundaries, and we believe that this is compatible. Moreover, we believe that the TACs need to be adjusted to each of these different fishing areas so as to ensure that the stock is managed sensibly. This is because, as has also been noted here, sensible management of the stock should take into account not only environmental and biological aspects, but also economic and social factors. Things that are essentially different should not be treated in exactly the same way.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The report on the prohibition of highgrading and restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound calls for new provisions in the regulations on fishing in the areas in question. The Baltic Sea has the status of a ‘particularly sensitive sea area’, and is one of the most valuable, but also one of the most sensitive, marine ecosystems on our planet. For this reason, I agree with the rapporteur that it is essential to abandon – and not only here – industrial scale fishing. It is only through economically and environmentally balanced fishing, using the right fishing methods, that we can help to preserve fishing and to preserve the current range of fish species at a sustainable level for future generations. In connection with climate change, there has been a massive movement of fish in the Baltic Sea, and it is therefore necessary to review the protected sea area regularly. I would therefore like to call on the Commission to do this at regular intervals. It is also essential for fishing companies to be encouraged through legislation to use the best equipment currently available in terms of selectivity, and thereby to avoid catching such huge quantities of under-sized fish and fish other than the target species, or by-catches. The European Parliament should make a point of including this in the proposed reform of the common fisheries policy in 2011, which I will be urgently promoting.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at last, we have come to the plenary debate on the new legislation on information on medicinal products. What we are about to debate is the last part of what certain people are calling the most controversial issue in the medicinal products package, namely, information on medicinal products. I will admit that as recently as a year ago, I probably would never have believed that we would come to plenary together in as much agreement as we have nevertheless achieved here in Parliament. The fact that this is the case is largely down to my shadow rapporteurs. It is their constructive proposals and their willingness to compromise that has helped us to reach agreement and hopefully adopt this report with considerable support in plenary.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is not only a question of willingness to compromise. I think that perhaps it is even more important that we have realised that we want, and are working for, the same things here in Parliament. The first is that we all, first and foremost, want Europe’s patients to have better and more accessible information on medicinal products. The second is that none of us wants advertising for prescription-only medicinal products, and the third is that the information that reaches patients and is disseminated by companies must be checked and approved by the relevant authorities. These are principles that everyone shares and that have made it easier for us to reach agreement. However, it is also why we felt somewhat compelled to re-draft the Commission’s proposal.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to highlight five things that we focused on when re-drafting the Commission’s original legislative proposal. The first is that we tried to change the perspective of the legislation – from a focus on the right of pharmaceutical companies to disseminate information to now focusing on the right of patients to have access to information and, with that, the companies’ obligation to publish and make available this information. Secondly, we tried to tighten up all of the exceptions that existed to avoid possible loopholes for advertising – something none of us wants. Thirdly, we ensured that the information on medicinal products coming from companies is checked and is reliable in that it must have passed through a pharmaceuticals authority somewhere. The fourth thing we did was to say that any information that could come from pharmaceutical companies should not be received by patients or the general public without them asking for it first. No one should ever receive unsolicited information on medicinal products. We have therefore rejected any so-called ‘push channels’, such as advertisements on the radio, television or in newspapers. The last point I would like to highlight is that companies are only one link in the information chain. Healthcare and society in many countries throughout Europe must take a much greater share of the responsibility than they currently do.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There are points on which we do not agree. In this regard, I would simply like to ask a question and call on my fellow Members to in fact accept the exception relating to information that doctors give to patients they are treating, in other words, that such information need not go through the same process of checks as other information. I have a specific example that could pose a problem if such an exception is not accepted, namely that a doctor in Sweden, for example, would not be able to give an English package leaflet to a patient who does not understand Swedish on account of the fact that it could never be approved in Sweden, as English is not an official language there.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I will conclude by addressing the Council, which, unfortunately, is not here – something that has been quite telling in this matter. I regret the absence of the Council. I really wanted to take account of the Council’s opinions and arguments in order to facilitate the debate, but as yet I have been met almost entirely by a flat refusal. It has been difficult to listen to someone who does not provide any information.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We have succeeded in reaching agreement on this matter. I am certain that the Council, too, if it begins to discuss this matter in detail, will actually encounter more or less the same conditions for agreement as we have created here. However, the Council must not try to ration information in order to save money. That is not something that we want to encounter. We do not believe that more poorly informed patients are in any way easier to deal with or that it is cheaper to withhold information. I call on the Council to take the baton so that, together, we can ensure that Europe has better information on medicinal products for the sake of the patients.</p>

    <intervention id="1-152" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="John Dalli" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, during my hearing as Commissioner-designate, I made it clear that information to patients is a very important topic for me. Patients are highly interested in their own health and wellbeing. But today, the availability of information on medicines in Europe is very diverse: you could even say very unfair.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whether patients obtain the relevant information depends on languages, IT skills and often even social class and networks. For a Europe that strives to overcome today’s health and inequalities, this is not sustainable. The key ambition of the Commission’s initial proposal therefore remains justified, and I applaud Parliament and, in particular, your rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, on taking this important proposal forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I strongly believe – as I also stressed during my hearing – that we have to address this file from a patient’s angle. We have to ask what information patients need, not what information industry may wish to provide. We have to ensure that we do not drift into direct-to-consumer advertising, which patients clearly do not want.</p>
      <p sl="en">Again, I applaud Parliament for taking exactly this stance. This will allow the Commission to accept many of your key amendments when we present our modified proposals. This concerns, in particular, the obligation to publish information, the question of what information is covered, the information distribution channels and the control mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I support the amendment stating that industry must have the obligation and not just the right to make certain information on medicinal products available. This is a very important change.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, as regards what information is published, I generally agree that information should not cover comparisons between medicinal products, as this could be seen as promotional. Of course, this information is highly relevant for patients and healthcare professionals but, due to its potential abuse for promotion, it needs a strict framework. We are cooperating with Member States on such a framework in the area of health technology assessments.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also share the view that the proposals should concern the information made available by industry and not by third parties such as journalists and scientists. However, we know that there is a grey zone which leaves room for abuse. I therefore believe that such parties should be obliged to declare whether they have received financial or other benefits from industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, as regards the information channels, I partially agree with your amendments. However, not everybody uses the Internet; we must avoid corroborating inequalities by excluding those who do not use digital communication tools from access to medical information. I consider, therefore, that it should be possible for industry to draft printed material on its own initiative and not only by request. This draft information could be used on request by the public or via healthcare professionals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, on the control of information, I agree that information which has not already been approved during the marketing authorisation process must be pre-approved by competent authorities as a matter of principle. However, I believe that Europe should play close attention to the constitutional concerns that some Member States raise as regards the compatibility of pre-vetting with freedom of expression. It should be possible for these Member States to provide for exposed control, irrespective of whether they already have such exposed control in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several of Parliament’s amendments concern information from sources other than industry sources. In this context, let me stress that I fully agree with the political ambition to place the proposals on industry-generated information on medicines, which we are discussing today, in a broader and more comprehensive agenda on patient information. Yes, there are other very important sources which have to be exploited as fully as possible, but the proposals are not the right place to address them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is already obliged to draft a report on the readability of the package leaflet. Therefore, any changes regarding this issue would be premature. Nor is it feasible to introduce, for each clinical study mentioned in the summary of the European Public Assessment Report, a link to the Eurydice Database on clinical trials. A general link between databases would suffice.</p>
      <p sl="en">The public summary of the assessment report should not be annexed to the European marketing authorisation, as it is already publicly available through the EMA website. I recognise that, in addition to information provided by industry, there are already a number of European and national databases and portals providing information on medicinal products. What we lack is interlinkage between them. I propose that the future European medicinal web portal recently created by the Pharmacovigilance Directive be used as a central point to access information.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, I fully recognise the need for broader information about diseases and their prevention. Patients are interested in all different treatment options, not just learning about medicines. However, this cannot be addressed through the present proposals, which focus on medicines. Nevertheless, the Commission is well placed to serve as a European information switchboard. I see our role as connecting other reliable information providers such as Member States or patient organisations. European action can add value, and many information tools such as the EU health portal are already in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, you will not be surprised that there are some amendments that the Commission, after careful reflection, cannot support. The right of citizens to lodge complaints, for example, is a fundamental EU principle. It is neither appropriate nor necessary to restate this. The level of penalties should be determined at national level and not at European legislative level. A list of the Commission’s positions on all the proposed amendments has been made available to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by again thanking Parliament and Mr Fjellner and the shadow rapporteurs for your important contribution. I hope this week’s vote will help strengthen patients’ access to information and convince the Council of the need to start in-depth discussions of the proposals.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Dalli, patients should have the right to know as much as possible about their illness and the medication available to treat it. Yet how can we distinguish information from advertising? Where and how is it possible to obtain objective and unbiased information? There are various interpretations of the texts currently in force, with the result that they need to be harmonised, strengthening the sovereignty of the individual. Information needs to be reliable, validated by the authorities, independent, accessible and targeted to an average, non-expert audience. The intention is to ensure more informed and responsible citizenship on the part of the end user. The deadline for the tacit approval of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) should be extended from 60 to 120 days. The requirement to state the reasons for a refusal lends weight to such rejections and gives balance to the final outcome. The EMA has a vital role as the preferred source of objective information. I would like to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, on his work, and by saying that I am delighted that he accepted almost all the proposals that I tabled as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.</p>

    <intervention id="1-154" speaker_id="38420" name="Cristian Silviu Buşoi" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the other colleagues who have contributed to this dossier. I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Dalli. I think we have reached a good outcome, and now the report is much more patient-oriented than the initial proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nowadays, patients increasingly tend to seek health-related information so that they can be actively involved in the decisions concerning their health. Patients also tend to seek information online. This information is not easy to control on the Internet, but sooner or later we have to deal with that problem, which will not disappear if we simply do not do anything because it is too complicated.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore support imposing strict rules for the registration and monitoring of websites, as well as making available a list of registered websites so that patients can be sure of the reliability of their source. Safeguards are also needed, and the report provides them, namely by limiting the information that can be made available to information that is approved by the competent authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">To this end, we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have adopted a number of amendments covering advertising, concentrating on changing the wording from ‘disseminate’ to ‘make available’ in the context of non-promotional information according to the ‘pull principle’, whereby patients have access to information if they need it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when you consider how we debated this proposal from the Commission during the last parliament – going from outright rejection to celebrating all the good things coming our way – then I must say that I am very enthusiastic about what has been tabled here. For this, we owe the rapporteur and his co-rapporteurs a great deal of thanks for having brought together this broad spectrum of opinions into a coherent position. I feel that the key words here are ‘patient oriented’. In other words, we have not been distracted by peripherals but instead have asked what it is that the patient needs. I believe it is right that we have established that patients are able to obtain information from a number of channels, not just one. I should like to reiterate, however, that the doctor must continue to be the trusted point of contact for the patient and must undoubtedly have an influence over decisions. The way we are guaranteeing that is by banning advertising and ensuring that the information patients receive has been checked and approved by an authority. This means that the information is based on scientific fact to start with, so patients can rely on it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, it is true that not everyone is able to find these things out via the Internet. That is why we have various channels, however, and I think it is so widespread that we do not need to worry about that. I only hope that the Council will now at last have the courage to deal with this matter. It is very important; action needs to be taken quickly. Our patients expect it. Then we will have done a good job.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the 21st century dawns, patients particularly need appropriate information so that they can be fully involved in the treatment pathway, know where to find treatment, decide on the best treatment with healthcare professionals and follow the planned treatment to the letter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nowadays, patients demand independent, comparative information that is tailored to individual needs. Unfortunately, the proposals for the revision of the directive submitted by the European Commission failed to properly meet the needs expressed by European citizens. These proposals opened the door to direct promotion by pharmaceutical companies, which we believe is a nonsense in terms of responding to patients’ real needs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Neither the public nor the Member States stand to gain from this move. On the contrary, it means more red tape, increased costs and risks to patients.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is for these reasons that we initially submitted a proposal to reject these texts, thereby requiring the Commission to revise its proposals. This approach, which was also adopted by my fellow Member, Mr Schlyter, of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, enabled our rapporteur, Mr Fjellner – to whom I pay tribute – to undertake a major review of the Commission’s proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, we tabled some 60 amendments with the aim of better protecting the health of our citizens and of facilitating patient access to independent, comparative information tailored to individual needs. The adoption of these amendments by the Committee on the Environment meant that we could place more emphasis on patients’ rights to information, rather than make it an option for the pharmaceutical industries to provide that information.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In light of the compromise amendments reached, and given the positive changes made to the substance of the text over recent months, we have decided to withdraw our proposal to reject the texts. The draft report, as amended, has succeeded in counterbalancing the European Commission’s initial proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, we shall continue to speak out against health professionals being used to distribute to their patients brochures and information that have been supplied by pharmaceutical companies without any checks by health authorities. Similarly, we will oppose the authorisation of industrial campaigns, especially information campaigns, in relation to vaccines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Information must not be freely distributed by pharmaceutical companies. Experience shows that we must be very vigilant – and what happened with the Mediator medicinal products shows, in fact, just how vigilant we must be – and make sure that we strike a balance, as we have sought to do with this draft report.</p>

Patients need to be informed objectively and there needs to be a clear barrier between information and advertising.

      <p sl="cs">As Horst Schnellhardt has already mentioned here, we have been campaigning since the last legislative session for progress to be made over this standard. These eternal debates over the fact that we are unable to distinguish between advertising and information now seem ridiculous to me, if you will pardon the expression. We can all distinguish between requested information and information that is forced on us. We should open the door fully to all information that is requested. Let us not forget that we are living in a globalised world, and let us not oblige European citizens to seek out information on US websites.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, just like Mr Ouzký, I, too, have devoted my professional career as a doctor to the question of how better to inform my patients. However, it is customary to begin by applauding the good work of the rapporteur, and I would like to do this, although with a minor criticism which I will return to later.</p>
      <p sl="cs">When we began negotiating this proposal, we faced two problems following the election of the new Commission. First, the issue had transferred to a new Commissioner, and second, we faced a problem over whether to continue the work started, or to throw away the existing document and start afresh.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Just like most of you and Commissioner Dalli, I agreed that the original Commission proposal was not a good one, as it did not address the needs of patients and consumers. We therefore did not want to lose time working together on the old document. We agreed to reject the commercial campaign mounted by the pharmaceutical companies. We ruled out print media as a communications channel, and we agreed that patients had a right to know who was providing information, and that companies were responsible for all the information they disseminated.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am rather surprised that Mr Fjellner is again submitting to the plenary an amendment proposal which we rejected in the committee and which would be a retrograde step, contrary to the amended wording of the proposal.

      <p sl="da">Madam President, Commissioner, I agree with the rapporteur that the focus should be on patient safety and providing patients with information. Patients, nurses and doctors should all have access to the best possible information on a given medicinal product. Doctors I speak to want greater accessibility of impartial information on medicinal products, both for themselves and for patients and other professionals. They also want the descriptions of the preparations to be standardised, as they use the Internet predominantly to find information on the effects of medicinal products. Here they compare the active ingredients of the same medicine from different companies at home and abroad. It is therefore extremely important for pharmaceutical companies to understand their responsibility and the importance of their information being factually and technically correct and of it not being construed as advertising. Pharmaceutical companies must sell their products, we know that, but accountability actually increases consumers’ confidence in a preparation.</p>

    <intervention id="1-162" speaker_id="96981" name="Franz Obermayr" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, the wellbeing of patients is key here. In order to cover themselves, pharmaceutical companies often include every minor side effect in package leaflets, which, of course, complicates matters greatly. Confused patients tend to change the dose on their own initiative or to discontinue the medication.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, the flood of information via the Internet, some of which is reliable and some not, adds greatly to the confusion and uncertainty. Certified websites are a step in the right direction, but are not yet enough. A further priority is to make the information comprehensible even to those without medical or pharmaceutical qualifications. The package leaflet must be unmistakable and legible. The font size should be increased, particularly for older people.</p>
      <p sl="de">I regret to say that there are third countries that are profiting from the high level of protection in the European pharmaceutical sector. Both original and fake medicines are thus freely available in large quantities in Turkish bazaars. We therefore also need to impose obligations on these third countries in order to put an end to this black market entirely.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive that we are discussing is intended to harmonise the content and quality of pharmaceutical information which is accessible to all citizens of the Union. Whilst it stresses the right to advertise, it ultimately asserts the patient’s right to information. We must give all European citizens the same opportunity to access information on medicinal products.</p>
      <p sl="it">The main objective of this directive is to make European patients more informed so that they can take a more knowledgeable approach to medicine. Every one of us, and especially the pharmaceutical industry, must have the same objective, which is to provide information that is accurate and useful and, at the same time, available to all citizens without distinction.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that there are two particularly important points in the directive. Firstly, citizens must be given the opportunity, by means of accurate information, to use medicines correctly, so that they have a more beneficial effect on their health, whilst the risks associated with their misuse are minimised. Secondly, accurate and effective information can increase citizens’ awareness of the burden of pharmaceutical costs on public spending.</p>
      <p sl="it">In any case, we must be very attentive and rigorous on certain points. I refer, above all, to the danger of medicinal information turning into disguised advertising. We must avoid the risk of supposedly scientific information disguising a much less noble intention, which is to influence patients and steer them towards buying a particular medicine. It is therefore crucial to have effective tools to control information, especially that which patients may obtain from the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, I therefore hope that the Committee will provide ways to control information in such a way as to guarantee its accuracy. These controls should be entrusted to dedicated independent organisations so as to offer greater guarantees of impartiality.</p>

Although the original proposal from the Commission tended rather to put the market at the centre, we have now succeeded – through a wide range of amendments that were adopted with a large majority – in putting people at the centre instead, thereby taking into account what Commissioner Dalli said.</p>

Our task, however, is to provide information. I believe that the present report and the corresponding amendments give due consideration to our responsibility to provide information.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, since the costs of medicines make up a large proportion of healthcare spending, I urge you to work to ensure that patients are well informed and continue to pursue and focus on your initiatives, prevention and health promotion.

      <p sl="lt">As far as public access to information about pharmaceuticals is concerned, it would seem that the situation varies across the European Union. The distinction between information and advertising is becoming less clear. I therefore support Parliament’s position which aims for a clearer definition of information and advertising. It is important for patients to obtain reliable objective information in their mother tongue, for it to be designed for the non-expert public, and for it to be easy to understand and access, bearing in mind the particular needs of consumers. As well as patients, we must protect doctors from hidden advertising as their relationship in the treatment process is particularly important.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Accessibility of information will undoubtedly play a fundamental role in this change. Such information clearly includes information on medicinal products, including those that are subject to medical prescription.

Under difficult conditions, and despite battling against a severe headwind, a very good result has genuinely been achieved with this report. The Commission proposal has been improved considerably. A strict ban on advertising remains: there will be no information on the radio, television or in magazines; instead, patients must actively seek out the information. I base my position on the idea that patients are responsible people. They want to be informed, and I would very much like to help them achieve that. I therefore also want the patient to be at the centre of the information. I would like to focus on two key points. I myself have said in no uncertain terms – including in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – that I would like to see health portals on the Internet and similar information in printed media. Our citizens often look things up on the Internet, where they often come across poor and uncontrolled information. We must therefore counter this with an alternative: controlled information. Pharmacovigilance was a first success, with the adoption of drug safety portals that included the package leaflets and information on the medicines. However, I would like to go beyond this, Commissioner, and would have liked to have seen comprehensive Internet portals that also provide information on illnesses and prevention. If I have understood you correctly, you support this in principle, but perhaps have not said so in this dossier.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, on the excellent work he has been doing for several months on these two reports. I say this especially because we have been waiting years for this text. The oldest MEPs among us will remember that, back when the pharmaceutical legislation was being revised, we wanted to talk about teaching patients about medicinal products and treatments, but that, unfortunately, there was some confusion between information and advertising.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nowadays, information must not be allowed to be disguised advertising and, in fact, the emphasis in these reports is no longer on the right of companies to convey information but on the right of patients to access it. The rationale is therefore completely different, and that is why patients are the priority. Moreover, we say ‘no’ to unsolicited information, a move that will reduce the distribution channels and thus the risks of advertising.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Patients themselves will search for the information they want, which will not be forced on them, via the radio or television, newspapers or magazines. That, in fact, is what makes it different from advertising. Some information will therefore need to be pre-vetted. Such pre-vetting must be carried out by national authorities, and it must allow for the creation of specialist, objective websites, and the use of specific printed materials, as Commissioner Dalli has explained.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All the conditions are therefore in place for ensuring good quality information, objective information, information for which patients have long been waiting. This is why the Council absolutely must fulfil its responsibilities and agree to it, because we cannot allow just any information to be found on websites. We have been waiting for 10 years: 10 years for the Council to make its decision.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Mr Fjellner, too, deserves thanks for the report, for we have long needed a proposal for providing patients with more and better information on the prescription-only medicinal products prescribed to and used by them. Quality information is very important and contributes to improved healthcare conditions. When patients are adequately informed, they are more likely to follow the required treatment and will better understand the decisions relating to their treatment.</p>
      <p sl="hu">What we need is not only harmonisation of European regulations. We must also ensure an improvement in public health through the provision of correct information. Pharmaceutical companies also play an important role in this. However, we must also make sure that there is no excessive drug consumption as a result of commercial promotion.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There are numerous problems with the provision of information on medicines in EU Member States today. In some Member States, patients have difficulty accessing even the most basic information about prescribed medicines. This causes serious inequalities in EU healthcare. In addition to information available on the Internet, we need to provide guidance through traditional channels as well. However, our aim is not to ensure that pharmaceutical companies have the right to provide information, but to give patients the opportunity to obtain information. We need to distinguish between information and advertising. In my view, communication between patients and doctors is also important, since the primary source of information for the patient must be the physician who prescribes the medication. Other information channels should only serve to supplement that information.</p>

However, we are also aiming to put an end to misleading advertisements on the Internet that encourage people to buy products that not only do not cure, but may even harm patients. It is, however, not easy to regulate web content in a globalised digital environment. I would like to emphasise again that the solution is to implement as soon as possible the proposal to introduce reliability marks for safe websites. Only then will it be possible to ensure reliable content concerning medicines on the Internet, regardless of where in the world the website operator is based. Such a plan was also included in my report on consumer confidence in the digital environment.</p>

      <p sl="it">The motion stresses the difference between advertising and information. The provision of information is based on the principles of active research. Doctors must continue to be the main source of information on medicinal products. Other sources, which are understood to be complementary and which include magazines and newspapers, should be maintained.</p>
      <p sl="it">The central focus is the patient’s right to information, with the active participation of organisations that represent citizens, particularly patients. We voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we would all like to see patients using the existing information that is available to them. We need to create awareness among citizens about the use of the information currently available.</p>
      <p sl="en">I support colleagues here who say that we should not advertise products, and would say to the companies involved that communicating quality information to consumers is the best form of advertising, because if a product works for the citizen, then that is a clear message that it will be used where it is required. Of course, we need to have general practitioners communicating medical and scientific information to their patients. This often does not happen in the best possible way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we also need to be clear about how medicaments are allocated to citizens of different age groups. They are prescribed today with no review of the case for a year. This is very dangerous, and we need to have much more rigorous assessment of how patients are cared for, on a regular basis. Otherwise, we will have medical problems.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is indeed gratifying to see such a level of positive engagement on such an important file and the general agreement that there is on the trust that has been placed in the basic principles and concepts on which this proposal should be moving forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I stated earlier, it was very important that we shift the focus of the original proposal into a patient-orientated proposal based on the patient’s perspective.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have been following the debate in Parliament very assiduously. I have talked to many of you to see what is being talked about, and I believe that what we have – as I stated in my original comments – is a very positive document on which we should be now building in order to come to a final agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to make some short comments on what you have said. Concerning the ex-ante controls by EMA mentioned by Mr Correia, I believe that 120 days would be somewhat excessive and, in fact, what we will be proposing will be in the region of 60 days.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Internet is a daunting task, and controlling websites containing information for patients is vital – but we all understand that it is also difficult. The points raised by Mr Buşoi and Ms Grossetête concerning strict rules covering the Internet is very important, and this is what we should be developing.</p>
      <p sl="en">The focal point which the doctor needs to continue to have in the relationship with the patient is also very important, as stated by Mr Schnellhardt and also, in their own ways, by Mr Pargneaux and Mr Parvanova.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree that doctors should not be instrumentalised by the pharmaceutical industry but, on the other hand, a doctor should be a good medium through which information should flow. Here, we must ensure that information in the hands of doctors, as Mrs Rosbach has stated, should also be objective.</p>
      <p sl="en">My last point regards the comprehensive portal on diseases, which was mentioned by Mrs Weisgerber. I have to say that, in the case of medicines, this is already covered by the pharmacovigilance legislation that we are proposing. It is somewhat more difficult in the case of diseases. We already have a portal on rare diseases, but in the case of the overall spectrum of diseases, we have started and are attempting to tackle this issue. However, it is proving to be a very complex and, as you will understand, an extremely extensive exercise.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I would like to thank you for the work that has been done on this dossier. I would like to thank the rapporteur and the co-rapporteurs again for the work that they have done, and I hope, as I said, that finally, we will have a document on which we can work further.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I am pleased that the Commission started by pointing out precisely the fact that access to information on medicinal products currently varies enormously throughout Europe, because we have tried very hard to ensure that everyone has good access and to harmonise this access. At the same time, I had a requirement of my own and that was that the information must not be worse or sparser in any particular country. I know that this is something that many people were concerned about in some countries, including Sweden, where, for a long time, we have had a system called Fass. I will now address those people directly and say that the way Parliament has voted here not only means that it is possible to retain Fass, but it is also possible for other countries to introduce similar systems.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In other respects, of course, the rules in Europe today are rather strange in that anyone can say whatever they like about medicinal products that are subject to medical prescription except those who manufacture these medicinal products; in other words, those who should know most about them. I am therefore pleased that we have established that they not only have the right, they actually have a duty to disseminate certain basic information. They must also contribute, because after all, they are the ones sitting on a lot of the information.</p>
      <p sl="sv">To the Commissioner I would simply like to say that I am very pleased to see that you and I seem to agree on all of the points that are key for me in this work. I believe that the Commission and Parliament are now in agreement. This puts considerable pressure on the Council to take up this matter in a constructive way and work further on it. To be honest, even with regard to the points in the proposal to which the Commission has stated that it has objections, I would maintain that the essence of what we want to achieve is very similar, for example, as regards printed material and the possibility of helping those countries that have constitutional problems, including Sweden, to solve them in the proposal.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I would like simply to address those Members here who do not think that we should have an exception for doctors and the information that doctors are to provide. Personally, I think that a doctor who sees a clinical trial published by a company should have the right to give it to a patient if the doctor deems the information to be relevant, or that a doctor who finds a package leaflet in a language other than that Member States’ official language should have the right to print out that information and give it to a patient. In that case, however, we must vote for the doctor himself to be able to decide and not for this directive to govern what doctors are to give to patients. It is always the doctors’ responsibility and we should not regulate it here.</p>

      <p sl="en">Information regarding consumer products has become essential. Information on medicines is especially sensitive. One important distinction which has to be made is between information and advertisement. The European Parliament, in discussing this report, is making safeguards where medicines are concerned. One instance is that printed matter has to be submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 90 days in advance for analyses before being forwarded to consumers. One important element which is not being addressed is information on prices. During this legislature, I have insisted on the high prices of medicines in Malta when compared to the same medicines elsewhere in the European Union. The difference in price is not minimal but unbelievable. The cost of some medicines in Malta is double or even more than the cost in Europe. When I submitted questions to the Commission on the subject, they always indicated that this is an issue for the national government. I strongly believe that the EMA should not only act as a shield for consumers in relation to information on medicines, but when consumers are being blatantly overcharged for medicines and national governments are unable to tackle the issue, the EMA should have the ability to address the issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome the provisions in the report on the information on medicinal products which emphasise the right of consumers to information. Regarding this, I would like to draw your attention to the online public consultation launched by the EC in connection with forthcoming amendments to the Tobacco Products Directive. Undoubtedly, this initiative is praiseworthy and I support it.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I would like to see the position of Parliament and the Council because, since I have familiarised myself with the proposals, I define some as extreme, unreasonable and, to some extent, I am even surprised at their inclusion for discussion. I mean some of the proposed options such as the introduction of simplified uniform packing without insignia, a ban on the display of products in sale and prohibiting the use of additives in the production of tobacco products.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that in drawing up new regulations, reality must be considered. Extreme bans and restrictive regulatory measures on tobacco should be treated with caution. This is a growing problem and I don’t want this signal to remain without discussion. The Commission proposes, but what it gives us as proposals is not always the best for all Member States. A debate in this case is obligatory!</p>

      <p sl="et">I think it is a good thing that, as a result of this proposal, the focus of the directive and the regulation has moved from drug manufacturers to patients. It is extremely important to raise patients’ awareness of prescription drugs in order to prevent overconsumption of medicines as a result of commercial considerations. Unfortunately, in many Member States, it has become the norm for drug companies to lobby hard, offering a number of benefits which certainly have an influence on doctors’ decisions. Needless to say, business interests are not always consistent with the interests of patients, and this is why the amendment to Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 are necessary in order to create a clear framework for giving out information on prescription drugs. A clear framework would help to promote the rational use of drugs and would be in the interest of patients. There should certainly be clearer distinctions made between advertising and information, even though direct advertising of prescription drugs to consumers will remain prohibited under the relevant proposals.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Environment Committee has made some important improvements to the Commission’s proposal which, in its original form, would not have prevented all forms of advertising of prescription drugs directly to patients. Prescription medicines are not like ordinary consumer goods. They should be supplied by clinical experts, not marketed like cars or cosmetics. So I welcome the continued ban on advertising of prescription medicines on television, radio, and in the print media. Healthcare professionals remain the most trusted source of information about medicines. So I cannot support the rapporteur’s amendment which would allow healthcare professionals to distribute additional, unapproved material from the pharmaceutical companies directly to patients. This would represent a clear opportunity to advertise, something which we want to avoid and which would be inconsistent with our position against direct advertising to patients. It is especially inappropriate because the material directly from the pharmaceutical company would, in the patient's eyes, carry the legitimacy of the doctor distributing it. On the whole, the report represents improvements for patients compared to the Commission proposal, and we should not undermine these improvements by allowing pharmaceutical companies to advertise directly to patients in the doctor’s surgery.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Jill Evans, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (recast) (COM(2008)0809 – C6-0471/2008 – 2008/0240(COD)) (A7-0196/2010).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-181" speaker_id="4550" name="Jill Evans" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would first of all like to thank all of my colleagues who have made this first reading agreement possible – in particular, of course, all of the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and both the Spanish and Belgian Presidencies, as well as the Environment Committee and the group staff and assistants. We managed to reach agreement following a lot of hard but constructive work, including some very difficult compromises.</p>
      <p sl="en">To put this debate into its proper context, over 9 million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment is sold every year in the European Union. Most of this is large household appliances and IT and telecommunication equipment. As this market continues to grow, it has also become the fastest-growing waste stream in the EU, estimated to rise to a huge 12.3 million tonnes by 2020. It is a very complex waste stream that includes several hazardous substances.</p>
      <p sl="en">The waste hierarchy makes prevention of waste the first priority, which means substituting hazardous substances in products which prevent recycling or pose a risk to health and the environment when undergoing waste treatment. The Commission estimates that the current RoHS Directive has led to a reduction of 100 000 tonnes of certain heavy metals and two groups of brominated flame retardants from going into the waste stream and potentially entering the environment. RoHS has set a global standard, but there was a need for more clarity, so we had a great responsibility with this recast to ensure that a clearer and more ambitious law was adopted.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that we have improved the current directive in a number of ways. It now has a clear methodology, with criteria for deciding on new restrictions, complementary to and independent of REACH. The scope has been extended to include all electrical and electronic equipment within eight years, unless it is specifically excluded. There will be a review for additional exclusions within three years, together with an examination of three phthalates and one brominated flame retardant identified as priority. Time-limited exemptions can be granted on the basis of clear criteria and application deadlines. Nanomaterials will be looked at specifically in future reviews of restrictions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given my ambitions for this report, Members will not be surprised that I am not completely satisfied with the final outcome. The RoHS Directive was designed to address the specific problems of a specific waste stream and I think that we have missed an opportunity to move it forward substantially by adding further restrictions. However, we have kept its identity and strengthened the Commission proposal in many ways.</p>
      <p sl="en">On correlation tables, my group supports making this obligatory for Member States, but this is a horizontal issue that affects all European legislation and cannot be resolved in this one file. To help find a solution, I proposed in Amendment 105 that we adopt a declaration calling on the Commission to report on the current practice of Member States in providing correlation tables and how it affects the Commission’s work instead of insisting on mandatory correlation tables. This will give us a much clearer picture for the future debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">In summary, we managed to strengthen a rather vague and unambitious proposal into a new RoHS which will deliver a higher level of protection for human health and the environment now and in the near future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Mr Potočnik, the Commissioner responsible for this file, is here with me, but unfortunately he has to remain silent because of a problem with his throat. I know that he has been working on this file for a long time, so I will do my best to be his voice.</p>
      <p sl="en">We stand on the threshold of a first-reading agreement on the recast of the directive on the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment – the RoHS agreement. We would not have reached this point if it were not for the hard work of the European Parliament on this important dossier. I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Jillian Evans, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for the excellent work carried out on this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">RoHS has been a successful piece of legislation since it was adopted in 2003. It has prevented thousands of tonnes of banned substances from being thrown away and potentially released into the environment. It has brought about important changes in the design of electronic products in the European Union and worldwide. Other countries, including the EU’s major trading partners, have followed the EU’s example and brought in similar legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We use enormous and increasing amounts of electronic equipment, which contain a lot of metal resources. A computer, for example, contains over 60 raw materials. On average, each EU citizen produces 25 kg of electronic waste every year. This law will ensure that electronic products are freed from many hazardous substances and will make this large waste stream easier to recycle. This law therefore also helps make the EU more resource-efficient, in line with our Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, industry and Member States alike have reported the risk of inadequate or inefficient implementation and enforcement of the directive. The status quo is insufficient, not only in terms of protection of the environment, but also in terms of creating a level playing field within the EU. Therefore, it is important that this law be clarified and streamlined. The key element for the Commission is to ensure alignment with REACH, but real environmental benefits only arise when a law is properly implemented and enforced at national level. I hope that the introduction of the common definitions and assessment tools of the new legislative framework for the marketing of products in this law will significantly improve this.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, the directive’s environmental ambition is improved through the extension of the product coverage, first by the two new categories – medical devices and monitoring and control instruments – and, in eight years, to all electronic products. Further extensions to the scope of this law will further increase the environmental benefits, but economic operators should, of course, have sufficient time to adapt, and all scope changes should be based on solid information. The Commission will therefore review the scope changes as regards the current law, which have not yet been subject to impact assessments. The Commission would therefore like to clarify the issue by making two statements.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, on the scope, the Commission interprets that it follows from Article 2(1a) that during the transitional period of eight years, Member States are obliged to allow electrical and electronic equipment that was outside the scope of Directive 2002/95/EC, but which would be covered by the new directive, to continue to be made available on their market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, concerning the review pursuant to Article 19, the Commission intends to undertake, no later than three years after the entry into force of this directive, an impact assessment focusing on the changes in scope. This review may result in the Commission making a legislative proposal in line with its right of legislative initiative in the treaties.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would also like to make the following declarations as regards nanomaterials. We note that work towards a common definition on nanomaterials is still ongoing within the Commission. We intend to adopt a recommendation on such a common definition for all legislative sectors in the near future. The Commission considers that the RoHS provision covered different forms, including nanoforms, of the substances which are currently banned, and those which, in the future, will be subject to a priority review under RoHS.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission also regrets the lack of support for the provision, including in the Commission proposal, making the establishment of correlation tables obligatory. The Commission accepted the substitution of the obligatory provision by a recital encouraging Member States to follow this practice in order to facilitate a first-reading agreement, but it states that this should not be seen to be a precedent. We will continue to work with the colegislators in an effort to find a horizontal solution to this horizontal institutional issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission can accept the compromise package in order to reach an agreement on this directive at first reading. I would encourage Parliament to adopt the same position.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, to begin, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Evans, for her excellent work in preparing the report. Without her commitment and determination, achieving a compromise between the political groups and the institutions at first reading would have been impossible. The RoHS Directive belongs to those legislative acts which place the environment and sustainable development on the same footing as the uninterrupted movement of goods. Her efforts in the field of environmental protection have, to date, led to a spectacular placing of limits on heavy metals in the waste stream of electrical and electronic equipment and the appearance of technological innovations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Our priority during work on the review of the RoHS Directive was to raise safety standards for electrical appliances and electronic gadgets for sale in the European Union. The new rules will require all manufacturers of electrical and electronic equipment to use substances which have been tested and which are safe for health and the environment. The open scope of the directive will have a positive influence on the harmonisation of the internal common market and the movement of goods, and will give European entrepreneurs legal certainty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe the negotiated compromise is a good one, and that it is beneficial in terms of environmental protection and the removal of toxic substances from equipment and waste products. On the other hand, the amended RoHS Directive gives industry and entrepreneurs the necessary timeframe in which to introduce changes and to make the adaptations required. The proposed methodology for determining the substances intended for priority review is based on REACH, and also brings legal coherence and consistency to European Union legislation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I hope that our Commissioner gets his voice back again, because we need a voice at the climate conference in Cancún. I had been rather surprised that Mrs Damanaki was speaking here on the revision of the hazardous substances directive after also speaking on the fisheries revisions; thank you for stepping into the breach.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament has not got everything that it wanted. Annex 3 has been dropped, which we regret. However, we will continue to keep an eye on these substances and when the revision takes place in three years’ time, you will have to come back to this House with your impact assessments and provide evidence of the problems that exist there on a substance-by-substance basis. We also have a considerable number of exemptions, so that it rather resembles a Swiss cheese. We also need to check here the gaps and shortcomings that exist as regards human health and the environment. I will simply say that solar panels were highly controversial. We want to keep cadmium out of the environment, but these panels put 100 000 tonnes of cadmium into the environment. That is something we will have to watch carefully.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am pleased that the Commission has made some concessions with its four statements, so for now, we will take what progress has been made in 2010 and we will meet again in three years’ time for the revision. Naturally, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, with this directive, we have before us legislation that has come about surprisingly quickly. I am very surprised that we have reached a compromise already which I and my group – and I expressly underline that – consider acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">When all is said and done, this piece of legislation has had a very difficult passage through Parliament. We expanded its scope, only to restrict it again straight away. We have quite incidentally attempted to declare certain substances highly dangerous; perhaps we should ask ourselves whether this legislation is really the right forum for such a debate. Personally, I did not think it a good idea to include PVC and nanomaterials in a directive on ‘hazardous substances’. I therefore think it sensible that this is no longer the case in the compromise.</p>
      <p sl="de">The previous speaker has just said so already, but it really is remarkable that we consider each gram of polluting substances so carefully and are then sometimes very irrational in our debates. Apparently, there are industries in Europe which we are ring-fencing for political reasons. This seems to be the case for enterprises in the renewable energy sector. The fact that we instantly exempt them completely from the scope of this legislation by saying that we have to put up with environmental pollution for the sake of climate protection and our objectives in the area of renewable energy is incomprehensible. It does not add up.</p>
      <p sl="de">I only hope that we do not do the same thing in the case of electronic waste – the decision on which is also imminent here – because that would be even more astonishing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to add my thanks to the rapporteur and her staff. After very long negotiations, we have an agreement that my group can sign up to.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I do want to take this opportunity to mention a couple of areas. This recast was intended to improve matters. By definition, I think that is what a recast should do. It was intended to simplify the requirements and demands on manufacturers. Looking at the result, it seems to me to be in many ways one step forward and two back. I welcome the removal of Annex III, which effectively created a blacklist for many substances, but I regret the inability to agree on the availability as a criterion. That took a great deal of discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, it was intended to create legal certainty. I have to mention the opening of the scope here. Right from the beginning, I argued that it would create uncertainty and simply cause new demands for exemptions and exceptions. It seemed to me that, at the very least, we required a full impact assessment from the Commission before agreeing to this. I have not changed my mind, but I accept that I have lost the argument. The checks and balances now being written into the regulations are, I believe, going to lead to a number of challenges, and I welcome the Commission’s commitment to look at this after it is included. But it would, in my view, have been better to have done this before. I wonder how this opening of the scope has actually advanced legal certainty and clarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would also like to mention the real danger of over-regulation. In voting for the RoHS recast, we are, in effect, continuing a dual tracking of regulation and EU approval for chemical – hazardous – substances. We have the REACH regulations in place, and their implementation is, as we heard at committee recently, evolving satisfactorily. At some point soon, we will have to grasp the nettle and let the REACH regime lead, as it was intended to. I look forward to the Commission taking this point on board.</p>

One major success of the new version is the open scope. This approach is exemplary and I am pleased that we were able to agree on it. On the negative side is the fact that the list of six substances that were already banned has not been expanded to include substances such as chlorinated and brominated flame retardants, phthalates and PVC. Although there is sufficient evidence of the risk to health that these substances present, they will not be banned in 2011 when the new version is in force.</p>
      <p sl="de">Certain leading electronics manufacturers have been placing products such as mobile phones, televisions and laptops that do not contain these pollutants on the market on a voluntary basis for a number of years, and without any great increase in costs. We have passed up a great opportunity here to make the growing electrical and electronics industry a little more environmentally friendly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Leading manufacturers are showing us the way. Instead of supporting these manufacturers with good initiatives, however, the EU is behind the times. It is the poor of this world that will suffer as a result. After all, every year, we dump millions of tonnes of toxic electrical and electronic waste on them. The poor cannot afford to pay for lobbyists in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we opposed the proposal for a directive in committee because the rapporteur had radically changed the Commission’s proposal in a restrictive way by expanding its scope; proposing the gradual phase-out of a further 33 substances in Annex III, including brominated and chlorinated flame retardants, as well as PVC and its additives; limiting the scope for exemptions and the time taken to adjust; and introducing restrictive regulations for nanomaterials.</p>
      <p sl="it">Had this House voted in favour of this decision, which is not supported by sufficient scientific evidence, it would have caused very serious damage to the economy, with major repercussions for unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="it">Fortunately, thanks to a series of trialogues in which I participated as shadow rapporteur, a more than satisfactory compromise has been reached, with a commitment to conduct an audit and a possible review within three years.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another complex subject was the detailed definition of nanomaterials, which has been suspended, pending a proposal by the Commission. The text, as arising from the trialogues, can be supported and adopted.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, our heartfelt thanks go to the rapporteur. The directive on electrical and electronic equipment is highly controversial. There were great differences of opinion regarding various aspects. I am therefore pleased that agreement has been reached and at what I regard as the good result of the trialogue negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would specifically like to reiterate two points. One is the question of the scope. What equipment should the directive actually cover? There is one thing that we must not forget: originally, it was meant to cover domestic appliances – in other words, white goods. The open scope now includes many new product groups, which would also have encompassed technologies for renewable energy. I must point out that this directive actually had a quite different objective. Naturally, much stricter and higher standards of protection need to be applied in the case of domestic appliances than in the case of technologies such as those that are uninstalled, recycled, etc. by specialist personnel.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I, in turn, advocated the exemption of renewable energies. I was not in favour of expanding the scope, but then I saw that a majority was moving in that direction. I think it would have been counterproductive to include renewable energy in this directive. It would have resulted in a competitive disadvantage and therefore I think it is the right decision.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then I would like to say something about Annex III: I would have had concerns about including a further 37 substances as priority substances when there is no real justification on health grounds for a future ban on these. I think that would be a panic measure, and that is why I think the decision made is the right one and am pleased about this aspect of the result too.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur. Mrs Evans has a remarkable determination, thanks to which we can today reach a compromise that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (the S&amp;D Group) can endorse. I am saying ‘can endorse’ because a number of significant improvements have been made to this very important legislation. These improvements concern the expansion of open application areas, though we would have preferred them to be introduced more quickly. A further result of the improvements is that we still have a separate, independent directive – independent of REACH – obviously with the necessary coordination between the two. Thirdly, and I personally find this extremely important, thanks to these improvements, we have a good methodology, which Parliament has had difficulty negotiating, which should ensure that substances come under review again, so that we can see what their possible effects may be. On top of that, there are a number of substances (HBCDD) – which I have to look up on my paper here – one of the most commonly used and most controversial brominated flame retardants and three important phthalates – that should be addressed as a matter of priority. Naturally, action is also being taken on nanomaterials. We would have wanted to go much further, but we are happy that the Commission will, nonetheless, issue a statement. That is very important. Would we have wanted to go further? Yes, of course, we are unhappy with some aspects. Obviously, our group would have liked some additional substances to be banned, the review to happen more quickly and there to be fewer exemptions. As far as the latter is concerned, I really must come back to solar panels for a moment. The S&amp;D Group was the only group to oppose to the end the totally mistaken idea that solar panels should be kept outside the scope. A special lobby has emerged around this issue, and completely unjustifiably so, if you ask me, because that will allow cadmium, a substance which has been banned since 2003, to remain in circulation for another ten years at least. I find that particularly unfortunate, especially for a sector that should undoubtedly be taking a lead in this regard. Nevertheless, the S&amp;D Group will be pleased to support this compromise. I only hope that the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group do not have the wrong dossier in front of them, because I have not seen from them much involvement in the trialogues.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the recast version of the directive should help improve protection for the consumer and environment alike. I believe we have achieved this because we have established a realistic framework that is based on the actual risks to consumers and the environment and that offers businesses legal certainty for investments and innovations. This is very important for small and medium-sized businesses carrying out research in specific areas. It is comforting to know that we have been able to agree risk-appropriate guidelines in relation to this important topic and, in this regard, I would also like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have heard several speakers express their regret that the panels have been dropped. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not talking about cadmium here, but about cadmium telluride. The issues at stake here are innovation and investment. Indeed, we need to consider these questions separately. The devices in question are not electrical appliances, but rather equipment for generating electricity. This is a very significant distinction. We cannot take a catch-all approach, saying ‘These are all poisonous substances’. After all, for example, my own body contains a certain amount of sulphur. Now, sulphur is not something I would readily choose to ingest. However, things are quite different when we are dealing with chemical compounds. That is why I am pleased that we have finally managed to put the question of PVC behind us. The businesses that manufacture PVC have done a lot of research in the last few years. One only has to look at the latest developments to realise what has been going on in the world. We do not need to revisit a debate that is already ten years old.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am satisfied with the version now before us. I am certain it will enable us to achieve great benefits to the environment and consumer, as well as promoting innovation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, we have witnessed considerable attempts by Community institutions to ensure that the production, use and disposal of electronic products better protect the environment and human health.</p>
      <p sl="it">The RoHS Directive is a key element of this policy. Compliance with the directives is certainly a challenge and a burden for businesses, but it is also an opportunity. Indeed, the ability to supply less polluting products is a very important distinguishing factor for our businesses, so much so that it can be classed as a real competitive advantage. Businesses must not regard the regulations and the provisions in the directive simply as obligations designed to penalise them, but as opportunities to improve business processes and product quality.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nonetheless, some exemptions have been deemed necessary – some because of the current serious economic crisis, others because they are the subject of a subsequent and specific directive. This is the case for nanomaterials, the space and safety sectors, fixed installations, means of transport and self-propelled machinery, human-implantable medical devices, photovoltaic panels and equipment intended for research and development applications.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, I would take this opportunity to express my desire for greater consistency between the RoHS Directive and the REACH regulation, with any risk of confusion or overlap avoided, because businesses and operators need clear and definite rules.</p>

      <p sl="de">Firstly, we need to remember the international dimension in all that we do. After all, what use is it if the European Union remains unblemished, but the importing of hazardous substances is still permitted.</p>

At least the tabled amendment manages to encompass all the exceptions foreseen. I believe that this will also provide some important guidance for the business sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, what is particularly important in respect of these guidelines is that consumers should be kept informed. I believe it will continue to be very important in the future that consumers should know about the potential environmental pollutants that they may be buying when they purchase electronics or electrical appliances. This is the only way to ensure that the correct procedures will be followed with our next directive, namely, in relation to the disposal of these devices.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in advanced industrialised countries, the lifecycle of electrical and electronic equipment is constantly shrinking. The replacement rate of this equipment is therefore accelerating, with the result that waste from electrical and electronic equipment is becoming an ever greater environmental burden.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is a form of waste that is complex and very often contains hazardous substances which cannot yet be removed in a satisfactory way. It is therefore appropriate to consider the possible replacement of these substances at the electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing stage.</p>
      <p sl="sk">According to the information available, our gradual aim should be to find, in particular, harmless substitutes for halogen flame retardants, or for cheap and widely-used PVC. However, in the case of PVC in particular, I think it will be necessary to take a very sensitive approach to finding the right compromise between the objective requirements of environmental protection and the interests of the manufacturing sector.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members of Parliament, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur again for her hard work, owing to which an agreement appears to be emerging from Parliament. This is very important. So we now have a package of rules set out by Parliament thanks to which Member States can ensure that electronic products placed on the European markets are free of certain hazardous substances. This proposal was a compromise, and we all know that compromises lead to compromises. This is obvious, so it is also obvious that Parliament, the Commission and everybody involved has shown a great deal of goodwill. The result is something that the majority of us can support.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has a lot to say on this issue. We would have liked the compromise text and scope to be clearer with regard to the obligations of the Member States and the economic operators within the eight-year transition period. The statements the Commission has made on the scope outline the way we think the compromise text should be interpreted with regard to the scope. This is why I would like to ensure that these statements are included in Parliament’s record. We nevertheless take very seriously our obligations to make an impact assessment of all scope changes as compared to the current directive, and we will start working on this as soon as the revised directive enters into force.</p>
      <p sl="en">On enforcement, we find that the provisions on conformity assessment and marking are going to make a difference, as they set clear obligations both on how economic operators show that their products are compliant and on how Member States are supposed to verify compliance.</p>

But we have the support of all the groups, and I very much hope and trust that in the vote on Wednesday, we will see that reflected.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also very pleased to hear that the Commission is committed to this directive, since the future of the directive itself will lie almost entirely in the hands of the Commission should the text be adopted on Wednesday. We will have no further codecision powers and, in future, the Commission would review the scope and the future restrictions. So I would call on the Commission to prioritise that view of the future restrictions so that we can further clean up this very important waste stream, which still creates so many problems for human health and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we have heard colleagues saying tonight, prevention is better than cure and there are far more problem substances than those heavy metals and brominated flame retardants which are restricted under the current RoHS Directive. There is also plenty of evidence of the need for future restrictions.</p>
      <p sl="en">This debate has, of course, been followed with interest by a great many people, including industry and NGOs.

      <p sl="it">According to recent data, 9.3 million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment, consisting mainly of large household appliances and IT and telecoms equipment, are sold each year in the European Union. With the expansion of the market and the shortening of innovation cycles, equipment is replaced more frequently, thereby adding to the amount of waste electrical and electronic equipment. It is estimated that such waste will reach 12.3 million tonnes by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="it">The RoHS Directive, adopted in 2003, was intended to gradually eliminate a first series of hazardous substances, and it has allowed for a reduction in the amount of substances which are disposed of and potentially released into the environment. The review of this directive has been undertaken with the aim of introducing stricter regulations in relation to the restriction of hazardous substances. I believe that the compromise package, which was achieved following long negotiations between the Council and Parliament, represents an important step in the direction of greater clarity and simplification of the directive. One aspect of regulation that is particularly important is the exclusion from the scope of the directive of those substances which would have been banned without any scientific evidence, thus damaging the numerous businesses which operate in the market.</p>

Now, I believe that this compromise package represents significant progress towards greater clarity and simplification of the RoHS Directive. Of the many aspects which are to be taken into consideration for the purpose of regulation, I would like to draw particular attention to the exclusion from the scope of the directive of those substances – such as PVC and nanomaterials – which would have faced a ban on their production. Not only would the ban be enforced without any objective scientific evidence; it would also harm technological progress associated with the production of such materials. For this reason, all in all, we can be satisfied with the agreement that has been negotiated. On the one hand, this agreement strengthens environmental protection needs, by banning substances which are deemed to be hazardous following reliable scientific tests; on the other hand, however, it prevents other materials, the risks of which have not been scientifically proven, from being blacklisted to the detriment of producers and researchers, but, above all, to the detriment of consumers.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Renewables have the aim of helping to protect the environment. It is entirely contrary to their aim to create new hazards for the environment and for human health. The RoHS Directive and the Council Resolution of 28 January 1988 on a Community action programme to combat environmental pollution by cadmium are principally targeted against the use of cadmium, as Europe is a region particularly at risk from this cumulative carcinogenic poison. I would like to express my fundamental opposition to amendment No 12. This proposal excludes photovoltaic panels from the scope of the RoHS Directive. However, this exclusion unfortunately does not have the effect of supporting solar technologies. In fact, it legalises the production of cells based on tellurides of cadmium. CdTe cells enable producers to achieve higher profits than is the case with silicon cells. The approval of this proposal therefore represents support for the production of CdTe cells at the expense of silicon cells, which have a limitless supply of raw materials and do not contain toxic materials. The situation is all the more serious for the fact that if there is an exemption from the RoHS Directive for photovoltaic cells, it will not be possible to review and reassess the decision for a number of years. Research into non-toxic photovoltaic technologies will be accelerated only if producers of solar panels have to comply with the requirements of the RoHS Directive now, just like everyone else.</p>

      <p sl="de">Revision of the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment poses a particular challenge. However, a recast is urgently needed in order to eradicate uncertainties in respect of the scope, the lack of clarity of the legal provisions and definitions, as well as the differences between Member States and potential procedural overlaps with other EU legal acts, for example, REACH. The Commission’s original proposal was tailored far too much to large enterprises. The economic capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises is taken into greater consideration in the current version. After all, these small and medium-sized enterprises form the backbone of European competitiveness. The derogation procedure and the relevant deadlines for a Commission decision have also been set out clearly. The requirement laid down to review the directive within 10 years in order to adapt it to technological progress should also be highlighted. When this review is carried out, it must, in particular, take account of the availability and reliability of alternative products as well as the socio-economic impact.</p>

There can be little doubt that the roots of the financial crisis lie in our monetary system, in other words, the way in which money is generated. Private commercial banks pump incredible amounts of money into the system. This promotes speculation, fuels inflation and, finally, leads to massive debt among those involved. Consequently, we are faced with a systemic crisis that cannot be resolved by investing billions in a ramshackle banking system, even if we do so by diverting funds to the Irish economy. What we need is a real form of money creation. We need to return the generation of money to the public sector. This would enable us to pour hundreds of billions back into European economies. Moreover, the public creation of money would be compatible with a free market economy. However, such massive decisions would require courage and strength from our politicians.

      <p sl="ro">Every month we find that young people sent by the Romanian Government for training provided through the programme initiated by the social democrats in 2004 are released by the administration or a job cannot be found for them, even though they have all the experience and desire required to make an effective contribution to the system.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I support labour market mobility, but the government in Bucharest must create new jobs which will also benefit from these young people’s expertise.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to pass on all our support to Romanian students and student associations, such as the League of Romanian Students Abroad.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the fishing boats that fish in the Indian Ocean are suffering a wave of pirate attacks. In the last two weeks, there have been ten attacks on the Intertuna III, the Demiku, the Elai Alai, the Playa de Anzoras, the Albacan, the Erroxape, the Campolibre Alai and the Playa de Aritzatxu.</p>
      <p sl="es">The attacks are happening increasingly far from the coast, because the pirates are using boats that they have hijacked as supply boats to improve their logistics. Even with private security, these boats are very vulnerable. They report their positions and no one intercepts them.</p>
      <p sl="es">Coordination must improve, as the European Union Naval Force has not intervened in any of these attacks. We do not know how they respond to these alerts.</p>
      <p sl="es">The resolution that we adopted in November last year in Parliament must be complied with, and we need more involvement from the United Nations. More countries need to be involved with, and more resources allocated to, Operation Atalanta, along with more effective blockades of the Somali coast and more agreements with coastal states to prosecute pirates.</p>
      <p sl="es">Piracy has an impact on our fishing and merchant fleet, and also on the countries with whom we sign agreements, whose development or ruin also depends on the safety of fishing in that area.</p>

      <p sl="it">On 17 November, following the opening, the head of the Communication unit, Wolfgang Petzold, ordered exhibitors immediately to suspend the exhibition on the grounds that the panels depicted captions which were different from those which had been agreed.</p>

It also emerged that the curator of the exhibition was told, by the same head of unit, to remove the terms ‘occupation’ and ‘Turkish invasion’. I phoned the head of unit a number of times to clarify what took place, but neither the director in question, nor members of his staff agreed to speak with me. A few hours after I reported these details, the exhibition was reopened.</p>

These people squandered the wealth created by an energetic and innovative population, and they must be held accountable.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the crisis was also caused by lax regulation of the banking sector. That failure also extends to Europe. One should remember last July’s banking stress tests, when the Commission effectively signed off on the future of the very banks in Ireland that are at the heart of the crisis. How could this happen? I am very angry that my country has reached this point – very angry indeed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Yet as part of a Eurobarometer survey, the findings of which have emerged today, over 27 000 citizens throughout the EU and 1 000 citizens in Ireland were asked for their views as to how we should emerge from the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">To focus on just two issues, one question asked citizens to rank in order of preference how we could rapidly move out from the crisis. While 29% of EU citizens and one third of Irish citizens did favour reducing public spending, two thirds of EU citizens and 57% of Irish citizens favoured boosting the economy first of all, or combining both approaches.</p>
      <p sl="en">A question on policy priorities showed that over 50% of both EU and Irish citizens reckoned we should tackle poverty and social exclusion first.

      <p sl="fr">The announced withdrawal of the United Kingdom could have tragic repercussions for the maritime safety of this sector, which, with more than 250 000 vessels a year, is the busiest trading route in the world.

Whether this programme remains on paper or is translated into action on the ground depends on us. In order to succeed, both European institutions and Member States need to take responsibility for it. Instead, the Bulgarian Government is conducting a policy which runs not only counter to national, but also to European policy on scientific research and education. While Europe has allocated three percent to research and development until 2020, Bulgaria has only reached a modest 0.6 percent.</p>

Around 40% of our artistic output in Europe is affected by orphanhood.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, good evening Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution which we hope to adopt here on Thursday sends, in my view, a very important signal, a signal which demonstrates that there is a great deal of support in this House for our typical European media model, which gives space to both commercial broadcasters, on the one hand, and public broadcasters, that is, public media companies, on the other. This model, Madam President, is typically European, because you will not, or only very occasionally, find it in the United States or Japan, let alone in China. In most Member States of the European Union, this dual media model has proved to offer the best guarantees when it comes to media pluralism, independence of editorials and freedom of the press in general. However, this model is, unfortunately, coming under heavy pressure in the European Union. That pressure is coming from various quarters. It is coming through the heavy cuts that competent authorities, national or regional, are facing, but there is also a great deal of pressure from private media companies on public broadcasters. They consider public broadcasters to be representative of unfair competition, especially on the Internet. As a result of this overall situation, public broadcasters in a number of Member States of the European Union are actually struggling to keep their heads above water. This is calling into question the delicate balance of the dual system which is being compromised. We have to do everything we can to ensure that our European media model remains intact in these turbulent times and that we give it a firm foundation for the future, too. A number of interventions are needed for that purpose and we have formulated these in the resolution. The first point I would like to make, and I am not sure whether this forum is aware of it, is that, at one time, all Member States of the European Union formally committed themselves to guaranteeing freedom of the press under the framework of the Council of Europe. That includes a clearly defined remit and funding for public broadcasting. Long-term funding is important. It is time that we, as the European Parliament, reminded all 27 Member States that they made those commitments back then and that they also have to keep to them. My second point is that pluralism in the media, and freedom of the press in general, are an essential part of our democracy. That is why we want to introduce the role of media pluralism monitor. That, Commissioner, is a tool developed on the Commission’s initiative. It is a very useful tool and one that can serve as a beacon in a number of Member States, in a number of regions where media diversity and media pluralism are at risk of coming under pressure. Last but not least, I think that the biggest challenge for all media is to secure for themselves a presence online, a digital presence on the Internet. The growing nervousness about – or, we might even say, the growing hostility to – public broadcasters’ initiatives on the Internet is disturbing. Some people in politics, in national politics in particular, and also in the media, seem to forget that clear agreements were made last year about the online activities of public broadcasters, and it is essential that they are respected. If we follow this line of argument, Madam President, I think that we also need to develop models which will allow search engines and Internet service providers to play their part. To conclude, I think that we cannot afford to stand on the sidelines any longer, otherwise we will wake up to find that Google and YouTube, and Apple too, have taken over our media landscape. That, of course, would be completely undesirable.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, there is a need to take steps in the European Union to ensure balance and a plurality of views, which will be greatly helped by an equilibrium between public service and commercial media on the market. With regard to maintaining cultural diversity, freedom of expression and healthy competition, we must not, of course, adopt a one-size-fits-all solution, and we must therefore respect the efforts of individual Member States to address the issue of increasing the share of public service media at the national level.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, a balanced ratio between public service media and commercial media on the Internet as well should be a priority both for national strategies and for European media policy in the near future. It is also necessary to encourage interested parties to cooperate creatively in order to improve the quality of information provided on the media market, and to produce innovations in this sector. I would like to end by saying that media plurality and freedom is a cornerstone of democracy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I am also of the opinion that the dual media system can also be a success here in Europe and that it is important that we should have public broadcasters, on the one hand, and the private channels, on the other, operating in free competition, in a free market economy. Unfortunately, the reality is somewhat different. There is evidence of a huge trend towards monopolisation, particularly in the private sector. We need to take steps to counteract this. This trend is particularly dangerous because it is happening against a background of grave economic difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, we have public broadcasting companies that are failing in their public service duties by allowing party spin-doctors and handlers to decide on the subject matter and content of their editorials. Of course, this cannot be allowed. Let me take the example of ORF in Austria: this broadcaster operates like a branch of the civil service, but not in terms of economic efficiency. There is no liberalism or pluralism in the media and no editorial freedom at present, or at least not as much as there should be. What can the EU do about this? I am convinced that the early warning system for identifying monopolies already presented to the European Parliament some time back is a good solution to this problem.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I would like to make two other comments on the debate. The directive adopted earlier on audiovisual services improves cooperation between the supervisory bodies, and provides a high level of protection for children against inappropriate shows and advertisements. However, Member States are not disciplined in the way they implement it. For example, in my own country, it has only been in force since June. We also have the incomplete harmonisation of copyright law. We need both to make it easier to obtain cross-border licences for audiovisual works from collective authors, and to release the archive of audiovisual works of uncertain copyright in the case of so-called orphan works. I have confirmed that the Commission will submit new legislation next year, but it wants to restrict the legislation only to musical works and not to audiovisual works. I therefore call on the Commission to state whether it will correct this fundamental error, or whether we will have to correct it as Members in committees. This problem is dealt with by item 33 of the report.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would like to begin by supporting the efforts of the rapporteur to launch a debate in the European Parliament on the media environment. I think this is a very useful theme, particularly in the period of digitalisation, a period when revolutionary changes are under way in this environment.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The media environment definitely varies between the individual countries. There are countries where the media environment is dominated by commercial media, with public service media essentially forming just a kind of background. In some places, the commercial media are weaker or broken up and diffuse, so that they do not create a concentrated pressure or a concentrated media environment, and the public service media are then more able to provide more information and to influence public opinion to a greater extent.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In any case, however, we see that political bodies often interfere in the activities of public service media in particular, just as owners interfere in the activities of commercial media, and our information and public awareness are then influenced to a considerable extent.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In order to achieve media freedom, genuine freedom that is independent of money, whether private money or state money, it is necessary to strive hard for journalists to be free, and not subject to some form of monitoring or self-monitoring which would, in effect, oblige them to be loyal to their employers. In my opinion, this is the greatest problem to arise in the media in our time, and we must make changes here in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission welcomes the European Parliament’s report entitled ‘public service broadcasting in the digital era: the future of the dual system’. The report is a well-balanced text as it supports the existing dual system, based on coexistence between public service broadcasters and commercial broadcasters in Europe. As the audiovisual media services directive recalls in one of its recitals, this coexistence is a feature that distinguishes the European audiovisual media market from others and the report fully recognises this.</p>
      <p sl="en">The protocol on the system of public broadcasting in the Member States, annexed to the EU treaties, recognises the Member States’ freedom to define the public service remit to organise public service broadcasting and its funding, as long as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community. Therefore, the Member States determine the form and conditions of funding of their public service media so long as EU State aid rules are respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">We agree with the main thrust of the report, i.e. that public broadcasters should be able to use the opportunities offered by digitisation and the diversification of distribution platforms, in line with the principle of technological neutrality. This was acknowledged in the revised communication from the Commission of 2009 on the application of State aid rules to public service broadcasting. We have some comments on two elements of the report in particular.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, regarding monitoring the Council of Europe standards, there is no EU responsibility for the political independence of public service media. Furthermore, EU Member States cannot give a mandate to the European Audiovisual Observatory without the agreement of the non-EU members. The Commission could not do so either.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, the report suggests that certain Member States have failed to take any action in promoting European works in broadcasting. This is not supported by figures from the Commission’s recent report on the application of the directive’s provisions. According to that report, broadcasters across Europe are doing well overall in terms of the promotion of European programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Public service broadcasters should be at the forefront of innovation, driving the development of new formats and quality, as regards both the programme itself and technically, if they are to keep up with trends and challenges from elsewhere. It seems that we fully agree on these points and I look forward to cooperating with Parliament on these issues within the legal framework provided by the treaties.</p>

      <p sl="ro">At the time of transition from the analogue to digital TV system, coupled with the growing importance of new media, including 3D format, we must bear in mind a number of factors in the policies which we are devising. Firstly, I believe that it is useful for us to take measures to facilitate the transition to the digital system, while also considering the possibility of offering vouchers or other measures to compensate the general public. Another important measure would be to organise traineeships for journalists and public broadcasting managers, given the sums steadily allocated to this area by the private media. Furthermore, I think that it is worthwhile us considering in the future the opportunity to set up a European public radio service. At the same time, I believe that it would be useful for public TV broadcasters in Member States to contribute programmes of European interest to the Euronews channels. Given not only how widespread 3D productions have become, but also the warnings issued by doctors about the impact on viewers’ health, I call on the European Commission to devise urgently a study which will take into account the possible risks which 3D TV can pose to Europeans’ health under current technical conditions.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I should like, first of all, to congratulate Ivo Belet on his excellent report on this highly important subject. I would also like to thank him for accepting my ideas and proposals on it. I believe that we have come up with a well-balanced report which aims to guarantee fair competition between public and private media.</p>
      <p sl="bg">On the strength of a long tradition, national budgets, i.e. the taxpayer, support public TV broadcasters based on the assumption that public TV stations are there only to protect the public interest, while private broadcasters are there to protect private, commercial interests. However, the practice in Bulgaria and in the whole of Europe has long since shown that this is not entirely true for public or for private media.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Drawing on many years of experience in the media sector, I proposed some amendments to this report, which aims to put public and private media on an equal footing in order to enable them to provide better quality information of importance to the public. European citizens have the right to receive the best information both on European and on national issues. This requires the efforts both of public and of private media, while regulatory authorities have to make sure that they operate on an even playing field. I thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Christian Ehler, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on civilian-military cooperation and the development of civilian-military capabilities (2010/2071(INI)) (A7-0308/2010).</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at an international level, the Member States of the European Union have undertaken to make a significant contribution to civil and military crisis management capabilities throughout the world. However, in many cases, we simply pay lip-service to this undertaking, which is formulated several times in the Helsinki Headline Goal as well as elsewhere. Let me put it in black and white: 25% of the positions approved by the Member States for the European Union’s currently active civil missions, such as EULEX or EUPOL, are unfilled. The objectives and structures for the civil and military capabilities of the European Union repeatedly formulated by the Member States could hardly be further from reality. That is why the European Parliament has decided to produce an own-initiative report on the development of civil and military structures and coordination in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Specifically: Parliament once again states in this report that the particular civil and military capabilities of the European Union are one of the most important instruments in its foreign policy and common security and defence policy. We have taken an unusual route in facing up to Parliament’s responsibilities in the context of the Lisbon process. We did not start with a report, but instead began by creating the empirical basis for this report. We have formulated very specific proposals based on these figures, which is why we have the support of the broad majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs: on a strategic level, we have made concrete proposals for the establishment of a structure of equal partnership between the military and civilian arms of the new European External Action Service; while, on an operative level, we have resolved to establish a permanent European headquarters, to be staffed with personnel by the Member States, to deal with the issue of creating an attractive system of incentives for national experts to participate in such operations and the build-up of personnel reserves for the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have made specific proposals for the training of civil and military personnel. There are concrete proposals for how start-up missions are to be financed, for example, the establishment of a start-up fund according to Article 41 of the treaty. Proposals are on the table for the instruments of crisis management, in particular, the question of greater future cooperation between police and military forces. One example of this is the European policing troop. However, the question arises as to how these two instruments can be linked together in specific operational cases and how we can manage the issue of separating purely military and civil operations.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have made proposals for the future of the battle groups. We are calling for a new approach to this issue. We want to see the battle groups being financed in accordance with the Athena mechanism. We are calling for the further development of the capabilities of the battle groups in line with the Oslo directives, the strengthening of the ability of the battle groups to secure civil missions, and a widening of the definition of the missions of the battle groups. We are considering the issue of research and technology, the question of dual use, and the inclusion of civil and military missions in the security research programme as part of the European Union’s research programme. We are dealing with concrete questions in relation to equipment and stockpiling, as well as international cooperation with the United Nations and NATO. Our main concern here is the avoidance of duplication, the improved use of existing structures, the question of the consolidation of shared air transport capacities and the question of the implementation of the Berlin Plus Agreements for improved cooperation between the two organisations in the event of a crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">In other words, Parliament has lived up to its new tasks and obligations. The report was supported by a broad majority from all groups in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and we see it as an important contribution to the future establishment of civil and military structures in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the first and most important point we must clarify is whether we consider it important for civilian and military forces to work together appropriately. For me personally and for my party, Jobbik – The Movement for a Better Hungary – the answer is clearly yes: we consider cooperation between civilians and military authorities to be important. Now, a very good example of this in Hungary was the Magyar Gárda (Hungarian Guard), which was founded in 2007 and was able to work well – if you will – with the military authorities, be that in floodwater defences, in helping the victims of the red sludge flood, in giving blood or distributing bread, in other words, in social matters. You may rightly ask what reward they have received – state honours or recognition perhaps? They have received nothing, and instead of thanking these people for their self-sacrifice, the Hungarian Government made the baffling decision to disband the Hungarian Guard. For this reason, in order that we may start cooperation between civilian and military forces, we need to honour individuals who participate in organisations like the Hungarian Guard. People who wish to take part in such organisations out of a love for their country and nation, protecting their environment, must be allowed to work and must be valued members of society.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the combination of civil and military powers is nothing new. Take, for example, the Command Centre, which has been in place in Council for some time now. Military and civil information has already been collated here. The Situation Centre is now to move to the External Action Service. I think it important to emphasise above all that the European Union has gained a high profile on the international front for its civil mechanisms, something that has brought the European Union a great deal of positive recognition. However, I believe we need a clear separation of civil and military powers.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point I would like to pick up on something that Mr Szegedi mentioned a moment ago. I would like to express my grave misgivings about the march organised by the Hungarian Jobbik party in Austria’s Burgenland province recently, at which rifles and fixed bayonets were in evidence. I do not believe that this is in any way acceptable. I would like to express my clear opposition to such actions. There can be little doubt that they run contrary to the European spirit.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I would like a very, very short answer. What my fellow Member says is simply a lie. Neither Jobbik – The Movement for a Better Hungary – nor the Hungarian Guard has ever committed any crime – anyone can easily check this out – and has never defied any law, and therefore this is simply part of neoliberal political propaganda which tries to show them in a bad light, for neither the Hungarian Guard nor members of Jobbik have ever come into any conflict with the law, and we intend to continue to act in accordance with the law.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will focus on the report, since it is an extremely useful and important report. I would like to thank Mr Ehrenhauser for his contribution.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report is useful because it rightly focuses on the key element of civil-military cooperation, which is exactly the Commission’s priority. It deals with the main points related to the EU’s comprehensive approach in crisis management. The establishment of the European External Action Service is the exact expression of this priority. The very concept of the service that the High Representative is putting in place points in the same direction as the one suggested in the report, in particular, through the inclusion of the structures of the Common Security and Defence Policy in the External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="en">We fully support the development of civilian capabilities in order to have a proper balance between resources. The appropriate modalities for recruitment are now agreed, and appropriate expertise can be brought into the External Action Service. As everyone knows, this was not possible before.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of points in the report have been taken into account, and specific actions have been launched. This relates, in particular, to fostering civil-military synergies, better usability of the EU battle groups, training, financing, and cooperation with key partners, in particular, NATO and the United Nations. We also support the reinforcement of relations between the EU and the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have already done a lot together. The High Representative again met with the UN Secretary General in Lisbon last Saturday. The relationship between the EU and NATO is an important issue, as was illustrated just yesterday at the NATO summit in Lisbon. We also favour implementing all practical measures which can reinforce concrete cooperation between the EU and NATO and ensure, in particular, cooperation when both are deployed in the same theatre.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission and the High Representative herself are looking forward to working together with the European Parliament on this important issue of civil-military cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Civil-military cooperation and the development of civil-military potential is one of the most important components of the common security and defence policy. Unfortunately, many aspects relating thereto remain at the planning stage. In discussions on the subject, Member States agree that significant resources should be provided for this. In reality, the plans have not been implemented and we still do not have fully formed structures. In view of the growing threat posed by natural disasters, terrorist acts and conflicts beyond the borders of the EU, I hope that this report will contribute to the exploitation of civil-military potential and civil-military cooperation. The report contains practical recommendations in this field, inter alia, with reference to the creation of civil-military structures within the European External Action Service, the use of battlegroups and the European Gendarmerie Force, optimisation of crisis management and the use of funds from the next framework programme. The aim of all this is to make better use of funds so that civil-military cooperation may fully materialise. A further significant aim is to avoid duplication of efforts during missions where NATO is participating in tandem with European forces. I hope that the report will be a significant incentive to start working towards the formation of effective civil-military structures. Baroness Ashton should ensure that the suggestions contained in the report are implemented as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union must respond rapidly in crisis situations, thereby necessitating more efficient coordination of its civilian and military structures. Setting up a permanent EU operational headquarters, placed alongside the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability, would maximise the benefits of civil-military coordination. With regard to the request in the report for Member States to make available civilian capabilities in order to achieve real progress as quickly as possible, I want to stress that, on the civilian front, Romania actively contributes to fulfilling the Civilian Headline Goal 2010. As a result of its considerable involvement in EU civilian missions, Romania has achieved third place in the European rankings in terms of participating in such missions and contributing sound and varied expertise through its police officers, military police officers, soldiers, diplomats, judges and human rights experts. Romania is also at an advanced stage in the process of adopting a national civilian capabilities strategy.</p>
