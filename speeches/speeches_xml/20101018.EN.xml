      <p sl="unknown">To begin with, I would like to inform you briefly of four matters. It was with great satisfaction that I learned that Mr Liu Xiaobo had received the Nobel Peace Prize. This champion of human rights is still in jail as a result of his peaceful activity for freedom of speech in China. We appreciate the Chinese authorities’ latest efforts on the path to attaining the political, economic and social standards of the free world. However, these are still not enough, and so we are redoubling our calls for the release of Liu Xiaobo, Hu Jia, winner of the Sakharov Prize, and other defenders of human rights from prison. The European Parliament will stand as a permanent guard upholding human rights.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Secondly, this week, the European Parliament is organising a series of events linked with yesterday’s International Day for the Eradication of Poverty Many of us are wearing badges relating to this. In addition to plenary debates devoted to this subject, I would like to invite you to take part in a ceremony at Bronisław Geremek Agora tomorrow at 14:45, in which UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon will be taking part.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Thirdly, today, for the fourth time, we are observing the EU Day Against Human Trafficking. We treat this problem very seriously. We are currently negotiating a proposal for a directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Fourthly, and finally, I would like to invite you, on Wednesday at 12:00, to hear a mid-term review of my Presidency of the Parliament. It will chiefly summarise the progress of the European Parliament and especially what you have achieved during this time, and also initiatives which I have personally undertaken, where we are, and where we find ourselves in a changed European Union, what the European Parliament looks like and cooperation with other institutions. I believe that you are entitled to this information halfway through my term of office.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">A7-0032/2010 by Mrs Estrela, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding (COM(2008)0637 - C6-0340/2008 - 2008/0193(COD)), and A7-0264/2010 by Mrs Thomsen, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on precarious women workers (2010/2018(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-024" speaker_id="28310" name="Edite Estrela" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pt">I would firstly like to thank the shadow rapporteur and the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for the collaboration and the work which we have accomplished together. A word of thanks is also due to many non-governmental organisations and unions, to the experts who participated in the presentation workshop for the financial impact study, to the secretariats of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and of my political group, to the Policy Department of the European Parliament, and to my assistants. All of them were tireless, and showed great professionalism and ability.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This directive is already eighteen years old, and it is outdated. The process of revising it has been long and problematic. It is now time for Parliament to decide, without further delay, to meet the expectations and needs of European families.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The proposals adopted by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality ensure the twin objectives arising from extending the legal basis: defending health and safety in the workplace for workers who are pregnant, who have recently given birth, or who are breastfeeding, and promoting gender equality and the reconciliation of professional and family life. At the same time, this will help to stem the demographic decline of recent decades.</p>
      <p sl="pt">One hundred years ago, the European population made up 15% of the world population. In 2050 it is not expected to make up more than 5%. Ageing and the consequent reduction of the active population undermine the sustainability of social security systems and economic growth itself. For this reason, motherhood cannot be viewed as an illness or a burden on the economy, but rather as a service to society.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The duration of maternity leave in the 27 Member States varies between 14 and 52 weeks, and payment for leave is also very varied, with 100% of earnings being paid in 13 countries. I realise that the current economic climate is not favourable to increasing social spending, but this is a good investment in our collective future, and it does not have the high costs that many are claiming it does. The financial impact study concludes that the costs of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality’s proposal will be completely covered if it contributes to an increase of only 1% in the participation of women in the labour market. These are balanced and workable proposals, in line with the recommendations of the International Labour Organisation and the World Health Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Twenty weeks is a sufficient amount of time to help women to recover from childbirth, encourage breastfeeding and enable firm bonds to be formed between mother and child. A longer period of time could affect the reintegration of women into the labour market. A payment of 100% of earnings is fair because families should not be financially penalised for having the children that they want and, moreover, the children that Europe needs to tackle the demographic challenge.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The right to paternity leave is already recognised in 19 Member States, with payment of 80% or 100% of average earnings. The involvement of fathers in their children’s lives contributes to their healthy physical and psychological development. It is a right for fathers and children.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Throughout the whole process, I have expressed my complete openness to a broader consensus, and I hope that those who care about the well-being of women, families and children will support this report. In view of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives, there will be no justification for maternity leave not being a period of 20 weeks, paid in full, from 2020. I therefore urge you to support Amendments 126, 127 and 128. For the same reason, I cannot support amendments which scandalously aim to reduce the rights of families.</p>

    <intervention id="1-025" speaker_id="28153" name="Britta Thomsen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="da">Mr President, we are having this debate today on women’s working conditions because women and men experience different conditions on the labour market. Women are trailing a long way behind men when it comes to wages, pensions, top jobs and executive positions. More than ever, therefore, we need the EU to take initiatives that improve the position of women on the labour market so that we can bring Europe into line with the treaty. We must ensure that women – whether they are from Portugal or Poland, Belgium or Bulgaria – are guaranteed equality on the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="da">A major and important step towards complete equality is a new and modern piece of EU legislation on maternity leave. There are many good reasons for us to have new legislation on maternity leave in Europe. First and foremost, there is a risk that, before long, the EU will face a demographic crisis – a crisis that could be at least as serious as the economic crisis in which we still find ourselves. Women in the EU are quite simply not having enough children. If we are to retain our competitiveness in the future and create growth, which is necessary in order to maintain our level of prosperity, more children need to be born in the EU. We therefore need a maternity leave law that motivates families to have children.</p>
      <p sl="da">A common high standard for maternity leave is essential in order to create an effective internal market. An internal market should not only be about cheap goods – it is just as important to ensure high social standards for workers. We must not have disparate competitive conditions, where it could be advantageous to lower the conditions for women, who will then become victims of social dumping.</p>
      <p sl="da">Fathers must also have the right to two weeks’ paternity leave on full pay. If we are to create equality between men and women, we need to understand that men also play an important role in connection with paternity leave. This will have a beneficial effect on equality, the children and, not least, the fathers themselves.</p>
      <p sl="da">We hear from the lobbyists for professional associations that this is a crazy thing to do and that we cannot afford better maternity leave legislation. I would venture to claim that quite the opposite is true. We cannot afford not to ensure that we have new, modern maternity leave legislation. It is a question of the health and safety of the EU’s women and children. Thus, this is not something that we should gamble with.</p>
      <p sl="da">We must increase the participation of women on the labour market throughout the EU. The objective of the EU 2020 strategy is to get 75% of all women on to the labour market. As we know that currently, only 60% of women work, this will be a major challenge. We must succeed, however, and there is no doubt that good facilities for childcare are the way forward. A second and equally important initiative, however, is full pay during maternity leave. Only by preventing discrimination against women can we get more women on to the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="da">Another important step towards more equality on the labour market is the report on precarious women workers, for which I was rapporteur. Unfortunately, the situation is such that women are significantly over-represented when it comes to these jobs. Women employed in private homes, in particular, have very precarious working conditions, characterised, among other things, by little or no job security, no social security, a high risk of discrimination and a poor working environment. We must not allow women to work under such poor conditions. The EU should therefore support the Member States to enable the precarious jobs to be replaced by proper jobs with decent working conditions. For a long time, we have neglected to focus on these vulnerable women, and it is my hope that the Commission will take this report seriously and help to take care of some of the EU’s most vulnerable citizens.</p>

    <intervention id="1-026" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maroš Šefčovič" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very glad that I can replace Vice-President Reding tonight in this very important debate because we are going to discuss two very topical reports which are at the heart of fundamental rights and gender equality. On behalf of the Commission, I would like to warmly thank the two rapporteurs, Ms Thomsen and Ms Estrela, who both have done tremendous work.</p>
      <p sl="en">These two reports concern the often challenging situation of women in the EU labour market. The contribution of women is crucial to meeting our ambitious targets of an overall employment rate of 75% by 2020, but this cannot be done without ensuring the fundamental rights of women workers. This is what we are going to discuss tonight.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start with precarious women workers. We have made a lot of progress in integrating women into the labour market during the last few years. As we know, women are more likely to be in precarious jobs than men. Certain forms of precarious work performed by women, such as paid domestic work and care, are simply not visible on the labour market. If women do not have decent jobs, they cannot enjoy economic independence – which is a prerequisite for having control over their lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to tackle the reasons why women are more likely to have precarious jobs: the stereotypes, the unequal sharing of family and household tasks, and the undervaluation of female-dominated jobs. We also need to ensure that the growing female migrant workforce, which is often exploited in the grey economy, is integrated into the labour market. Our new equality strategy covers all these issues and we need to mobilise all the instruments available to make progress in implementing it.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you allow me, I shall add some remarks on the pregnant workers directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is quite clear that stronger maternity leave standards at EU level are crucial to ensuring the health and safety of the mother and child, as are increasing participation of women in the labour market, changing family models and dealing with demographic pressure.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main points of the Commission proposals include extension of maternity leave by four weeks to reach the International Labour Organisation recommendations; encouragement to grant a higher allowance; more flexibility for women to work until shortly before giving birth; and the right to ask for flexible working hours.</p>
      <p sl="en">With this, the Commission aims to protect women’s employment rights, give women sufficient time to recover from birth and bond with her child, and allow women to be financially secure during the maternity leave.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would therefore like to compliment Ms Estrela on her work on this comprehensive report which, in many ways, improves the Commission’s original proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the Commission fully agrees with the emphasis on the role of fathers. The reinforcement of parental leave through the new directive adopted earlier this year is an important step forward. However, introducing paternity leave under the maternity directive is neither in line with the overall objective we are pursuing, nor with the legal basis on which the proposal is made. The proposal is based on Article 153 on health and safety at work for pregnant women, and on Article 157 which allows the EU to intervene in the field of equal pay for men and women.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having said that, I would like to underline that the Commission will consider this issue further. It is currently undertaking an in-depth cost/benefit study on the subject in view of a possible separate initiative in this area. Similarly, the Commission cannot accept weakening a woman’s right to refuse night work.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the lengths of the leave and the payment to be received by women during this period, I would like to say the following. Vice-President Reding has met many Ministers over the last few months and they have explained that the national leave systems work well and that it is not possible, given the current financial constraints, to increase the length or payment, but the Commission made it very clear that it is not prepared to reduce the level of ambition of this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">This being so, I would like to stress that the Commission aims to set the minimum level of protection which takes into account the different models of reconciliation and family-related leave in the Member States. The Commission believes that its proposal would constitute a good basis for an agreement between Parliament and the Council. The Commission would also like to thank Parliament for introducing a number of amendments which either strengthen or clarify the proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">To sum up, the proposal should aim to strengthen the protection of the health and safety of women, increase their employment prospects and help tackle demographic ageing. I very much look forward to your contributions and suggestions for both these very important items.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I wish to tell you that our intention has been to contribute, through the improvements set out in this report, to those policies which will help achieve the objective of increasing the employment rate and improving health and safety conditions at work.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, when we talk about the EU 2020 strategy objectives, we must think about people and put people first, which means women in this context. The new approach which we are adopting is that motherhood must stop being penalised, especially with the birth rate falling, not to mention the population getting older and poorer, thereby creating an urgent problem in terms of the sustainability of social security schemes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">All the measures we are proposing will protect women at work, both when pregnant and after giving birth. The measures proposed by the report are also an investment in Europe’s future. We want guaranteed, fully paid maternity leave. Let us think about the need to stop penalising motherhood in the European Union in the 21st century and to ensure that women enjoy all the conditions worthy of a decent job.</p>

    <intervention id="1-029" speaker_id="96851" name="Thomas Händel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have undoubtedly made progress in recent years on the issue of equality between men and women, yet there are still many women who are forced into low-skilled jobs. That applies not just to activities that are traditionally carried out within the family. The deregulation that has taken place in recent years has frequently resulted in employment that provides mandatory social insurance being replaced by employment conditions that are atypical, precarious and uncertain. Women, in particular, have been affected by this. The trend in employment in Europe between 2000 and 2010 is for 60% to be made up of new, precarious and atypical types of employment, primarily – two thirds – taken up by women. Women are frequently debarred from democratic participation in organisations by virtue of being employed on a part-time basis and on precarious conditions. Yet women are now much more committed and better trained than in any previous generation. Nonetheless, on average, they earn 25% less than men.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has looked into this matter intensively and has developed good proposals on the issue of female employment: inclusion in social security systems regardless of job status; the establishment of childcare facilities; aligning retirement pensions and social systems with independent living; and organising work according to ‘good work’ principles. All this is essentially contained in the report on precarious women workers. The Employment Committee is satisfied with the results of this work and urges the House to vote in favour of the report presented.</p>

    <intervention id="1-030" speaker_id="23894" name="Anna Záborská" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="sk">This report is already the second attempt to formulate the position of the Parliament regarding minimum standards of protection for mothers in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The opinions of nearly all of the 27 delegations in the seven groups differ. This equally applies to my own Christian Democrat group. Until today, many MEPs have recognised the consequences of our voting for their national economies since the aforementioned study took into consideration only 10 of the Member States. I have been in politics for 20 years and only rarely have I experienced a situation this complex. Human life begins in the body of the mother and that is why we must protect her health before as well as after the birth. Protection of the mother as a social expense factor must not become an obstacle for her employment. The mother must not be in conflict with the woman worker. If we suggest to young, educated women that they ought to have children, and simultaneously refuse to recognise their motherhood and fail to give them the opportunity to care for their children, we shall never succeed in reversing demographic development.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Protection of the mother should be considered in relation to care for the father, the natural framework of the family, and the necessity of motherly love for the newborn. Babies are more than future tax payers. I personally agree with the maximum requirements proposed by the report. At the same time, I advocate provisions supporting the reintegration of mothers should they decide to return to the labour market. However, it is unfortunate to speak of protection of mothers in conjunction with equal opportunities. I would personally prefer that the Commission put forward a proposal that would take into consideration a comprehensive view of pregnancy, birth and the subsequent healthcare. This directive may be in force for two decades; today, we are merely at the beginnings of a long and difficult decision-making process. I am asking whether we intend to assess future social and economic development solely according to our current financial situation. All of this is at stake today.</p>

    <intervention id="1-031" speaker_id="29579" name="Marc Tarabella" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although the Commissioner has spoken on behalf of Mrs Reding and the Commission to express the Commission’s reservations about integrating paternity leave into the text, I should like to take the floor today, above all, on behalf of all the fathers in Europe who do not yet have the right to paternity leave.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nature did not grant us the right to give birth, but can society deprive us of the right to share the first moments of our children’s lives? Let us not forget that fathers are parents too. Society must allow us to make the most of our sons and daughters so that we can forge a special bond with them from birth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I call on all my fellow Members to vote overwhelmingly in favour of the introduction of two weeks’ fully paid paternity leave throughout the European Union. While I am on this subject, I also call on the European Commission and the Council to support us, and I repeat: how can you go against our request for the establishment of a new right for fathers at European level?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also call on all my fellow Members to support the Estrela report in its entirety. As for those who cite the economic crisis as an argument for denying women a more acceptable length of maternity leave and, even more so, adequate pay, and men paternity leave, I ask them straight: why do you always go back on the social acquis when there is an economic crisis?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Do you not realise that all the economic costs will be offset by greater female participation in the labour market, less discrimination, gender equality, a better work-life balance and, therefore, in the long term, real economic benefits?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, to those who wish to sacrifice fathers and mothers on the altar of the economic crisis, I repeat: we cannot cut corners where fundamental rights are concerned. This fight is also for a more humane society, and in these times of crisis, the family is increasingly our last bastion against the upheavals of life.</p>

    <intervention id="1-032" speaker_id="26829" name="Siiri Oviir" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="et">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for years, the European Parliament has consistently called for the protection of pregnant employees and the updating of existing legislation relating to maternity leave. The directive dealing with this issue has been in existence for 18 years. Europe’s demographic future is not encouraging, and, having discussed this situation, we adopted a resolution in this Chamber in 2008 which called for the adoption of measures relating to the length and protection of maternity leave, having ensured that, with an appropriate policy, it is possible to influence the fertility curve, creating a financially and psychologically beneficial environment for the family.</p>
      <p sl="et">The European Union treaty currently in effect gives us in this Parliament a legal basis to adopt the directive under discussion. We have talked a lot about equal opportunities for men and women, equal rights in the labour market, and it is clear that longer maternity leave, and paternity leave too, will create a better basis for that. It is a fact that pregnancy and childbirth are a burden for a woman’s body. The directive aims to protect women’s health. It is therefore important to have a period of leave which would allow for the restoration of health, but which would also allow the mother to breastfeed her children for their health and development.</p>
      <p sl="et">I would like to say a few words about paternity leave. Who else but the child’s father should be supporting the child at this time? I support the introduction of paternity leave, compensating such leave by analogy with maternity leave. Our citizens often complain to us that European Union legislation is complicated – do you not understand this? Let us not make the situation more complicated, but let us add leave covering the same period of time as maternity leave to the directive regulating it. As for the cost: we are in an economic crisis, or rather, we are exiting it, but this is not a justification for fervently not wanting to pay for maternity leave the amount that would be appropriate in the 21st century. The analysis has shown that we only need to raise women’s employment by 1% and the costs would be balanced.</p>

    <intervention id="1-033" speaker_id="28409" name="Raül Romeva i Rueda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, this is not a good time for motherhood, but even less so for fatherhood.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is because some political forces and some business groups are still stuck in an old-fashioned perception that having children is exclusively women’s work.</p>
      <p sl="es">Well, ladies and gentlemen, that is not the case. Not in any way. It is a social responsibility that should be borne collectively by the whole of society. That is what we are talking about today. That is what we are discussing: who has to bear the responsibility and the cost of having children, who must also be our future?</p>
      <p sl="es">Obviously, only women can get pregnant and give birth. No one is disputing that. What we are discussing here is women being the only ones who have to bear that cost in their professional lives and shoulder that responsibility in their personal lives.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the end of the last parliamentary term, we had the opportunity to make a giant leap forward on this issue at European level, and we were unable to do so because a large proportion of this House – the most conservative section of this House: groups from the Group of the European Peoples Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, some delegations, not all, but some delegations – prevented it. This prevented mothers today from having more rights. We should not forget that.</p>
      <p sl="es">What we have on the table today is a fresh opportunity to correct part of that problem. The Estrela report, which has already been adopted by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, is a good point for compromise and consensus, which I believe we should support on Wednesday when we vote.</p>
      <p sl="es">It gives more rights to working pregnant women in Europe, it ensures that their salaries are maintained, and it also obliges fathers to take their share of the responsibility, as well as ensuring that pregnant women will not lose rights if they move between European Union countries. All of this is important, and we should not, under any circumstances, lose sight of it.</p>
      <p sl="es">If, during the votes on Wednesday, we lose some of these fundamental points, I think it is important that we are clear and that European parents are clear that it has not happened by chance, and that the argument of the economic crisis cannot be used in such an important context.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is obviously a crisis, and we need to take responsibility for it. Mothers, however, do not have to take any responsibility for it. This is understandable if we realise that we are not talking about a cost, but an investment. It is an investment in the future and in much healthier societies.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is the debate that we will have during the vote on Wednesday. I am in favour of supporting the report by Mrs Estrela, and I am in favour of the majority of this House doing exactly the same, because if not, we will be risking not only the health of working mothers, but also the welfare state that we have worked for so long to achieve in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, a well-known businessman once said equality legislation, taken too far, actually reduces the chances of women gaining employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Businesses are not allowed to ask a woman if she is going to have a baby, so it is easy – they just do not employ her. And that, unfortunately, is the grim reality of compulsory full pay maternity leave in this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Couple this with the economic effect on SMEs – in the UK, £2.6 billion; Germany, EUR 1.7 billion – and this report is positively dangerous in today’s economic climate.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, if the maternity clause were removed, what a difference that would make. The report would focus on its original mandate, that of the health and safety of pregnant workers and those who have recently given birth.</p>
      <p sl="en">I ask my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality to get back to basics and do what is right for women. Women need to have choices. They need to have the tools to make these choices. Employers need to be able to support women without it meaning they are no longer economically viable. Member States need to strengthen their economies too, thereby creating opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ECR has put forward an amendment which deals with many of the issues created by the full pay compulsory leave clause and I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment and make this report workable.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is not here to create social engineering with its policies. The idea that paid maternity leave will encourage women to have children is naive. Children are for life. The cost is for life. So please do not tell me that we will increase the population by giving 20 weeks fully paid maternity leave.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are a lot of weaknesses in this report. The impact assessment the ECR requested has proved this. The question now is whether we strengthen it at this stage or send it back to the drawing board.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The debate on the Maternity Leave Directive and the own-initiative report on precarious women workers touches on the most important reason for all work to promote equality. The opportunity and prerequisites for women to be able to support themselves form the platform for equality in all political areas. This coming Wednesday, we will have the opportunity to open the way for women to participate fully on the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I regret the fact that, in 2010, we are still talking about maternity leave rather than parental leave. For me, it is self-evident that children have the right to both of their parents and I believe that we should also take a look at the Convention on the Rights of the Child in this case. We are discussing the rights of mothers and of fathers, but we also need to discuss the right – the unconditional right – of a child to build a close relationship with both parents.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We have talked very loudly about the costs of this leave and in quite a different tone to the one we used to discuss millions of euro in support for banks and the motor industry, among other things. Sometimes I ask myself whether it is easier to accept costs in traditional masculine areas than it is in connection with equality issues and the right of a child to have both parents.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I also think that the costs have been discussed without taking account of the benefits both to the individual and in socio-economic terms that this proposal entails. Many have talked about the demographic future, that too few children are being born. However, we now have the opportunity to try to ensure that it is possible to have more children.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left and I support Mrs Estrela’s and Mrs Thomsen’s proposals, which we voted on in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, where we improved the possibilities.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, I see a number of problems for certain Member States that currently have considerably better parental leave. I would like this to be legislation that confers rights, rather than imposing an obligation on one parent. I would also like the Convention on the Rights of the Child and a child’s right to both parents to be much more evident.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There are also problems with the levels of remuneration in certain Member States. Someone mentioned here in this debate that today employers ask women of child-bearing age whether they intend to have children. I therefore hope that in the future, in the very near future, we will ask the same question of fathers, as children – one again – are the concern of both parents. That is something that we need to take seriously.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the road towards a female-friendly Europe is still long and arduous. The statistics are quite clear: the global crisis has struck the labour market, putting female employment, which shrunk by a further 0.7 percentage points in 2008, to a difficult test. Notwithstanding the provocations which, with regard to equal opportunities and employment, periodically fuel euro-propaganda, for which support is waning, to date, concrete measures have still not been adopted to guarantee women real fulfilment as both workers and mothers.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Europe of the future needs to radically rethink its own welfare model and not simply change its label from time to time. The directive which aligns the institution of maternity leave in Europe is therefore positive, but the decision to address on the sidelines, in the same report, the complementary and equally important issue of paternity leave, is unproductive.</p>
      <p sl="it">The greater integration of women is not only a moral value, but also a strategic objective for the sustainability of the much publicised European social model, which continues to leave me unconvinced, given the lack of results.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The proposal on maternity leave is inherently a health and safety provision, and the primary reason why the 1992 directive needs to be amended in terms of improving mothers’ living conditions is that the International Labour Organisation adopted an international convention in 2000, setting the minimum length of maternity leave at 18 weeks. In the meantime, however, we can witness such a diversified development – in terms of the length of maternity leave, financing and the level of allowances – of various healthcare systems due to the combination of maternal and parental leave that it is now practically impossible to find a common denominator. Despite the good intentions we all have, whether we sit on the right or left side in this House, we are unable to make a decision which is received positively and welcomed by each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The good solution would have been to stay on the grounds of health and safety in this proposal, and strengthen equal opportunities in a different provision. When I tabled the report on gender pay gap in this House, I pointed out the disadvantageous situation of mothers returning to the labour market after the birth of their first child. Therefore, equal opportunities are also problematic, and we must resolve this issue. However, as long as fathers and mothers are unable to perform the same task in terms of giving birth, that is, fathers cannot give birth to a child, we probably have to resolve equal opportunities in other areas. The issue of equal opportunities must be resolved, and we have to make progress in this respect, as well, but not in this directive. We have missed the opportunity to modernise the combination of parental and maternity leave.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that Parliament has a great opportunity today to reiterate that motherhood is a social value, that the protection of a mother’s health and that of her child must be strengthened, that a female worker must not be discriminated against for being a mother in finding and keeping a job, and that childcare should be better shared with fathers.</p>
      <p sl="it">Notwithstanding the current crisis – as has already been highlighted – we must make the same observation which has already been made by the most advanced economists: the impact assessment which has been carried out shows the need for a more far-sighted and holistic approach. Today’s costs, which can potentially be staggered, are a social and economic investment in the greater well-being of children, fewer diseases and the greater participation of women in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="it">Many claim that there will not be an increased and appropriately trained and qualified female workforce without a new welfare system and new opportunities to achieve a work-life balance: I fully agree with and thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Estrela and Mrs Plumb, for the complex work they have carried out, as I do all Members who have strived to find common ground.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also agree with the facility which, I believe, many of us wanted, and which will provide mothers of disabled children, and in the case of adoptions and multiple births, with greater opportunities to have flexible working hours, the reversal of the burden of proof against breaches of the law and greater protection from dismissal. Furthermore, I proposed, together with other Members, that with respect to the compulsory six weeks’ leave following childbirth, a safeguard clause be provided for those countries where legislation provides this compulsory period prior to childbirth too.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, I hope that now, over these two days, we will be willing to find common ground so that we do not miss the important opportunity to adopt this directive in this parliamentary term as well.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, when speaking about sharing family responsibilities equally between men and women – and ultimately moving towards the goal of a more equal society in the context of promoting the best interests of the child in reconciliation policies – we have to remember that we are representing the people here in this House rather than the Council view. Recently, I have noticed that there have been too many people from Permanent Representations going round and lobbying MEPs, which I do not feel is acceptable under our rules and the principle of independently elected MEPs.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is argued that increasing maternity leave imposes higher costs on the private and public sector at a time of economic crisis, but this is only 0.01% of GDP and we are talking about EUR 2 billion. At the same time, I have compared the military budget of the countries mentioned. That budget has actually increased by EUR 3 billion in one year and this has not been questioned either in this House or in their parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, in a time of growing economic uncertainty and while we are facing demographic changes, it is vital to support flexible leave policies, which may help to reverse current demographic trends. We should make our joint commitment to ensuring that women across Europe become part of the labour market and that their life choice is taken seriously through higher female labour market participation, with greater value being accorded to childhood and the importance of balancing family and working life.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is very clear from the amendments submitted by some colleagues in ALDE, PPE and ECR — though luckily not all of them – that they have sold their souls to short-sighted corporate interests and to lobbyists from Member States who do not care about women’s rights. If those amendments are adopted, life for new mothers and fathers in the EU will not improve.</p>
      <p sl="en">If leave is not properly paid, only those women whose jobs do not matter can take it up. You, my dear colleagues on the right, are perpetuating a traditional system with a male breadwinner and his little wife, with her little job on the side, kept neatly under his thumb. For her, it does not really matter how much the compensation is. But any independent woman who actually financially provides for her family had better get back to work after the six compulsory weeks – if the rest is poorly paid – whether or not she is still bleeding; and she can forget about offering her child a good start by breastfeeding.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope with all my heart that those who really want to make life better for new mothers and fathers will win this vote. This directive could be a cornerstone of a modern labour market policy for the ageing society. The future needs politicians brave enough to have their own opinions, who can look a bit further ahead, and who have a vision for a society with many more working mothers and many more caring fathers. The future can certainly do without those who buckle at the knees as soon as business CEOs with only the next financial report on their minds, and national ministers with only the next elections on their minds, start lobbying.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The significance of this directive goes beyond the problem of equality for women and help for women during maternity. We must look at this in a wider context, not just in a social but also in an economic context, over a longer period of time. There is a certain paradox in that by trying, understandably and logically, to protect current financial management practices, we could lose a great deal both economically and financially in future generations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Many experts believe that one of the main problems in Europe, which could possibly be the most important problem of all, is the demographic collapse. Progress in medicine, an improvement in living conditions and a drop in natural population growth mean a very old and very costly Europe in the future. Even today, the cost of caring for the elderly is estimated at almost 2% of Europe’s GDP. The reasons for the drop in population growth are very complex and transcend social issues and material security. However, there is no doubt that the new proposals contained in the directive will create a significant impetus which will help many women in Europe to decide to have children.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the level of support for pregnant women workers is very varied in European countries. The significance of this directive will be felt particularly in those countries where the scope of protection is very weak, and where support for families is very low or even non-existent, including when it comes to looking after older children. This is why I would like to thank everyone who worked on this directive, especially for their sympathy for women in other countries who will be able to face the future with greater hope. As far as the children are concerned, of course they want a happy mother who is not afraid that she will lose her job and who is not afraid that she will not be able to feed them or bring them up. Once again, thank you, and I am counting on a compromise in Wednesday’s vote. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, these reports are along the right lines and deserve much more publicity. Eighty-five per cent of involuntary part-time work and 80% of low paid jobs are carried out by women. Women’s pay is 27% lower than men’s. Fifty per cent of women have a pension of less than EUR 600. The majority of the cases of false declarations or undeclared work that are uncovered concern women. Even now, in the 21st century, we are still discovering cases of slavery in Europe, and every one involves a woman.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to a sector in which conditions for the female workforce continue to be precarious. I refer to the agricultural sector, a sector in which women focus on innovation and, at the same time, on revitalising traditions and preserving agricultural heritage, keeping rural territory alive. Yet female workers encounter a range of obstacles in their working activities, having to reconcile their working life with family life.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mrs Thomsen, in her report, provides a figure which gives us food for thought: in the agricultural sector, 86% of female workers are employed part-time. Furthermore, the entry of young women into this sector is fraught with difficulty and for this reason, women managing the farms are often over 65. On the other hand, some other women assume the position of supporting partner, or rather, they help with their husband’s farm, without being entitled to a legal status and without being appropriately remunerated.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would argue, therefore, that it is necessary to protect women and their employment in a sector in which their work is often temporary and seasonal, support them in the area of health and safety, and ensure they receive fair pay and appropriate recognition for their work.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak of reconciliation, we mean those initiatives which, taking into consideration the needs of the family and the needs of workers, allow a balance to be struck between professional and family life. We are talking, therefore, about support mechanisms, without which a woman who works for pleasure, career ambition or, above all, out of necessity, faces a dilemma and the most drastic, and almost always final decision, is to leave her job. Once she has left the labour market, returning to it is yet more difficult. Such a situation brings a strong sense of frustration, on the one hand, and great economic sacrifices, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="it">The text which is being debated today proposes numerous support mechanisms for female workers, providing the basis for legal certainty which will give women freedom of choice and, as a consequence, a real work-life balance. I would also like to highlight another aspect with regard to the position of precarious female workers: as has been said, too often, women continue to endure inequality with regard to employment opportunities, quality of work and remuneration. With regard to the quality of work, it should be noted that women, very often, do not report abuses and are compelled to accept employment at the fringes of legality in order to obtain a sufficient income to support their family. It is time to bring an end to this.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is necessary, therefore, to monitor all misconduct by employers with regard to female workers. Any infringement must be prosecuted and punished without qualification. Our commitment must continue to move in the direction of social policies which are increasingly just and effective.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the report we are now discussing is crucial for parents and children in Europe as well as for Europe as a community. The provisions in this piece of legislation contribute to ensuring that all women across Europe have the same minimum rights and assistance when deciding to have children. They also ensure that women who decide to have children are not punished financially for their choice to be mothers by trying to combine it with their careers.</p>
      <p sl="en">A very important factor is Europe’s demographic challenge. Falling birth rates and an ageing population and, as a consequence, a falling labour force, are putting a huge strain on maintaining economic growth, especially in times of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is the solution one of encouraging women not to have children, or following an American model where women have no or little support and have to go back to work before they have even recovered from giving birth? If it is, then I say no. Not having children is more expensive for the community in the long run. Women need to recover from giving birth in order to be ready to enter the labour market again. Allowing them 18 weeks is a minimum and they should not be punished for this by direct or indirect cuts.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 24 EU Member States out of 27, it is the governments who contribute to the maternity leave and not businesses. Would businesses not want to invest in the young women they have recruited and trained? We should have social responsibility. Knowing that the EU and its Member States have spent an enormous amount of money on rescuing banks, we have to ask why money must always be saved at the expense of women. Fathers should also be able to take time off to spend with their newborn babies.</p>
      <p sl="en">We keep on talking about shared responsibilities and now we can do something about it. Some here believe that it is not acceptable. Hopefully, Commissioner Šefčovič will show us that he is going to be very clear and progressive on this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this directive was always intended, quite rightly, to provide minimum standards to protect pregnant workers and women who are breastfeeding. However, I find that some of the amendments from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs go too far.</p>
      <p sl="en">They do not take into account the different traditions in different Member States. Some countries have maternity leave, some have paternity leave as well, and some have parental leave. They are paid in totally different ways and at different rates – some from the social security systems, some from businesses and some are a mixture. We must not ruin some very good systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">My amendments try to address the difficulty of achieving something that will suit all Member States. Bringing in full pay would, in my opinion, stop a lot of young people – or young women in particular – being employed. I am pleased that the second impact assessment was at least more detailed than the first. As you know, it said that it would cost the ten Member States over EUR 7 billion a year if full pay was included. It did not even look at the other 17 Member States, and I assume the cost of bringing in full pay for them would also be problematic.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as compulsory leave is concerned, I have always believed that it is for the mother herself to decide what time to take off and when to take it off.

When it comes to women employees, we can generally talk about protection, particularly during pregnancy and after childbirth, through labour law. It is not possible to protect self-employed women through labour law, as it does not generally apply to them. On the other hand, these women entrepreneurs employ men and other women too, and so I was horrified by the fact that the directive, which was initially supposed to apply only to the protection of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth, would, under the amendments, be intended to apply to entrepreneurs too. It is impossible, not only in practice, but also from a legal perspective. I therefore sincerely hope that this Parliament does not adopt the amendments, which have unfortunately largely passed in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality too, and which, in my view, have nothing to do with this directive, as they cannot apply to self-employed people.</p>

There is a real danger that pregnant workers or women who recently gave birth, who are in a more vulnerable position, will suffer discrimination in the current circumstances. We strongly agree with making explicit a woman’s right to return to the same job, 20 weeks maternity leave and reasonable paternity leave. We should also support maintaining the income level at 100%.</p>

This is the second time that an attempt has been made to establish minimum rules for the European Union, and it has now been 40 years that I have been campaigning in my professional life for equality between men and women, the integration of young women via training programmes, and their integration into society via their integration into the labour market. Equality is what we are talking about here: equality between men and women.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, in this Estrela report – one need only listen to the speeches that have been made today – every possible issue has been covered. Everyone comes along with his or her small contribution, and wants to add one section to another section.

      <p sl="fr">Baby leave is just about the only thing that has not been covered in this report. I would like to say one thing to you: to vote today in favour of 20 weeks’ fully paid maternity leave is irresponsible and demagogic. I insist that effective measures be taken to ensure that this does not backfire on women. The more we extend maternity leave without emphasising women’s return to the workplace and their need to create a work-life balance, and the more we extend maternity leave without taking measures to protect women in the workplace, the more we are working against them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact is, when we create policy, our duty is to be courageous and responsible, and to tell the truth. Who is going to pay? Which of our Member States can pay for this increase? Which company can pay? Ultimately, women are going to find themselves trapped by a text that is being allowed to drift on all points and which will backfire on them. I call on you to be responsible.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Mrs Morin-Chartier is not the only one who has said this. There were a couple of speakers who said that maternity leave of 20 weeks would hurt women’s chances in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to ask where that idea comes from because, if you look at the research, as well as what happens in Sweden, Norway, Iceland or Bulgaria, you can see very clearly that you can have extremely high female participation in the labour market and a properly long period of maternity leave.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The first is that there is no mathematical link between the length of maternity leave and women’s fertility rate, and to prove it I need only mention the situation in France, since France is a country which provides for 14 weeks’ maternity leave and which, today, has one of the highest birth rates in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point of my answer is that, with each birth, the gap between the professional lives of women and of men is found to widen. With each birth, with each period of maternity leave, women first reduce their professional responsibilities – unless the initiative comes from the company or the public sector. With the second birth, they reduce their working hours, and they continue to reduce them with each subsequent birth, while men, on the other hand, increase their professional responsibilities with each birth. From a professional point of view, then, the gaps widen throughout their careers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, I urge you: pay a little attention to what is actually happening, in the public sector and in the private sector alike.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mrs Morin-Chartier, do you accept the double standards whereby all employees of the European Union, those of the Commission, the Council, Parliament and Parliament’s political groups, would be on full pay for the 20 weeks of their maternity leave, while at the same time proposing that this would not be the case for other people? I would think that mothers should be put on an equal footing throughout Europe, and we ought not to accept double standards or the Janus face.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, we did not say that we advocated double standards. The European Commission has submitted a proposal for 18 weeks. We are proposing to introduce a bridging clause. As a basis, this is entirely possible, but there is a difference between what is possible and the Utopian idea of proposing 20 weeks on full pay; between what is feasible and what one can promise in Parliament, which will not be accepted by either the Council or the national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we vote on Wednesday in favour of the Estrela report and the 20 weeks, the European Parliament will be disavowed three times: the first time by the Council, which will be unable to give its support – the Member States will be unable to give their support; the second time by the national parliaments – the national parliaments, with their budgets, will be unable to give their support; and the third time by women, when they realise that we have worked against them.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, we have to stand by mothers and fathers in the rush hour of their lives. They must be given the peace and quiet to enable their full involvement early on in the life of their child; to breastfeed and fully recover from childbirth; to be able to roll up their sleeves once more after their leave and participate fully in working life. Mothers, fathers, unions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) – everyone wants this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Opponents wrongfully put a price tag on women: no additional costs can be incurred to the ever ageing European society. Yet we must invest now in women as workers and in improving work-life balance so that our society remains affordable in the future. Of course, it is important that maternity leave be on full pay. Why should women, by virtue of being the only ones with the biological possibility of bearing children, take a pay cut during their leave?</p>
      <p sl="nl">We say that we consider it important that men and women be able to enjoy a healthy work-life balance, that women be given equal opportunities in the workplace, and so we must stop squabbling and assume joint responsibility.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the question that we must ask ourselves is what is this directive intended to achieve? There is relatively substantial agreement that there should be health protection for mothers-to-be and new mothers. The great debate concerns the areas in which the aspect of equality should also be included. On the other hand, as the European Parliament, we also need to be aware that we are adopting a directive that will be in force not just for five years, but perhaps for the next 20 or 25 years. However, I hope that by then, women’s working conditions will be substantially better and companies will be keen to employ young mothers – not least because of a shortage of skilled labour – and, above all, will also build up the appropriate infrastructure for this. We need to bear in mind this perspective too.</p>
      <p sl="de">Notwithstanding this, I also realise that at present, we do not have a majority that is prepared to adopt this perspective. In view of this, we will probably arrive at a point where we agree on a compromise such as eighteen weeks, a higher rate of statutory payments or the continued payment of 75% of salary, which will indeed bring about an improvement in some European countries in particular.</p>
      <p sl="de">A much more important point, and one which goes beyond the aspect of maternity leave, is the framework conditions surrounding young families. This means childcare facilities; in Germany, for example, there are still not enough of these. That would be a real equality policy that gives women a chance to go back to work.</p>

I applaud your commitment to these proposals – indeed, I agree with the vast majority of them – but there are one or two parts that I do not agree with. So I can applaud your commitment but I cannot applaud your tolerance. Come back in 30 years’ time and preach to me about advancing women’s rights when you have done as much work on this as I have.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will not be pigeon-holed as regressive. There are aspects of these proposals which are regressive: the idea that European women should have more European babies in an overpopulated world is socially regressive. To impose 20 weeks’ fully-paid maternity leave in the UK – I cannot explain our system quickly enough here – is financially regressive. A disproportionate number of higher paid women in the UK will receive the vast majority of the extra GBP 2 billion. It will not go to the lower paid women whom, I think, we would all want to help the most.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, mothers need special protection. On that there is agreement in this Chamber. Having a child is physically and emotionally demanding, and is a profound experience for any woman. The physical changes, new life circumstances and, above all, the recovery and recuperation period – all these things make adequate maternity protection essential. This is something that society must provide. Hence, there is no dispute as to the principle. The debate concerns how this is done and the conditions under which it is done. In this regard, we should not forget that the EU lays down a minimum standard and it is up to the Member States to implement, organise and pay for maternity provision. We are not starting from nothing.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Member States have organised their maternity provision in very different ways, in some cases, supplementing this with parental leave to include fathers. Fathers need to be involved in family responsibilities – and we are talking here not about leave, but about shouldering the responsibilities involved in bringing up children and in family life. However, paternity leave is not part of maternity provision; rather, it must always be part of parental leave. Neither do fathers become ill as a result of a birth. I congratulate all the Member States that have established paternity leave; likewise, Commissioner, I am pleased to hear of the Commission’s proposal that has just been announced. We cannot allow the important matter of maternity provision to be diluted by an extension of parental leave. Maternity provision is about health. No mother is sick for 20 weeks; neither are breastfeeding mothers sick.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have a responsibility to women who participate in working life to make maternity provision justifiable. Our proposal is for 18 weeks in total, with the last four weeks of this being subject to national variation in the level of the financial payments made. This is set out in Amendments 115 and 116, which I urge Members to support.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, I call on the Member States to exploit their opportunities to offer all families and mothers more payments that can then be adopted on a voluntary basis. Mothers are building the future, and they need every support that we can offer them.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in voting for the Estrela report, we are basically responding to the demands of millions of women for greater protection for pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth, or who are breastfeeding, and their babies. By increasing maternity leave to 20 weeks and paternity leave to 2 weeks, on full pay, we are supporting the recovery from the international crisis and economic growth in the European Union, because we are helping to reconcile family life and work. By protecting working women from dismissal during pregnancy and for six months thereafter, we are providing an incentive to implement the objective of the EU strategy and achieve a 75% female participation rate in the labour market by 2020.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about the working conditions of women, which we want to improve in Europe. I will specifically address the Thomsen report, for which I was shadow rapporteur; in other words, the subject of ‘precarious women workers’.</p>
      <p sl="de">This year is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. It is an established fact that poverty disproportionately affects women. Naturally, we cannot, on any account, allow this to remain the case. Poverty among women may be the result of various things. It may result from the fact that women are not paid as well as men. Naturally, that is not the only cause. Women also take more career breaks, for example, when they have children and take time off to bring them up. Women also perform the lower skilled jobs. Things are particularly serious in the case of women whose employment conditions are precarious, because in some cases, they may not even have an employment contract or may have irregular employment contracts; they may have no protection whatsoever and they may have little access to information. The situation is particularly bad for women with a background of migration. This can lead to the poverty continuing, so that they also end up poor in old age.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to break out of this spiral, which affects women more than men. One of the ways this can be done is through education and training. Every woman – every girl – needs to get a qualification, whatever their background, and they need access to a profession which will genuinely secure them a proper living. Lifelong learning must generally be possible for women too. We also need to ensure that we have more women and girls going into the better paid professions. These are frequently the professions that are more heavily dominated by men.</p>
      <p sl="de">In other words, access to education in any event, and access to social security systems – that way, we can achieve many improvements for women.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Establishing minimum standards for the duration and payment of maternity leave is difficult in the current economic and social climate in Europe. In some countries, the proposed minimum exceeds the level of protection which national legislation currently offers pregnant women. On the one hand, we are still contending with the consequences of the crisis: governments of individual states are raising taxes and introducing severe expenditure cuts, and we still have a high level of unemployment. On the other, we have to deal with the problem of the falling birth rate, negative natural growth, and, consequently, an ageing population. In the not too distant future, we are being threatened with the failure of pension systems or possibly their total breakdown.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this sort of situation, there are no free or easy solutions. Yet we must realise that in investing in women and creating favourable conditions for them, we are encouraging them to decide to have children. Of course, fully paid and longer maternity leave is not enough on its own. We also need pro-family tax solutions and stable employment. In this case, we have no alternative. There is no other way of increasing the number of Europeans who will be professionally active in 30 years’ time if we do not invest in the family now. This is why we need a fair and just minimum standard for the duration and payment of maternity leave in Europe. We are giving women the possibility to choose and to decide on motherhood.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what I feel is missing from this debate is the necessary distinction between national transposition in the Member States and the task that exists at European level. We all realise that we need to take the special features of individual nations into account. However, where the debate in Germany is concerned, for example, I must say that I can definitely see how Germany could implement this report. What we are concerned with here is creating minimum standards at EU level to establish social framework conditions for women. We are always keen to make reference to the ILO when it comes to good work, protection at work and protecting health, so I ask myself: why not in this case?</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as the debate on costs is concerned, I would like to remind everyone in this House that in Germany – as well as in some other European countries – the anti-discrimination directive brought about a huge amount of lobbying on the part of enterprises. There was talk of an avalanche of costs, of companies going bankrupt, of burdens on the economy and on workers themselves. Looking back years later, how much of this happened? None of it. I find this debate, this lobbying, very reminiscent of that time. I urge you at last to put the economy on one side and to put people at the heart of what we do.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not one of those merely sermonising here. I have stated that I advocate a social Europe. For me, that includes women. In this situation, women need our help.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, in its votes, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality adopted a number of amendments to the Commission’s original proposal for a directive.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Unfortunately, in its amendments, the Committee has completely ignored the principle of subsidiarity with regard to the allocation of costs. The attempt to harmonise the regulations on maternity leave in 27 different Member States has resulted in a muddled proposal. Furthermore, mixed up with it all is a proposal for paternity leave, which, under the legal basis, does not even fall within the scope of the directive, as the Commissioner clearly stated right from the outset, luckily. Paternity leave needs to be regulated in connection with the system for parental leave, and not in connection with leave in the sense of recovering from pregnancy or childbirth.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The proposals put forward by the Committee on Women’s Rights also ignore the progressive maternity and parental leave schemes in other countries, including the Nordic countries. The Committee’s proposals confuse these parental leave systems, which offer freedom of choice at national level, and in certain respects, they would even detract from the welfare of mother and child. For example, under the Committee’s proposal, if mothers only begin the compulsory six week period of maternity leave after confinement, there is increased risk to pregnant women at the workplace due to give birth soon, as well as their children. Mothers who are almost due will not make it through to the end working an eight-hour day, and this proposal will result in more cases of sick leave prior to confinement.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Committee’s proposal ignores as compensation the national schemes under which maternity leave is closely linked to a significantly longer parental leave, because it does not happen on full pay. For example, in Finland, parents can look after their child at home until the age of 18 months, on average, and we can afford it, because at various stages, employers, workers and taxpayers, too, share the costs. If employers were saddled with the full amount, there is no doubt whatsoever that it would weaken women’s employment opportunities and do a disservice to women as employees.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Gender equality and the gender equality perspective would be enhanced. It would be possible to meet the target set in the EU 2020 strategy of increasing the employment rate of women to 75%. More women in work would be of definite benefit to society.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, in general, with time comes wisdom. Unfortunately, that is not the case with this second report, which was adopted by a majority in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and which we are discussing here in Parliament 17 months after the first report. In its present form, this second report is just as muddled, counterproductive and overloaded with texts that do not belong in a legislative act as the report that was referred back to committee in May 2009.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have already wasted two years improving maternity protection. If we vote for this report as it stands, we will waste at least the same amount of time again debating with the Council in codecision, when the Commission’s initial 2008 proposal was reasonable. It guaranteed substantial progress in Member States in which the length of maternity leave and maternity pay are still below that which exists in some countries; rarely are we granted 20 weeks’ leave on full, uncapped pay, paid for by the state.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us not forget that, in this case, the aim is to establish minimum thresholds, and that we cannot impose radical solutions on the 27. Indeed, in order to encourage an employed and, above all, highly qualified woman to have children, it is more important for her to have the right to a shorter period of leave but on full pay than to have 20 or 30 weeks’ leave or more without a full pay guarantee. Not only are the proposals in the Estrela report counterproductive where women’s employability is concerned; they are also difficult for governments and businesses in certain Member States to finance. It is better today to take one real step in the right direction than to make a promise for the future, to be realised 10 years from now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Personally, I shall not be voting for this report in its present form, and I call on all my fellow Members to reject all those amendments that have nothing to do with maternity protection, such as the provisions concerning self-employed workers. Barely four months ago, we voted in this House for a directive on maternity leave for self-employed workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The same applies to paternity leave, Mr Tarabella, and I am in favour. The Belgians can introduce 20 weeks’ fully paid paternity leave tomorrow if they have a government; there is nothing stopping them from doing so. Similarly – since this is another point to consider – the social partners are currently discussing a directive on paternity leave. Let us wait for them, and action will be taken on this matter as it was on parental leave: this is the right way to go.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I call on my fellow Members to vote in favour of the amendments restricting leave to 18 weeks and of the considered amendments, Madam President, tabled by your group and mine.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Eliminating any form of discrimination in every sphere of social and economic life is a vital prerequisite for protecting human rights and the welfare of every citizen. The promotion of the principle of equal opportunities for men and women, along with ensuring greater involvement by women in economic and social life, as fully entitled participants, must constantly be issues of concern. I believe that this approach must be reflected in the common agricultural policy in order to ensure that the sexes are represented fairly and equally. On the other hand, this approach can ensure that various policies are implemented effectively at European level in every working sector, but especially in agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Bearing in mind that the principle of gender equality is promoted by European legislation and is one of the fundamental requirements of the Europe 2020 strategy, I consider it appropriate to include this issue in agriculture as well, which also means through using new instruments which will promote this principle.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, now I know how to go about changing and extending one’s speaking time. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has called for 18 weeks’ maternity provision, which is four weeks more than was amicably agreed in Germany. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has called for 20 weeks on full pay plus two weeks’ paternity leave plus extension to self-employed workers. What has been completely pushed into the background is the fact that 20 weeks will cost France an additional EUR 2 billion per year and the UK an additional EUR 2.85 billion, according to statements by the Commission. For Germany the additional costs are estimated at around EUR 1.7 billion. Sometimes, you have to think of the costs.</p>
      <p sl="de">We recently had a joint study by the EMPL and FEMM committees that was drawn up with numerous errors. Payments such as Germany’s maternity allowance were not included. The reference framework for German parental allowance was incorrect. The cost estimates commissioned by some Member States were not sufficiently taken into account. You cannot make responsible policy on such a basis. Germany is exemplary: during the parental leave period, two thirds of salary continue to be paid for up to 14 months. This extends 14 weeks of maternity provision to up to 170 weeks. This makes Germany a European champion when it comes to protecting infants, and consequently, it needs an exemption clause in this directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is why I have tabled an amendment, together with 50 of my fellow Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which is supported by the European Conservatives and Reformists and large parts of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Our aim is for sufficient account to be taken of national systems. We hope that a majority of this House will support this call for reason to prevail in the vote on Wednesday. We want mothers to enjoy adequate protection; but if such protection is carried too far, specifically for ideological reasons, this will represent a major obstacle to women’s employment – which is something that we must remove, not encourage.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The issue of gender equality has been given greater prominence with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and we have a responsibility to take it forward.

We are dealing with a report which affects the social, employment and economic policies of our States, but which also concerns the whole of Europe in its desire to grow in unison.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Estrela report, as debated and amended, pursues with conviction the principle of reconciling private and working life and that of equal opportunities, and therefore of healthy and balanced progress.

      <p sl="it">Balance is necessary in the ends as well as the chosen means and must safeguard both the position of women in the labour market and the prerogatives of the States in implementing their policies.

      <p sl="lt">Today, it really is very important to reconcile work and family life better by striving for economic growth, welfare and competitiveness in the field of gender equality. As there is a steep decline in the birth rate in almost all Member States, we must take measures to create the best possible conditions for mothers to bring up children and to have a genuine opportunity to return to the labour market. I also call on the Member States and MEPs to find opportunities and coordinate the cost of maternity pay and childcare allowance in order to ensure that women are not a more costly work force than men. The sharing of family responsibilities and the opportunity to also grant men the right to two weeks paternity leave would give women increased opportunities to return to the labour market and would strengthen family relationships. Therefore, I am convinced that an extended period of maternity leave would also facilitate the achievement of improved birth rates, in particular, given that our society is ageing rapidly.</p>

      <p sl="fr">However, there are essentially two parts to the problem: the first is the economic context, that is true, but it is not reason enough to leave millions of families in the lurch for more decades to come; the second is the legal loopholes in the report, because the text includes several types of family leave with incompatible legal bases. Let us take adoption leave, which appears in the text alongside maternity and paternity leave.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I personally appreciate, as an adoptive mother and on behalf of all the women I represent, the will to grant the same rights as those of biological mothers. I am, in fact, what Mrs Morin-Chartier referred to as the small additional package to be added to the Estrela report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While the aim is indeed to improve the health and rights of women – of all women – in the labour market, adoptive mothers, who have become mothers like the others, are entitled to the same rights and the same protection at work. Like the others, they are mothers in their own right, and this applies, moreover, whether the child they adopt is under 12 months old or not; we must avoid the kind of discrimination that appears in the text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the subject of adoption, I regret the fact that the text goes into so little detail. It does not even include any of the Ramboll impact assessment findings. None of this has been dealt with very well, which is clearly a weak point. Nevertheless, despite this reservation, I shall support Mrs Estrela’s report because, economic considerations aside, not only are there men and women who must better assume their parental responsibilities in a society that is increasingly abdicating its responsibility of raising its young people, but it is also our duty to ensure that people do not have to choose to sacrifice their children for their job, or their job for their children.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, we are not Members of the Council but of Parliament. If we directly elected representatives are not ambitious, then tell me: who will be?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many things have been said, especially just now. However, the various new developments and controversies surrounding Mrs Estrela’s report demonstrate one thing: it is still very difficult today to calmly address the issue of gender equality and especially that of a better work-life balance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This legislative text has had – please forgive the expression – a difficult gestation period, mainly because attitudes still need to change a good deal in this area. Impact assessments are undoubtedly necessary to ensure a broad understanding of the issues at stake. However, they must be understood for what they are, and with caution. Their contradictory conclusions are, I might add, clear proof of this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Clearly, it would be foolish not to raise the issue of the potential costs of certain amendments tabled. However, it would be just as foolish to refuse to consider the medium- and long-term socio-economic benefits as regards the health of mothers and infants, or as regards equality between men and women in the labour market. What is more, our debate deserves better, I feel, than certain caricatures and certain stereotypes that one still hears today.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Europe is ageing, and it has very low birth rates. These factors pose great challenges to the European Union, and we must respond to them with concrete solutions. We have agreed on this observation during this debate, despite the differing views that have become evident in the discussion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In Portugal, for example, the birth rate is not high enough to ensure that generations are replaced, and this situation is jeopardising the future. This is happening in my country, as it is in the majority of EU Member States. I am sure that more flexible policies with regard to maternity leave can help to reverse these trends. We must send families a consistent message of support for motherhood, with concrete measures for the better reconciliation of professional, private and family life. Women must be protected so that they can choose to have children without having to leave the labour market. Meeting this challenge is vital if we want to achieve the economic and social objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and combat demographic ageing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In Portugal, for example, maternity leave is already paid at 100% of earnings for 120 days, in an attempt to counteract the low birth rate that we are experiencing. I would therefore argue that women’s salaries should be assured during maternity leave in the manner described in the report under discussion. Allowing each Member State to create conditions that will ensure an objective of paying full salaries during maternity leave by 2020 seems a sensible step.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Estrela, for her persistence in defending measures which are aimed at protecting families, whilst also counteracting the ageing of the population.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I think that we are all aware of the responsibility that Parliament has to exercise today in revising the directive on working conditions for women; a directive that we have been discussing since the previous legislature and on which, due to various points of view and difficulties, we have not been able to progress.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is why I am saying that today, we need to take responsibility, within the different points of view that we may have, in order to move forward on equal rights between men and women and improve the living conditions of women in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="es">This directive goes beyond the number of weeks of maternity leave, as I am sure we are all agreed that 14 weeks is not enough and we need to increase the length. However, aside from the number of weeks, we are talking about the dismissal of a woman who has become a mother being considered to be an unfair dismissal, or paternity leave being granted for the benefit of a working mother’s health.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do not understand why people say that paternity leave does not benefit the health of working mothers. Of course it does. Enabling the mother and father to share the work of caring for their children in the first few days after they are born is essential and fundamental for making progress in terms of equality between men and women. There are countries such as Spain that have already implemented independent and transferable paternity leave.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have to make it possible for men to take responsibility along with women in order to improve on the path that we have on the table at the moment. I think this is important.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, about five and a half years ago, I caused something of a furore by suggesting that any small businessman with his brain in the right place would be mad to employ a woman of childbearing age.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since then, it has got worse and worse as the balance in favour of employees versus employers has got completely out of control. One of my constituents from York wrote to me last year saying never mind about employing women of childbearing age, any small businessmen who employs anybody has got to be out of his mind.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have an extraordinary situation here, do we not? We have young women desperately keen to get into work, desperately keen to work for companies, especially small companies – which are the driving force of the United Kingdom economy – and we have employers who are too terrified to take them on. That is the problem we have. We are making it – here in this place with so little commercial experience amongst our Members – almost impossible for small businesses to employ young women, which is something they want to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">I used to think it was some sort of Chinese conspiracy where this place made it almost impossible for a European economy to function, and that behind the scenes the Chinese were making it so bad that eventually we had to import absolutely everything from China. Well, I have another hypothesis here, namely, that perhaps the women who are making it so difficult in committees, in the Commission and in this place for small businesses to employ young women have an eye to the main chance.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would suggest that when the electorate quite rightly look at them and boot them out in a few years’ time for their incompetence and their stupidity, they will only be able to get back into the workplace because they are in middle or late middle age. The game will be cleared for them. That is my hypothesis. I can think of no other sensible answer to this sort of ludicrous interference between employer and employee. If you think that is a weird hypothesis, anything that puts up with the way you talk about climate change, believe me, nothing is too stupid for this Chamber.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, there is no doubt that bringing this draft legislation to Parliament for debate after 18 months of intense work should be greeted favourably. It is clear that a project of this nature is characterised by various sensitivities, given that the equivalent laws in the Member States are profoundly different. In any case, the innovative scope of the measure is a result which should be very positively received, as indeed should the assertion of the principle of the centrality of the family, the guarantee of a greater degree of social protection for women and for women in a particular condition, such as that of having a baby.</p>
      <p sl="it">Consistency must likewise be ensured in the protection of women who give birth – and I say this despite the fact that I hold the regulatory scope of this measure to be broader than that which was originally envisaged – insofar as it should be highlighted that in Europe, and in many Member States, there is still a notable difference in the protection offered with regard to childbirth and unborn babies.</p>
      <p sl="it">This activity must clearly be reconciled with the need to eliminate employer abuse, and we need to limit the scope of the amendments – some of which, in my opinion, make the legislation too inflexible overall – starting with paternity leave, which seems far removed with regard to a measure issued fundamentally for the protection of women.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is no doubt of the need to give due consideration to the problem of immigrant workers and domestic workers, which constitute another element of this – the draft legislation on precarious female workers – in a flexible and elastic market, where women, especially now, must be seen as a resource at the service of the community.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, UK employers and the UK Government are urging British MEPs to vote against the proposals to raise the amount of fully paid maternity leave from 14 to 20 weeks – although I think this is rank hypocrisy from the Conservatives who, in committee, put in an amendment asking for 24 paid weeks. As I say, hypocrisy apparently knows no bounds.</p>
      <p sl="en">The British Federation of Small Businesses has stated that these plans are unaffordable and that they would cost British business over GBP 2.5 billion a year. Even the coalition government in the UK, which includes the Liberal Democrats, is opposed to these changes. The proposed changes will cost the UK up to GBP 2 billion at a time when public and private sector workers are being made redundant in order to save far smaller sums.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also the case that the changes may be self-defeating as, according to the UK Government, it will be the highest paid workers who will benefit most and lower paid workers the least. These changes, however well-meaning, will actually have the effect of setting back the process of achieving equality for working mothers. It will also be the case that these changes will encourage employers to choose male candidates over women.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, there are other ways of enhancing the rights of nursing mothers, such as more flexible leave systems. We must also respect the diverse social and cultural differences of various Member States. One size simply does not fit all. The working families who are so reliant upon us getting the legislation right to live, work and raise children are in the real world, not some ideological Eurodisney land.</p>
      <p sl="en">These changes are being proposed at the wrong time and they benefit the wrong people. At a time when governments across the EU seek to cut public expenditure, you seek to increase employment costs, which will hit a sector where women are disproportionately represented and therefore more exposed to the possibility of job cuts. The UK already has the best, fairest and most generous standards of maternal and paternal leave. British mothers currently get six weeks of 90% salary, followed by 33 weeks statutory maternity pay of GBP 125 a week.</p>
      <p sl="en">I shall vote in the interests of the British people. I shall follow the advice of Her Majesty’s government and I will vote against the amendments of the maternity pay.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, having listened to everything that has been said here in this plenary sitting, I am certain that the equal treatment of men and women – which, indeed, has required a great deal of courage and effort and also large amounts of money – has not been achieved. I am saying this not only to a number of colleagues from my own group – who, incidentally, have left the Chamber – but also to others. That was my first point.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second point concerns ageing and the top-heavy age structure in this society. This is an extremely important issue as far as Europe is concerned, and so it is of paramount importance to make having children easier. For example, I value the interview that the French Minister for Finance, Mrs Lagarde, has now given on the position of women in the workplace, which was perfect. Indeed, I hope that we keep to this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My third point is that equal treatment is a commitment to a social Europe. We have said that, in this social Europe, men and women must enjoy equal opportunities on the labour market and must also be able to have children. Currently, we are all aiming for 18 weeks, and we have now more or less agreed on this 18 weeks, but we do not yet know how we are going to afford this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have no objections at all to the compromise tabled by my own group to set a maximum of 75% for those four weeks. What I do object to is the fact that the compromise concerned also contains a link to health costs. That is where my main objection lies, as this gives countries such as the United Kingdom and Ireland – in France, such costs are also heavily subsidised – the opportunity to evade the 75% that must continue to be paid. Therefore, I wonder whether we can perhaps vote down that part of the compromise. This would also mean we were able to deliver a consolidated opinion here that could be expected to gain a majority in the Council.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need European legislation that will protect the health of pregnant women and women who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding, and we must rise to the demographic challenge we are facing and encourage an increase in birth rates in Europe. However, this advance must not serve as a disincentive to employ women.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would emphasise three points. Firstly, I welcome the European Commission’s proposal on the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. Indeed, I would emphasise the title, which is the legal framework of this directive, because too often, we tend to forget what exactly this text is about. We are talking here about women because, until we receive proof to the contrary, men cannot give birth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The debate tends to become diluted as a result of the reference made to paternity or parental leave. Let us solve the problem faced by women first, by focusing on their health when they bring a child into the world. We must implement genuine guarantees to protect the health of these women in the labour market. Paternity and parental leave will be dealt with in another directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the debate revolves around the number of weeks. Currently, the average leave period is set at 14 weeks. The European Commission is proposing 18 weeks and the report 20. Obviously, as a woman and mother of three children, I want mothers to be able to stay with their babies for as long as possible. However, this then begs the question: who is going to pay for this extension from 14 to 20 weeks? The state? Businesses?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am convinced that the average increase from 14 to 18 weeks is a major European advance and a real investment by our economy towards promoting a rise in birth rates in Europe. Twenty weeks is liable to have a negative impact on female employment: it would put a brake on their employment. Businesses and our States cannot support this additional huge financial burden at this time of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, more priority must be given to improving childcare so that mothers can achieve a work-life balance. Little progress has been made on this matter despite the many appeals by our Parliament. Therefore, let us not be counterproductive and let us not send women back home.</p>

Women are concentrated in low paid jobs and account for the large majority of part-time workers in the European Union.

I have listened very closely to the debate this evening and I would like to say that those against this draft, and I am referring to extending maternity leave and full pay, can only come up with one argument – economic. However, this is simplistic because, looking beyond the budget deficit, we are dealing with people. They are unaware that the balance of benefits is weighted in favour of this report, both for employees and employers. I do mean employers, too, in the sense of investing in the future.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, opponents fail to realise that actually penalising motherhood and the idea of it at a time when the birth rate is falling, not to mention the population getting older and poorer, has an impact on the sustainability of social security schemes.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I, too, have listened carefully to everything that has been said up to now, and I note that, as is very often the case, having too much can make us worse off. The arguments that are being made to justify this super-maternity leave – 20 weeks, of which six must be taken before the child’s birth and two after it, on full pay – are unconvincing. It is clearly not with this kind of isolated measure that Europe is going to rise to the highly complex challenges of demography and female employment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Who can seriously think that people decide to have a child, a baby, to take advantage of five months’ leave instead of four and a half months’? On the other hand, I do not believe that denying women their freedom of choice helps improve their situation. Furthermore, let us please bear in mind the effects, the collateral damage of the decisions we take. Protecting women primarily means not going overboard with our demands and thus not paving the way for new forms of discrimination against them when they are initially recruited and when they return to work, as all the experts from the OECD and from the Union of the Middle Classes, for example, confirm.</p>

Mr Mann and his colleagues have also tabled amendments on this matter, including Amendment 115, the first part of which really concerns whether or not the four weeks should be counted.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, this is associated in the second half of the amendment – and I will read it out now so as to be absolutely clear – with the fact that the remuneration may be the average of the remuneration for the 18 weeks of maternity leave, which shall be at least 75% of the last monthly salary or of the average monthly salary as stipulated according to national law, subject to any ceiling laid down under national legislation. What this in fact means is that we are giving up on European harmonisation when it comes to financing in this area and how much women receive during this period. That is not acceptable. I would consider it a great pity if this were voted through together because, in the final event, we are not giving up on harmonisation at European level, but rather want to increase it in order to bring about an improvement for all men and women.</p>

Are we trying to bring about a small improvement in equality and a little assistance for families as cheaply as possible? Of course, making family life compatible with work costs money. I would simply like to ask my fellow Members from Germany: what is expenditure of EUR 1 billion in Germany if, at the same time, we are handing out EUR 450 billion in bank guarantees? What do we actually want in this area? Full pay for parental leave is quite correct. What else should it be? It is not time off, it is not holiday; this is work that people are doing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course we want the period extended to 20 weeks, because we believe that this is the only way this work can be accommodated.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, we do not merely want to bring about a bit more equality in working life. We want complete equality, for women and men. We need to take drastic steps if we are to achieve this, such as a statutory minimum wage in all Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the matter of maternity protection should remain a matter for the Member States on account of the cultural differences in Europe. Austria has 16 weeks of maternity provision. Extending this would cost EUR 17.4 million per year for each further week. Making 20 weeks’ provision mandatory would cost Austria more than EUR 60 million. The additional costs would be even higher if there were also two weeks’ paid paternity leave for every father.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us be clear in our deliberations: firstly, this is a completely personal decision by the parents, and secondly, I see this as presenting a risk of further discrimination against women of childbearing age.

If we take all these suggestions on board, it is possible that young women, in particular, will be unable to find employment. I am looking at this as a parent. I have two daughters and I want them to have the same chance as boys have to get jobs. That is the main thing! In Ireland, we are currently in a quandary as regards finances. There are 20% of young people unemployed. Four businesses a day in the small and medium sector are closing down and we are facing the worst budget we have ever had to face.

      <p sl="pl">The second group are women over 50, who are seen as less productive and less creative. According to the statistics, women aged between 59 and 60 make up only 25% of employees in this age range. The percentage of women over 60 still in work is even lower.

Maternity leave should not be penalised; we have to work very hard to achieve equality of pay; and we have to study very carefully the economic consequences of the decisions we take here.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several of you referred to the issue of paternity or parental leave. I would like just to remind you that the newly adopted parental leave directive grants a minimum of eight months for parents per child. For the first time, we have legal encouragement for fathers at EU level to take leave.</p>
      <p sl="en">A whole month of leave is lost if the father does not take his responsibility. This directive will soon be in force and we will build on this progress and look carefully at further proposals on paternity leave.</p>

      <p sl="en">Allow me to underline the encouragement of fathers to take part in parenting with a personal remark. I was lucky enough to be present at the deliveries of two of my three children. Of course, during that time in the hospital, the most I could do was put on a brave face and pretend that I was neither worried nor scared and try and offer my wife the highest moral support I could. Sometimes, however, it was my wife and the kind nurses who took care of me, so I could offer this moral support! I will never forget the very important moments after the delivery and the first few days when I could help my wife with the newborn baby.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very clear that it is not just mothers who need to bond with a newborn child. The fathers need to do the same and we need to encourage them and change the paternal pattern and create the conditions where fathers can also bond with their newborn babies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Coming back to the reports we were discussing today, and with regard to Mrs Thomsen’s report on precarious work, I have taken careful note of what has been said. I can assure you that the Commission will back up action to improve the working conditions of precarious female workers by monitoring national employment policy and by providing structural fund support in particular.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to Mrs Estrela’s comprehensive work on the Commission’s proposal for a strengthened maternity leave directive, we are indeed trying to strike a very difficult balance. We need to ensure the fundamental rights of female workers, but we should not give an excuse to Member States to stop these very important negotiations. We need to study the models which offer us a high employment rate and high fertility rates at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this vein, the Commission welcomes the amendments which are aimed at maintaining the 18 weeks minimum leave, set an alternative level of remuneration, keep the reference to sick leave, and allow for other forms of leave to be counted as maternity leave.</p>
      <p sl="en">All this under the proviso that it does not lead to the weakening of existing protection. Rolling back in this respect cannot be an option for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I very much hope that Parliament and the Council will be able to reach a compromise. The Commission position aims to breach the gap between the positions of the two institutions and to provide a solid basis for future discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">The improvement of conditions for women in Europe must be our ultimate goal. They contribute enormously to society and society must find a way to pay them back.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the sensitivity that you showed in your opening remarks and your closing speech, along with your personal testimony. I think that it is very important that this is associated with the testimonies of other people, such as the other MEPs who have also spoken in this debate, as this will certainly help to alter certain prejudices and change the stereotypes which still exist in our society.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, it is also important that we also include paternity leave by making the most of the dual legal basis in this directive, which aims to promote gender equality and the reconciliation of family and personal life, because one of the stereotypes which prevails in our society is that women are associated with reproduction, while men are associated with production. Men are just as much fathers as women are mothers, as well as being workers, and thus they are entitled both to professional achievement and to raising their children from birth. The Member from the UK who spoke is not here. I would have liked to ask him whether David Cameron is better than other Europeans who would also like to take paternity leave, but who are discriminated against in at least eight Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are still in the first reading process, and so we will have the opportunity to improve these proposals together with the Commission and the Council. I would also like to thank my fellow Members for their involvement. I feel that this broad consensus is very important.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their comments on my report on precarious women workers and the Commission for its willingness to take initiatives to improve the situation.</p>
      <p sl="da">As many Members have pointed out, women constitute the vast majority of those working under poor working conditions and for low wages. This not only means that women in Europe earn less than men, but also that women receive smaller pensions than men, and we will see many more poor women in the Europe of the future, because marriage no longer provides automatic financial security in old age.</p>
      <p sl="da">The most vulnerable group on the European labour market is that of female immigrants. Among this group, we see a high level of exploitation, especially among the 11 million women working as domestic workers. This group also includes au pairs. Au pair means ‘on equal terms’, but many of the women who come from the Philippines and the former Soviet Republics to work as au pairs do not come for cultural exchange. They come to earn money, and the scheme is exploited in many places in Europe as a way of obtaining cheap labour. This situation is one that I would like to call on the Commission to investigate. We should not allow this form of exploitation to be legal in Europe. We must therefore exercise greater stringency in connection with the au pair scheme.</p>
      <p sl="da">Pay differences between men and women begin, according to the Commission’s own pay statistics, when children come along. If we want to achieve complete equality between men and women on the labour market, women need to be fully compensated during maternity leave, and men need to be involved in looking after the children and thus granted paternity leave.</p>

      <p sl="it">Equality between men and women represents one of the fundamental principles of the European Union. It was already defined in the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992, some years later, in the Treaty of Amsterdam (1997) and in the present day in the EU strategy 2010-2015. The social agenda of the European Union includes, amongst its priorities, the need to promote policies aimed at supporting the reconciliation of the working, private and family life of women. In this context, in my opinion, motherhood is an absolutely fundamental right for the purposes of social stability.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union is, at present, facing a demographic challenge arising from low birth rates and the steady increase in the proportion of older people. I believe that the improvement of provisions aimed at promoting a work-life balance for women is part of the answer to this demographic decline. I recognise the importance of introducing stronger protection from dismissal during the period from the beginning of pregnancy and the months immediately following the end of maternity leave.</p>
      <p sl="it">As such, I support the amendments that have been introduced for this purpose, including, in particular, the right of a woman to return to her job or to be assigned an equivalent position.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The report’s main objective is to improve security and healthcare for pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth and workers who are breastfeeding at work. Personally, I consider the most important proposal to be the extension of the minimum length of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 20 weeks, which will contribute towards improving the health and psychological state of the mother, who will also therefore be able to take full care of her child. Extending the minimum length of maternity leave will also encourage breastfeeding, which has a demonstrably positive impact on the health of the child and the mother. Just as important in my opinion is the current proposal that the contribution to maternity leave should be the full amount of the employee’s salary – that is, the average monthly salary – or at least 85%. These measures are sufficient to ensure that families, particularly single parent families, are protected from falling below the poverty line and from social exclusion. Part of the report is devoted to the traditional status of women. Women, unlike men, still bear the main responsibility for the care of the child and other dependents, and are often forced to choose between motherhood and professional development. It is therefore particularly important that the new forms of parental leave do not reflect or reinforce existing social stereotypes. The proposal only affects the Czech Republic with respect to the amount of maternity contribution, and not the length of maternity leave.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Women are the favourite victims of the recession due to redundancies primarily affecting precarious jobs. Those most affected by redundancies, salary cuts and abuse from employers are women employed in paid domestic work, providing care and working on temporary contracts. Domestic work accounts for almost a tenth of the total number of jobs in developed countries, which represents a large group of citizens, especially women, in a vulnerable situation. This encourages abusive treatment by employers, especially when the workers are immigrants originating either from the new European Union Member States, like Romania, or third countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the removal of the employment restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians must be the first step towards eliminating discriminatory behaviour, which still imposes an inferior, precarious status on them in most old Member States. The tragic example of a Romanian nurse killed recently in an Italian underground station, under the indifferent eye of passers-by, must ring the alarm bell about the dangers of collective discrimination and stigmatisation, which can have, as in this case, unforeseeable and extremely serious consequences. I also wish to press for the minimum period of maternity leave to be extended to 20 weeks so that women can have the time they need to look after their children accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="en">I support this report which seeks to extend EU maternity leave to 20 weeks on full pay and to introduce two weeks of paid paternity leave. It is vital that the governments now support the EP’s recommendations in the EU Social Affairs Council on 2 December. Opposing this measure will have the effect of excluding many women from the labour force, thereby losing a valuable resource. Instead of penalising women for having children, the EU needs to support them and help them better balance work and family life. Better maternity leave is an investment in the future good health of our society. The first few weeks of the lives of newborn children are invaluable for the development of trust, sensory-cognitive skills and a bond with both their parents. Studies have also shown that social measures such as maternity leave help increase the female employment rate by 3-4%. Providing better maternity leave and introducing paid paternity leave is a sensible investment. The impact assessment of this measure demonstrated that just over a 1% increase in female labour participation would cover the costs of 20 weeks paid maternity leave and two weeks paid paternity leave.</p>

      <p sl="en">Over the last 50 years, European women have made huge progress towards gender equality. Among the most important goals achieved is the entry of women into the labour market. However, the increased over-representation of women in ‘non-standard’ employment is extremely worrying and I would like to repeat the report’s calls on the Commission to encourage Member States to ‘exchange best practices and make full use of the cofinancing opportunities offered by the Structural Funds … to ensure broader access to affordable, quality childcare and elderly care facilities so that women are not forced to undertake these duties on an informal basis’. It also ‘stresses … the need to ensure that precarious domestic care jobs are transformed, wherever possible, into decent, long-term jobs’. Precarious work has long been a cause of concern; however, the current economic and financial crisis has made the issue of precarious work and especially the issue of women in precarious employment very urgent, and I would urge the Commission to act to protect women in a vulnerable situation employed in precarious circumstances.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Keynote speeches make much of the need to promote the status of families. The promotion of equality is a priority in employment strategies. It is time for action where it concerns families. Families require concrete deeds and better coordination of work and family life. Employment and birth rates among women are higher in countries where good systems of family leave and childcare services ease the burden that results from having children. Good examples include Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Finland. It is therefore possible to combine women’s participation in the labour market with high birth rates, and that should be supported in the EU. I back the proposal by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for maternity leave to last 20 weeks on full pay. Women and families should not be penalised for having children. In addition to the call for full pay, the proposed directive is also suggesting that maternity leave should count towards service in employment when pensions are being calculated. This issue is connected to the EU’s call for equal pay. If the directive went ahead, it would narrow the earnings gap between women and men. The directive would also improve the status of multiple birth and adoptive families and that of families with disabled children. It is indeed difficult to think of any reason not to support the proposed directive with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. Better coordination of family and professional life promotes the well-being of families, employment and economic development.</p>

      <p sl="fi">We are unanimous regarding the need on the part of women who are pregnant or who have just given birth for special protection in society and the labour market. This is ultimately about the basic unit of society, about strengthening the status of the family. We nevertheless disagree on what sort of legislation should actually be enacted to realise this goal in the Member States. I support the Commission’s view that the minimum period for maternity leave should be raised across the Union from the present 14 weeks to 18 weeks, with compensation paid at the rate in place for a period of illness, at the very least. This would be a significant improvement in Europe. When, in addition, we bear in mind the changes to parental leave made last year, we may conclude that protection of the family is improving in the EU. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, however, has adopted amendments that do not respect the differences between national systems or financial realities. The Member States have widely varying maternity leave systems. Cramming them all into the same package would result in poor legislation and breach the principle of subsidiarity. For example, in Finland, maternity leave combined with paternity leave and a long period of parental leave lasting more than six months makes for a wide-ranging system, the cost burden for which is shared among different parties. The system has an additional component: the possibility of childcare leave, during which the contract of employment is not discontinued. The costs of maternity leave lasting 20 weeks on full pay, which is now being proposed, would go up in Finland from the current level of EUR 30 million to EUR 80 million. In many Member States, it would mean even higher costs. In this economic situation, such a proposal can only be made completely free of budgetary responsibility. From the perspective of equality, I also regard as worrying the dreaded scenario where women’s employment opportunities could, in fact, weaken if employers were saddled with the massive costs arising.</p>

      <p sl="cs">It is 15 years since the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action. The document summarises the status of women in the world and recommends steps for improving it. It emphasises women’s working conditions, particularly in the economy, health and education. The European Parliament and the Council have adopted several directives to implement these recommendations. Based on the results, which appeared to be largely positive, further tasks were undertaken and presented for implementation by the Member States in the road map for equality between men and women for 2006-2010. February’s annual report by the European Parliament on equality between men and women for 2009 says that, as a result of the economic crisis and the budget cuts in the EU countries, there have been job losses, particularly amongst women. Women often submit to pressure by employers, which particularly favours multinational retail chains. The workload has a bad effect on women’s health, family, legal working time or training. Few employers are willing to create favourable conditions for their employees for reconciling professional and family life. The most difficult working conditions are faced by female immigrants. The obstacles they face include language barriers, an unfamiliar working environment, family or cultural traditions, and so on. The crisis has impeded the attainment of many fixed objectives. The European Institute for Gender Equality should immediately assess the current situation, and the European Commission and the European Parliament should take effective action to halt the worsening of the status of women.</p>

      <p sl="it">The long gestation (a fitting choice of term in this case) of this proposal for a directive is due to the conflict between those who wanted to include impossible objectives in the document in order to give it a symbolic quality, and those whose sole aim was to advance our society by promoting certain rights in practice. In the end, the compromise does not fully meet the protection requirements outlined: the protection of the health of pregnant women; the guarantee of equal treatment for female workers, including self-employed workers; and the increased sharing of childcare responsibilities between parents. However, the new features introduced – the extension of maternity leave to 18 weeks and the 6 weeks’ compulsory maternity leave after confinement; the introduction of remuneration at the full amount of the woman’s previous earnings; the increased protection against redundancy; and the introduction of the right to request flexible working patterns, notwithstanding the option for Member States to set different limits and to maintain more favourable provisions, mean that we are indeed taking a step forward. I voted in favour of the resolution, although my opinion differs even from that of my group on many amendments, in an attempt to highlight the fundamental importance of the measures linked to health and safety protection at work.</p>

      <p sl="et">For a long time, gender inequality in the labour market has been a very important subject for the EU, and for years, it has tried to find a solution. Nevertheless, even today, we cannot report positive developments in this area. Thus, for example, according to Eurostat data, the number of women in precarious employment – that is, women working part-time – has increased significantly, reaching 31.4%, while the figure for men is 8.3%. It seems reasonable here to locate the reasons for this in the current economic and financial crisis, which has exacerbated the problems of women in precarious employment even more. I believe that precarious employment is not just a reason for the difference in pay between women and men, but also a barrier to career opportunities. As the proportion of women in precarious employment is excessively high today and, therefore, the abovementioned harmful consequences have a disproportionate effect on the situation of such women, I think that the EU should strengthen the legal regulations on temporary, part-time and agency work. Perhaps then, one day, we will be in a position to say that the EU has guaranteed equal rights between men and women and abolished gender discrimination in the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Estrela for her creditable report on the amendment to the Council Directive to encourage improvements to the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. The reforms set out in the report are important for the improvement of the rights and well-being of EU citizens and the creation of healthier competitiveness in the internal market. The European Union needs a coherent social policy. The harmonisation of maternity leave systems is an important step towards a more social Europe. The report proposes a period of maternity leave lasting 20 weeks on full pay. This would increase maternity benefits in many EU countries. A long and well remunerated period of maternity leave has been shown to have a positive impact on women’s participation in the labour market. The greater contribution made by women to the labour market would quickly cover the costs of the reform, which many claim are insurmountable. Better maternity benefits also raise birth rates. An ageing Europe needs taxpayers in order to maintain security of the supply of services in the future. The call for full pay during maternity leave is also an important step in narrowing the differences in income between women and men. A period of maternity leave would no longer mean less income for women and, furthermore, full pay during maternity leave would increase women’s pension accrual. In today’s Europe, older women are especially liable to live in poverty.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The majority of precarious jobs have always been taken by women. There has been talk for a long time about improving working conditions for women but, unfortunately, nothing is changing. Against this background, I wish to draw your attention to the plight of the seasonal workers picking strawberries in Spain. I am familiar with their situation not only from the countless complaints received from Romanian workers or the trade unions, but also from direct experience on site. Every year, thousands of Romanian women go to pick strawberries in Spain for a period of between three and five months. Some are very often subjected to abuse from their employers. The original contracts are replaced by contracts in Spanish, which they do not understand. They are often not given health insurance, being forced even to pay for it out of their own pocket. Their work sometimes requires them to pick strawberries sprayed with pesticides, without any protective equipment. However, they cannot complain as they are afraid that they will be sacked and sent home. I have drawn the European Commission’s attention to their situation through questions which have been submitted requesting a directive for regulating the rights of seasonal workers in the European Union. However, the response I have been given is that this issue is not on its list of priorities. This is why I call on the Commission again to table a legislative proposal on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Supporting women as they reconcile their working and family conditions is one of the biggest challenges of modern times. The amount or length of maternity leave certainly does not determine the decision to start a family or whether or not to have a child. Nevertheless, the conditions under which these decisions are made are important. This is about the degree of certainty that women have during this time that they can dedicate themselves to motherhood, in peace and without fear, during the first weeks and months. It is also an expression of the importance society assigns to these women. It is about whether we basically consider motherhood to be merely an unfortunate obstacle in the professional life of women, who are at the mercy of the harsh conditions of the labour market, or whether society is able to provide women with the necessary protection. If greater protection for women in the labour market in the context of childbirth and motherhood primarily means an economic burden that European society is not willing to bear, then we need to think about the values of this society. This is a question of society’s priorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Many speakers have understandably referred to the economic impact of extending maternity leave from 14 to 20 weeks. Unfortunately, costs often come up because they are easy to measure. However, benefits, too, can be measured. In fact, one subject which has been well researched quantitatively is the impact of paid maternity leave on prime-age female labour force participation rates (FLFPR). One of the most authoritative econometric studies by the ECB clearly shows that the FLFPR for prime-age women is always on the increase up to 43 weeks of such paid maternity leave. Only beyond that point will the rate be actively affected. For many Member States whose length of maternity leave is close to the legal minimum and, as a consequence, their female participation is low, an increase in paid maternity leave is economically beneficial. For these Member States, the cost of extending maternity leave will be money well invested rather than a burden.</p>

    <intervention id="1-106" speaker_id="96903" name="Paulo Rangel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pt">With regard to these two reports, I would firstly like to congratulate and publicly mention, as I did at the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the remarkable work carried out by my colleagues, Mr Lehne, Mr Swoboda, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mrs Wallis and Mrs Harms, who made up the team of Members of this House that negotiated this framework agreement with the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would also like to mention the great openness and highly constructive spirit of collaboration shown by the President of the Commission and, after the new Commission had taken office, Commissioner Šefčovič and his teams. I believe that a remarkable piece of work has been achieved, and that this has led to an historic agreement that represents the first framework agreement following the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon, and the first framework agreement with a direct, explicit basis in the treaties, but specifically on Article 295 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Actually, I would like to say that this agreement creates a highly transparent, greatly dynamic and extremely close association between Parliament and the Commission, and that it essentially represents a compromise: a balance between the respective visions of the two institutions on the new role that falls to each of them following the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that the work carried out by our team was, in fact, very positive, as in this framework agreement, it has managed to give expression to the new competences and the strengthening of powers arising from the Treaty of Lisbon. This applies to the legislative procedure and to programming or planning, especially, to give just two examples, in Parliament’s involvement in the Commission’s programme of work or, for instance, in matters relating to the Commission’s use of ‘soft law’ in Parliament’s legislative powers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, one very important aspect is Parliament’s increased powers of control and monitoring, whether in the details of specifying rules for the election of the President of the Commission and of the latter as a body, or, for instance, where this relates to the involvement of Parliament in issues such as the reshuffling or the possible removal of a commissioner, or, to take another example, hearings for directors of regulatory agencies or even the monitoring of international negotiations. In all of these areas, the powers arising from the Treaty of Lisbon have been confirmed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Access to information is also very important, particularly when it relates to classified or confidential information, and, moreover, the very exchange of information and points of view between the leaders of Parliament and those of the Commission. For example, we know that these days, it is already possible for the Commissioner responsible for Constitutional Affairs and the President of the Commission to participate in the relevant parts of the Conference of Presidents, or that there are various platforms for direct dialogue between the Conference of Presidents, the Conference of Committee Chairs, the President of Parliament, the President of the Commission and the College of Commissioners. Even the Commission’s presence in Parliament has also been strengthened, especially through the implementation of question time, not only for the President of the Commission, but also for the commissioners.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In view of this, I would like to say, with deep respect for the Treaty of Lisbon and its new balance of powers, and also with deep respect for the idea of the separation of powers, that here we have a clarifying agreement that will make the Treaty of Lisbon current, active and applicable.</p>

I am very satisfied that the resolution on which you are going to vote on Wednesday recommends that Parliament should endorse the framework agreement. This will successfully bring to a close a process that started almost one year ago with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">On this occasion, I would like to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to Mr Lehne and the whole working party: Ms Diana Wallis, Ms Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, Ms Rebecca Harms, Mr Hannes Swoboda and, of course, our rapporteur, Mr Paulo Rangel. We have been working in a great spirit, with great intensity, and our discussions have been very constructive and, at the same time, very frank.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is evident that Parliament’s increased rights and competences under the new Treaty have an impact in many ways on working relations between our institutions. This was reflected by Parliament’s resolution of 9 February 2010 and by President Barroso’s related statement the same day. It is therefore of great importance that, with the revised framework agreement, our institutions will now get a solid and formally agreed basis for mutual relations and will be able to start implementing all elements of the agreement in daily practice. This revised framework agreement builds on the existing framework agreement from 2005 which, as we have seen, has been a very successful instrument for governing relations between our institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was in this spirit of successful cooperation that we started our negotiations on the revision of the framework agreement in March. I believe that we should all be very satisfied with the outcome. Like your rapporteur, Mr Rangel, I am also of the opinion that this revision is a significant achievement which will deepen the relations between our institutions and offer practical solutions in line with Parliament’s increased competences following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. This is how we are putting the special partnership between the Commission and the European Parliament into practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me single out a few elements which constitute real progress. The agreement sets out rules and a timetable for an intensified and structured dialogue between our institutions that allows Parliament to provide important input when the Commission is preparing its work programmes, as its contribution to Union programming.</p>
      <p sl="en">It sets detailed rules on how the Commission will inform Parliament about the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements. It brings the rules on the provision of classified information to Parliament up to international standards and will thus facilitate informing Parliament, for example, on international negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">It also sets rules to enhance the information provided to Parliament relating to the work of experts advising the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I expect it to enhance our dialogue and coordination with regard to the planning of Parliament’s part-sessions and ensuring the presence of Commissioners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even though the agreement is not yet in force, we have already implemented important elements of it. Let me just mention a few examples related to the preparation of the Commission’s work programme for 2011. On 7 September, President Barroso held his State of the Union address in Parliament, and I attended the Conference of Presidents with information on progress in preparing the Commission’s work programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 7 October, the College and the Conference of Committee Chairs met in the Berlaymont. Furthermore, President Barroso will meet Parliament’s Conference of Presidents again on Wednesday.</p>
      <p sl="en">All this aims at intensifying the political dialogue between our institutions and, from my perspective, we seem to have designed the right instruments for this in our framework agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you all know, the negotiations for the revised framework agreement were long and required a major effort by both institutions in order to arrive at a text that caters for both our institutions’ interests and concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also knew that for a number of aspects in our relations – for example the Union’s programming, introduced by the Lisbon Treaty – we would have to involve the Council too.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Council had chosen not to be part of the negotiations on the revised framework agreement, we have taken care not to pre-empt on issues that need to be agreed with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The negotiators from both sides therefore made sincere efforts to fully respect the balance of the institutions, as defined by the treaties, and the commitment to loyal cooperation between them.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is repeatedly evoked in the agreement and the Commission is, moreover, firmly convinced that the text we arrived at, after sometimes difficult negotiations, does indeed fully respect the rights and competences of each EU institution and stands the test of legal scrutiny.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, there are voices that consider that the framework agreement already goes too far, and the possibility of a legal challenge against the agreement or against specific instances of its implementation cannot be excluded.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, the Commission notes that the motion for a resolution on the adoption of the revised framework agreement will officially set out Parliament’s own interpretation of the agreed text.</p>
      <p sl="en">On some important issues, this interpretation goes beyond the text agreed after sensitive discussions. This concerns notably the provisions regarding informing Parliament about negotiations on international agreements and the inclusion of Members of the European Parliament as observers in the Union’s delegations to international conferences, as well as the definitions and conditions for the application of soft law.</p>
      <p sl="en">When questioning this approach in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the Commission was told that these interpretations were, in fact, intended to put Parliament’s initial objectives on record and that only the text of the framework agreement as such had legal value.</p>
      <p sl="en">To avoid all ambiguity, it is in this sense that the Commission reads Parliament’s interpretation of the text.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission stands firmly by all the commitments that it has made in the agreement, and it intends to apply the agreement following the agreed text. Let me make it clear that the Commission will not be bound by any unilateral interpretation of this framework agreement. The framework agreement text as negotiated will, in practice, give us all necessary possibilities to find solutions in the interests of both Parliament and the Commission without disregarding the rights and interests of other institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this spirit, we will continue to put into practice the special partnership between our two institutions and, at the same time, loyally cooperate with all the institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am looking forward to the signature of the agreement and its successful implementation thereafter.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I joined Parliament 18 years ago now. Then, the European Parliament was a consultative parliament. It was a parliament that did not have any powers.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this process over the past 18 years, we have seen Parliament change from a consultative parliament to a fully colegislative one. Our good friend, Francisco Lucas Pires, who witnessed this process, said that it changed from a deliberative parliament to a legislative parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, the text that we are going to adopt on Wednesday is the culmination of negotiations between the Commission and Parliament on the framework agreement.</p>
      <p sl="es">I confess that when I tell my family that I am going to Strasbourg to take part in the debate on the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission, I have to give them quite a lengthy explanation. This is because, obviously, these things do not exist in national parliaments or at national level, so people do not understand why an agreement has to be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to implement what the treaties say.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, it does have to be done. It has to be done for a very basic reason, which Mr Rangel and Mr Šefčovič have already stated: because we want to be efficient.</p>
      <p sl="es">What the framework agreement is essentially seeking to do is to resolve all the practical obstacles that could arise in terms of legislation, parliamentary control and codes of conduct.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore believe that it is a good blend of European democracy. It is ‘consensual’ democracy rather than the ‘conflictive’ democracy that we have in our countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">In consensual democracy, the intelligent thing to do is to find solutions to any problems that could arise. Therefore, the framework agreement is an instrument for preventing future problems and making what the treaties say a reality. As we have a new treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, it makes sense to implement it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to congratulate Mr Rangel and the team that he led, and the European Commission, because I believe that they have reached a very reasonable agreement. When reading the content of the agreement, one cannot fail to be surprised at the voices being heard in some national parliaments questioning whether it poses a threat to the Council’s powers.</p>
      <p sl="es">For goodness’ sake! The Council is indeed the other colegislator. We do want to legislate, and we are legislating a great deal and successfully with the Council of Ministers. We are colegislators on an equal footing. We do not need to gain any sort of small advantage. What we want is for this to be effective, and I believe that the agreement is going to help to achieve this.</p>
      <p sl="es">Allow me to say, Mr Šefčovič, that you took the bull by the horns – a very bullfighting-related expression in my country – when you said that the interpretation of Articles 6 and 7 of the resolution is Parliament’s interpretation in relation to international agreements and international conferences. I do not believe there is anything strange here. What we are talking about here is Parliament being informed and participating through the Commission and through negotiation, nothing more. What is the purpose? The purpose is for us to know what the Commission has done when we have to adopt it here.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore – and I will finish here Madam President – congratulations to both of you. I believe that this is a good omen: as they would say in Casablanca, ‘the beginning of a beautiful friendship’.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like to echo what has been said by all the speakers so far in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="es">More importantly than the technical difficulties that this agreement might involve, I believe that we are talking about something important, something that we have to consider alongside the reform of the Rules of Procedure that we conducted a few months ago, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This framework agreement and the new Rules of Procedure are two essential elements of the new European democratic structure.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am convinced that, with the reform of the Rules of Procedure and the framework agreement, this new role that Parliament is taking on through the Treaty of Lisbon of being a legislative House is acquiring a basis, a foundation for operating in a reasonable way. This is because – as has already been said – what is important is that this House now has the major role of discussing and agreeing on the new laws for the European Union with the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">In order to do this, we have new Rules of Procedure and a framework agreement that also establishes all the elements that make up our relationship. In this respect, I would like to highlight the importance, for example, of the control functions that this House exercises over the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Šefčovič, I believe that we should ultimately consider a mechanism involving the Commission being present in this House, as provided for in this agreement. For example, it could involve all the Commissioners being present together to answer direct questions. That is what we should do in order to respond immediately and directly to the political relationship that we have.</p>
      <p sl="es">In relation to your interpretation of paragraphs 7 and 8, I would like to say that I understand it. I understand it because it is true that this House does not strictly need to be a party to the negotiations, but you also need to understand that we as Parliament have expressed a wish, an initial position and a future position regarding how this House should relate to international negotiations.</p>

I think that is quite correct because if the Council – which I see is not yet here this evening – had been seriously interested in playing a part in becoming a party to this framework agreement, it could have done so.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a Parliament, we know that as we put Lisbon into effect, we have to exercise our new powers with discretion and responsibility. We are also committed to bolstering the Union’s power in international negotiations through an effective performance by the Commission. Can I stress especially the need for President Barroso to revise the Code of conduct of Commissioners, especially the financial declarations. We were aware of certain frailties that were exposed in the course of Parliament’s approval of the Barroso II Commission.</p>

He has more patience than me. I do not even try to discuss this with my wife, as it is too complicated. I think that the Treaty of Lisbon has turned out to be a sort of blind date, which means that it is not a good or proper thing that we are only just now beginning to define the competences of the individual organs of the Union. It is late, but as the American film has it, ‘better late than never’. Let us not talk about friendship as proposed by Mr Méndez de Vigo.

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I, too, would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the fine work done by Mr Rangel with regard to a number of the sections in the report. The fact that we are obtaining more information from the Commission is certainly progress. The fact that the need for parliamentary control is being emphasised, as well as the need for better mutual cooperation, is also clearly progress.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, in one area – the one that has been the most important both today and in the previous debate – there is reason to express disappointment. This is, of course, the common foreign policy, with regard to which there is nothing to reproach Mr Rangel for, but there is reason to criticise the whole direction that this area has taken since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force. I was a member of the Folketing, the Danish Parliament, when Denmark was lured into saying ‘yes’ to the Treaty of Lisbon on condition that it did not lead to the surrender of sovereignty. We were given the word of all the official EU authorities that there would be no such surrendering of power, and now we can see that the European Parliament is quite clearly taking on a power that was not originally intended in the area of foreign policy. This is deeply regrettable, because very many Europeans, including, surely, the French, the Dutch and the Irish, who had the opportunity to say ‘no’ at one time, entered into this cooperation with the expectation that foreign policy was an area where they would still retain their sovereignty. Now we can see that everything will be dealt with in an interplay between the Commission and the European Parliament, and the Council will be completely cut off. That is extremely regrettable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I shall resist the temptation to reject automatically as insidious or worthless any agreement between two sets of supporters of ‘the project’, as it is called. I shall try to judge it on its merits and demerits.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Parliament’s team have a mission to increase Parliament’s power and influence, and they have had a measure of success. It would be wrong to deny that. They have succeeded in winning equal treatment of the Parliament with the Council, a greater duty for the Commission to consider legislative initiatives from the Parliament, Question Hours with the High Representative, involvement in international negotiations, and much else.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there is another side to this. The Parliament’s equality with the Council must involve a relative reduction in the power of that body, which represents – however badly in the case of my own country – the interests of nation states. Furthermore, the power exercised by Parliament is exercised disproportionately by the leaders of the large political groups and the committee chairmen. The ordinary members of these groups have no more independent power than those of us who are Non-attached Members.</p>
      <p sl="en">The promise of involvement in international negotiations was also in the 2005 agreement, and Parliament has been treated with disdain. We were not told the identity of the overseer in the agreement on the transfer of financial data with the United States, and when members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs asked why there was a perceived need for secrecy, the Member of the Commission refused to answer and either misunderstood or pretended to misunderstand the question.</p>

The proof and tangible confirmation of the constructive interinstitutional dialogue are provided by this agreement which, we trust, will be adopted on Wednesday and ratified immediately afterwards.</p>
      <p sl="it">This agreement certainly gives a boost to the centrality of the role of the European Parliament which was clearly intended by the Treaty of Lisbon, and establishes close cooperation between the institutions; the intense work of the negotiators is certainly heading in this direction. There is no doubt that Parliament puts its faith in the Commission and it must certainly assess, through constant scrutiny, the activities which are introduced for approved programmes and the tangible results which are achieved. The Code of conduct for Commissioners, as well as the requirement to provide information, including confidential information, are welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="it">I do not agree with some amendments which, in my opinion, are not going in the opposite direction, even if, overall, they are consistent to a certain degree with the intended design of the agreed text. I am likewise convinced that, through this report, it is possible to legislate better and make better impact assessments with regard to individual legislative proposals. At the same time, relations should be strengthened with national parliaments, who are the mirror image of these activities.</p>
      <p sl="it">The work carried out with regard to the agencies is welcomed and I am convinced that the primacy of politics also depends on a greater willingness on the part of the Directorates-General of the Commission to cooperate with Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am glad to see that the new framework agreement represents a significant improvement in, and deepening of, relations with the Commission, and the special partnership reflects the new power of the European Parliament under the Lisbon Treaty. As a result of excellent work within the Commission and the working party, the practical solutions included in the proposed revised agreement bring major improvements in legislative procedure and planning, parliamentary scrutiny, obligations to provide information, and the Commission's presence in Parliament. Welcome Commissioner Šefčovič!</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me draw your attention to two points in particular. I consider the involvement of Parliament in international negotiations a major step forward, facilitating Parliament’s consent and giving more predictability to the procedure. In my view, one of the most important elements is the follow-up of legislative initiative requests from Parliament. I welcome the development that the Commission undertakes to report on the concrete follow-up given to any legislative initiative requests within three months of its adoption; the Commission shall come forward with a legislative proposal after one year at the latest or include the proposal in the next year’s work programme. If the Commission does not submit a proposal, it shall give Parliament a detailed explanation of the reasons.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the rapporteur on the European citizens’ initiative, I hope that the follow-up of citizens’ requests will also be handled with equally proper respect.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this framework agreement on the relationship between the Commission and this House introduced by the Lisbon Treaty – in reality, the EU Constitution – is said to bring about a more democratic governmental process. In truth, it is nothing but an illusion of democracy where none exists.</p>
      <p sl="en">The following points are important. Lisbon has no democratic or moral authority in the UK, where the British people have been cheated by the ruling political class from giving their verdict on the treaty. The so-called changes in this agreement will in no way diminish the power and activity of the unelected and unaccountable Commission supported by this compliant House. In practice, the business of the EU will continue, as it always has done, in back rooms and behind closed doors.</p>
      <p sl="en">In due course, the recommendation will be to vote resolutely against these proposals since we do not, and will not, recognise Lisbon unless and until it has been submitted to the British people for their decision. That is real democracy.</p>

      <p sl="sk">(I am very pleased that we are able to discuss the revised framework agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission at today’s meeting. This revision corroborates and gives tangible form to the stronger position of the European Parliament after the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon. Today, I would personally like to highlight the agreement concluded between the Commission and the working party of the European Parliament on the framework agreement, and thank you, Mr Vice-President, for your personal involvement.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Allow me to make a few comments with regard to the framework agreement. The stronger position of the European Parliament makes for a more democratic European Union. As the elected representatives of the citizens of the Member States, we will participate in the adoption of European legislation and will have greater control over the Commission. The Commission will, for example, be obliged to submit reports to us on the concrete follow-up provisions adopted for any legislative initiative request. The Commission will be equally obliged to ask us for approval in the event that it intends to change the Code of conduct for Commissioners. We also definitely welcome the fact that on the basis of the treaty, the European Parliament will be better and more transparently informed about the conclusion of international agreements. The aforementioned provisions are not the only ones; the revised framework agreement contains many more similar provisions and I firmly believe that they will all lead towards more effective and closer cooperation between both institutions, and that they will represent a coherent implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In conclusion, I would like to highlight a key area: the timely cooperation of Parliament on requests ensuing from the European citizens’ initiative is a significant provision which, pursuant to the agreement, will guarantee close contact between the European Parliament and citizens.</p>

The specific result naturally forms the basis of our cooperation, and while the interpretation given by Mr Rangel is perhaps somewhat extensive, it allows us to remain focused on our goals.</p>
      <p sl="de">What remains now is not just the openness and transparency between our two bodies, but also the need to convince the Council – which is not present – that if we work well together, it does not necessarily have to be at the expense of the Council. Unfortunately, the Council sometimes behaves like a child who has had a toy taken away and is now upset and affronted. Instead of feeling affronted and threatening complaints, the Council should work with us to achieve what is best for the citizens of our continent.

However, few of us are aware of the radical change that it brings about, particularly in the field of trade policy, which I follow closely.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament will ratify all international trade agreements. This is already causing quite a stir, and the discussions on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and on the free trade agreement with Korea are merely a first sign of this. However, the socialists and democrats in the Committee on Trade wanted to go further than the treaty allows. I am their spokesperson, and despite the scepticism of some and the opposition shown by certain others, I conveyed a clear message: if Parliament is to ratify any trade agreement, it must be involved from the start of the process. What used to seem idealistic is now a core element of our relations with the Commission, since we will be fully consulted on the negotiating mandates. I welcome this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to continue to respect the Community spirit and the democratic will that are at the heart of the treaty.

However, the point which I am most eager to highlight is the progress made with respect to the interinstitutional aspect of international relations.</p>
      <p sl="it">The role given to Parliament should not be considered as strengthened: it is a requirement. We hope that no one casts doubt on allowing the presence of European Parliament observers at multilateral and bilateral international conferences as anything but an act of responsibility. Indeed, denying the status of observer to Members of the European Parliament in bilateral agreements, such as, for example, fisheries agreements, prevents, de facto, full knowledge of the area being negotiated, upon which Parliament will subsequently be required to express its opinion.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that it is not possible to do without these preconditions, as otherwise we would end up with Parliament rejecting bilateral agreements which, by definition, cannot be amended and which, in the absence of a partnership, would make the vote a mere formality.</p>

I welcome the fact that the agreement allows for more detailed impact studies and a better response by the Commission to the political requirements of the European Parliament. It is particularly important for the Commission to actually improve Members’ access to documents, including proposals for international agreements. This has already been said here. Their ratification cannot merely be a formality, as is often the practice in the national parliaments.

The mutual agreement on joint procedures will certainly help prevent possible misunderstandings when making joint decisions. However, the European Union is constituted on the basis of agreement by nation states which passed on to us – the European Parliament as well as the European Union – part of their competences. Therefore, the Treaty of Lisbon has, in certain matters, brought with it the obligation to cooperate with national parliaments. The correct form of this cooperation ought to be the next step when defining cooperation within the European Union. This is what I would like to ask for, Commissioner.</p>

I therefore feel that huge shortcomings still remain in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="de">The flow of information between the Commission, on the one hand, and Parliament, on the other, also needs to be strengthened in the area of international relations.

      <p sl="hu">According to biblical wisdom, good trees yield good fruit and bad trees yield bad fruit. The Treaty of Lisbon was signed under dictatorial circumstances, which means that it cannot have any democratic consequences. It has been forced upon nation states, at least upon Hungary, my native land, under expressly dictatorial and anti-democratic circumstances, as it is a treaty that took away from people several decision-making powers concerning their own destiny, behind their back and over their head, and handed them over to Brussels. By virtue of natural law, the Treaty of Lisbon is obviously invalid, at least in relation to Hungary, firstly, because of a failure to discuss and reconcile this greatly significant treaty with the people, the public and various civil organisations, and secondly, because it was passed without having any idea about the content of the text. So much for the democratic consequence of this dictatorial treaty.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first I would like to thank all the speakers, especially those who voiced support for the framework agreement, because I think it is really a very important manual on how we could cooperate and work together better in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like once again to underline my gratitude to the working party and the European Parliament team because we spent a lot of time together. We had 11 rounds of very intense negotiations, but this hard work paid off and I think today we can really celebrate an excellent agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, I have listened with great attention to the comments of the honourable Members and to their questions, some of which reflect concerns about the agreement reached.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should therefore first underline that it is an important principle for the Commission that established and successful practices of cooperation between our institutions should be preserved. This means that the revised framework agreement should not lead to any rollback of successful practices. In fact, I expect that applying the framework agreement will, in all cases, lead to clear improvements.</p>
      <p sl="en">That said, both parties acknowledged during the negotiations that they will face difficulties with interpretation, but they also expressed a readiness to implement the revised framework agreement in the most constructive way, and I can assure you that the Commission is committed to doing so.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that practice will show that many of the concerns expressed today will not materialise. Also, some expectations which go beyond the competences that the treaties attribute to each of the institutions will have been corrected. In response to the request from the floor concerning my statement on the Code of conduct, allow me also to confirm that the Commission will soon come forward with a proposal for a revised Code of conduct and, according to the terms of the framework agreement, it will seek Parliament’s opinion in a timely manner, as was promised during the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, let me underline that should we discover any problems, we will sit down together again and seek solutions. In fact, we have already foreseen a review of the framework agreement for the end of 2011, which will give us plenty of opportunities to correct any mistakes which may have been made.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this sense, I am really looking forward to collaborating with you on the basis of this revised framework agreement and I hope and expect that you will support this agreement on Wednesday.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe and I hope that this positive spirit will also prevail in the overall relations between all the institutions of the European Union, because this is what the citizens expect from us and this is what we should deliver.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I would like to make my closing speech based on what has been discussed here during this debate. I would like to conclude by pointing out the following. One of the major objectives of this framework agreement was that in ordinary legislative and budgetary matters, the Council and Parliament would be placed on an equal footing, that is, a parallel position. In relation to other matters, the aim was also to respect the balance of power arising from the Treaty of Lisbon and to respect the principle of separation of powers so as to allow Parliament to better exert its political control outside budgetary and ordinary legislative matters.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that the clarification offered by this framework agreement is good for both institutions. It makes their relationships clearer and more transparent.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Yet it is also good for the other institutions, particularly the Council, because the Council now has a clear basis, with a clear understanding and vision of how it will handle relations between Parliament and the Commission following the improvements made by the Treaty of Lisbon. Therefore, however much the Council might react emotionally or direct criticism towards the framework agreement, the truth is that there will come a time when it will remember that it was a positive step for all the institutions, and a time when we will have a framework agreement made not for two, but ultimately, as the European public wishes, three institutions, all of which represent their view on the letter and spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I welcome the openness shown by the Commission throughout this process.</p>

      <p sl="pl">When we began discussions on the new interinstitutional agreement a year ago, we stressed the point that in view of the strengthening of Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon, the time had come for a new quality in our cooperation with the Commission. I myself said at the time that, of course, Parliament has gained from Lisbon at the expense of the Commission, but that the devil would be in the detail, and how advantageously our negotiators manage to turn the letter of the treaty into specific provisions in the framework agreement would depend on these details. Today, we have these provisions, and we have managed to include the stipulations which we made in the resolution at the February plenary sitting, and for this, congratulations are due to our negotiators and the rapporteur for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Rangel. Let us hope that despite the initial friction between us and the Commission over the interpretation of the provisions which had been negotiated, the agreement will contribute to a more efficient and effective cooperation between our institutions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I shall be fairly brief. I think the oral question is very clear. We are currently working on a PNR package. The Commission has prepared three draft mandates for negotiations with the United States, Canada and Australia. In the meantime, however, the Member States are negotiating bilaterally with the United States about the transfer of personal data, or rather, giving the United States access to European databases, including passenger data.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before this House can take a position on any PNR proposal or any PNR agreement, we need to know what the situation is. If the Member States are agreeing bilaterally with the United States to transfer PNR data, then I wonder what we are doing in this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have also been told – but there is no way of verifying this because the bilateral agreements and the bilateral negotiations are secret – that it may concern PNR data of non-EU citizens or EU citizens on flights with destinations other than the United States, and therefore, they are not covered by a possible EU-US agreement. We need clarification on that before we continue the talks on PNR.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Commissioner, last weekend, I stumbled over another item that we have not been informed about and that might be relevant for this debate. It is a programme called ‘One-Stop Security’ which the Commission is apparently currently negotiating with the United States Transport Security Authority. This would involve the lifting of security checks for US travellers coming to Europe and vice versa.</p>
      <p sl="en">I find it rather strange that the security checks for European citizens travelling to the United States are becoming stricter and stricter – we even have to pay for our ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorisation) submission – and, at the same time, the European Commission is negotiating the lifting of security checks for Americans coming this way.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is about time that the European Commission informs us fully about this programme and about the state of the negotiations, and I would like to know – and I will conclude on that – if it is indeed the case that the United States imposed the security standards which would make this programme possible.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has been mentioned many times today. I should like to say something positive about it for once. Most of our citizens think it is a good thing that we can travel in Europe without borders, that we can move freely about Europe for the purposes of education, work and leisure. However, in so doing, we naturally leave a data trail behind us. For a long time now, our data has not just been stored in one Member State, but is spread throughout the European Union. That is precisely why it is a good thing that we have greater powers at European level in this area – which concerns the protection of data relating to European citizens – because our citizens quite rightly expect their data to be well protected everywhere in Europe and they do not expect large amounts of data to be passed on unnecessarily, possibly even to third countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">How are we, as the European Union – and I will make myself absolutely clear: as the European Parliament and Council; in other words, together with the Member States – supposed to ensure this protection if it is the case that while we, as the European Union, are negotiating with third countries on the forwarding of data – over what data is actually required, the purpose for which it is to be used and the safeguards that are necessary in order to protect this data – at the same time, individual Member States are negotiating with third countries on data? Especially since we do not even know what data they are talking about, what security standards are being maintained, whether duplicate data is possibly being forwarded, or even whether data is being forwarded that we would not allow to be forwarded at European level.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is also another aspect that the Member States are perhaps not taking into sufficient consideration. If a Member State negotiates with a third country, how then can I ensure – how can and will the individual Member State ensure – that only the data of its own citizens is, in fact, forwarded, if any data is forwarded at all? We now have databases within the European Union that collect data on all kinds of citizens at a central point and to which many authorities in European countries have access. In other words, if my data is stored somewhere in country A and country A decides to forward data, will my data also be forwarded to a third country? This cannot be the added value in the European Union that was intended when, for good reason, we negotiated the Treaty of Lisbon. The Member States, too, need to take note of the new balance of power between the institutions, must act accordingly, and must stick to the rules, which state that data protection is a European matter. We need to ensure at European level that as little data as possible is forwarded and only for narrowly defined purposes, and that this is not all undermined by bilateral initiatives.</p>

    <intervention id="1-134" speaker_id="96821" name="Rui Tavares" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on many occasions over the last year, we have discussed various matters relating to data protection and the privacy of European citizens, and we have said that in order to ensure the physical safety of people who travel, for example, by aeroplane, we should protect the personal data of European citizens. This is an exchange that has both legal and political implications that Parliament should carefully consider.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We know that this is like building a house from the roof down: every time we have a problem, we try to solve that problem. First, we had Secure Widespread Identities for Federated Telecommunications (SWIFT), and now Passenger Name Record (PNR). Yet we are failing to build the house from the foundations upwards. In other words, we are not first determining what the general thinking in Europe is on data protection, and then applying it across the board to every matter and every international partner, whether it be the US today, or China, South Korea, or Saudi Arabia in the future: any of the international partners who request this type of data.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Obviously, while working in this fragmented and piecemeal way, we are already dealing with an extremely difficult framework, and Parliament has tried to make sense of this. We all know, however, that things should be quite different. If the situation is already bad, however, it is becoming even worse if reports are confirmed that certain Member States have been negotiating Memoranda of Understanding with the US which allow the direct transfer of data regarding passengers who are travelling from those Member States to the US.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to make clear here that my main complaint is not with the US. The US is one of our international partners; it is a country that has many things to admire and with whom we have common interests. I am, however, complaining about the Member States that are breaking with the negotiations that we should be having at European level. This shows disloyalty on the part of those Member States, and it undermines not only the negotiations which are under way with the US, but also interinstitutional understanding within the EU itself. It also undermines the possibility that we might later reach an agreement with the US – a framework agreement on data protection, for which Mr Albrecht is the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is also the kind of attitude that can have unpredictable effects, because if the US is now negotiating with individual Member States, what is to stop it from later exchanging citizens’ data with individual airlines, or even via a direct approach, dealing with them individually at the time of buying a ticket?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Someone has to stand up and defend the rights of the 500 million European citizens. Parliament has been doing it at this level. It is important that the Commission, the Member States and the US are aware that, in the case of PNR, Parliament has its finger on the button. Moreover, as it has already shown in the case of SWIFT, Parliament is not afraid to use its prerogatives, whether in order to interrupt an interim agreement or to reject a permanent agreement which does not meet the guarantees on data privacy and security concerning European citizens.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-135" speaker_id="96736" name="Jan Philipp Albrecht" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, representatives of the Commission, I urge you to take this question that we have asked extremely seriously, because what we are concerned with here is the fundamental matter – as has just been said – of whether there is any point in working on data protection provisions if, at the same time, agreements are being negotiated behind the back of the European Parliament, and perhaps even behind the backs of the national parliaments, that undermine these standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">Close transatlantic cooperation on security – all transatlantic cooperation – is very important, particularly when it comes to creating an area of freedom and justice. However, we must not allow this to result in collective security interests being asserted while individual freedoms and basic rights are left behind. This applies particularly to data protection in international cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Parliament, we have repeatedly made clear over many years that we consider it important in all these measures – whether it is the forwarding of PNR data or access to SWIFT banking data – that there are generally applicable data protection principles that can also be implemented at an individual level. This is something that is constantly being neglected. For this reason, as Parliament, we have also made it clear that we want to have general standards that are applicable throughout the EU and which are then agreed with the US. I was rapporteur for the EU’s framework agreement with the US and I feel obliged to say that it is highly important that this applies not just to EU agreements by the Member States, but also to Member States’ agreements. It is obvious that this is an area in which powers are shared; in other words, bilateral agreements by Member States with the US will always exist in parallel. There is nothing wrong with that, provided firstly, that these do not result in a lowering or undermining of the standards agreed jointly at European level – which is what this debate is about – and secondly, that they remain within the legal framework in force.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we not only have the situation that the European Parliament has quite rightly been involved in these matters, but we also have a legal framework that states that where powers are shared, then it is the case that if regulations have been passed at EU level – such as for PNR data – then this area is out of bounds to the Member States. In my opinion, the Member States cannot then be allowed to start their own negotiations with the US in this area, because this quite simply undermines our negotiating position on data protection.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore urge you, as the European Commission, to intervene in this matter where the Member States are concerned and to make it clear to the Council Presidency that these negotiations must be halted and that, above all, the legal basis that applies post Treaty of Lisbon must be clarified. It is clear to us, as Parliament, that the EU needs to speak with one voice in the negotiations, and the Commission – whose proposals I consider correct in many cases – should also be told that the following clear principle must apply at all accounts: we must negotiate with one voice only, and not constantly conduct new negotiations on a bilateral basis.</p>

    <intervention id="1-136" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I very much welcome questions from Members of Parliament. I would like to declare from the very beginning that the Commission shares their sensitivities on the protection of the data of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me refer to the issue from the very beginning. You perhaps know that this is not a new issue. In August 2007, the United States modernised the Visa Waiver Programme by adding certain conditions to further enhance security. We have to admit that these conditions affect all EU Member States, whether they are in the US Visa Waiver Programme or not. They provide that, in order for a country to enter or to continue to be in the Visa Waiver Programme, it would need to agree to cooperate with the United States on law enforcement issues. In particular, it would need to exchange law enforcement information.</p>
      <p sl="en">This new law led the EU to follow a twin-track approach, as you have already mentioned. Under the EU track, negotiations started between the EU and the United States regarding certain conditions for access to the US Visa Waiver Programme which fall under EU competence. The EU track dealt with the return policy of all nationals, security of travel documents and airport security. These issues fall under our competence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The bilateral track, which still exists between the US and individual Member States, was used to satisfy the United States’ requirement for cooperation on counter-terrorism initiatives and information sharing. For Member States not yet in the Visa Waiver Programme, concluding agreements on these issues is a pre-condition to be designated as a Visa Waiver Programme country. We have to take care of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">For Member States already in the Visa Waiver Programme, such negotiations would take place at a later stage, so it is much easier for them. According to information the Commission gathered from the Member States, this is the only way to deal with the issue. Eight Member States signed Memoranda of Understanding with the United States stating that they agreed to cooperate with the United States on such matters. These are the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta and Slovakia. This was the problem they were trying to solve. In this way, these eight Member States were able to join the Visa Waiver Programme, which is why they did it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission understands that the Memoranda of Understanding were not intended to be, in themselves, the legal basis for the exchange of data between the United States and the relevant Member States. They merely express the intention of the two parties to have specific arrangements and agreements to govern the exchange of data. This is what they are about.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to underline that information about the precise content of the Memorandum of Understanding is held by the Member States themselves. This includes the categories of data that are covered by them. Therefore, if the European Parliament wants to seek additional information, you have to seek it from the Member States concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the Commission – and I am coming to our responsibility now – has ensured that the United States would not request bilateral arrangements with the Member States on the exchange of PNR data since this was a matter falling within EU competence under the relevant EU-United States PNR agreement. This is what we have done.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, in the negotiations on the EU-US Agreement, there was an exchange of letters to record that the US legal requirements for continued participation in the VWP were satisfied for matters which fall under EU competence. In this context, the Commission made clear that this exchange of letters, which is part of ongoing negotiations, could not provide access to the EU database.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your responses and I must confess that I am perplexed, because on the one hand, the Commission says that if we want more information, we must go and knock on the door of the Member States. This can only be interpreted one way: the Commission says that it has no ability to put pressure on the Member States or to intervene in this matter. On the other hand, however, it then says that the Commission asked the US Government not to request data which undermine access to European databases. I do not understand why the Commission thinks that it is easier to go and ask the US Government instead of establishing contacts with the Member States and the governments of the EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I must confess that there seems to me to be only one explanation for this: it shows that the Commission is in a weak position and means that the concerns that Parliament has expressed on this matter make complete sense. We are primarily concerned with the fact that the US has used a ‘divide and conquer’ strategy, apparently with impunity. Secondly, we are concerned with the fact that several Member States have decided to pursue bilateral relations and negotiations, showing a certain lack of European solidarity. Yet we are also worried about the attitude of resignation and shirking of responsibility on the part of the European institutions, which does not give us any greater power in negotiation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Europe must have a voice on this issue. We must ensure that there is no access to databases through bilateral agreements. Moreover, the cloak of secrecy that surrounds these negotiations, the fact that certain representatives from the Member States or national parliaments have revealed the contents of Memoranda of Understanding, and the fact that this Parliament continues to lack information on this issue, are fundamental reasons to back up our concern, and this has not been resolved by the answers that the Commission has just given.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to express my great thanks to the Commissioner, who is answering this question on behalf of her colleague, Mrs Malmström. We very much appreciate your doing so. To be honest, however, I think we are not working from the same facts. The essence of this is not just about the use of DNA databases. My fellow Members have avoided mentioning that explicitly: the requesting of DNA data, the requesting of fingerprints, the requesting of data on criminal convictions – and all via the system that we created with the Prüm Convention. Where that is concerned, we are talking about an elementary part of European policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Quite honestly, that is not really what concerns me here. That is something we can talk about, we can have an exchange on it, we can find and debate ways and means if we consider it right to do so. What annoys me is that neither the Council nor the Commission has the backbone to tell the US that its behaviour is not acceptable. You cannot use the Visa Waiver Programme to blackmail Member States – in this case Austria, hardly a new Member State – by saying: we will take away your visa waiver if you are not prepared to give us this data. What is interesting to note is that a Member State of the European Union cannot unilaterally withdraw its visa waiver from the US – in response, so to speak – because our agreement states that it is the EU as a whole that grants the visa waiver. What annoys me is the tone, and that nobody has the backbone to stand up and say that while we want to work with you and have a transatlantic partnership, in any good relationship – just as in any good marriage – good manners and respect are an important part of making it work. That is precisely what we expect from our relationship with the people of the US and with US policy, and we would like the Commission and the Council to place greater emphasis on this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as soon as the SWIFT agreement had been negotiated, it became clear that what had been sold to us as data protection was, in fact, an embarrassing case of Europeans having pulled the wool over their own eyes. Now my opinion has become official: the EU’s own monitoring system has not – as I suspected – turned out to be a placebo, a sedative for critics, within the space of a few years, but rather after just a few months.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is clear that the US does not give a fig about agreements. Once again, the US has shown that it is not interested in partners, but at best only in states that say yes and amen to every omnipotent act of the almighty US. We have had to grit our teeth and acknowledge that for years, the US has been eagerly helping itself to European banking data, and that when we then insisted on European standards of data protection in an agreement and appointed an EU monitoring system, the US was happy to agree to this because it could still have untrammelled access to data via the bilateral back door.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to endorse what one of the previous speakers said. We greatly appreciate your coming here personally and making a statement. I realise that this is not your specialist area. However, I feel bound to state that the Commission’s statement is extremely unsatisfactory. Something has happened here to which I really must draw your attention.</p>
      <p sl="de">All the main groups in this House want to discuss the principle. We are appalled, to put it mildly, that the Commission is not taking action. It was the same with SWIFT. At the last plenary session, we had to make the Commission aware of the USD 14 entry fee. Today, a fellow Member has quite rightly asked: What is the Commission doing? What are the Member States doing? Now I hear that there are even discussions on giving Americans preferential treatment over Europeans!</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to state quite clearly that we want to have a very serious discussion with the Commission on the fundamentals. The fundamentals include reciprocity at least. It means that rather than allowing access to European data, such data must be retrieved under a push procedure. These are principles that are now even more warranted; likewise, citizens’ rights – namely that the citizen has a right to know what data about him is being used where, and how it is being used, and naturally, this should be based on a European concept. What we are hearing today is that the Commission is actually weakening our negotiating position with the US by not going to the Member States and coordinating this, and secondly, by not taking action itself.</p>
      <p sl="de">When will the negotiations start? When is action going to be taken? In the case of SWIFT, pressure from Parliament resulted in this suddenly being done within a month. We need to see the same kind of action in respect of PNR and data in general.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Although it is necessary to fight terrorism vigorously and with all means available, it is not possible, in the context of international cooperation in this area, to circumvent the democratic standards which operate in the nations of the transatlantic area. I am therefore very disappointed that in the latest case of bilateral contractual relations between the Union and the US, the Commission and the Member States have not learned the lessons from past mistakes, and are making deals behind the backs of the European Parliament and the national parliaments. Because of the rapid agreement, which seems to be more tailored to the needs of the American pre-election campaign, they call legitimacy, transparency and democratic control into question. Furthermore, all of this comes at a time when the US has imposed a fee on the visa waiver scheme for the Union, which was signed on the basis of European public opinion. Personally, I do not have a problem with transferring selected personal data on European citizens, such as air passengers, to developed democratic countries, but it must take place in accordance with all legal provisions in a way that can be examined by an independent body, such as Members of Parliament or judges.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Transfer of data about the citizens of the Member States of the European Union as regards the United States is justified particularly by our counter-terrorism efforts and our joint interest in the safety of our citizens. This is certainly a noble cause, but at times, I have the feeling that in the name of the war on terror, we are increasingly depriving our citizens of their privacy. I have no wish to devalue the negotiations between the European Union and the US, and I remain convinced that the US is our closest ally. On the other hand, the mere fact that the US negotiates both individually and bilaterally with the Member States and not solely with the European Union as a whole already speaks for itself.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In conclusion, I would like to support those Member States that have already concluded a memorandum. This happened because these particular countries had had visa-based relationships with the United States, and because the European Union was not acting as one, those countries had no other choice but to sign the bilateral memoranda. However, I believe that in future, the European Union will take a more prominent role as opposed to the individual Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I firmly believe that we must continue our efforts to counter terrorism which continues to represent a great danger to the civilised world.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, the handling of the personal data of travelling Europeans under the pretext of counter-terrorism prevention appears to be uncoordinated and unorganised. It is the United States that is the main collector of personal data, collecting data relating to European Union citizens both on the basis of agreements with the European Union and on the basis of bilateral agreements made with individual countries. I believe that this twin-track approach should no longer be tolerated. We should amend the handling of personal data relating to EU citizens in such a way as to prevent the right to personal data protection being violated by some semi-legal procedures of the Member States. In our relationship with the US, we must therefore apply reciprocity and painstakingly ensure that the rules are acceptable to us Europeans too, and that European data or the data of EU citizens are shared in accordance with the rules that are in force in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Any data protection process or any procedure violating fundamental data protection interests must be related to a clearly identifiable aim and should have the ability to achieve that justifiable aim. What exactly, according to the US, is the justifiable aim, and how will the transfer of personal data be able to achieve that aim? In other words, how are they going to use these data? That is my first question to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to ask why they use two different levels of scrutiny – one for the ‘old’ Member States and one for the ‘newer’ Member States, including my own country, Hungary. Why would a Hungarian citizen be more dangerous from the point of view of terrorism than any citizen from the ‘older’ Member States? Did this issue arise during the negotiations, or is it going to be an issue?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for allowing me to ask for clarification on two points.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was rather surprised to hear the Commission say that the issue of the Visa Waiver Programme affects the Member States only – at least I think that is what you said, Commissioner. Back in 2007, the European Commission initially said that it had exclusive competence in that area, and it eventually had to cede competence to the Member States. Am I correct in thinking that the European Commission has now changed its views on its own competences?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, Commissioner, you say that there is no reference in any of the MOUs to the transfer of PNR data. Well, I can give you a copy of one of the MOUs that mentions PNR. Does that indicate that the Commission itself does not even know what is going on?</p>
      <p sl="en">Now I will clarify something for you, Madam Commissioner. This Parliament has decided to postpone the vote on two PNR agreements because we felt that we could trust the Commission to be equally responsible as an EU institution as we are at the European Parliament. I am beginning to wonder whether the Commission deserves that trust. I hope you will not disappoint us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that I find this discussion very interesting and that I am here to give explanations to you, but I cannot accept the claims that the Commission is not sensitive about protecting the data of EU citizens, nor can I accept the claim that I am here just to replace my colleague, without knowledge of the issue or of what is happening. We all know very well in the Commission – very well indeed – what is happening and I can tell you that we really are sensitive about protecting the data of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us come to facts now: do we have to respect the Lisbon Treaty or not? What is your proposal? To ignore the Council? I have heard you say, in a very easy way, that you would like the European voice to be unique on this issue. I agree with you: I would also like that.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what do you prefer? To tell the Commission to ignore the Council completely? I would like to inform you – and I am talking about facts here, not dreams – that we have already asked the Council, as you are well aware, for this is not something new. We proposed to the Council last May that if the future EU-US framework has any reference to personal data, this should also apply to the data of Member States. We proposed what you have all talked about here.</p>
      <p sl="en">If it is agreed, then we will go for it. This is the case. But if it is not agreed with the Council, what do you propose we do? Do we go to the Member States and say that we cannot go any further? I understood that such is your proposal and my reply is very simple: we have to respect the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, moving on to some other very interesting issues: I have heard a lot about the European database and about the Prüm database. My answer is that if the Member States have Memoranda of Understanding and bilateral agreements, they may be able to give data on their own nationals. They cannot give data from the EU database or the Prüm database and I was very clear on that point. I was also very clear that we have asked the United States – and we have sent letters and are still negotiating on this – to agree that the bilateral agreements cannot refer to PNR data. This is not to say that Member States may not have tried to negotiate with the United States, but this is the position of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand your concerns very well, but we have to move forward to negotiate in a better way – the best way – with the United States and try to have some binding rules for the Member States within this agreement, because that is the only way to achieve exactly what you want to achieve. That is the way we can do things, so the Commission is going in that direction: we are now negotiating with the United States and we are trying to have an agreement that is binding on the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why we have gone to the Council and said: please be sure that, if this is agreed and if we can protect the data in our track – the track between the EU and the United States – then you have to do the same. Do you have any other proposal based on the legal framework that we have to respect? If so, I am very willing to hear of it. If there is no such proposal, however, please understand that we, too, are very sensitive about citizens’ data and are trying to protect them, but we also try to respect the Member States and to respect the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">This issue is ongoing. I hear all your concerns and I will try to take them all on board. What the Commission can do is go to the Council and say stop talking with any other country. What we can say is that we are going to negotiate and afterwards try to bind them to our track. This is the way we can do things.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Madam Commissioner, allow me simply, because I have knowledge of the issue, to underline that virtually every political group in this Chamber has expressed major concerns, as you have heard. We do have a PNR agreement being re-negotiated and coming through. It is extremely important to this Parliament that the Commission takes these concerns very seriously and that we do not have the sense of disconnect that we had, for example, with the SWIFT agreement.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We have also pointed out in the recent past in these discussions the grey areas that are very dangerous. For example, if every Member State were to give to a third country the data that it places in European databases – let us say Schengen – you might end up having the third country collecting all the data in the Schengen database. Although it does not get it from Schengen, it gets it individually from each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In that sense, as you very correctly mentioned, we are grateful for the forcefulness with which the Commission is protecting the Community pillar of this situation. Allow me as well to ask you to make sure that this gets done in the best possible way.</p>

      <p sl="en">In the Commission, we are trying to find legal ways that respect the treaties to solve this problem, to protect data, and to try and enhance the Community pillar of this situation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The convention which I have the honour of presenting was signed in Ottawa in 1978 and came into force on 1 January 1979. The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, NAFO for short, was created under the convention in order to support the conservation and optimum utilisation of fish stocks and to support international cooperation. The contracting parties adopted amendments to it at NAFO annual meetings in 2007 and 2008. This document introduces fundamental changes to the convention, the principal aim being to bring its wording into line with other conventions at a regional level and with international instruments, and to incorporate modern concepts of fisheries management. The organisational structure has been updated, a clear division of responsibilities between the contracting parties, flag states and port states has been introduced, a more coherent decision-making process has been created, the system for contributions to the NAFO budget has been reformed and a mechanism for settling disputes which may arise between contracting parties has been provided.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the light of the fisheries rights granted to the European Union under the convention, ratification of the proposed changes lies in the interests of the European Union. As a result, we should agree to ratify the changes to the convention. Having said this, I would like to emphasise, clearly and precisely, a few problems which have surfaced during ratification at this time. Firstly, the contracting parties adopted changes at a NAFO annual meeting in 2007, and an English version was produced. In 2008, a French version was produced, but the COM document, being the Commission’s proposal on transposition into Community law, is dated 8 March 2010. This means that work on the document has taken over two years. Such a delay is unacceptable and should not be repeated in the future. Rapid decision making is a necessary condition for the efficient functioning of the Union. Three institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, must find an appropriate solution to avoid delaying the procedure and to realise one of the main aims of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is to simplify and accelerate the decision-making process. The current case which has been presented for ratification is proof that something is still wrong and action needs to be taken urgently to rectify the situation. Secondly, I would like to remind you that the Treaty of Lisbon came into force in December 2009. In the context of these newly acquired rights, the Committee on Fisheries and the European Parliament should be properly represented during any subsequent negotiations on future international conventions. In 2007 and 2008, the European Parliament was not represented, for obvious reasons. Our institution is, however, ready to ratify the agreement within the framework of its competences, but at the same time, the Council and Commission should be reminded of the new procedural requirements and the necessity of complying with the new powers of the European Parliament.</p>

    <intervention id="1-154" speaker_id="1993" name="Carmen Fraga Estévez" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, allow me to express my gratitude to the Council and the Commission for arriving at this excellent agreement at first reading, and I would particularly like to thank the legal services of all three institutions for their cooperation and help in resolving the problems arising from the new committee procedure following the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that we have reached a good compromise, especially as it represents significant progress compared with the current situation, although, as in any compromise, we have all had to make concessions and be flexible, in what has been an especially complex task, as the Commission proposal arrived before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This meant that at the same time, it had to be adapted to the new situation, in particular, to Articles 290 and 291 of the treaty, relating to delegated acts and implementing acts.</p>
      <p sl="es">As this is a transposition into EU legislation of recommendations issued by a regional fisheries organisation, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) in this case, but which will be followed by many others, Parliament’s objective was fundamentally to establish a mechanism which would enable the transpositions to take place as quickly as possible, preventing internal bureaucratic delays from preventing us from responding correctly to our international obligations, as has been the case so far.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, the new wording of Article 48, following the compromise reached with the Council on the subsequent amendments to this regulation, will enable the Commission both to comply with the obligations imposed by the NEAFC and to adapt to new recommendations that may arise in the future, through the delegation of powers.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is true that the Commission wanted it to be possible to revise all the articles in the proposal through delegated acts, and the compromise agrees that this will be the case for the majority of the articles, except in areas such as the recording of catches, tranships, inspections or monitoring of infringements: in other words, fundamentally matters relating to control and supervision, which will remain outside the framework of the ordinary legislative procedure.</p>
      <p sl="es">In any case, Commissioner, Parliament commits to amending this procedure if it is shown that the inclusion of these aspects within the scope of the ordinary legislative procedure could endanger compliance with the European Union’s obligations and, especially, those of the Commission, as a contracting party to the regional fisheries organisation.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is why we consider that this compromise represents a significant step forward, not only in relation to this specific proposal, but in order to lay the foundations for future discussions between the Council, the Commission and Parliament on fisheries policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission urges Parliament to give its consent to the approval of amendments to the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries, known collectively as the Amendment to the NAFO Convention.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Mr Wałęsa for his helpful work on this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">This amendment revises the convention to bring it more into line with other regional conventions and international instruments. It incorporates modern concepts of fisheries management; it streamlines the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) structure; and it introduces a clear definition of the responsibilities of contracting parties, flag states and port states and a more coherent decision-making process.</p>
      <p sl="en">It modernises the contribution formula for the NAFO budget and provides for a mechanism to settle disputes between contracting parties.</p>
      <p sl="en">This thorough amendment will help the EU fulfil its international obligations on sustainable fisheries and further the objectives of the treaty. Speedy ratification of the amendment is in the EU’s interest and I therefore commend it to the House.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would turn now to the second report, on the scheme of control and enforcement applicable in the area covered by the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the North-East Atlantic Fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Ms Fraga Estévez for her work on this report. I am pleased to see the very strong support from the Committee on Fisheries on the substance of this important proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">The implementation of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) scheme of control and enforcement is indeed a key measure to help us manage fishery resources in the Atlantic region and to get rid of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I must point out that the Commission is not entirely happy with the package deal made between Parliament and the Council during their trialogue with the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am, indeed, disappointed by certain results, in particular, on Article 48, dealing with the procedure for amendments to the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has been seeking more sufficient delegated powers for transposing future amendments to the scheme. Let me explain why – and I would like you to be attentive because we will have the same problems in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the European Union needs to implement this scheme fully because it is our international obligation under the NEAF Convention to do so. Under this convention, amendments normally become binding for us 80 days after adoption. So we have 80 days to implement them. I am really concerned that the limited powers delegated to the Commission by the colegislators may hinder the timely transposition of the amendments into EU law. This is the reality and this is an answer to Mr Wałęsa’s concerns about the timetable.</p>
      <p sl="en">While it will not be my responsibility to endorse the arrangement, I would like you to be aware of the problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ultimately, we need to avoid turning the transposition of NEAFC measures into a modern version of the myth of Sisyphus. As matters stand, measures adopted by the NEAFC last year will have been transposed by the time the package deal is finally adopted, but next month, NEAFC will most likely adopt new amendments requiring effective transposition into EU law early in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will therefore need more time for this.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission therefore considers this regulation to be without prejudice to any future position of the institution as regards the use of Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union for the transposition of Regional Fisheries Management Organisation measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission furthermore reserves the right to propose amendments to the regulation, increasing the number of measures which should be adopted by delegated or implementing acts.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will do this if transposition through the ordinary legislative procedure leads to delays which would compromise our duty to comply with international obligations.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, I would like once again to thank Ms Fraga Estévez and Mr Wałęsa for their reports and the Committee on Fisheries for its work on these important issues.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to speak primarily about the report by Mrs Fraga Estévez. It is a report on which we are voicing our opinion today and which is of paramount importance for the strengthening of controls in the North-East Atlantic and for the European Parliament’s role as colegislator on matters relating to the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, one of the priorities of Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries is to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, which directly affects our fishermen and our European fishing industries. They are, in fact, victims of the unfair competition of an underground fishing industry. Illegal ship-owners exploit underpaid crews and sell fishery products at very low prices. Their failure to comply with the law of the sea, the International Labour Organisation conventions and the IUU Regulation of 1 January 2010 means that European ship-owners are now uncompetitive due to the labour costs they have to bear. We want upwards harmonisation of the rules and working conditions applicable to fishing carried out in the European Union by third countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">European fishermen also respect strict management and control rules that allow for the preservation of resources and the sustainable development of European fisheries, but these rules must not penalise our fishermen in relation to those who fail to respect them. I therefore call for the controls to be strengthened and the penalties against this illegal fishing to be properly applied.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this connection, I congratulate our Chair on her report, which points out that the control scheme adopted by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) must be transposed into European law without delay; more specifically, I welcome the introduction of the programme promoting compliance by non-contracting party vessels. This report also clarifies the scope of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome the addition in an annex of three statements laying down the conditions for implementing delegated acts, which enable the Commission’s implementing powers to be monitored and the institutional balance to be maintained.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would point out that Parliament as legislator must be entirely free to act on matters pertaining to delegation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we are able to adopt a regulation that represents one more small step towards our shared goal of sustainable fisheries. The regional fisheries organisations are extraordinarily important institutions for good management worldwide. Unfortunately, the negotiations are often difficult and progress much too slow for impatient people such as me. We must therefore do all we can to strengthen the regional fisheries organisations.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will now comment on the specific outcome of the NEAFC report. I believe that the new port state control ruling in the NEAFC and the new measures to prevent illegal fisheries are very much to be welcomed. Nonetheless, we had to conduct intensive negotiations with the Council and Commission on matters that seem extremely technical at first glance, but which are important for our future work. I think we have found a compromise that is acceptable to all parties in the matter of delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also succeeded in reaching agreement on how future NEAFC decisions are to be transposed into EU law. It is no secret, however, that the Commission is not very happy with the result achieved here. I can understand that. We cannot allow it to take years for the European Union to implement NEAFC decisions. In this respect, Council and Parliament must together prove that we are able to conclude a codecision procedure quickly where necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to say something about a matter that is very current: the dispute with Iceland over mackerel fishing. We already have the NEAFC, which governs the international waters of the North-East Atlantic. In the case of migratory species such as mackerel, however, we also need an agreement that applies in territorial waters. As you know, that is still a sticking point. I feel it is extremely regrettable that, despite the cooperation working in the main, there is so much dispute over this. How about giving the regional fisheries organisations authority for coastal waters – at least for migratory species? It would be a radical step, of course, but undoubtedly one worth considering.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries established a very important organisation: the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, or NAFO. Its aim is the conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources in the Northwest Atlantic. The convention has since been amended and brought more into line with other regional conventions. Modern concepts such as stock management have been incorporated. I feel it is important that the structure of the organisation is streamlined and that the obligations of the contracting parties are clearly defined. It is also good that the possibility of resolving conflicts through a dispute settlement procedure is provided. The fishing possibilities accruing to the European Union under the convention are of great interest to the EU. Parliament should give its approval under the new powers granted to it by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Fraga Estévez and Mr Wałęsa, for the reports we have discussed today.</p>
      <p sl="en">The North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) is a very important regional fisheries organisation – or RFMO – for Europe and for ecosystems in the North Atlantic. An independent review of the NEAFC’s performance was positive overall, something which is not always the case for RFMOs. Even though the NEAFC is performing better than other RFMOs, the status of the main fish stocks in the convention area is at a critical point. For economic and social aspects, the performance cannot be evaluated, which leads to huge uncertainties as to whether or not the Convention’s objective of optimal utilisation is met. However, improvements in monitoring control and surveillance establishments and enforcement of blacklists for IUU vessels and port state measures are important accomplishments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another result of the evaluation was the establishment of a dispute resolution mechanism, but it has taken far too long for the EU to transpose this into legislation. These measures were adopted by the NEAFC as early as 2006 and have only now entered into force. The EU must be better prepared to respond to new developments and to live up to international responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Combating illegal fisheries is of increasing importance. In some fisheries, 30% of the catch is illegal. On a global scale, 11 to 26 million tonnes of fish, worth an estimated USD 23 billion, are landed illegally each year. This is equivalent to about one-fifth of the global reported catch. Illegal fisheries undermine sustainable fisheries management particularly, but not only, on the high seas and in coastal waters of developing countries. They also have substantial environmental, social and economic consequences.</p>
      <p sl="en">The entry into force of the control regulation and the IUU regulations are important tools for the EU. In the CCAMLR (Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources) area, IUU operators have been shown to respond to management measures aimed at reducing IUU by changing fishing grounds, ports, landings and flag states. This adaptive capacity has resulted in an arms race between IUU operators and fisheries management bodies at national and international level. Compliance mechanisms in an RFMO can lead to IUU vessels changing fishing grounds. IUU vessel operators now routinely keep changing flag states – or ‘flag hopping’. This is something that the EU has to address.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU needs to go further. Cooperation between RFMOs is essential, but we should also take the initiative of drawing up a global register of fishing vessels, including all support vessels, which clearly shows the beneficial owner of a vessel. The EU must take greater responsibility in addressing IUU fishing globally.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the context of inspections, it should, however, be pointed out that there is no uniform system of distributing quotas or reporting catches by individual Member States. The analyses which have been presented prove that the Commission itself does not have the know-how in this field, and on more than one occasion, the opinions presented by representatives of the Commission have been contradictory. At the same time, regional advisory agencies do not have the know-how either. It is worth reminding everyone of the tragic situation of the herring population in the Western Baltic. There have been investigations into the reasons for the crisis since 2004. No reasonable explanation has been found as yet. It is incomprehensible that the problem of overproduction of fish meal and fish oil has been omitted.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The issue of the Fisheries Control Agency in Vigo which, in certain cases, has presented inspection reports subjectively, as in the case of the Eastern Baltic, should be considered. The inspection of industrial fishing units is also mired in controversy. However, a fundamental issue now is the construction of the northern pipeline, in the case of which fishermen have to stand up for their due rights and reclaim lost benefits on their own. All this forces us to carry out a more thorough analysis which should be incorporated in a future common fisheries policy, and every report should fulfil this policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, you are indeed having a busy evening since we have already met in the Fisheries Committee. Firstly, I want to offer my thanks to the rapporteurs for these reports and to reiterate the comments of many colleagues here tonight about their concern over the delay in progressing these matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I really want to use this opportunity in the House to turn to fisheries agreements in a more general way and to stress the need for cooperation from all of those parties to these agreements. This was outlined by the Commissioner when she indicated that agreements require the exercise of responsibility from all those involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, imagine you have just made a multi-million pound investment in a new state-of-the-art factory which annually produces a high value product from a renewable and sustainable resource to the highest internationally recognised standards. Then your neighbour decides to tear up that international agreement and unilaterally declare that they are massively extending their share of the natural resource that your business depends upon. This is exactly what has happened with mackerel and, in particular, one fishing family from Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, I refer to the Coastal States Agreement between the EU, Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Commissioner, we have already heard you and we appreciate the strong stand that you have been taking on this particular issue. We want to recognise your efforts on behalf of these fishermen, but we also want to urge both Parliament and the Commission to stand strong with you as you continue to negotiate a resolution to what is becoming a very difficult and a very fraught situation.</p>

    <intervention id="1-162" speaker_id="96668" name="Seán Kelly" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, there are three speakers from Ireland here this evening: Mrs Dodds, who has spoken; Pat the Cope, who is speaking shortly; and myself. Between the three of us, we represent almost the entire fishing community of the island of Ireland. Fishing has been very important to our country for many years. We have wonderful coastal communities that are dependent on fishing, but, as I have said here before, I have never encountered more disillusionment amongst any group of people than I have among those fishermen. This is a result of quotas, illegal fishing, lack of traceability from fish to fork and, in particular, over-zealous regulation, draconian penalties and being undercut by fish imports of dubious quality and dubious origin.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thankfully, the rapporteurs have addressed some of these issues here this evening. I particularly welcome the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Convention’s proposed ban on frozen fish being landed at European ports without ratification by the flag state of the foreign vessel. That is a very important matter and I hope it will be implemented with the same zeal with which we implement our own regulations affecting our own fishing communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteurs pointed out that it is important for Parliament to maintain its prerogative to scrutinise future amendments to the convention, but it is equally important that the Commission and Parliament work closely together to get the best possible benefits for our coastal communities, which are largely our fishing communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we should not miss this opportunity to look at all the possibilities open to us for developing aquaculture. There are far too many fish being imported into the European Union which we could actually be producing ourselves. There is certainly a great opportunity to develop aquaculture in these times of economic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Damanaki for being here and to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Wałesa and Mrs Fraga.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mrs Fraga’s report is the result of the recommendations on the control scheme adopted by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) in 2006, although the Convention was drawn up in 1982, and it redefines the rules for control and enforcement for vessels in the Convention areas. Mrs Fraga’s report is the legal framework included in the proposal for a regulation to apply the measures at European level.</p>
      <p sl="es">The main changes are: promoting compliance with the rules by vessels in the non-contracting area, a new control system, banning landings of frozen fish whose legality cannot be proven, realigning with other conventions, fisheries management measures and new measures to combat illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to highlight something that other fellow Members have already pointed out. Mrs Fraga’s report mentions that the recommendation on the control scheme was adopted in 2006, although the convention was signed in 1982, 28 years ago, while the convention referred to in Mr Wałesa’s report was adopted in 1978, and I think he said it was transposed in 1989. In other words, I would like to express my disagreement with the method used by the Commission to transpose the recommendations of regional fisheries organisations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Not only does illegal fishing need to be monitored through total allowable catches and quotas, but also, we need to tackle the legal vacuum that could be created by failing to transpose the legislation.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not sufficient to transpose recommendations from other regulations, because this takes away clarity and credibility. Moreover, it calls into question the ordinary legislative procedure and the institutional balance. The measures adopted in regional organisations need to be incorporated efficiently and swiftly. Parliament has often stressed that regional organisations and their agreements take priority.</p>
      <p sl="es">Failing to comply with EU law when transposing the decisions made by regional organisations is detrimental to Parliament and, of course, it disparages the nature of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commissioner said that there are going to be fresh agreements. Therefore, in short, we are asking the Commission to be swift and dynamic in legally transposing them. Let us not allow a legal vacuum to harbour illegality in fisheries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to compliment both rapporteurs on their reports, and to refer, in particular, to Carmen Fraga Estévez’s report, which has proved to be non-controversial as all parties have agreed to the compromise. The report aims to ensure the long-term conservation and optimum utilisation of fisheries resources in the North-East Atlantic area, providing sustainable environmental and social benefits.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to take this opportunity to raise the ongoing dispute relating to mackerel, as some of the stock is fished within the North-East Atlantic area. It is important that this dispute is resolved as quickly as possible, because over-fishing of the mackerel stock will have a devastating impact on future catches. It is vital that the stock is fished in a sustainable manner, and all parties should sign up to this. I understand that recent talks in London were inconclusive, but I note that they will resume next week. I wish these talks well and I hope that good sense will prevail. Commissioner, I understand that you will assess the situation after the talks on 26 October, and I appreciate the firm stand you have decided to take. You must ensure that this jointly managed stock remains healthy in the future. Finally, we cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past in relation to blue whiting. We cannot decimate this healthy mackerel stock.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in supporting the reports which are the subject of debate, I must also take the opportunity to make some more general comments on international and multinational agreements in fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="en">If agreements between fishing nations are to succeed, there must be clear incentives for all parties to comply with such conservation measures as may be required from time to time.</p>
      <p sl="en">There must also be faith in the scientific advice which is used as a basis for conservation and management plans. From the point of view of my own fishing nation, Scotland, the common fisheries policy, the EU’s very own international agreement, has not been a great success.</p>
      <p sl="en">The so-called cod recovery plan is actually causing discards of perfectly good fish and is imposing an almost unworkable combination of quota restrictions and days at sea. The current dispute over mackerel – Scotland’s most valuable fishery – which we have heard about from other speakers, has implications for all international negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">If there is to be any hope of successful agreements between fishing nations, then we cannot have a situation where stocks are threatened by a race to catch all the available fish on a unilateral basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">I ask that the Commissioner continue her good work in striving for a solution to this dispute. I know that she is well aware of the strength of feeling in Scotland about this from her recent visit, but I appeal in broad terms for the Commissioner to keep in mind the need to ensure that we have robust scientific advice in all that we try to do, that we have sensible, workable rules in management plans – which would be a novelty under the CFP – and that we have, above all, incentives for those who are the subject of these plans, i.e. fishing communities, to comply.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing destroys communities living in coastal regions, has a devastating impact on marine ecosystems, and poses a threat to food resources. This is why I welcome this agreement with the Council and I believe that we have taken a step forward in implementing the recommendations of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Tightening the control measures and basing them on sound legislation are vital actions to enable us to meet the obligations assumed by the treaty and to protect the Atlantic’s resources which are currently being heavily overfished. However, in spite of this progress, this regulation’s scope of application does not enable us to tackle completely the problems relating to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are all aware that thousands of vessels fly the flags of states which are unwilling or do not have the capability to apply international legislation. It is not only fish stocks but also the marine environment which stand to suffer. Working conditions aboard many of these vessels are nothing short of slave labour.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, multilateral cooperation on fisheries in international waters is necessary to ensure their sustainability and the preservation of fish stocks in the medium and long term. Conservation measures and the management of resources at the level of regional fisheries organisations should, of course, be defined alongside measures to ensure effective compliance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are therefore in favour of bridging gaps in the monitoring system, especially in relation to illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing activity. Today, monitoring of fishing activities places increased demands on the Member States, whether under the common fisheries policy (CFP) or under multilateral cooperation, as the proposed transposition now demonstrates.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This fact should not be ignored by the Commission. The necessary acquisition, development or modernisation of controls may require considerable financial input. It will therefore by important for us to consider the financial resources allocated to monitoring activities in the available legislative instruments, particularly in the regulation of the financial measures of the CFP, and especially by reviewing the maximum rate of cofinancing provided in this area, which is currently 50%.</p>

It is important that we do not lose sight of the fundamental considerations here: the optimum utilisation and sensible management of fishery resources. This needs to be based on a sustainable and ecological concept if we are to ensure that fishing continues to provide food for future generations.</p>
      <p sl="de">The agreements are intended, in particular, to preserve the small local fishing enterprises with their family structures, and to protect them from competition that uses illegal methods, as well as from large-scale fleets which plunder the seas using large amounts of electronic equipment and deep fishing nets. In short, we want a fisheries industry, but not in this form which jeopardises the small-scale structures, the local structures, with its negative actions. We need to provide sustainability for future generations, and we must protect this and secure it by contractual means.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs once again for their excellent work, and I would also like to thank all the Members for their remarks. I understand that these are very important reports. These amendments would drastically improve the situation, especially as regards control and our stance on the problem of illegal fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with everybody that the problem of illegal fisheries is something that we have to tackle, because it destroys the sustainability of stocks. It is also a grave danger for our coastal communities, because if sustainability of the stocks collapses, our coastal communities will have no future. It is very important to secure these control schemes. The reports and the amendments concerning these schemes can help us a lot.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to underline that I understand we need more resources – and more funding, perhaps – to ensure that these rules are well implemented. It is not an easy task to deal with this crisis, but we are nevertheless going to do our best.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to focus a little more on the codecision process between Parliament, the Council and the Commission in the context of making amendments to these RFMO decisions and transposing them into our legislation. I share with you the opinion that these regional fisheries organisations are very important for our policy and we need to boost their activity in order to tackle illegal fisheries worldwide. I also agree that if we can secure implementation of our principles worldwide, then the sustainability of fisheries would be much more secure.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also very much welcome the proposals on how we can boost cooperation, and the proposal to establish an international registry of fishing vessels, but we have to take a lot of steps before reaching that stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we really want to boost international cooperation, we have to press ahead and swiftly implement the decisions taken in these organisations. This is why the Commission is asking for more delegated powers on this issue. We respect the codecision process, we understand that we are in a new environment now, and we understand that the Council and Parliament will decide on the powers you can give us under the delegation mandate. I would nevertheless like to underline that it is not just the Commission’s problem: the international reputation of the EU is at stake if we delay the transposition of these regional organisations’ decisions into our legislation. That is why we are insisting that we have to have a better balance on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with you that we need a balance between the three institutions, but we need a better balance, and I am ready to participate in specific discussions with Parliament as regards how these RFMO measures can be more effectively transposed into EU law.</p>

      <p sl="es">The Commission put forward the proposal late and the procedure has changed, as we have changed from the consultation procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure, and the proposal as a whole has been changed in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. That is exactly what we are avoiding through this compromise. Through the new wording of Article 48 of the regulation, which is the article that provides for the amendment of the regulation in future in order to transpose the various NEAFC recommendations into EU law, in the majority of the articles, we have delegated powers to the European Commission. We have only maintained and preserved the ordinary legislative procedure in a few areas, which was the compromise with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">A significant step forward has therefore been taken to ensure that this functions in the future, but even so, Commissioner, I have made a public commitment here that if, in the future, it does not function adequately and we are prevented from fulfilling our obligations, Parliament will be prepared to revise the procedure. I believe that we have made quite a considerable effort, and I think that this is a significant step forward as a starting point.

      <p sl="pt">The restructuring promoted by concentrating the power to make decisions in a single new body, along with the new process of dispute resolution, will speed up internal decision making. New definitions have introduced clearer guidelines on the obligations and rights of the different parties, bringing greater transparency to fishing activity in this zone.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Along with the NAFO, the EU should be guided by a proactive stance in conjunction with the other contracting parties, and should seek to preserve good relations with Canada while continuing to pursue dialogue and consensus with the other contracting parties of the organisation, and even among the individual Member States that have an interest in this RFO.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Issues concerning the environment and climate affect us all. As we know, they are global in scope. It is self-evident that the EU must play a leading role in the fight to safeguard our living conditions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Environmental experts claim that, after industry, the next most important cause of damage to the climate and the next largest source of emissions is all the primitive hearths and cookers that are found in huts and hovels all around Africa, Asia and South America.</p>
      <p sl="sv">A few nations that are focusing on protecting the environment have at last realised this. Today, there are solar-powered, simple stoves that, for a small amount of money, remove 95% of these toxic emissions that black coal, manure and other fuels generate on combustion.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Calculations also show, and this must be the most important thing to point out, that nearly two million people die a premature death because they are forced to breathe in these gases.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I hope that the EU, together with the United States, which has demonstrated an awareness of this problem, will take an active interest in this extremely tangible means of saving people and the environment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Just recently, specific steps have been taken to strengthen the European Union’s energy security through the provision of natural gas from multiple sources in order to avoid any new gas crisis in Europe. I am referring to the opening of the Arad-Szeged gas pipeline, linking Romania and Hungary, which has also benefited from European funding.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This makes the investment not only a success story, but also a model of cooperation between EU countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The interconnections envisaged at European level, together with the general facility for transporting gas in both directions by 2014, as well as gas deposits, allow all the countries in the region to enjoy greater energy independence. European states will be able to help each other in the event of any new gas crises.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Another aspect which is just as important is that the price of gas will be set at regional level, rather than by negotiation with a single supplier. I hope that the completion of the Arad-Szeged pipeline will give some impetus not only to the Nabucco gas pipeline project, but also to the AGRI project, which will be used to transport natural gas to Europe via a route through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Romania.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Democracy is being violated in Romania, a European Union Member State, by the actual party in government, without any fear of repercussions. The president of the Chamber of Deputies, one of the Romanian parliament’s two chambers, counted the 80 MPs who were in the chamber and announced that the result of the count was 170.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At that moment, a law which is vital to a large number of Romanian citizens was put to the vote. This was the draft of the new pensions law, which envisaged increasing the retirement age excessively, setting the same retirement age for women and men, and performing a recalculation, amounting to a reduction in real terms of the pension amount for a large number of pensioners.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Although the opposition was strongly against these amendments and was not present in the chamber at the time of the vote, the cameras were able to expose the fraud taking place. However, if the opposition and press had not protested against this action every day since then, the law would have been officially announced today by the Romanian president.</p>

In the background, there was disagreement on the question of the exchange rate of the yuan, deemed by the euro area to be excessively low.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union has asked the Chinese Premier to appreciate their currency and put an end to unfair commercial practices which have, for years, fuelled tariff wars, highlighting this as a basic condition before addressing the issue of recognising China as a market economy.</p>

For the South Tyroleans, this is a daily reminder of an injustice suffered. This is not worthy of a united Europe of the 21st century. Years ago, the then European Commissioner, Franco Frattini, suggested a Europe-wide law banning all Nazi symbols. The logical consequence of this would have been that, as part of the drive against Nazi symbols, fascist monuments in South Tyrol would also have been banned and would have had to be removed.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Edvard Kožušník, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the future of European standardisation (2010/2051(INI)) (A7-0276/2010).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-211" speaker_id="96704" name="Edvard Kožušník" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="cs">The report that we are dealing with today is submitted as a precursor to a standardisation package which the Commission is currently working on. This should provide a legislative revision of the existing legal framework of European standardisation, which we will use to define the development of standardisation in the coming decades. It is therefore in the interest of Parliament to use this report to convey to the Commission and relevant specialists our concept of the future development of European standardisation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The form of the system of European standardisation is key to fully exploiting the potential of the internal market, improving the competitiveness of the European economy and fulfilling the Europe 2020 strategy. We have therefore given our full attention to this subject in the Committee on the Internal Market. We have conducted intensive discussions with all stakeholders, both at international and European level and at the level of organisations in the individual Member States. When seeking the best form of European standardisation, we did our best by representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as consumer representatives, disabled people, environmentalists and other organisations representing community interests.</p>
      <p sl="cs">During discussions on the future form of European standardisation, we concluded that the design review should be based on the strengths of the existing system, which provides a stable base on which to build. We cannot undertake any radical changes that could weaken the key merits of the current system. In order to achieve an effectively functioning system of European standardisation, it is necessary for national standardisation organisations that play a less active role in the existing standardisation process to move closer to stronger national organisations. Strong national standardisation organisations, which can communicate with each other effectively, but also with other interested parties, are the basis for the stability of the European standardisation system.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In future, we must also focus more on the greater involvement of stakeholders in the standardisation process itself. The aim is to make sure that the standards that emerge are the result of a broad consensus, and are therefore ultimately more representative. Another subject that was addressed in this long discussion was easier access to standards. In particular, I would mention the process of establishing standards. This should correspond to the nature of their beneficiaries and users. In order that the standards can be enforced more easily, they need to be more comprehensible and easier to use.</p>
      <p sl="cs">With the increasing liberalisation of services, it is necessary to think more about standardisation in the area of services. We consider this area to be crucial for achieving greater cross-border competition in services. The establishment of European standards in services is a way to dismantle barriers in services in the internal market and to do so sensitively. Dismantling these barriers and increasing competition are a way to improve the transparency and quality of European services and to encourage competition, which goes hand in hand with innovation. It is innovation and new technologies which are the engine of economic growth in the post-crisis period. For European standardisation, the challenge is to achieve close cooperation between the creators of standards, innovators, academics and researchers. Without the intensive involvement of all these four groups in the process of establishing standards, Europe will find it difficult to standardise its knowledge in the low carbon economy, electric cars, nanotechnology and ICT. The ability to convert the findings of research and development into the process of establishing standards will ultimately determine whether the European system of standardisation will continue to play a key role in a globalised world.</p>
      <p sl="cs">At this point, I would like to thank all my colleagues on the committee, but also my colleagues on the partner ITRE committee, who were actively involved in the drafting of this report. I would particularly point out that we managed to obtain a joint agreement on the final form of this report across all the political groups.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to express my satisfaction with the work that has been undertaken by the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, with whom we have been able to strike a good balance between the various political positions. This report sends a political message, loud and clear, to the European Commission and contains important guidelines in view of its imminent review.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have determined that the current system works well and does not require radical changes. The improvements that we have proposed do not prejudice the current principles on which the system is based, or rather, the principle of national delegation and its private and voluntary nature. That notwithstanding, it is important for the public interest to play a more active role and contribute to the creation of new standards. I feel that the function of small and medium-sized enterprises is important and relevant within the process of standardisation.</p>
      <p sl="it">This report is only the beginning: we will continue to work in the coming months to ensure that European standardisation meets the economic and social needs of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to congratulate my colleague on the preparation of this important report. Standardisation is particularly important for building a common internal market, ensuring the business competitiveness of both the European Union and individual Member States and removing trade obstacles. I support the Commission’s initiative to prepare a Standardisation Package, which will hopefully be sufficiently comprehensive and will facilitate the removal of existing deficiencies which currently prevent us from ensuring product safety and which create different levels of consumer protection in different Member States. The laying down of uniform standards at European level is especially important in the field of rapidly developing technologies and innovations. In order to ensure not just that the European Union is competitive, but also that our people’s health is properly protected and that safe products access the market, it is necessary for uniform standards to be valid and applicable in all Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The European system of normalisation is a part of an international system that sets out unified, generally applied regulations and norms used by the production sector worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As societal progress increases knowledge, changes technologies, organisation and the way of life, normalisation as a specific field of defining generally used regulations must also be an active undertaking open to progress. If the European Union wishes to have a truly sophisticated, innovative economy, it cannot avoid substantially increased activity in the field of the development of new norms which will facilitate the introduction of new scientific and technological inventions to the market. From this point of view, I believe it is time the mechanisms of European standardisation and normalisation, currently based mostly on national traditions and national workplaces, were brought up to date. Today, however, these mechanisms must be simpler and more effective.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, as Jobbik representatives, we are often called EU sceptics, and we actually agree with this. We are EU sceptics, but this does not mean that we do not support cooperation between EU Member States. It is clear that we are against the principle of the United States of Europe and we support the Europe of nations, but standardisation is typically a subject that we can agree on, that we can support. However, it is always said that we are always protesting and saying no, no, no to everything. Well, standardisation is a topic that we, too, would like to facilitate and support. I would also like to ask all Member States to support standardisation, and my fellow Members to support this report by Mr Kožušník. This is where we can agree for the time being.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The adoption of European standards can make a vital contribution to facilitating access for SMEs to the single market and consolidating their position in it. With this in mind, SMEs need simple, standardised loan products, which will facilitate their rapid use, based on a minimum number of documents and a simplified financial analysis. The European standardisation system must encourage and support innovation and also establish a common basis for a more comprehensive approach to standardisation. I also feel that it would be useful to apply the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality on a regular basis at European level. This would help consolidate the basic principle of ‘think small first’ as part of public policies for SMEs. In this context, I would also like to mention that an ordinance was issued recently in Romania on implementing measures supporting the uniform enforcement of EU legislation, which harmonises the conditions for marketing products.</p>

      <p sl="cs">This report will further encourage the Commission to pursue carefully the harmonisation of standards in the internal market. During the progressive liberalisation of global trade, it provides a way for us to protect European citizens from low quality and unsafe products, particularly from the Asian countries. I thank my colleagues from the Commission for their support for my draft, which gives the green light to the establishment of standards for safe children’s shoes. It is high time to act, because today’s generation of children has orthopaedic defects due to cheap, but physically harmful Chinese shoes.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is very striking that we have European quality legislation for safe toys, where a child comes into contact with a toy only for a short time, but we do not have adequate standards for shoes and slippers that children have on their feet all day. I hope that the Commission reacts to this call, which is not the first, and takes appropriate action. I think that it is a shame that the industrial lobby from Germany and France has won and that, in the international standards committees, the European Union will not speak with one voice, but in twenty seven languages.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, congratulations on an excellent report. It is a good basis for further work. Transparency and democracy are most important in the standard-setting process, as is improved participation on the part of the weaker societal stakeholders, consumers and environmental organisations. Standardisation must not be allowed simply to become a battlefield for big business.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am pleased that the report takes account of the principle of appropriate representation, according to which all stakeholder positions must be incorporated in an appropriate manner. It is also important that societal stakeholders are more strongly represented. In my opinion, this could be done by giving them the right to vote on technical committees. It is also important to develop a second production line. I hope that the Commission will pay serious attention to that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his comprehensive report, which has received general approval. I would also like to thank the honourable Members who have stayed here so late to help the President with his duties and also to put forward some very constructive contributions and ideas in the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report is a valuable contribution to the debate launched by the European Commission some time ago. It draws attention to the future of the standardisation system in Europe: a central element in the implementation of the internal market, in increasing the competitiveness of European business, and an important tool in fostering innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the next decade, European standardisation will have to adapt to new energy, environmental and societal challenges, as you have already mentioned. These include the emergence of new economic powers, the development of technologies, climate change, carbon management and renewable energies. These are some of the new factors we have to face.</p>
      <p sl="en">We share the rapporteur’s view that we can build on the existing system. It forms a solid basis for further development. There is, nevertheless, room for improvement. The report presents a number of proposals with a view to improving the system within its current boundaries. The Commission welcomes the emphasis placed on the importance of the principle of national delegation. At the same time, the report draws attention to a negative consequence of this principle: existing deficits in participation by societal stakeholders representing health and safety, consumer and environmental interests in the standard-setting process. The participation of societal stakeholders is extremely important as it lends the system a significant element of legitimacy and accountability and improves the quality of the consensus. The Commission will explore practical ways of ensuring effective membership of European standardisation organisations for organisations representing societal stakeholders, and of helping to achieve more balanced participation by stakeholders in the standard-setting process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission shares the view that, with respect to the central role of the national delegation principle for CENELEC, national standards bodies are key players in the European standardisation model. All national standards bodies must therefore be able to provide a robust platform of consensus-building. The report notes significant differences among them in terms of resources, technical expertise and stakeholder engagement in the standardisation process. There is room for improvement here in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Though the problem of access to standards should not be limited to the price of standards, the Commission welcomes the call on national standards bodies to reduce costs through special rates, by offering bundles of standards at a reduced price, and by investigating additional ways of improving access, especially for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">European standardisation has a huge potential to support legislation in public policies. We appreciate that the report recognises this potential and stresses the need to move into new domains of standards development such as services. As pointed out in the report, the new European model must contribute to European innovation and sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in this very useful and inspiring report.</p>
