      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0245/2009) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the 25th annual report from the Commission on monitoring the application of Community law (2007) (2008/2337(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-007" speaker_id="4254" name="Monica Frassoni" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my third report on the application of Community law and I must say that – with all due respect for the considerable amount of work that we have done, together with the Commission – I do not think that we can declare ourselves to be particularly satisfied. I believe that there are basically three problems, which I would like to mention, and which have been drawn to your attention and, above all, to the attention of the Commission in our report.</p>
      <p sl="it">As compared with the outset, I can see a tendency on the Commission’s part to pay less attention to what Parliament does and asks, given that in contrast to previous practice we have received almost no reply to the questions that we have asked during the past two reports. I must say that this causes me a certain degree of frustration, since we had all agreed that the issue of the application of Community law was a priority in the ‘better regulation’ agenda.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have encountered the following problems: the three fundamental issues that we discussed with the Commission were transparency, resources and the length of procedures.</p>
      <p sl="it">We can see that with regard to the new point that we developed together, in other words the issue of transparency, progress has been rather slow and in fact, with the new regulations on access to documents, the opportunity for those who carry out infringement proceedings, or who request that infringement proceedings be opened, to find out why they have been closed or why they have been opened, is decreasing by any standards.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, I would like to talk about the issue of defining priorities: the definition of priorities, respect for and conduct of infringement proceedings must naturally involve decisions which are not merely technical but are also political and here, unfortunately, after the three or four years that we have been working on this point, we still have a problem with monitoring and the transparency mechanism, not only internally in other words, with regard to the Commission but also externally.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to give you a couple of examples, particularly concerning Community law on the environment. We know that this is the main problem in the application of European law, and yet both from the point of view of resources and from the point of view of the priority given to this sector, we are still lagging significantly behind.</p>
      <p sl="it">One of the most interesting issues, and one which was discussed in the most positive terms with the Commission, was that of the reduction in the time taken by proceedings, through a set of mechanisms that had been put forward and in part agreed with the Commission. On this issue too, however, we have remained at a stalemate due to a certain inertia, which I hope in the future can be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="it">Also, another issue that we had debated at length with the Commission was the ‘pilot project’: this is a project whereby, when a citizen complains to the Commission, the complaint is forwarded to the Member State so that it can give some sort of response. The assessment that some Member States have given, particularly our Commissioner, Mr Tajani, regarding the operation of this pilot project, is relatively unsatisfactory; the fact that the Commission no longer writes directly to those who have been accused of a possible infraction greatly reduces the capacity of an administration that is guilty, let us say, of this alleged breach, to be motivated to respond.</p>
      <p sl="it">Things are always that way: if an Italian ministry department writes to a region, that will certainly be less effective than a letter arriving directly from the Commission. This is the kind of criticism that has been made of the pilot project, but unfortunately the Commission has not given much of a response. Madam President, I reserve the right to come back in the second part of the debate, to respond to the comments that I am sure Vice-President Tajani will make.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I am here today on behalf of President Barroso, who asked me to pass on his regrets that he is unable to attend this debate on our 2007 annual report on monitoring the application of Community law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission welcomes the support given by Parliament to the approach it adopted in its 2007 communication entitled ‘A Europe of results – applying Community law’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Barroso Commission attaches great importance to the correct application of Community law, making it a top priority. That is why the Commission has made a special effort to improve its working methods for the benefit of citizens and businesses, as explained in the 2007 communication.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Previous Parliament resolutions have inspired a significant number of the initiatives introduced in the communication. Firstly, last January we introduced more frequent decision-making in infringement proceedings with the aim of speeding up cases; secondly, we launched the ‘EU Pilot’ project in 15 Member States last April to test a new method aimed at improving problem solving and the availability of information; thirdly, the main purpose of this initiative, which is close to Parliament’s interests, is to better serve the interests of citizens and businesses with regard to questions and problems identified in the application of Community law, including infringements of this law; fourthly, the Commission will nonetheless continue to decide to prosecute infringements in the event of non-conformance within the framework of the ‘EU Pilot’ project, particularly through infringement proceedings; and fifthly, President Barroso has written to the chairman of Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Gargani, with details of the pilot project’s performance in December 2008. This letter also confirmed the Commission’s intention to send Parliament a detailed report on the project’s first year of operation, and preparatory work on this has begun.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Following on from its communication, the Commission also adopted an annual report, which is more political; while it, too, points to the work done over the course of the last year, it also seeks to identify priorities for the application of Community law and a programme to put these priorities into practice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report constitutes an important and strategic statement by the Commission on a key aspect of the ‘Better Lawmaking’ programme. One of the aims of this initiative is to provide Parliament with more useful information to form a better framework for the interinsitutional discussions that follow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament has welcomed the identification of the priorities listed in the 2008 annual report, especially those concerning fundamental rights and quality of life. For the first time, the Commission has used its annual report to set more precise priorities for the various sectors. Our goal remains to focus our work more on actions that will yield more effective results in the interests of all citizens and businesses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The action taken on the priorities identified last year and the progress made will be shown in this year’s annual report, as well as the new priorities for 2009-2010.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you. I am very interested to hear the contributions to this debate from the various Members, and I will give some answers to Mrs Frassoni at the end of the debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to congratulate Ms Frassoni on her report. I think she and I now, over a period of two or three years, have enjoyed working together on this report on behalf of Parliament. That cooperation I have enjoyed; I do not enjoy the fact that we seem to end up every year repeating much the same things and having a certain sense that we are going round and round in circles.</p>
      <p sl="en">It ought to be pretty simple, because this is about our citizens being able to see what European law is; when there is a problem, to be able to see what the enforcement process is; and, finally, to see the result of that enforcement. But, as it is, we seem to have to keep trying to invent new mechanisms all the time to actually deal with a process that is already there but is not obvious and is not transparent.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have made some progress in that the beginning of the process, in the sense of making EU law understandable, has now been taken on board by the Commission, and I am pleased that we now see, with some regularity, so-called citizens’ summaries prefacing pieces of legislation, so that we can all see – and those we represent can see – where we ought to be heading and what the law ought to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="en">But when it comes to the enforcement process, we still seem to be in a position where the decision to enforce or not is less than obvious – why that decision may or may not be taken – and citizens are often left wondering. We have recently received a letter from somebody who had tried to get a piece of legislation enforced and is now so disgusted with the whole European set-up, having been pro-European, that they now support an anti-European party.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is the point: if we do not get this right, we bring the whole of European law and the whole of our institutions into disrepute. It is as serious as that. All of us as Members, in these last days of this mandate, are spending our time tearing around, going from trialogue to trialogue and first-reading agreement to first-reading agreement, arguing about sets of words, the contents of sentences in legislation. That is great. But if, at the end of the day, it is not enforced in the way that our citizens expect, we might ask ourselves: what is the point?</p>
      <p sl="en">All of our institutions have a responsibility concerning the monitoring of EU law. You, the Commission, have the primary responsibility, and I wish in a way that we did not have to have this debate in this style every year.</p>

    <intervention id="5-010" speaker_id="28301" name="Tadeusz Zwiefka" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, one of the key principles governing the operation of the European Union is that the Member States accept the obligation to transpose and implement Community law. This principle is foundational to the process of integration. There is without doubt a need for continuous, active cooperation of the Commission and Member States in order to ensure rapid and effective answers to doubts raised by citizens and to criticise and rectify breaches in application of Community law. I welcome the declaration of the Commission on closer cooperation with the European Parliament in the area of reporting and application of Community law.</p>
      <p sl="pl">National courts play a fundamental role in applying Community law, and so I fully support the Commission’s efforts at specifying additional training for judges, the legal profession and civil servants in the Member States. However, the effective application of Community law is still associated with serious challenges, including widespread delays in the transposition of directives.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One of the most important mechanisms which allow us to ascertain how, in reality, European law is applied, is the system of references for a preliminary ruling, the objective of which is to give national courts the opportunity to ensure uniform interpretation and application of European law in all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A fundamental problem with the procedure for references for a preliminary ruling is the time needed to receive an answer from the Court of Justice, which unfortunately is still around 20 months. The reason for this is always the same – translation of the trial dossiers into all the languages of the EU. This takes around nine months. Of course, these translations are extremely important, because they ensure wide access to the latest and most important European rulings and they increase legal confidence in the European Union. However, success or failure in the effective introduction of EU law will ultimately be determined by whichever institutional model is considered appropriate. Having the knowledge and the means is not everything. The will to take action is also needed.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, just as in previous years, the Commission has not responded to the issues raised in last year’s resolution on monitoring the application of Community law, of which I was the author. In this respect there are three fundamental issues in which the lack of improvement remains a cause for concern: transparency, resources and the length of procedures.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Of the new cases of infringement in 2007, 1 196 concerned a failure to notify national measures relating to the transposition of Community directives. It is unacceptable that the Commission should grant itself 12 months to deal with these simple cases, which, apart from the necessity of a quick reaction, do not require any analysis or assessment. The ‘EU Pilot’ project, which was launched a year ago in 15 Member States to test the new method for reaction to complaints, could be extended to the other Member States, but the lack of information on assessment of its operation does not, unfortunately, allow Parliament to comment on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I regret to say that during this parliamentary term no significant progress has been made with regard to the role that Parliament should play in monitoring the application of Community law. In connection with this a call should be made for prompt implementation of the related reforms proposed by the Working Party on Reform, which enhance Parliament’s capacity to monitor the application of Community law in Member States.</p>

    <intervention id="5-012" speaker_id="1337" name="Manuel Medina Ortega" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, for once I am glad that I am not the incumbent, glad that Mr Tajani has come, because Mr Tajani has the advantage of having been an MEP. I know that as a former Member of this House you have experienced the frustration that we have as MEPs regarding the application of Community law.</p>
      <p sl="es">Well, in Parliament, we do have a tendency to take the Commission to task, but I think that we are setting the Commission an impossible brief, because all Community law and all application of Community law is based on indirect application.</p>
      <p sl="es">In other words, the Commission has only a few officials in the central headquarters where it receives some complaints and has some options for action but, at the moment, the trend is to restrict budgetary powers, and so the Commission is not going to be able to act.</p>
      <p sl="es">All Community law, and all application of Community law, is based on action by the national authorities: national parliaments, national courts and national civil servants.</p>
      <p sl="es">Here, on this aspect, I do not believe that we can demand too much from the Commission. What we should do is to help the Commission, and I think that the report by Mrs Frassoni contains several points that may be useful in trying to make the application of Community law a reality. I am referring to the points on the correlation of national measures with directives, the cooperation of national parliaments and action by national courts.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-013" speaker_id="1429" name="Christopher Beazley" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wonder if Commissioner Tajani would agree that, in a sense, the biggest obstacle to the correct observation of Community law are in fact our national governments.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will just give one example. About 20 years ago we agreed to have the four freedoms throughout the European Union. In my constituency there are many people of Italian origin, one of whom is a teacher and, obviously, a fluent Italian speaker. He returned to his family home in Italy and was forbidden to teach in his family’s native country because his training was undertaken in England. That surely must be wrong, but there is nothing that we can do about it because the Italian authorities say – for whatever reason – that this is reserved for Italian nationals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The British Government’s behaviour at airports seems to me to be in flagrant breach of most European agreements. Is there something the Commission can do – maybe by making a plea, at the next summit, to our national governments to show a bit of European solidarity?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="5-014" speaker_id="28345" name="David Hammerstein" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, over the last five years, as an MEP who is a member of the Committee on Petitions, I have examined hundreds and hundreds of petitions, complaints and questions regarding the environment, and I have seen the very limited extent of cooperation by the national authorities. One might even say that there is a real rebellion in progress by certain Member States against the application of the directive on natural habitats and other environmental directives.</p>
      <p sl="es">We can see how inadequate the Commission’s departments are; they have neither sufficient resources nor the political will to apply Community law in the most obvious of cases. All this goes on for so many years that, in the majority of cases, when infringement proceedings reach the European Court of Justice we are acting ‘at the point of death’, and so the law, in irreversible situations concerning the environment, achieves nothing.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft resolutions under discussion today attach particular importance to the interests of citizens, and more specifically of complainants, in the application of Community law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Within the limitations of its obligations in terms of confidentiality, the Commission is working to be more transparent and to publish more information in its annual report on the Europa website and in its correspondence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is in the process of developing a joint European Union portal that should help citizens. It is looking at the best way of presenting useful information to citizens and directing them towards the information that best matches their interests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is in the process of finalising its work explaining the principle of State liability for breach of Community law, which could help citizens to obtain reparation in the national courts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In terms of complaints, the Commission confirms the importance that it attaches to the formalities, to efficient processing of complaints and to keeping complainants informed about the progress of their complaints. It also confirms its desire to find solutions as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to highlight, as has been rightly done by Mrs Wallis and Mr Medina Ortega, the importance of the national courts in the application of Community law. Work is being done by the Commission in several contexts, with national judges, as Mr Zwiefka said, to raise their awareness of the different aspects of Community law and ensure that they have all the tools they need to access the relevant information.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the new ‘European Union pilot’ method, it is not an additional stage in the procedure. This method enables us to quickly examine whether a solution can be found directly and quickly with the parties concerned in a Member State. It was constructed on the basis of the Commission’s practice over the years, adding better commitment from the Commission and the Member States taking part in terms of organising contacts and the results to target.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are many specific points raised in the draft report under discussion today. The Commission will provide explanations on the aspects that I am not able to respond to today in its response to the resolution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having said that, with regard to infrastructures, which are also part of my portfolio, I can only welcome the European Parliament’s invitation to ensure that infringement proceedings are dealt with and, where appropriate, closed, as they prevent Member States from investing in infrastructures that could affect the implementation of the European Economic Recovery Plan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the common interest shown by Parliament and the Commission in the appropriate and correct application of Community law, in the interests of citizens and enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We confirm our joint assessment of the vital importance of this aspect of the ‘Better Regulation’ programme.</p>

    <intervention id="5-016" speaker_id="4254" name="Monica Frassoni" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give my thanks to the President. It is very interesting that the Commissioner has chosen, out of all the resolution, the point which I, as rapporteur, am least pleased with, but nonetheless I welcome all the things that he has said and the commitments he has made on behalf of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also wanted to take this opportunity to point out a few problems which I hope can be tackled by the Commission. The first is a gradual reduction in the independence of the Directorates-General, subject to the combined effects of a legal service that is increasingly reluctant to go to Court and a General Secretariat that is increasingly reluctant to encourage the Member States; the examples that I could give are, alas, numerous.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is also a real problem of ineffective control of the application of Community law because of a lack of resources: Madam President, in relation to a directive that we have studied in depth, which is Directive 2004/38/EC, there have been 1500 complaints. This is the directive on the free movement of citizens, and there have been 1500 complaints by citizens but only 19 infringement cases have been opened.</p>
      <p sl="it">Next, with regard to the pilot project issue, I have already spoken about the problem of a reduction in persuasive force and the fact that the deadlines cannot always be shortened. Clearly, when issues are handled in the pilot project such as pollution that has already been confirmed, rules on hunting that obviously and openly conflict with Community rules, it cannot be claimed that the Member States are taking action, because this only serves to delay proceedings further.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, Madam President, there is a problem which I consider to be worrying and which is relatively new, and that is the combined effect of the extreme formality, which is continuing to increase, of the replies given by the Commission, and the increasingly arbitrary nature of decisions. Recently, an infringement case was closed for reasons of political expediency – I am referring to the MoSE project. Clearly, when the concept of political expediency becomes involved in a monitoring process that ought to be, above all, a legal one, things can become complicated.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, within our own institution, Parliament, we are faced with very serious problem because the reforms that we are about to debate and to vote on in May include proposals to significantly reduce the powers of the Committee on Petitions. This would be a very serious mistake, because a reduction in the power of petitions means a reduction in the power of citizens, of complaints and of the handling of infringements of Community law.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">the report (A6-0053/2009) by Mrs Starkevičiūtė, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in the Community (COM(2008)0640 – C6-0352/2008 – 2008/0194(COD)), and</p>
      <p sl="unknown">the report (A6-0056/2009) by Mr Purvis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking up, pursuit and prudential supervision of the business of electronic money institutions, amending Directives 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 2000/46/EC (COM(2008)0627 - C6-0350/2008 - 2008/0190(COD)).</p>

    <intervention id="5-020" speaker_id="28285" name="Margarita Starkevičiūtė" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="lt">Today, as the European Union’s economy experiences a period of recession, it is very important to stimulate economic growth. One of the sources of the European Union’s economic growth is the expansion of the common market, which is still very fragmented, especially in the area of financial services. The proposal before us should help solve this problem and establish a common European payment area. In English this is called the Single Euro Payments Area.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This document already has some history. As soon as the euro was introduced and the currency exchange rates were abolished in euro zone countries, it became clear that prices for cross-border payments still differed from prices for local payments. For this reason Regulation (EC) No 2560 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in euro was adopted and entered into force at the end of 2001. It set equal charges for corresponding local, national payments and cross-border payments and strengthened this principle. The aim of this was to reduce prices for consumers and ensure greater competition in the payment services market.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Implementing this regulation reduced payment fees; for example, a cross-border transfer of EUR 100 used to cost an average of EUR 24 in the European Union, now it costs EUR 2.50. On the other hand, the document revealed certain deficiencies. For this reason it was decided that it should be revised.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The document before us is an improved version of Regulation No 2560. What is new in the document? Firstly, the principle of equality of charges for cross-border and corresponding domestic payments has been extended to include direct debit. This was not previously available. Once the SEPA had been created and the Payment Services Directive had been adopted, the payment environment in Europe changed; therefore, it is important that from November 2009 it will be possible to use the popular electronic payment method, direct debit, on a cross-border basis. In order to help create that common direct debit model, the regulation states that in the absence of a bilateral agreement between the payment service providers of the payer and the payee, the level of the default interim Multilateral Interchange Fee for a direct debit will be set at EUR 0.08 for a transitional period until 2012.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The document also outlines how to improve the defence of consumer rights and remove obstacles to business. It is proposed that Member States appoint competent authorities to supervise the implementation of this regulation, and those authorities should also actively cooperate across nations, so that there are fewer obstacles to business; they could also lay down guidelines on how to assess procedures for determining compliance with the principle.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Another novelty the revision of this document offers is the proposal to gradually abolish obligations imposed on banks in certain states to provide balance-of-payments statistics and the laying down of other procedures for providing balance-of-payments statistics.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I am very sorry that an agreement with the Council could not be reached on this point and for the time being the balance-of-payments revision procedures and implementation procedures have still to be defined. Parliament and the Commission have declared that a strict deadline would be set.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this directive responds to the growing importance of electronic commerce and of electronic money and the need for a clear legislative framework. Its aim is to facilitate the use of electronic money for on-line payments accounts, pre-paid mobile phone accounts, top-up travel cards and gift vouchers.</p>
      <p sl="en">E-money is no different from other forms of money in that it stores monetary value and provides a convenient means of exchange. But, unlike account-based payment instruments, such as credit and debit cards, it works as a pre-paid bearer instrument. It is used to cover payments – usually of relatively small amounts – to undertakings other than the user, thus differentiating it from single purpose pre-paid cards like telephone cards. There is no need of a bank account in order to use e-money, so it is particularly relevant to those in society who do not, or cannot, have bank accounts.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was all of eight years ago that a Benjamin Cohen, in his article, ‘Electronic Money: New Day or False Dawn?’, stated that the era of electronic money will soon be upon us. Sadly, this prediction was both over-optimistic and premature – for Europe, at least. Electronic money is still far from delivering, in Europe, the full benefits which were expected when the first e-money directive was adopted in 2001.</p>
      <p sl="en">Probably this was because of the high initial capital requirement and other over-cautious restrictions. The number of e-money institutions differs remarkably from one Member State to another. For example, the Czech Republic has over 40 EMIs, or Electronic Money Institutes, while France and Germany between them have a grand total of 12. In fact, two German EMIs were even constrained to move to the UK jurisdiction because of major differences in regulation, even under this directive. In August 2007 – two years ago – outstanding electronic money was only EUR 1 billion, and that compares with EUR 600 billion of cash in circulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, clearly, e-money has a long way to go to become a serious alternative to cash. However, it is growing significantly, despite the restrictions, and this new directive should enable new, innovative and secure electronic money services to operate, to provide market access possibilities for new players and to foster real and effective competition between market participants. New and smaller operators will have an opportunity to enter the market, as the amount of initial capital needed will be reduced from EUR 1 million to EUR 350 000. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would certainly have preferred less.</p>
      <p sl="en">Providers can extend the outlets where e-payments can be made, for example the customer paying for his metro ticket with e-money could also purchase a coffee, a newspaper or a bunch of flowers at the station kiosk, as is already – and very successfully – the case in Hong Kong, for example.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have been rushed through the legislative process for a first-reading agreement in order to get this measure enacted before the European elections. I thank most warmly Ivo and Melanie from the Economic Committee staff, the Socialist and Liberal shadows, Mr Pittella and Mrs Raeva, the Commission services and the Czech Presidency, notably Tomáš Trnka and his team, for their very positive cooperation. None of us achieved all we would have wished, but I believe we will have made a significant step forward, and I would very much welcome Parliament’s support for this project.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to express the Commission’s appreciation of the speed with which Parliament has dealt with these two issues, which are so important, and on this point I would like to thank both the rapporteurs and Mrs Berès, chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for making a crucial contribution to the speed of the work.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are now only a couple of months away from the final deadline for transposition by the Member States of the directive on payment services. These two measures, alongside the noteworthy efforts of the payments industry to develop SEPA products, constitute a crucial and timely step towards the completion of the single market for payments. These measures, together with the directive, will complete the legal basis which is indispensable in providing clarity, certainty and stability to the market. The negotiations that have been conducted in recent weeks have made it possible to obtain a very rapid agreement concerning these two issues.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to the revised regulation on cross-border payments, I am pleased to announce that the Commission endorses the proposed amendment, which has come about as a result of a compromise. The Commission is particularly pleased by the inclusion in its original proposal of articles governing the matter of the multilateral interbank fee for direct debit transactions. The market was looking for these provisions and we consider them to be vital for a timely launch by European banks of the SEPA direct debit.</p>
      <p sl="it">These rules will give the payments industry three years to put forward a long-term commercial model for automated debits that abides by competition rules. In a spirit of compromise, the Commission is willing to replace the unconditional removal of these obligations with a review clause, as proposed by Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to the revised directive on electronic money, this is a particularly ambitious piece of legislation that will offer a well-received second chance for the establishment of a market in electronic money that will be genuinely useful. The directive aims to provide the market with a clear and balanced legal and prudential framework, removing unnecessary, disproportionate or excessive barriers to market entry and making the business of issuing electronic money more attractive.</p>
      <p sl="it">The new directive should promote genuine and effective competition between all market participants, and at the same time ensure equal conditions for all payment services providers and a high level of consumer protection. The compromise reached establishes an excellent balance, fully protecting our initial objectives and at the same time providing an appropriate response to the legitimate concerns expressed during the adoption process. We therefore fully support this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Legal Affairs Committee supports the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in the Community.</p>
      <p sl="en">The aims of the Commission initiative are as follows: firstly, to replace the existing regulation in order to adapt it to market developments; secondly, to advance the protection of consumer rights and to provide an adequate legal framework for the development of a modern and efficient payment system within the EU; and thirdly, to achieve an internal market for payment services in euro.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Legal Affairs Committee was appointed to submit an opinion to the lead Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In the opinion it was proposed that Member States may appoint existing institutions to act as competent authorities and to utilise or extend existing procedures concerning cross-border payment services. It is important to apply and improve already existing measures and redress bodies to deal effectively with complaints and disputes regarding this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to point out that the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity and especially the extended principle of equality of charges for cross-border payments should comply with the EC Treaty, Article 95(1). Cross-border payments in euro require a Community-wide approach because the applicable rules and principles have to be the same in all Member States in order to achieve legal certainty and a level playing field for all European payments market stakeholders.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I am going to comment only on the regulation on cross-border payments and the report drawn up by Mrs Starkevičiūtė.</p>
      <p sl="es">The regulation, as she has explained very well, responds to the needs that have been perceived as a result of the introduction of the euro, and lays down a relatively clear principle: charges must be the same for domestic payments as for cross-border payments. This is a common-sense rule in an internal market, but one that was far from being adhered to prior to this regulation.</p>
      <p sl="es">The regulation has thus become a launch-pad for the Single Euro Payments Area, to which the rapporteur also referred, and I therefore have some additional observations.</p>
      <p sl="es">With time, this regulation has become outdated and it has been necessary to revise it in order to adapt it to the changes on the financial markets and also to the directive on payment services.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission set itself three goals in this revision: firstly, to include cross-border direct debits within the regulation’s scope; secondly, to establish procedures for the out-of-court handling of problems that might arise from the application of the regulation; and, thirdly, to ease the balance-of-payments statistical reporting obligations.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Parliament has, on the whole, agreed with this approach, but it has made three significant changes: a clarification to the legal definitions laid down by the regulation, a warning or reminder to the Member States that they should comply with the regulation more effectively than they have done in the past and, thirdly, a call for significant cooperation between the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">My concern was the issue of balance-of-payments statistical obligations, which has been resolved by agreement between the separate institutions. I can therefore say that I am fully satisfied with the result achieved.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would like to talk about the report by Mr Purvis on electronic money.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, I think that if we consider the reasons why electronic money is less developed here than in Hong Kong, it is undoubtedly because European citizens have become used to using their bank cards much more easily.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This Parliament has had two concerns in drawing up this legislation: firstly, at a time when the issue of supervision is on everybody’s lips, we do not want to deregulate the supervision of electronic money institutions solely because of the latter’s lobbying. This is why the European Parliament has above all insisted that these institutions that issue electronic money and manage electronic money should be subject to genuine supervision, and I think that we have obtained a number of guarantees in this area. I welcome this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the same way, we were anxious to take into account the interests of citizens and those who use electronic money, particularly when they want to end their contracts, so that they did not have restrictions and fees imposed on them by the institutions managing electronic money that we would have seen as excessive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the spirit in which we have supported this proposal, in the hope that it would make our fellow citizens’ lives easier through the use of electronic money, but that this would not result in excesses, particularly in terms of supervision mechanisms.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in the Community, which aims to replace the current applicable regulation, is linked to the creation of an integrated European payments market. The proposal is also aimed at increasing the protection of consumers’ interests and rights and easing the burden with regard to reporting statistics.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Article 5 on the balance of payments and Article 12 relating to the review clause are the subject of a compromise which our rapporteur, Margarita Starkevičiūtė, is aiming for and is supported by Bulgaria. The compromise offers an opportunity for a timely, adequate assessment.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The current global financial crisis focuses attention on the need for relevant statistical data. Bulgaria is in favour of removing settlement-based reporting obligations on payment service providers for balance of payments statistics under a threshold of EUR 50 000.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Bulgaria supports the removal of Article 5(2) as the reservations which have been expressed are made in the context of the potential loss of information and a deterioration in the quality of the balance of payments statistics, as well as to do with the need for a technical period for implementing the switch to the direct reporting system.</p>

      <p sl="it">In parallel with the directive on payment services, these two pieces of European legislation will make it possible to create a modern, comprehensive legal framework for the Community market in payments and will smooth the path so that the European payments industry will be able to fully develop the Single Euro Payments Area project.

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, electronic money that can be used across borders represents considerable progress. It is important for the EU to improve the internal market in this way by promoting its use. However, I would like to take the opportunity to recall what it is that we are actually talking about.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When we introduced the euro in a large number of European countries, it was based on the analyses carried out on the value of a monetary union. The value is that we reduce the costs involved in exchanging money as well as other transaction costs. We reduce information costs by having a common currency. The price that we pay for this is to have more unstable economies. It is more difficult for us to maintain even and high rates of employment and to maintain stable state finances. We are seeing this right now as everything is going pear-shaped in this regard in countries such as Ireland, Spain, Italy and Greece.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Take note, then, that the victims should be counterbalanced by the benefits gained in lower transaction costs as a result of a common currency, but the benefits are continually diminishing precisely because progress with regard to the payment system is so rapid. Within a short time, we will be in a position where we find that we have such an effective payment system that the costs have become negligible. Then we will have a common currency that actually only guarantees us instability in our European economy. This is something I have said before and now you can see it happening. I urge you all to reflect on this.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to say that the text before us is a compromise, which has been reached through complex negotiations between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, it is a positive result and I would like to thank the Council representative Mr Trinka and the Commission representatives for their cooperation, and would also like to thank staff of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who helped to prepare this document. It will answer those questions which were raised by Mr Lungren, that is, it will help to bolster the whole euro area, because the procedures for euro transactions will be strengthened. As a representative of a country, which is not in the euro zone, I am delighted that this regulation can also be applied, if non-euro zone Member States wish, to payments in national currency, which in Lithuania would be the litas.</p>
      <p sl="lt">For the time being, in our countries prices for cross-border payments and prices for domestic payments in the national currency still differ. This is partly determined by the fact that we are not euro zone Member States. I think that the first step and one of the steps towards the euro zone would be for us, non-euro zone Member States, to begin to apply this principle to national currencies. The other important thing is that the fostering of cross-border payments by this regulation opens the way to modernising the European banking sector, because banks have a transition period of three years to prepare a new business model, which would make payments more efficient.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This is very important as we often talk about innovations, new initiatives and modernisation. This document creates exactly the right conditions for all this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, just to satisfy the prudential concerns mentioned by Mrs Berès, I would point out that we have insisted in this directive and report that e-money funds are not deposits; credit cannot be created upon them. We have opened the door for e-money only a bit wider.</p>
      <p sl="en">The basic capital requirement is reduced to EUR 350 000; the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would have preferred EUR 200 000. The own-funds requirement is to be 2% of outstanding e-money funds; we would have preferred 1.6%, but with the 20% flexibility up or down that is allowed, the more liberal Member States can go down to 1.6% and the conservative Member States can go up to 2.4%.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not ideal that we still have the prospect of such an uneven playing field in the European Union, especially when we have insisted that e-money users’ funds will be fully safeguarded and there are also other important user-friendly protections, for example in redemption, as Mrs Berès mentioned. Because of the level of capital required, the waiver level has also had to be set for purely national e-money operators at EUR 5 million instead of EUR 2 million.</p>
      <p sl="en">All in all, this is a very cautious step forward. It is not perfect. Compromises seldom are. Almost certainly it will have to be revisited in three or four years’ time and, by then, I hope more operators will have entered the business. Users and merchants will be clamouring for more choice. The more doubtful regulators, banks, Mrs Berès – and even the European Central Bank – will have become reconciled that this is a beneficial, user-friendly service which holds no risks to the European economy. We in Europe can at last take up all the opportunities which e-money offers.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0087/2009) by Mr Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down health rules as regards animal by-products not intended for human consumption (Animal by-products Regulation) (COM(2008)0345 – C6-0220/2008 – 2008/0110(COD)).</p>

    <intervention id="5-034" speaker_id="1930" name="Horst Schnellhardt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have produced a good report and we have succeeded in achieving a consensus on the regulation on animal by-products at first reading. For this, I owe my thanks to the French and Czech Presidencies, the Commission and the rapporteurs from the individual Groups.</p>
      <p sl="de">The cooperation in drafting this report was characterised by a spirit of trust and we were able to finish the report quickly, although – and we must think of it like this – the report before us now has significantly changed the Commission’s proposal, less so in the way of content, but more in terms of structure. Many of the details have been reordered. The new proposal was necessary, because a few shortcomings emerged in the application of the 2002 regulation which led to problems in practice. Although the 2002 regulation controlled animal diseases such as BSE, dioxin contamination and the spread of other animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease or swine fever, in order to make further progress in this regard it was vital to lay down requirements with regard to the questions of responsibility, traceability and the end point for slaughter by-products.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was also necessary to eliminate the legal uncertainty with regard to the scope of the regulation concerning by-products from wild game. In line with the previous regulations on hygiene issues, operators will in future also be responsible for their products. I have said this already in connection with the other regulations. However, this must not lead to a reduction in official control.</p>
      <p sl="de">Through the new regulation we want to increase safety for citizens and not merely shift the responsibility. It is therefore important for operators handling by-products to be subject to approval. The particular operators that will require approval are clearly regulated. The fact that, in addition to a process of approval, there is also a process of registration is due to the desire to reduce bureaucracy. In future, we will certainly have to examine carefully whether the registration procedure will ensure a sufficient degree of safety. I also think that the uncertainty previously caused by the provisions on animal by-products from wild game has been eliminated. It is now clear that good hunting practice is crucial. Game gathered in the woods must not be used. I also think that we have complied with the wishes of many Members in allowing the appropriate feeding of necrophagous birds in certain regions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The ability to establish the end point of the life-cycle of by-products is a significant step forward. This will eliminate legal uncertainty and resolve many shortcomings and difficulties. We will have to examine whether the setting of the end point by the European Commission complies with the aforementioned criterion, namely legal certainty. I realise, of course, that it can vary from product to product and for that reason flexibility is needed, but I will also say to the Commission now that transparency is also needed so that it is also clear to the user.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then we come to the crucial point, which, for me, is always the issue of comitology. Too many rules in the new regulation are implemented using the comitology procedure. We must examine this carefully. We know, of course, that as MEPs we have the chance to play our part here, but we also know from practice that we are not at all in a position to monitor or examine all comitology procedures. For this reason, I welcome the fact that the Commission has said that it wishes to present its proposals to the Committee on the Environment prior to their adoption. That is a good approach, because there are very many forms of comitology. I believe that we are on the right path here.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will make a couple of comments on other topics at the end of the debate.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today Parliament will be asked to vote on a common position based on the proposal for a new regulation on animal by-products presented by the Commission. At this time, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, which has made it possible to arrive at this common position, and for his knowledge of the rules in the veterinarian sector that has made it possible to achieve a positive and agreed outcome. My colleague, Mrs Vassiliou, apologises for not being present at this debate in person, but she has asked me to give her personal thanks to the rapporteur for all that he has done and the efforts he has made to achieve the goal.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the Commission, we are, of course, also grateful to the shadow rapporteurs, who have seen this this work through in a constructive manner, as the rapporteur stressed in his speech, and through this collaboration it has thus also been possible to incorporate into the common position the chief concerns expressed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Like the rapporteur, I would also like to thank the French Presidency, which did a lot of work, although it was aware that it would not itself attain the final result, and the Czech Presidency, which invested great efforts to obtain a clear and consistent mandate for the negotiations with Parliament. The Commission therefore gives its definite support to the common position.</p>
      <p sl="it">This text clarifies the relationship between health rules and environmental rules and thus contributes to the objectives of ‘better regulation’. The rules on which Parliament is about to vote will permit a wider use of by-products of animal origin, which currently cannot be put to any good use, but does so while ensuring appropriate safety conditions. There will also be a reduction in administrative costs, and this will enable operators to be more competitive. All this will be of vital importance in allowing them to respond dynamically to the challenges of the future, whether these derive from imports from non-EU countries or from new technological developments in the use of by-products.</p>
      <p sl="it">The new rules will also be fully consistent with the goal of protecting biodiversity and – the most important aspect of all – will make it possible to maintain a high level of protection within the European Union against public health and animal health risks.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the draft report by Mr Schnellhardt and would like to thank him for his fine work. After the numerous crises in recent years in connection with products of animal origin that pose a risk to human and animal health, a comprehensive statutory regulation is essential. A revision of the current regulation was necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now, as before, we need to ensure a high degree of safety. Although we essentially support the report, there are a few points which give me cause for concern. Many points in the regulation have been made less stringent and thus make trade in animal by-products somewhat easier. Let me give some examples of what I am talking about. It is permitted to use certain Category 1 material in pet food. Category 2 or 3 material may, irrespective of the risk associated with it, be disposed of more easily, under official supervision, if there are only small quantities of waste per week. The risk associated with animal by-products of any category is only partly determined by its quantity. It remains the case that it is the European Commission that will enact the implementing regulation and, like its predecessor, the draft contains a lot of authorisations for the Commission. This means that the Commission can lay down comprehensive and fundamental regulations for handling animal by-products in the comitology procedure, with the result that Parliament – as is unfortunately often the case – is excluded.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The main objective of the regulation before us is the guarantee of hygiene and human health and safety. I would now, however, like to mention another detail, which is important for protecting biodiversity and small-scale entrepreneurship in nature tourism in my country. I am pleased that political consensus was found within Parliament and also with the Council of Ministers to resolve this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is about small-scale operations which take the carcasses of dead animals on farms with livestock, in pigsties for example, directly to feeding sites in the country for wild animals to feed on. This is important, for example, in Spain, to maintain the wild bird of prey population. In Finland such practices saved the white-tailed eagle from extinction back in the times when its natural food supply was too contaminated owing to chemical toxins, and when white-tailed eagles would not have been able to breed just by surviving on natural food sources.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In the northern, very sparsely populated parts of Finland, nature photographers use this method to attract wild animals to places where they can be photographed, and small travel companies also organise bear watching safaris, for example. I am very glad that this legislation would provide a solution which would safeguard human health and safety but also preserve small-scale tourism entrepreneurship and the use of the method to protect biodiversity.</p>

I would put very high on my agenda, too, making maximum use of all natural resources, including animal by-products. I should like to thank our rapporteur, Horst Schnellhardt, for his excellent work in accommodating all our concerns and also for the excellent outcome of his discussions with the European Council. Personally, I regret the removal of the reference to the Waste Incineration Directive, but I do not have time to expand on that here.</p>
      <p sl="en">I had one amendment tabled asking for assurances that there should be a clear distinction made between animal by-products moved in large volumes between Member States and at risk of entering the food or feed chain and specialist animal by-products for pharmaceutical and other diagnostic and research use; the latter are safe-sourced high-value products which are transported between Member States in very small volumes to and from registered suppliers, processers and users.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate has shown broad support for the common position on animal by-products, and this enables the Commission to proceed with the next stage. The Commission will prepare the implementing provisions for the new regulation in the light of your comments today, we will listen attentively to the experiences of operators, we will talk with our partners at international level and we will be fully transparent with Parliament during the whole of the process.</p>
      <p sl="it">I can thus confirm to the rapporteur the commitment already made by the Commission in relation to comitology and the optional provisions. Regarding the question raised by Mrs Doyle, I wanted to say that the current regulation already recognises the particular food needs of certain wild species and allows the Member States to use by-products for feeding wild animals, provided that the health risks are appropriately controlled.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, recently it has been stressed that the Commission should step up efforts to preserve biodiversity. For this reason, the Commission agrees with the decision by the legislator to extend the terms on the feeding of animal species protected in their natural habitats with by-products of animal origin; whereas the current rules refer to vultures and eagles, the new regulation will also make it possible to find appropriate solutions for wolves and bears.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the basis of recent experience, we are also considering the advisability of laying down arrangements which would go beyond the current system of fixed points for the feeding of protected species with animal carcasses, particularly for extensive breeding systems, provided that specific health standards are abided by. On this point, the Commission is ready to enter into dialogue with all the parties involved.</p>

      <p sl="de">I think that one would already need to act extremely illegally in order to be able to mix in this material. We will check whether a more stringent regulation is needed here. What we wanted to achieve with this new regulation was to enable the by-products of slaughter to be used in many ways and in that regard I can also say to Mrs Doyle that your concern is unfounded. Everything is the same as before. By establishing the end point for slaughter by-products, we have also very clearly stipulated that they will then become subject to totally different provisions, in other words we have clearly indicated the transfer to the Waste Framework Directive. I believe that we are on the right path here.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to mention that we naturally also want to address the issue of the rotten meat scandals with this new regulation. We are not completely on the right path yet in this regard, but with the labelling and the guaranteed traceability, I believe that we are heading in the right direction. Of course, we now need to see what sort of labelling the Commission will propose. This will not be particularly easy, as we all know the problem of the blue Chappi dog food – no one wants that. In this respect, we definitely need our researchers to choose an approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards the issue of organic fertilisers, which was also up for debate and has not yet been properly discussed, the Commission actually intended to provide for more thorough mixing-in of the material so that the animals did not even notice it. However, that would result in a change to the quality of the fertiliser and I believe that we have formulated a good regulation in this regard and that our small-scale gardeners who like organic fertilisers so much can also be appropriately provided for.</p>
      <p sl="de">By and large, then, this is a good regulation. I am very happy with it and with the cooperation, and I hope that we will not have to amend it again too soon. The cooperation with the Commission was very agreeable and for that I am very grateful.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, gender responsiveness is a measure of good governance anywhere in the world, but even more so in Afghanistan after the suffering endured by women for decades there. There cannot be true peace and recovery in Afghanistan without priority being given to respecting the human rights of women.</p>
      <p sl="en">This Shia family law allows marital rape, approves child marriage and bans wives from stepping outside their homes without their husbands’ permission. Women’s human rights and dignity cannot fall victim to pre-electoral negotiations with Islamic fundamentalists. The international community present in Afghanistan must put much more pressure on President Karzai and the Afghan authorities to come up with proper laws which respect the human rights of women, and policies that are committed to enacting those rights and respect their dignity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Like the Shia family law, the delaying of the Afghan media law, which was passed by the Afghan Parliament months ago by two thirds of the Parliament, is a tool by President Karzai to continue control of the state media, vital propaganda ahead of the presidential elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">The international community cannot allow this to go on. This law is fundamental to ensure that there is freedom of expression and of the media in Afghanistan. Without that, anything that we are doing in Afghanistan is not worth it. It is crucial that action is taken on these two laws and that the international community makes sure that the authorities in Afghanistan abide by their commitments, by their words, in terms of human rights, and respect in particular the rights of women.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the international community has been absolutely appalled at the information that we have all heard about the law that is being drafted in Afghanistan on the status of Shia women. It is appalling to believe that, at the beginning of the 21st century, a country that wants to be a democracy and wants to abide by its international commitments can have a law that limits the rights of women.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I believe that in our debate, and in everything that we do with Afghanistan, we have to be very careful how we approach things, because Afghanistan is a country that has come through a violent, repressive religious dictatorship; it has endured years and decades of civil war; it is a society in which people, more than buildings, have been hurt and destroyed.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to be very consistent in our messages, but we also have to be very careful in how we phrase those messages. We should call on the Afghan authorities to take a look at the law, to revise it and make sure that it is entirely in line with the international commitments of that country, as well as its constitution.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not use this as an election opportunity here for us in Europe but as something that we can pass on to our colleagues and friends in Afghanistan to make sure that they can fulfil the obligations that they have voluntarily undertaken themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this case we have to assist President Karzai and the Government of Afghanistan in revisiting this law and making sure that it is in line with international commitments and the constitution. It is part of our dialogue, and we have to be absolutely firm that no measures should be adopted that impede the rights of women.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree entirely with what Ana Maria Gomes has just said. But let us be very careful because, when we deal with a society that has been so traumatised, it is far more important how our messages are heard there than how our messages are understood here. Let us be very consistent in that and let us call on the Commission and the Council to pass on this message via all of our assistance programmes to the government and authorities in Afghanistan.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the final declaration of the Durban II Review Conference, which Afghanistan is taking part in, concluded only today on the absolute need to make all forms of violence against women criminal offences punishable by law and on the condemnation of any judicial arsenal based on discrimination, including religious discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, Afghanistan is promoting legislation that applies solely to the Shiite population and that clearly discriminates against women in the areas of marriage, divorce, child custody, inheritance and access to education.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is completely schizophrenic. What Afghanistan signs up to in Geneva, it cannot reject in Kabul. By taking part in the Durban II conference, Afghanistan has made firm commitments to eradicating multiple discrimination. It is imperative, for its credibility, that it starts taking action now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By refusing to pass this law, the minister of justice and the president would be showing their will to commit their country to complying with its human rights obligations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Equality between men and women is clearly enshrined in the Afghan constitution and in international conventions to which Afghanistan is a party. The authorities have a duty not to give in to extremism in any way and not to retreat. It is ultimately the future of a society that is being decided through this draft law, and Afghan society has already expressed its desire not to remain excluded from these debates.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Women are fighting and deserve all the support and all the protection of their country. It is up to the authorities to meet their obligations and demonstrate their ability to fulfil their commitments, and to the European civilian forces on the ground to support them in this ambitious reconstruction, and to set an example.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us not forget that the acts of violence committed by our armies and the fact that war is plunging Afghanistan into poverty are simply swelling the ranks of extremists.</p>

    <intervention id="5-052" speaker_id="4508" name="Erik Meijer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, two arguments are put forward for the foreign military presence in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The first argument is self-protection for the world outside of Afghanistan. Since 2001, the United States has lived in fear of new disasters if al-Qaeda were to use the territory of Afghanistan to prepare attacks once more. This is, therefore, about the self-interest of other states. This objective has largely been met.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The second argument, however, pertains to the position of the people of Afghanistan. It was the intention to free them from coercion and backwardness. The argument touches on the freedom of the press, the rights of religious minorities, individuals’ freedoms and, in particular, the protection of equal rights for women. For years, international news about Afghanistan has been dominated by stories about how girls were going to school again, women were no longer required to wear a veil, how they were now able to live as equal citizens, independent of their husbands, and how more and more women were entering the world of politics. The invasion resembled a feminist project.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Meanwhile, we can see that the events in Afghanistan more or less mirror those in Chechnya. Both countries were run by fundamentalist Islamic groups, something which external forces wanted to put an end to in both cases. A monstrous alliance was formed in both cases, one by the Americans, the other by the Russians, which means that, in a bid to control a particular group of Islamic fundamentalists, agreements are concluded with other Islamic fundamentalists. The upshot is that the pursuit of freedom, which was an important justification for the invasion, has been sacrificed in the process.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In Afghanistan, women are more and more being pushed back into the position they were in under the Taliban regime. Girls no longer go to school and women are disappearing from the political scene. There is now even a law that protects the right of men to sexual gratification without any say from the women involved. This is tantamount to rape. Meanwhile, journalists are now also being threatened with the death penalty by the State. This is a dead end. Europe should refuse to lend any more support to this situation.</p>

    <intervention id="5-053" speaker_id="4740" name="Marco Cappato" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the international community we are undoubtedly staking much of our credibility on events in Afghanistan. Emma Bonino, the leader of my political party, was arrested by the Taliban for her mere presence, as a European Commissioner, and was held in detention for some hours precisely because of her presence in defence of women’s rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">Despite the divisions and differing views on armed intervention, and regardless of the positions that have been taken, we cannot allow the situation to deteriorate in this way with regard to women’s rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">Six years ago, we, the Nonviolent Radical Party, organised a satyagraha: a non-violent world action advocating the presence of women among the ministers of the Afghan Government. Today what is needed is a new mobilisation of the international community to ensure that not only are women’s rights protected, but that women play a full part at the highest levels of political and institutional life.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need to clearly ensure that any collaboration we have with the Afghan Government is subject to prudence and caution, which has in any case been called for, but also to the greatest possible firmness of purpose, because it would really be misguided to think that some sort of Realpolitik towards the fundamentalist parties could end up producing peace in the long term in Afghanistan, as well as in our own cities and countries.</p>

    <intervention id="5-054" speaker_id="2229" name="Bernd Posselt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, 30 years ago during the autumn of 1979, this House adopted the first urgent resolution in relation to Afghanistan, the author of which was Otto von Habsburg, whom I worked with at that time. It related to a warning of the impending Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which then actually occurred a few months later.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since that time, this country has had a terrible history of suffering, and we ought to ask ourselves the question: what is Afghanistan? Firstly, it is in many respects a very ancient tribal society, which we cannot catapult into the 21st century in one fell swoop. Secondly, it is a country that attaches a great deal of importance to its independence, which it protected against British and Russian imperialism with a huge amount of effort. Thirdly, it is a country that suffered a lot during the 20th century and, as a result of a rather questionable intervention – this I say quite openly – by Western powers, is currently in a situation in which it has a president who many people there do not feel to be their own.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a very difficult mixed situation. In order to ensure that there is no misunderstanding, Mr Cappato knows that I am not one of the so-called ‘realist politicians’, I am, as far as human rights are concerned, not open to compromise. We must uncompromisingly oppose this law and the oppression of women. However, we must proceed in such a way as to succeed and so as not to create the impression that this is a form of external control. We must therefore find partners in this multi-ethnic society in Afghanistan and gradually build a modern society there.</p>
      <p sl="de">This means that we must support a political concept for Afghanistan rather than a purely military solution, as has been the case thus far. Therefore, the law needs to be revised. On this, we are totally unwilling to compromise, as we are paying out a great deal for this country in which we have a military presence. However, we must do this in a way that involves the Afghans and that respects their dignity, and as a top priority this of course includes – whether some people like it or not – the dignity of women.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in light of the signing of the Shia family law, which shows contempt for women, in Afghanistan, I urge the Commission to make the rights of women a central part of its Afghanistan strategy once again.</p>
      <p sl="de">In November 2002, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament sent a delegation under my leadership to Afghanistan in order to make sure that women were not being excluded in the reconstruction of the country. We held talks with President Karzai, numerous government representatives, women’s and human rights organisations, and we were very encouraged. An awakening to more in the way of safety, stability and prosperity for women, including without the burka, seemed to be within reach. The health system, education, training and the chance to earn a living were opened up to women after the Taliban rule. The highest child mortality rate in the world seemed to be improving. Through our intervention, a 25% quota for women was included in the new constitution for the first parliament that was to be elected and around four million refugees returned to their war-ravaged country.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, however, very little has happened in the last five years. Warnings from women’s rights organisations, such as medica mondiale, that violence must be stopped seemed to go totally unheeded, and at the beginning of April the radical Islamic Taliban in Kandahar murdered the German-Afghan women’s rights campaigner Sitara Achikzai. We were forced to discover that other women had been shot, such as the highest-ranking police officer. We must not sit back and watch this happen and do nothing about it. The civilian awakening is at serious risk. We must put a stop to this new Shia family law.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament resolution must state loud and clear that the law must be thrown out. If that does not succeed, international support for Afghanistan is also at risk if women’s rights are not respected. Either an awakening into the international community, which respects human rights, or regression into oppression by the Taliban is what is on the cards. This must be said loud and clear to Mr Karzai!</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, what disturbs me most about the change to the law introduced in Afghanistan is that women have had their right to medical treatment taken away. This is a result of the ban on going out of the home without the husband’s permission and also of the ban on undergoing medical examination.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Afghanistan is a country where, as a result of many years of civil war, the state of hospitals and their equipment is catastrophic. Access to water is hindered because of the deployment of landmines. Hygiene skills and knowledge about how to manage minor ailments without medical help are no longer passed from one generation to the next, as was traditionally the case. Mothers do not pass on to young women the fact that camomile can be used when bathing a baby, because of its disinfectant properties. All too often the mothers have simply been murdered. In addition to this dramatic situation, the obstruction of access to a doctor or a healthcare facility could have catastrophic consequences for an entire generation. We should strive to resolve this problem, in spite of cultural differences.</p>

      <p sl="nl">A saying in my country has it that ‘paper can wait’, which illustrates the chasm between lofty ideals and regulations on the one hand and day-to-day reality on the other. When we apply this saying to women’s rights in Afghanistan, we are left with a shocking picture.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The joint resolution is right to refer to the Afghan Constitution and the international agreements ratified by Kabul, which all claim equal rights for men and women and gender equality before the law. The real position of the women of Afghanistan tells a different story, however. In summary, the position of Afghan women can, roughly speaking, be outlined in 12 brief points, namely an average life expectancy of 44; a high death rate during childbirth (1 600 per 100 000 childbirths); only 14% of all women over the age of 15 can read; a low status, because women are owned by men; a frequent and increasing number of threats and intimidation of women in public roles, including murder; hardly any protection of Afghan women’s organisations from the local authorities or foreign troops against targeted attacks; it is the family that decides, in the main, whether girls can be educated; persistent attacks on girls’ schools – for example, in November 2008, eight schoolgirls and four women lecturers were mutilated in the town of Kandahar by the Taliban spraying acid in their faces; the continued threat of sexual violence in and outside of marriage; approximately 57% of all girls are married off before their 16th birthday; crimes committed against women are hardly reported for fear of retaliatory action by the family, tribe, perpetrators or even by the police; and self-mutilation, and even suicide, by Afghan women on account of their hopeless situations.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This depressing image of the position of Afghan women, which only scratches the surface, underlines the ultimate need to turn the paper reality of the legal status of Afghan women into a national, international, but also European political priority.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Afghanistan’s new law, effectively legalising rape in marriage and also child marriage for Shia women, threatens to take the country back to the medieval days of Taliban rule. Certainly this law makes it harder to distinguish, in terms of modernity and respect for women’s rights, between the elected Afghan Government and the Taliban terrorists against whom it is fighting.</p>
      <p sl="en">The law also makes it hard to justify the international community’s massive military and financial assistance to Afghanistan. I feel very uneasy about soldiers from my country, the United Kingdom, dying to defend a government that panders too much to extremist and obscurantist sentiments.</p>
      <p sl="en">To his credit, President Karzai has said this law will be repealed, but it has taken a great deal of international pressure, including this resolution from our Parliament, to get us to this stage. Also the repeal of this law should not obscure the fact that women in Afghanistan continue to suffer lack of schooling, injustice and discrimination on a daily basis. There is still a very long way to go to bring Afghanistan fully into the modern world and hold it to its binding international commitments.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, despite the fact that Afghanistan is a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and that the government of President Karzai has decreed the equality of both sexes in the eyes of the law and has guaranteed women a quarter of the seats in the Afghan Parliament, Afghan women are still being treated as second-class citizens in their own country</p>
      <p sl="pl">For many Afghan fundamentalists the place of women is in the home, and not at school or at work. An example of this is the law approved recently by both chambers of the Afghan Parliament and signed by the president, which states that only with the consent of their husband or father do women have the right to go out of their homes, study, apply for a job or receive medical care. In addition, the law gives legal custody of children exclusively to fathers and grandfathers. Fortunately, this law has not yet come into force. As a result of numerous protests, both in Afghanistan and from abroad, the draft law has been referred to the Afghan Ministry of Justice so that the conformity of the text with the constitution and international treaties can be verified.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Parliament should demand strongly that the Afghan authorities revoke this law, which without any doubt contravenes the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. In addition, we should make a clear call for the Afghan Ministry of Justice to abolish all other laws which discriminate against women. The European Union, as a community, must express support for all those who are fighting for women’s rights in Afghanistan, so that we do not allow the destruction of all that has up to now been achieved in this area.</p>

This act blatantly contravenes the agenda which we are promoting in Afghanistan, all the more so as the majority of NATO countries have announced that they are going to step up their involvement in the effort to bring stability to Afghanistan. The military aspect of the international presence in this country is certainly very important, perhaps even decisive, but this involvement is not only about guaranteeing peace and infrastructure investments, but also about a much more complex project: modernising Afghan society.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Who are we building schools for, when Afghan girls are discriminated against and not allowed access to education? No one is, of course, assuming that the new Afghan society should be a copy of Western societies, but we cannot let ourselves turn a blind eye to abuses and human rights violations in the name of respecting local cultural identities.

      <p sl="fr">We are closely monitoring the political developments on the ground, through our delegation and with the European Union special representative and the representatives of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We naturally respect the independence of the legislative process in Afghanistan, in particular with regard to the Constitution, which does indeed make provision, under Article 131, for the possibility of legislation devoted solely to the Shiite community. Nevertheless, along with our partners we have supported an approach targeting certain articles of that law that are scarcely compatible with the Afghan Constitution or the international law that the Afghan Government has signed up to.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union therefore made a representation to the Afghan Government on 12 April. In our representation, we specifically reminded the government of its obligations with regard to international conventions on civil and political rights, discrimination against women and children’s rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We pointed out that the proposed legislation would to a large extent prevent women from fully enjoying their rights and from participating fairly in the economic, social. cultural, civil and political life of Afghan society.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is likely that the international reaction and the reaction of Afghan civil society contributed to the Afghan Government’s decision to refer the legislation back to the minister of justice for a general review, with the latter being focused in particular on Afghanistan’s obligations in terms of international law. It goes without saying that this review will be conducted entirely under the authority of the Afghan Government. In view of the political background of this country, it is essential that its government assume its responsibilities in full within the framework of the legislative and institutional process.</p>

      <p sl="en">Since the overthrowing of Taliban, the situation in Afghanistan has improved, however in reality, there have not been many positive developments as far as human rights are concerned. The continuous violations against women are absolutely unacceptable and it is highly important for the European Union to put pressure on Afghan government in order to get the situation under control. Even more outrageous than several controversial laws concerning the equality between men and women, is the fact, that men are still widely being regarded higher than women in Afghan society itself.

      <p sl="ro">One of the problems affecting justice systems in many countries around the world is not so much the absence of a well-structured legal framework, but more particularly the lack of enforcement of the judgments made by the justice system. In countries afflicted by the scourge of civil war, a permanent state of conflict or massacres, the consequences of this situation are catastrophic from a humanitarian and development perspective.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the case of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, it is all the more important that legal judgments are enforced because this court is establishing a series of important precedents in international law. It is not only the first court of this kind set up in the same country as where the events being tried took place, but it is the first which has indicted and convicted, in the person of Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, an African head of state still in office at the time when the trial started.</p>
      <p sl="ro">These aspects, combined with the recent conviction of three former rebel leaders from the civil war period, are strong indications of the determination of the international community and Sierra Leone Government to fight hard against the feeling of impunity displayed by those who have committed atrocities for an entire decade.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The international community must fully complete the implementation of the project proposed for reinforcing the process of justice and law in Sierra Leone. The Court’s mandate comes to an end soon, in 2010, and the Sierra Leone Government has been totally frank about not being able to ensure that the sentences passed will be enforced.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is vital therefore for the European Union and its international partners involved in the peace process to uphold and support the enforcement of the sentences passed by the Special Court. It is not only the progress towards peace and stability in the region which depends on this, but also the credibility of the Special Courts set up with the support of the international community in other countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, international humanitarian law is a relatively new and somewhat imperfect body of jurisprudence, but it has already achieved some major successes. In Europe the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia has paid an immensely important role in bringing justice to a region torn apart by a series of savage wars. Similarly, a tribunal in Tanzania has been prosecuting those responsible for the Rwandan genocide of 1994.</p>
      <p sl="en">We therefore know the potential of such courts to help war-torn regions by ending a climate of impunity and moving on. In many ways justice delivered in this way is as valuable as financial assistance from the European Union. That is why the international community should continue to support the Special Court for Sierra Leone by providing secure jail facilities in the Member States, if necessary and when required, for jailing convicted tyrants.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of my proudest achievements in this Parliament was my role in this Parliament’s resolution calling for Nigeria to hand over Charles Taylor to the Court, which is what eventually happened through the mediation of the UN. But there are plenty of others who will escape unpunished without a robust and well-funded special court for Sierra Leone.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, two years ago I had the opportunity, as part of a mission headed by Mrs Isler Béguin, my colleague, who is in the Chamber here, to visit Sierra Leone, to attend the Special Court and to become aware of the huge task that it was accomplishing, not only for Sierra Leona, but also for mankind as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Special Court for Sierra Leone has of course set a precedent, as has already been mentioned here. It has set a precedent in that, as the resolution states, it is the first international court to be funded by voluntary contributions, the first to be established in the country where the alleged crimes took place and it was also the first court – as has already been pointed out – to indict a former head of state.</p>
      <p sl="es">For all these reasons, not only because it constitutes a precedent, but also because it is a benchmark for other courts that have been created and modelled along the same lines – such as the courts of Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, Cambodia or Lebanon – we consider it vital that this resolution, on which we have now been working together with the court for several months, be adopted.</p>
      <p sl="es">Two years ago we adopted a resolution to support its funding, since at that time the Special Court was going through a difficult period, was without any funds and did not have the necessary support – and here we should thank the European Commission too, which gave the court its financial support.</p>
      <p sl="es">Now we are asking, above all, for two things: firstly, that those who have been convicted should serve their sentences – what is at stake here is not the operation of the Special Court, which will conclude its work next year, but the legacy that it is to leave us – and, secondly, obviously, that all this should be accompanied by more funding.</p>
      <p sl="es">In short, the Special Court for Sierra Leone is a fine example and a benchmark for all of us and for all courts that have dealt with war crimes. It is a fine example and a benchmark and it is a lesson being given to us by the second-poorest country on the planet: as we entered the court, we saw the slogan ‘no peace without justice’. That is exactly why we have a moral obligation, not only as Europeans, but as human beings, to ensure that the legacy of this Special Court leaves its mark on history.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Sierra Leone, like its neighbour Liberia, has been faced with full-scale atrocities, as a result of which many citizens lost their lives or became seriously injured, mentally or physically.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The criminals who got child soldiers to cut off the limbs of innocent citizens should be punished and not be given an opportunity to repeat their crimes. It looks like the attempt to organise this punishment between 2000 and 2010 is set to fail. The UN’s Special Court for Sierra Leone is unable to function. Anyone found guilty cannot be locked up in Sierra Leone for any decent length of time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The question now is what can we still do to guarantee a better outcome? The Court will not succeed without external funding, an extension of its mandate or without prison places outside of Sierra Leone. The resolution is right to draw attention to these options. This statement must lead to measures quickly. Otherwise it will be too late.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in Poland we sometimes say that ‘what you begin, you should also finish’. This is very relevant to today’s debate, which, above all, is about financial support for the Special Court for Sierra Leone. It is true that we are in the middle of a crisis, and the Court, which is maintained from voluntary contributions made by various countries, absorbs large sums of money. We must not, however, allow this body, which is the only one of its kind, to end its work in international disgrace – and it would be a disgrace, if for financial reasons the Court ceased to function and the accused were released.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union, and especially, in my opinion, the United Nations, are obliged to carry the work of the Court through to completion, to ensure financial support and to carry out the sentences handed down by the Court.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The work of the Court and its high costs are the subject of much controversy in Sierra Leone itself, because a great many people there are waiting for compensation, and Sierra Leone is one of the world’s poorest countries. This is why, when judging the past, we should not forget the future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Special Court for Sierra Leone has sentenced Issa Hassan Sesay, the Commanding Officer of the Revolutionary United Front, to 52 years’ imprisonment. It has also sentenced Morris Kallon, one of the commanders of the RUF, to 40 years’ imprisonment, and Augustine Gbao, responsible for security in the RUF, to 25 years’ imprisonment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">They organised one of the most cruel rebel movements of modern times. Drastic mutilations of the civilian population, and in particular amputations of limbs on a massive scale, sexual violence as a weapon, enrolling children in the army – these are only some of the brutal methods used by the RUF, which was commanded by the defendants.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A heavy sentence in their case is a strong signal which should restrain others from committing similar acts, and a sign that the civilised, democratic world will not stay silent, and has a strong tool for reacting to the perpetrators of such atrocities. That tool is the Court, and the Court should be supported, both financially and politically.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission has made a strong commitment to assisting the transition by Sierra Leone from a post-war situation to a situation of growth and development. The Commission certainly supports the country’s commitment to the consolidation of peace, stability and, above all, democracy.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this regard, the Commission recognises and welcomes the vital role that the Special Court for Sierra Leone has played and continues to play within the context of the reinstatement of peace and stability in Sierra Leone. We are convinced that the Special Court’s activities can transmit to all the message that no serious crime against humanity, no genocide and no war crime will remain unpunished.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Special Court for Sierra Leone has, in fact, played an essential part in the development of international law, by virtue of the case law that has been created on issues such as the recruitment of child soldiers and forced marriages, which were the subject of the Special Court’s first judgments. To this end, the Commission has been supporting the Special Court’s activities since 2003. We have given the Special Court EUR 2 700 000 through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. The aim of this funding is to support the activities of the Special Court on communicating its objectives of promoting the rule of law, international humanitarian law and human rights in Sierra Leone and the region of western Africa as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, in 2008 the Commission adopted a project, funded by EUR 1 million, under the 10th European Development Fund, conceived together with the Special Court and the Sierra Leone Government. The project, which is to be carried out during 2009 and 2010, will integrate previous activities and sets out to ensure a lasting legacy on which to rely after the conclusion of the Special Court’s activities, in particular through the capacity-building of legal professionals and the strengthening of institutional capacity within the Sierra Leone legal system as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="it">Having been informed of the Special Court’s budget problems, in 2008 the Commission provided it with emergency aid to the tune of EUR 2.5 million, funded from the Instrument for Stability and intended to cover the funding costs, and chiefly the salaries, of the Special Court’s employees. On this point, the Commission was pleased to learn that the Special Court has managed to cover the budget deficit for several months. We are confident that, despite the world financial crisis, the international community will manage to find the resources necessary for the Special Court to carry out its tasks successfully and in full, and to complete the trial of Charles Taylor, former president of Liberia.</p>
      <p sl="it">Before I conclude, I would like to express my support for the request for further examination and investigation into the roles and functions of the various special courts, and on this point I am pleased to inform you, on behalf of the Commission, that two initiatives are to be funded in this sector under the human rights ‘conflicts and security’ heading within the Seventh Framework Programme on research.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, some in this Chamber want to present the People’s Mujahedin as heroes or a true alternative to the Iranian regime. They are neither.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my trips to Iraq, I have heard Kurdish, Sunni, Shia, Christian, Turkman leaders and others complain about the role of the People’s Mujahedin as a tool of Saddam Hussein in the 1988 Anfar campaign, which culminated in massacres such as Halabja. That is what the Iraqi delegation which was here this week also confirmed to us, while assuring us that the Iraqi constitution binds the Government of Iraq to fully respect the human rights of the residents of Camp Ashraf, who, with the help of UNHCR and ICRC, wish to leave for Iran or any other destination, or wish to stay as political refugees abiding by the laws of Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must understand the reluctance of the Iraqi Government to let Camp Ashraf continue to be a nuisance to their good neighbourly relations with Iran. For Iraqis, Iran cannot be wished away. It is there. It is a powerful neighbour. It is true that the People’s Mujahedin are no longer on the terrorist list, but they are still an opaque cult which brutalises those of its members who wish to defect. Above all, the people in Camp Ashraf are human beings whose human rights have to be respected, irrespective of the fate of the organisation itself or of its past. They are to be treated under the 1951 Refugee Convention and no one – I repeat, no one – should be forced to return to Iran.</p>
      <p sl="en">But let us make one thing clear. This resolution is not about the Iranian regime, which has been repressing its people, mismanaging the country and destabilising the Middle East for decades. Anyone who presents a vote for the PSE and Green amendments, which aim to balance the tone of this resolution, as a vote for the Iranian regime, is either arguing in bad faith or has simply run out of arguments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The spirit of our amendments is quite simple. We want to present the whole picture of human rights violations and threats in and around Camp Ashraf. For example, we request that all Camp Ashraf residents be allowed to be interviewed by the ICRC and UNHCR at a neutral location and without People’s Mujahedin officials in attendance, in order to clarify their real wishes. Also we must call on the Mujahedin leadership to stop controlling the lives of the residents of Camp Ashraf, namely by not letting them leave the camp. Above all, we express our concern about the reported practices of mental and physical manipulation and severe human rights violations within the cult. In short, this is about the individual human rights of the people in Camp Ashraf. Let us have these people and their human rights in mind when we vote.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this morning we will be voting on a joint motion for a resolution co-signed by four political groups on the situation of the Ashraf refugee camp in Iraq. Three thousand five hundred Iranian men and women, members of the democratic opposition to the fundamentalist regime in Iran, live there completely defenceless. In the last few weeks they have been under pressure and harassment by the faction of the Iraqi Government under the influence of the Iranian regime, and there is a high probability that at any moment a tragedy could happen that would parallel the ones we witnessed in the Balkans not so long ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all remember Srebrenica, and I have no doubt that no Member in this Chamber wants a second Srebrenica in Iraq. Our motion for a resolution is a call to alert public opinion all over the world before a disaster takes place. Unfortunately, some colleagues have tabled amendments that could increase the danger for the residents in Camp Ashraf and provide the Iranian regime and its proxies in Iraq with arguments to massacre them.</p>
      <p sl="en">I recently visited the camp myself and I assure you that the allegations included in the amendments tabled are absolutely unfounded. People in Ashraf are there on a volunteer basis. They are free to leave whenever they want and they live in the best friendly relations with the Iraqi population of the region. The intention of our motion is to protect these people. Nobody would understand – but if these amendments are adopted the result of the motion would be exactly the opposite.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not a political issue, colleagues: it is purely humanitarian and it is very urgent. I beg you to vote against all amendments tabled to this joint motion supported by these four groups and support the motion as it has been agreed by these four groups that are of very different political stances. The lives of many innocent and harmless people depend on your vote. Please do not let them down.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group has not signed this resolution and we will only vote in favour of it if the amendments that I have tabled together with the author, Mrs Gomes, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are adopted.</p>
      <p sl="de">It relates to the dispute over the Mujahedin or the MKO. This is not a democratic opposition. I would like to say a few things about it. The MKO is a degenerate organisation, which is tantamount to a religious sect and which severely oppresses its own members, including within the camp. Mental and physical pressure is used to force the members to stay in this camp. Those who refuse have their relationships destroyed, they are forced to divorce and their children are taken away – one of the most brutal means of oppression.</p>
      <p sl="de">The MKO has totally isolated all MKO members living inside and outside the camp. All access to the international press or media is prohibited. All of the interviews conducted by the US took place in the presence of MKO cadres, which meant that the people could not talk about their real problems and concerns.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the past, MKO members from northern Iraq were handed over to Saddam Hussein’s henchmen and were shamefully tortured and killed in camp Abu Greib. These are just a few examples and explanations for the joint amendments which I urge you to support. Anyone who rejects these – and I want to say this very clearly – and anyone who adopts the present resolution text unchanged, is voting in favour of allowing the MKO to carry on its policy of oppression in a camp that it controls. You will then also be partly responsible for what the MKO is currently threatening to do, namely that if the camp is broken up under international supervision, it will call on its members there to incinerate themselves. That is clearly the opposite of what we want to do here and therefore I urge you to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the PSE and my group.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for 30 years Iran has been ruled by a theocratic dictatorship. That dictatorship not only forces the inhabitants to live in conformity with its religious standards but also tries to kill everyone who does not conform to its system. The consequence is that many Iranians have to live in exile, not only in Europe but also in the neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">After the Anglo-American military invasion in Iraq, the Iranians who live there in exile got a guarantee of protection from Iran. Now the foreign troops are preparing to withdraw from Iraq. I support this withdrawal, but an unforeseen consequence could be that the theocratic regime in Iran would get an opportunity to attack the opposition outside its own borders. It strives for the deportation of those people to Iran in order to kill them. Inside Iraq there is much solidarity with the Iranians in exile. However, the power of Iran in Iraq has grown because the majority of the inhabitants in Iraq, too, is Shiite Muslim.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through written questions to the Council I have drawn its attention to the position of the 3 400 people living in Camp Ashraf. The only answer was that the Council had not discussed this matter. Today, we are discussing a very important urgent resolution on Camp Ashraf. In two previous resolutions in 2007 and 2008, our Parliament confirmed the legal status of the Ashraf inhabitants under the Fourth Geneva Convention. Today, our Parliament is paying special attention to the current situation by adopting a resolution only on Ashraf. This text is a joint text, adopted by most political groups, and it is balanced. It wants to send a strong message to the Iraqi Government that the rights of these 3 400 people in Ashraf, including 1 000 women, cannot be violated because of the pressures of the mullahs in Iran.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we must send a united message, without amendments that would undermine and weaken this resolution, which only covers the humanitarian issues of Ashraf residents. We have to avoid any changes to the final text of the resolution that would complicate the situation or endanger the lives of these defenceless people.</p>
      <p sl="en">The inhabitants of Ashraf were bombed by US forces at the beginning of the invasion in 2003. Later on, they were screened by the USA. The Iraqi Government has also screened every one of the people in Ashraf – this took place during April this year. Every one of them was interviewed, outside Ashraf. They were encouraged and urged to leave the camp or go to Iran. Only six of them agreed to leave – six out of 3 400 people! So we have to respect their decision.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the situation of Camp Ashraf, home to 3 500 members of the main democratic opposition of Iran, the PMOI, has been of great concern for some time and has been the subject of several resolutions in this House in recent years. Together with a delegation of four Members of this House, I visited Camp Ashraf in October last year and met with American, Iraqi and UN officials there. They all reinforced our concern for the legal status of Ashraf’s residents, because its security was transferred from American troops to Iraqi forces at the beginning of this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation has got much worse since then. The Iranian supreme leader, in an official announcement at the end of February, asked the visiting Iraqi President to implement the mutual agreement to close down Camp Ashraf and expel all its residents from Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since then Iraqi forces have started a siege around the camp. Iraqi troops have been preventing entry of families of Ashraf residents, parliamentary delegations, human rights organisations, lawyers, journalists and even doctors to the camp, and do not allow many logistical materials to get into Ashraf.</p>
      <p sl="en">This Parliament therefore found it absolutely necessary to address this as an urgency issue at this stage. We have now worked together with all groups and produced a common text, which is well balanced and addresses all our concerns on this matter, and calls on international bodies to find a long-term legal status for Ashraf residents.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately there are some amendments tabled by some of the spokesmen for Tehran, those who believe the lies told by Tehran. I think we should understand clearly that these are contrary to the security of the residents of Ashraf and we should vote against them. We urge all colleagues to stick to the joint text and reject any amendments.</p>

The reason why we are debating this point today under the urgent procedure is the risk that these persons may be deported en masse and that all their rights with regard to the Iranian regime may be infringed once and for all.</p>
      <p sl="it">Certainly, questions can be raised about the level and extent of democracy in the People’s Mujahedin of Iran, their organisation, but this is not the subject of the debate that we must have, and this is not the reason why we asked for the urgent procedure to be used. The reason why we have requested the application of the urgent procedure is to prevent this small town from being attacked as a whole, for its fundamental rights to be swept away and for it to be consigned to the hands of the Iranian dictatorship.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is why the amendments that have been tabled are liable simply to confuse the naked urgency and necessity of this message, and that is why I hope they will not be adopted.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I believe that Alejo Vidal-Quadras, a good friend of mine, and others who have spoken are profoundly mistaken and that we should support the amendments, because the Iraqi Government has announced on more than one occasion recently that it has no intention whatsoever of forcing the inhabitants of Camp Ashraf to leave for Iran or to go to any other country.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Iraqi Government has repeatedly requested different countries, including many EU Member States, to receive them, and we have not agreed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of the 3 400 people living in the camp, 1 015 hold residence permits from, and enjoy resident status in, different countries, many of which are EU Member States, and we are not accepting these people. Why?</p>
      <p sl="de">Most of the camp’s inhabitants received professional military training during the previous Saddam Hussein regime and they participated with his presidential guards and with other security forces in the violent crushing of the Iraqi people’s popular uprising after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is ample evidence that these people harmed the Iraqi people when the Iraqi army refused to carry out the killings that Saddam Hussein required. The families of the victims in Iraq cannot forget this fact, and the Iraqi Constitution does not permit the presence of groups such as the NKO or the PKK on Iraqi soil.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two thousand of these people have registered themselves with the High Commissioner for Refugees, hoping to be transferred to other countries ready to accept them, and for several years now the Iraqi Government has been working closely with UNHCR asking other countries to accept them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Dear colleagues, this is the business of Iraq. The sovereignty of Iraq is at stake, and we should place our trust in this democratically elected Government of Iraq. This is their right, their duty, and I can assure you they are fulfilling it correctly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have never been a great fan of the People’s Mujahedin of Iran, whose philosophical origins are Islamist-Marxist – which is a contradiction in terms – and they were of course for many years under the protection of Saddam Hussein, the butcher of Baghdad, whom they supported militarily.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, in recent years they have reformed, and have given valuable information to the West about human rights violations in Iran and the geographical location of Iran’s secret uranium enrichment facilities. It was therefore questionable if they should have remained on the EU banned terrorist list. What is unquestionable, in my view, is that the residents of Camp Ashraf deserve legal protection in Iraq from its Government and the allied forces, and do not deserve deportation to Iran, where they face almost certain torture and possible execution.</p>

      <p sl="en">I want to put on record that the original Socialist text clearly opposes any question of forced deportation, and calls for full compliance with the Geneva Convention and full access by international human rights organisations. To Mr Vidal-Quadras and others, having myself sought to get a compromise by getting cross-party support only for Amendments 2, 3 and 6 and then the Socialist support for the joint resolution, it is a complete distortion to say that these amendments could be used as a pretext to massacre residents. Whether people support or criticise the PMOI, in a human rights debate no one in this Chamber should disagree with amendments which seek to support human rights obligations on any or all parties anywhere in the world.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am now going to speak in French. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission regularly monitors the development of the situation in Iraq, particularly in relation to Camp Ashraf.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As we all know, in January 2009 the Iraqi Government took back control of that area. With regard to the humanitarian situation in the camp, the Commission has been informed by the International Committee of the Red Cross and other international organisations that have been monitoring the development of the situation that no significant deterioration in living conditions or any breaches of international conventions have been reported.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission entirely agrees with the view that the closure of the camp should be within a legal framework, and that the lives and physical or moral well-being of its residents should not be threatened. International humanitarian standards should be applied, not least the principle of non-return.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On several occasions the Iraqi Government has said that it is prepared to treat the residents of the camp decently and that it did not have any intention of illegally deporting the members of this organisation or forcing them to leave Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With this in mind, the Commission nevertheless stresses the need, as always, to respect the rule of law, and is counting on the Iraqi Government to act accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When they met with the Commission in March 2009, the Iraqi authorities reiterated their commitment to respecting international humanitarian standards and not using force, and in particular to not conducting forced returns to Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Iraqi Human Rights Minister is currently holding individual meetings with the residents in order to establish their rights and determine whether they wish to return to Iraq or leave for a third country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Over recent weeks, some members have chosen to leave the camp and have been able to do so without encountering any difficulties. The Commission supports these efforts. If the residents of the camp wish to leave, the Iraqi Government must authorise them to settle in another country and facilitate the process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission, in cooperation with the representatives of the Member States on the ground, will continue to monitor the progress of the situation.</p>

This would help, to a large extent, to also make the Council’s and other institutions’ discharge procedure work successfully. This is why I am suggesting that the postponement of the Council’s autumn discharge procedure should only be accepted, provided that the Council also puts this report on its agenda. This would be extremely important to ensure that the Council also accepts those regulations which are pending and would guarantee transparency in the spending of European funds.

But we also have to understand the unintended consequences of our actions sometimes, and if we seek to crack down too much on lower-tax regimes and lower-tax areas, rather than just driving money from one country to another, we will drive much-needed capital, much-needed innovation and much-needed entrepreneurship out of Europe altogether.</p>

      <p sl="en">I agree with the comments that have been made about tax competition being a good thing. I think it is a good thing. I think anybody who looked at this independently would say it is a good thing. People often say, well, isn’t it easy for you – you have 12.5% corporation tax in Ireland, and I say, well why don’t you have a 12.5% corporation tax in your country, if that is the problem? But there is an issue here, and we need to put down the marker about tax evasion. That is a criminal offence, and we really have to ensure that we do not become too close to those who practise these types of evasions.</p>

The PPE-DE did not support Amendments 17 and 54 which were passed in committee, because it agreed with the Commission proposal – we are opposed to the introduction of intra-state markings, because they represent a barrier to the internal market and we agree that Member States should eliminate all national references demonstrating conformity other than the CE mark.</p>

Like everybody – and you all know this – as a Member of the European Parliament they immediately think a number of things. Firstly, that you are on the gravy train and you do not really care about ordinary people, and secondly that Europe is not working: there are too many regulations. Maybe in some cases they are right – there should be a cost-benefit analysis of what the regulations are – and they are badly implemented, in fact not uniformly implemented across the continent.</p>

On the contrary, the situation in Camp Ashraf is in the public domain and numerous people, including members of parliament and journalists, have visited the camp and drawn their own conclusions. The residents of Camp Ashraf are protected persons under the Geneva Convention.

      <p sl="it">Thank you, Madam President. I voted for the report.</p>
      <p sl="it">The core subject-matter of Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 is cross-border transfers and cross-border electronic payment operations. The regulation was adopted on 19 December 2001 and its aim is to ensure that the cost of a cross-border payment is the same as a payment made within a Member State.</p>
      <p sl="it">Up until 1 January 2006, it applied only to transfers, withdrawals from automatic teller machines and to payments made with a debit or credit card up to EUR 12 500 in EU countries, whereas, from that date, the amount has been increased to EUR 50 000. This change has led to a fall in prices and greater competition on the payment services markets. Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 also has drawbacks, however, such as the failure to define ‘corresponding payments’ and the failure to include a review clause, and it is necessary to take action on these points immediately.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to conclude by saying that we are in favour of the proposals to update and amend Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001, since it is our duty to make cross-border payment transactions easier and more economical.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted for the Schnellhardt report on the regulation laying down health rules as regards animal by-products not intended for human consumption, as I consider that the proposals contained in this document will substantially improve the safety of these products, particularly by ensuring traceability throughout the treatment process. Food safety and consumer protection in the EU will thus be reinforced.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This report will enable the European Union to equip itself with a more precise legislative framework with which to increase the level of safety throughout the food production and distribution chain. The merits of this text are that it proposes a method that is based more on risks and controls, and makes the regulations on animal by-products and the legislation on hygiene more consistent, while also introducing additional rules on the traceability of animal by-products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I can also tell you that Mr Schnellhardt’s previous report on the hygiene of foodstuffs (2002) had a very positive impact by making the European game sector aware of its responsibilities. The transposition of this regulation into national law has had positive effects on the ground, including by improving the training of seven million European hunters, who, as a result of working in that environment all the time, are in a position quickly and effectively to detect health crises affecting wild fauna.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore support this report, which will enable the European Union to better anticipate and react to any potential food crises linked to products of animal origin.</p>

    <intervention id="5-223" speaker_id="38595" name="Rovana Plumb" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="ro">I voted for this report because in Romania as well as in other Member States we are sometimes faced with crises which affect public and animal health safety in relation to animal products, such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, dioxin, swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease. Such crises can also have a wider adverse impact on the socio-economic situation of farmers and the industrial sectors affected, including a decline in consumer confidence in the safety of animal products. Disease outbreaks can also have adverse consequences for the environment: disposal of the bodies and biodiversity. We needed to review the regulation on animal by-products (ABP) not intended for human consumption from a legislative perspective.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This will therefore resolve problems linked to differences in interpretation of the scope of the regulation and the problems caused by this, such as: distortion of competition and the different levels of protection against the risks to public and animal health; ABP classification based to a larger extent on risks; clarification of derogations (e.g. impact of ABPs on research, disease outbreaks, natural disasters); reduction in the administrative burden by eliminating the duplication of permits for certain types of economic units.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The review upholds the principles used to regulate in the EU the use, processing, disposal, traceability and allocation of ABPs not intended for human consumption, thereby ensuring a high level of food safety and consumer protection.</p>

I am in favour of a withholding tax, that is, enabling each citizen to pay his tax in full to the Member State of which he is a taxpayer, by paying a reasonable tax (20 or even 25%). This tax should be applied to natural and legal persons, should be collected at source by the financial body where money (securities, bonds, and so on) is managed, and should be transferred to the taxpayer’s taxation department.

However, we believe that, in their current form, the Commission’s proposal and the report before us raise more questions than they provide answers to. The EU has a long-term ambition to reduce the regulatory burden. The Commission’s proposal seems to be heading in the opposite direction and runs the risk of increasing the administrative burden, in particular for small businesses in Europe.

The key problem for me, though, remains the fact that Parliament tenaciously clings to the Lisbon Treaty as if it were the great saviour. Naturally, we will not make any progress in this way. It remains a fight to the finish, and eventually, only democracy and the credibility of a democratic European project are set to suffer. Needless to say, I completely disagree with extending the application of the ‘blue card’ system. This is something I feared from the beginning, and this fear has become reality. As ever, the typical European salami policy, whereby decisions are taken piecemeal and the effects of subsequent decisions are kept secret in the meantime, must be rammed down our throats.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The G20 Summit and the awareness of the need for a coordinated and cooperative response to the current world economic situation are an expression of the positive side to globalisation. No longer are there solitary powers, independent economies or dispensable globalised countries. On the contrary, those countries experiencing much worse conditions than these ‘victims’ of the crisis, but which have not been involved in globalisation, as is the case with most of the African countries, still have their problems and remain outside the solution. That is the problem to which no solution is being given.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The other lesson of these times is that the only alternative to the market economy is a market economy that functions better. That is the road to be taken.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, I must underline that the capacity to respond to the crisis very much depends on whether or not there is the capacity to reform national economies and create conditions of flexibility. At the same time as responding to the financial crisis, we need to respond to the paradigm shift in the world economy. Otherwise, we will experience a deep but cyclical crisis, without solving the structural problems in our economies.</p>

      <p sl="en">First, dealing with ‘systemic risks’: the international institutions need to be strengthened to face future threats. Inside the EU a sole authority such as the ECB must be considered for reasons of coordinating strong actions when urgently required.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the revamping of existing legislation and introduction of new legislation which recognises the specific needs of sectors of the financial services industry, in particular Solvency II and CRD, are vital elements which contribute to the management of risk. Also, credit rating agencies are now going to be regulated.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the fiscal measures currently being envisaged by Member States, it is important to continue with sensible, balanced approaches which also do not add up to protectionism.</p>

Rushing to further enlargements and a Lisbon Treaty that has come about in an undemocratic manner is absolutely not the way forward.

Some of these people feel a very strong bond with Serbia, others with Croatia and a third group would like to underline its own independent Bosnian identity. In actual fact, this is a pocket-sized Yugoslavia, a federation in which different peoples have the option of either living together peacefully or battling out internal conflict over their territory.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Since Yugoslavia fell apart in 1992, attempts have been made to make a united state out of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but to no avail. I do not expect this to be possible in the near or distant future. Agreement among three peoples and their political leaders on effective governance is only possible when nobody feels threatened any more by the others or by the outside world.</p>
