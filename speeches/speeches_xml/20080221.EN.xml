      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we are discussing two parliamentary initiative reports, but I feel both of them are extremely important for a number of reasons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, we are considering the Commission’s Fourth Report on Social and Economic Cohesion. This is a truly remarkable document, much better than the previous versions, and it constitutes a firm basis for all manner of reflections on the future of cohesion within Europe. It is also important because the brand new Lisbon Treaty establishes territorial cohesion as one of the EU’s main objectives. As we know, new and formidable challenges are now looming together with those we are already aware of, and cohesion policy must make a major worthwhile contribution to their consideration, to allow us to move forward to the Europe we want to see: that is, an effective, solidarity-conscious Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What does the Fourth Report show us? That social and economic convergence between the Member States is moving in the right direction, with a definite reduction in discrepancies in terms of income and jobs over the last decade, but also that there are still considerable disparities between regions, and occasionally within regions, with a frequent tendency to become more acute. Development is real enough, but is plagued by far too many imbalances. It is here that the new concept of territorial cohesion comes into its own, and this is where it must take centre stage in the continuation of regional development throughout the EU alongside economic and social cohesion. Implementing this will require an integrated approach among sectorial policies, and genuine multi-level governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Here we await with interest, and I must say with some impatience, the Commission’s Green Paper in September. There is an obvious need for a common language on this issue, as emerged from our discussions in the Committee on Regional Development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The teachings of the Fourth Report project our thoughts to after 2013, since operational programmes for 2007-2013 are now in place at almost all locations. One of their main features is a credit earmarking system to channel the basic essentials of resources towards the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda. While we wish to stress the close relationship of priorities between the Lisbon Strategy and cohesion policy, we feel the latter must forge beyond this sphere and take up a position within a broader perspective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our report firmly states that convergence on different levels is a prior condition for long-term competitiveness in the regions, and that in years to come complementarity of the two policies will be necessary to reconcile effectiveness and solidarity. Periodic assessment over the 2007-2013 period, which we are calling for, must allow us to confirm the appropriateness of the process, or to implement any adjustments that may be necessary in a properly informed fashion. Questions must also be asked as to the dissociation implemented over the current scheduling period between rural development and regional policy. Its relevance does not appear to be well established on the ground, and we feel that maintaining this separation after 2013 may pose a problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our report emphasises the new challenges to be faced by the EU and their substantial territorial impact. There are problems such as population ageing, climate change, energy, urban concentration etc. We feel that necessary and urgent convergence and an appropriate territorial approach for these challenges call for enhanced political and financial cohesion policies after 2013. In this perspective, Parliament will staunchly oppose, as it has always done, any attempt to renationalise the policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to finish, Madam President, by thanking the shadow rapporteurs, who were of great assistance to me in this task, for the large number of compromises we were able to achieve. I also wish to emphasise coherence with Mrs Kallenbach’s report. I think it would be good if a fully coherent whole were presented in the House today.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-009" speaker_id="28236" name="Gisela Kallenbach" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs for the good and constructive cooperation. Equally, I would like to thank the committee and group staff and Members' assistants. The stronger the community, the better the product!</p>
      <p sl="de">I greatly welcome the fact that we are discussing the report by Mr Guellec and my own report jointly today. When it comes to the aim of achieving genuinely sustainable development in Europe, these two reports form a complementary whole. Cohesion policy is the hardware, as it were, with the Leipzig Charter and the Territorial Agenda being the software. These instruments can only work in tandem. The EU is equipped with the legal and financial competences through its cohesion policy. We do not have any real responsibility for regional development, urban and spatial planning. That is why a coherent policy – at local and regional level, the level of the national ministers and the EU level – is the prerequisite for sustainable European cities and regions. This is the only way to generate European value-added. The cities are the focus of opportunities and problems. They impact on rural regions and the immediate periphery. That is why we are relying on balanced development of the territory as a whole, on solutions which proceed from a holistic perspective and which at the same time are adapted to the specific situation. There can be no single solution, but there can be common principles such as the integrated approach, the partnership principle, horizontal and vertical, between the cities and the periphery, but also with the various actors who are directly concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have achieved a great deal of progress at European level. Besides the Leipzig Charter and the Territorial Agenda, the First Action Programme under the Portuguese Presidency, territorial cohesion was included as a Community objective in the Reform Treaty. This strengthens Parliament's weight through shared competence and the codecision procedure. With today's debate, we wanted to deliver a statement from Parliament in advance of the Council's Spring Summit so that territorial and urban issues can be included as clear components in the Lisbon and Göteborg strategies.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was also the joint wish of the Informal Council of Ministers in Leipzig that the Slovenian Presidency should put the Territorial Agenda on the agenda for this year's Spring Summit in order to achieve greater political recognition of the territorial framework for the development of regions and cities and new forms of participation in the EU's political decisions. This was clearly reiterated at the meeting in the Azores in November. So far, I have no real information available about progress here.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore have greatly welcomed the presence of a Council representative here today, so that we could have obtained this information about the status of the preparations. Regrettably, I have heard that there is apparently no consensus in the Council to comply with the Ministers' request. I would have liked to hear from the Council whether, and in which form, the Territorial Agenda is to be discussed at the Spring Summit. I would also be interested to hear whether it is true that in the current draft of the Council's Conclusions, no mention is made of territorial issues and nor are relevant amendments envisaged in the Treaty of Lisbon. However, that is the only way to turn our many fine words into real action.</p>

    <intervention id="4-010" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Danuta Hübner" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating – and perhaps, even more, by thanking – both Ms Kallenbach and Mr Guellec on their reports, and also the Committee on Regional Development on its excellent work both on the fourth cohesion report and on the report on territorial cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission fully shares your views that European cohesion policy has played a major role in narrowing disparities across the European Union and thus fostering European integration, and also getting the Union closer to its people. Therefore, the Commission firmly rejects attempts to renationalise this policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also share your view that adequate financial resources for cohesion policy must be guaranteed in the future in order to deal with the anticipated new challenges which will affect all European territories. We have also to keep in mind that, at the same time, cohesion policy will have to continue to cope with regional disparities resulting from the most recent, and forthcoming, enlargements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me reassure you that, in the context of the ‘Lisbonisation’ of our policy, the main priority of European cohesion policy is, and will remain after 2013, the objective of narrowing disparities, as it is enshrined in the Reform Treaty. The solidarity dimension of the policy is central to this policy and the allocation of resources will certainly follow an inverse relation with the prosperity of countries and regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">This view is also shared by an impressive majority of stakeholders across the Union. What is also shared is that European cohesion policy is much more than just a distributive mechanism of resources between Member States and regions; this policy is first and foremost a development policy whose objective is to foster the endogenous development of all European regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission also shares your concern about the need for more coherence between European cohesion policy and other Community sectoral policies, especially rural development, research or competition. I would add here that the need for coherence between the different development policies also applies to the coordination between European cohesion policy and national polices. I am convinced that this is a key issue for the future of European cohesion, also in its territorial dimension.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully share your view that the success of the territorial agenda and the Leipzig Charter depends on two conditions. First, we need to put in practice an integrated approach to the territorial development in order to avoid a piecemeal approach to our territories. A classic example here is thinking in categories of purely rural or urban strategies, which misses the key importance of the true economic regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, the integrated approach means also the need for integrating different sectoral policies both at the EU and Member State level, which affect the development of all our territories.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second condition, as you rightly point out, is the need for the Commission to monitor and to assess regularly the progress in the implementation of actions agreed under the territorial agenda, and here we need to know more about the effects of these actions in the Member States so that the Commission can offer them adequate assistance. For example, on the basis of better monitoring, the Commission can further progress in the area of defining indicators of territorial cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clearly the Commission sees as good news – as does your report – the introduction of the notion of the territorial dimension of cohesion in the Lisbon Treaty, and now we have to make the most of this new dimension of cohesion policy and the avenues it opens up such as, for example, the new definition of subsidiarity giving more weight to local and regional authorities. That is why the Commission included the Green Paper on territorial cohesion in our legislative and work programme for 2008.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even if there is no standard definition of the concept yet, territorial cohesion synthesises the legal objectives of the Union to achieve a sustainable balance and harmonious development of its territory and also to provide equity of access to services of general interest. We are all aware today that there are a number of aspects of territorial balance in the Union which threaten the harmonious development of the Union economy and society in the years to come. They are at EU, national and regional level and also in some specific areas and with regard to outermost regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to confirm that the key recommendations made in Ms Kallenbach’s report, as regards the definition of the concept of territorial cohesion and the implementation of an integrated approach to territorial development, and also the improvement of the synergies between Community policies, are all taken on board in the preparation of our Green Paper that will be adopted by the college next September.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also use this opportunity to inform you that we are progressing with the Member States in our common understanding of territorial cohesion and its key components. We are currently working on the responses to the questionnaire which we have sent to 25 Member States on territorial cohesion, thus clearly making progress possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also established in the Commission an inter-service group which is giving us a framework to work in-house on territorial cohesion, and we have already completed the first part of this exercise: the identification of the territorial dimension of key EU policies. We have now embarked on the process, specifically on the process of developing some tools which also match your request. As you probably know, investigating territorial impact assessment of policies and also developing territorial cohesion indicators are among the priorities of the new strengthened ESPON programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards urban affairs, in March we will have the next Urban audit which is currently finalised and the second report on the state of European cities is due for June 2009. URBACT II has now been upgraded to a strategic instrument for networking and for exchanges in urban development.</p>
      <p sl="en">My feeling is that we have, in the case of both reports, a high coherence of your views and of those of the Commission, and I now look forward to the debate for a better understanding of your concerns.</p>

    <intervention id="4-011" speaker_id="28208" name="Nathalie Griesbeck" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I also wish to thank our rapporteurs, especially Ambroise Guellec, for his presentation and work on the subject. As permanent rapporteur on the structural funds for the Committee on Budgets, I also wish to elaborate very briefly on budgetary issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This policy is now one of the most significant policies for solidarity between the peoples of Europe in budgetary terms. Today, as we have already heard this morning, the major issue is increasingly optimising the efficiency of cohesion policies. The Committee on Budgets wished to draw Parliament’s attention to a number of disturbing signs such as completion delays and commitments outstanding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to emphasise what I feel are a number of salient points within this problem. The EU must urgently make it a point of honour to simplify procedures, such as implementation of technical assistance, with a view to preparation and execution of many projects our countries need.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must also proceed with a clear distribution of responsibilities between the EU and the Member States to ensure better shared management, and I welcome the Commissioner’s words in relation to Tuesday’s decision to adopt an action plan on audit strategy for structural funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Something I have been pointing out for a long time now, which I am also glad the Commissioner has just mentioned, is the need to provide both qualitative and quantitative performance indicators common to all the Member States, in order to assess budget needs and help define the next legislative framework for the post-2013 multi-annual period and, in a word, to improve the clarity of Europe’s presence in relation to EU policies and European citizens.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012" speaker_id="31123" name="Pedro Guerreiro" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries">
      <p sl="pt">I must start by expressing my regret that the Committee on Regional Development has not included any of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries on the Fourth Cohesion Report. These amendments reiterate, for example, the contribution made by the fisheries sector to the socio-economic situation of fishing communities in convergence regions, regions handicapped by permanent geographical or natural disadvantages, such as the most remote regions, and also poor fishing communities within more prosperous regions. I also regret that the financing for the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), in a Union with 27 members, does not differ significantly from the budget of the FIFG (Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance) in a Union with 15 members. The EFF must therefore be financially reinforced.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why I have re-tabled in this part-session two amendments which aim to underline the importance of the fisheries structural policy to economic and social cohesion.</p>

    <intervention id="4-013" speaker_id="28323" name="Oldřich Vlasák" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="cs">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reports we are debating today are significant not only in the way they deal with the present situation of our cohesion policy and its territorial dimension, but also in turning our attention to the future beyond 2013. I would like at this point to thank Ms Kallenbach and Mr Guellec for their excellent work and their open-minded approach.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The two reports, as both rapporteurs mentioned, are complementary and should be considered together. Territorial cohesion, by virtue of its inclusion in the Lisbon Treaty, has become as important a concept as economic and social cohesion. But territorial cohesion as a concept is the least researched and the least understood. Territorial cohesion so far even lacks a clear definition. The general aim of cohesion is to even out differences, but these differences still persist and they are most pronounced in the border areas between the former Eastern block and the democratic West. Territorial cohesion, in my view, also includes cohesion of towns and country. It is indisputable that towns are the engines generating growth in the individual countries and therefore it is right to include the question of urban development in our motion for a resolution and at the same time call for strengthening of the integrated approach. However, in the future it will be necessary in this regard to improve and simplify access of urban areas to structural funds and foster better links between municipal authorities and developers when financing projects of urban development from private funds.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We have adopted the Leipzig Charter and now we must gradually start putting it into practice. At the same time we must create the right conditions for life in the future, for the development of our countryside. I am convinced that we should analyse very carefully whether it is best to include rural policy in the common agricultural policy or whether we should be considering a different solution.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, just one closing remark. The debate on cohesion policy is above all a debate on the allocation of funds. It is evident and it is right that cohesion policy is getting stronger and is beginning to show in the European budget. Cohesion policy will have to deal with new phenomena, such as the aging and dying out of the European population, the instability of energy supplies and the deterioration of the environment. It is therefore necessary to modify the policy accordingly and ensure sufficient funds.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-014" speaker_id="1854" name="Constanze Angela Krehl" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Vlasák is quite right to say that we have the task of preparing the cohesion policy for the period after 2013. We have used these two reports in order to address this as an issue. In fact, we have drawn together everything that we think is important in this context.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to remind you, however, that we should be mindful of the strategic objectives of European cohesion policy, namely narrowing disparities in living conditions between the European Union's regions and supporting the Lisbon and Göteborg strategies. If the European Parliament wishes to play a role in shaping the future cohesion policy, it must, in my view, concentrate on key strategies rather than reverting to the 'watering-can' principle. We must face up to the new challenges arising in the context of cohesion policy. Let me give you just a few examples: demographic change, climate protection, regional depopulation, and also, indeed, a modern European urban policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">From my perspective, the 'equal opportunities for people and regions' approach is essential for solutions in this area. I believe that more investment in education, research and innovation and their infrastructures is important, and increasingly so, and is genuinely sustainable, in my view. However, this can only work if, in future, we involve European citizens more effectively in the development of programmes and projects, as the European Parliament has demanded for a long time and does again in these reports.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to appeal to the Member States – I think it is regrettable that no Council representative is here – and point out that we are giving them some homework to do. If we are to fund additional tasks in the framework of cohesion policy, the financial resources that are needed for this purpose must also be made available.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-015" speaker_id="28388" name="Grażyna Staniszewska" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="pl">The Fourth Cohesion Report and the report by Mr Guellec highlight the success of cohesion policy in narrowing disparities between Member States. They also note the growth in countries that were formerly lagging behind, for example Greece and Portugal. At the same time, however, they confirm the marked failure of this policy as regards approximating the level of development between regions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Member States unfortunately condone undue concentration of investment and other elements of development in national capitals. A similar situation is true of the regions, where investment also tends to be concentrated in central areas, thus preventing the whole region from developing at an even pace. The differences within and between regions of the European Union are significantly greater than in the United States or in Japan.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Everything points to the need to introduce a mechanism that would stimulate decentralisation within the Member States. A long-lasting but dynamic regional policy for the next Financial Perspective is needed. The report by Mr Guellec points in a considered way to the need to forge appropriate links between the Lisbon Strategy and cohesion policy. The latter must not become simply an instrument of the former. Cohesion policy aims at sustainable and harmonious development, and is an important end in itself. It is the cheapest way of preventing what can later prove to be very costly situations from arising. I have in mind conflicts, mass emigration and immigration, relocation of companies and similar events, which all represent an upheaval for local populations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition to the Lisbon Treaty, the report adopted today emphasises the importance of the territorial dimension. There is an urgent need to clarify this concept, however, and establish an unambiguous definition of what the territorial dimension involves. At present we are using this term somewhat blindly, and it can be understood as meaning many things. There are parts of Mr Guellec’s report where this notion takes precedence over the policy of economic and social cohesion, whereas in others it is presented as complementary. In certain instances it concerns equal access to services, and in others it involves the balanced distribution of research centres, for example.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think it is unfortunate that the debate on the Green Paper on the territorial cohesion is planned for the autumn, after the report on cohesion policy. The Green Paper should be debated much earlier.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to thank both rapporteurs very much for their work.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The term cohesion has acquired special significance within the Union. References to the need to reduce differences between the various regions in order to unite national economies and support their harmonious development date back to the Treaty of Rome.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Fourth Report covers the years 2000-2006. It is the subject of the Guellec report, which contains many valuable findings. This report presents a summary of the situation in all the Member States. It also highlights the areas where disparities are greatest. Narrowing disparities in those regions must be perceived as a long-term undertaking.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report tabled by the Commission contains many comparative parameters that were lacking in earlier documents. The suggestion of using indicators supplementing basic GDP per capita in relation to different NUTS levels remains, however.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Cohesion policy is the foundation of integration and makes a valuable contribution to the harmonious development of the Union. Its regional, local and environmental aspects are important in this context, as Mrs Staniszewska has already mentioned. We should also recognise its impact on the Union’s innovation and competitiveness, and therefore on implementation of the Lisbon Strategy. Demographic issues are important too, as certain areas are threatened with depopulation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">When we refer to cohesion we perceive it as economic and social. A sound definition of the term territorial cohesion is urgently required. Cohesion should be understood as ensuring that, regardless of where they reside, Union citizens enjoy equal opportunities for access to health services, education, culture, the Internet and transport, for example. Cohesion policy should be strengthened and improved with adequate Union resources. The urban aspect is particularly important, as Mrs Kallenbach pointed out.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The question as to how to choose between cohesion or competitiveness, equality or efficiency has recently arisen. My brief answer is to choose both, in due measure.</p>

    <intervention id="4-017" speaker_id="1933" name="Elisabeth Schroedter" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the late 1990s the philosophy which prevailed in the European Union was that the integration capacity of the Union was to be measured according to the success of the internal market. The hope that the problems existing in the European Union could be resolved with the development concepts of the internal market, which were geared solely towards economic growth, remained unfulfilled, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European internal market focussed the growth of economic activity on the centres of gravity which pulled in additional activity, at the expense of disadvantaged regions and the natural environment. And even in these centres, not everyone was able to share in the benefits; instead, poverty increased, triggering tensions and unrest.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, the Commission is making the same mistake. It is subordinating cohesion policy to the Lisbon strategy. Instead of genuinely prioritising the problems of the particularly disadvantaged regions and only promoting sustainable development projects, it is investing in outdated infrastructural concepts and, in consequence, only in the economic centres. The municipalities and regions will become dependent on the major European banks for generations. In my view, this is a massive problem, because ultimately, it is the next generation who will then pay the price of failed development policies. And that in turn will trigger migratory movements – my colleague Mrs Krehl has already indicated as much – and it will also trigger an anti-European mood because some sections of the population will not share in the benefits. These are dead-end strategies.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe we must be very careful not to put the European Union's internal cohesion at risk. Economic and social cohesion must genuinely remain a separate policy area and the benefits must be available to all the regions and people in Europe. This can only happen if cohesion policy is genuinely underpinned by a social model based on solidarity and on sustainable development models which are not pursued at the expense of the environment.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In this brief speech on such an important issue as the future of the cohesion policy in the European Union, we can only underline some of the fundamental principles that we believe should guide this debate.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Firstly, regional policy is a key instrument for promoting the highly cherished economic and social cohesion. It is a structural policy which must have as its primary and principal objectives, as has already been stated, the reduction of disparities between the levels of development of the various regions, the encouragement of the least-favoured regions that are lagging behind, the promotion of real convergence and the stimulation of growth and employment. It must therefore serve as a factor of redistribution and compensation, as regards the increased costs of the single market, Economic and Monetary Union and the liberalisation of international trade, for the less-developed countries and regions of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, the cohesion policy and its associated financial resources must be used to promote projects for economic, social, environmental and regional development. As a result, these projects must not be subject to a policy which has, as its priority and dogma, the competition, deregulation or so-called adaptability and entrepreneurship which are priorities of the Lisbon Strategy. In other words, we believe that competitiveness must not be a substitute for convergence in the Member States and regions which are lagging behind in their socioeconomic development.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thirdly, the current Community financial resources for the cohesion policy are insufficient to meet the needs of real convergence, regional disparities, high levels of unemployment, inequalities in income and poverty in the European Union. We therefore reiterate the need to increase the Community budget, making the promotion of economic and social cohesion in the European Union the central and primordial objective.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I have read the reports by Ms Kallenbach and Mr Guellec with interest. The cohesion of European countries remains a fascinating theme. The integration of internal policy and cooperation between EU Member States and regions is increasingly taking shape. That such a strategy produces results is clearly shown in the cohesion report. Cohesion between the Member States has increased.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At the same time it shows that cohesion between regions within Member States is decreasing, particularly between urban and non-urban regions. In my view, it is right in such situations for national, regional and local authorities to play an important role. I do not understand, therefore, why the option for Member States independently to increase their contributions to regional development has been rejected in advance.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is too early to ascertain how long the current policy should be continued. That it presents some specific challenges is clear. But let us also examine whether it is able to solve the so-called divergence, i.e. not only cohesion at Member State level but also at a regional level, between and within Member States. As that will probably not be the case, a different approach with a larger role for Member States is desirable. No-one knows the national and regional situation better than the individual Member States. They can introduce solutions which will make the goals of cohesion at subnational level achievable.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-020" speaker_id="966" name="Jean-Claude Martinez" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the European Commission is so concerned with cohesion between the Member States and within the Member States that 350 billion euros have been allocated to it between now and 2013.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A Green Paper is also in the offing because, in Brussels, whenever a problem arises a paper has to be written on it. There certainly is a problem of cohesion between western Europe and eastern Europe, the Europe of villages and the Europe of cities, or the Europe of the upmarket districts and the Europe of working-class neighbourhoods.</p>
      <p sl="fr">But whose fault is it? Who depopulated villages where they tended vines and reared cattle, Madam President, in Greece, where they produced tobacco, cotton and olive oil? Who, and which policies, took away thousands of post offices in Sweden, Germany and France? Who closed down rural train stations, railways and maternity homes? In ports, is it the wind destroying fishing craft, fishermen’s livelihoods, small businesses and shipyards? Is it the wolves in the Pyrenees or the Alps that are eating up the shepherds, or lamb imported from New Zealand?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We all know the answer: it was the international trade policy conducted by the Commission through GATT agreement and the WTO that has been leading to the closure of 90 farms a day in Spain and France for the last 20 years. It was the dogmatic removal of customs protection that destroyed industrial balances beneath a wave of imports.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, in order to establish cohesion, first we have to establish coherence between policies. We cannot have one policy in Cotonou for the ACP states and then destroy this policy in Geneva over the banana trade. We cannot have a Community preference for rural produce between 1962 and 1986 and then destroy all this with free trade at the Uruguay or Doha Rounds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Cohesion therefore requires a certain amount of coherence between choices. Commissioner, either we build Europe or we build the world. Either we focus on social tasks, or we focus on the world.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Ms Hübner, the unique and peculiar nature of this Fourth Report lies in the fact that not only has the current policy been well thought out but it looks ahead to the new challenges which Europe must tackle. It covers globalisation and its effects, it covers climate change, it covers the problems of energy and demographic challenges. It is good that we are doing this now, particularly in preparation for the spring recess this March. Mr Guellec has done everything very well. He has stated that the cohesion policy should not change in its essentials – which is specifically reconfirmed in the new Treaty – but that the content of the regional commitments and the programmes should change.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This week we have also looked at the Lisbon Strategy, and what strikes me is that we should continue strongly and make an express contribution, earmarking 60 – 65% of the cohesion budget to be committed to this end. This will show to what extent the core of the cohesion policy stands to meet the challenge of new circumstances. What is stated in the Kallenbach report is also important, that we consider territorial cohesion as a core function of the European Union. Globalisation focuses on a number of key regions, metropolitan areas, and Europe’s answer is that it is imperative that knowledge is shared and the conditions created for entrepreneurship in all regions, including rural areas. That is the new agenda.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The PPE finally resisted using renationalisation as an answer to the 2013 debate. This leads to the achievement of a new consistency between R&amp;D, innovation policy, the internal market and the nuts and bolts of the Union, coupling a knowledge-based economy – which will be implicated here in the long term – with high employment and prosperity in our regions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I also gladly subscribe to the transparency initiative put forward by Mrs Hübner. The people must know how relevant to them this policy is.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I wish to begin my speech by thanking Mrs Kallenbach and Mr Guellec in particular for their work on these reports leading to a majority agreement within the context of the Committee on Regional Development.</p>
      <p sl="es">European cohesion policy has been an example of a successful EU policy, which has abided by the principles on which it is based, and which has helped to remove inequalities.</p>
      <p sl="es">Countries such as Spain have achieved indisputable results in terms of convergence thanks to the cohesion policy. We would therefore reaffirm its role in enhancing the potential of Member States for development and job creation through progress in training human capital.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, we must also admit that territorial inequalities still exist, and therefore we must give a firm response if we are to move forward with a policy that has to tackle new challenges such as ageing or depopulation processes in certain areas, especially rural areas.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must deal with the remaining challenges in order to reduce regional and interregional disparities and secure economic and technological growth, and this means that our focus on compliance with the Lisbon Strategy must be a priority issue, while not neglecting other matters such as demographic change.</p>
      <p sl="es">If EU regional policy is to secure balanced sustainable development, it must be carried out in close cooperation with regional players and in coordination with other policies. We are likewise aware of the need to push forward specific measures in order to reduce disparities between accessible regions and those with structural disadvantages: mountainous areas, islands, or sparsely populated areas.</p>
      <p sl="es">With a view to the future, therefore, it is absolutely essential to reinforce cohesion policy with major economic resources to cope with all the challenges involved.</p>
      <p sl="es">Yesterday we adopted the Lisbon Treaty in Parliament by a large majority, and today we must drive forward a new component of the Treaty, setting out territorial cohesion as a basic EU objective to make progress towards a more prosperous future for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to say, Commissioner, that as I listened to your reply to the two reports by our colleagues Mr Guellec and Mrs Kallenbach, I felt there would be no need for me to say anything at all, since it was so obvious you were showing you had fully understood us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is an initial stage, and I am extremely pleased and wish to congratulate the House since these close-knit reports between you, your associates, our committee and our Parliament have produced such a level of cohesion between our points of view. Now, however, beyond this cohesion, we must move forward with implementation, for it is all well and good to achieve cohesion among ourselves, but this must produce some specific results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I feel this is possible by means of the Green Paper you are drawing up for the autumn, and here I would like to mention two items dear to my heart, which in my view are essential to implement the entire cohesion policy and the Leipzig Charter we desire so much.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The two items are: firstly, the necessity, which you have already mentioned and which I wish to reiterate in the strongest terms, of showing how different EU policies must be made coherent at the level of urban and periurban areas. Yesterday evening we were discussing population. Yesterday afternoon we were discussing transport. Before that we were discussing social issues. All the Commission’s DGs are involved, all the various EP Committees are involved … All this must be made coherent within the microterritory of a town and its surrounding area. I expect a position to emerge from the Green Paper.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second item. How could we, Parliament and the Commission, if we agree on all this, succeed if we do not have European citizens and governments on board? I have already told you, Commissioner, we must make a huge effort, and I know you are endeavouring to do so, in terms of communication, so that all our speeches, all our comments, all our hopes with regard to cohesion, emerge in words and phrases that will encourage governments to act and persuade and motivate our fellow citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are the two main points, Commissioner, that I expect to see in the Green Paper. After listening to us, I trust you will help us find specific applications.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, one of the fundamental aims of the European Union is to even out differences in the development and income of individual countries and regions. These differences have become more marked in recent years, because significantly less developed countries have joined the Union in the latest enlargements.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is estimated that these countries are more than 15 years behind the others. Swift development is the only way to level out the differences. This represents a considerable challenge, especially taking into account the cuts in financial resources and the limited opportunities the countries striving to move forward have to make use of them. It is unlikely that the success achieved in Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland will be repeated, certainly not quickly. It is also unlikely that we will catch up with the United States and Japan in the near future. We should remember, however, that the start is always the most difficult stage, and look to the Czech Republic for a positive example of how much can be achieved. Our citizens’ outlook on life has changed and is continuing to do so, which bodes well for the future. In addition, the Lisbon Strategy lays down clear guidelines for our actions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As I conclude, I should like to thank our rapporteurs most sincerely for their statements. I see Mr Martínez is no longer in the Chamber, but I must add that I totally disagree with his intervention.</p>

      <p sl="en">Before I make my brief points, I would echo Mr Guerreiro’s points about support for the fisheries sector within cohesion policy. We will be supporting his amendments, and I do think this sector is of particular strategic importance in our geography.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would pick up on the rapporteur’s call for better statistics, particularly for the targeting and monitoring of the efficiency of funding programmes. It seems pretty clear, as things develop, that targeting at NUTS I, NUTS II or even NUTS III level is pretty broad and pretty scatter-gun. I welcome moves in the future funding streams towards more thematic activity, be it the Lisbon Agenda, the promotion of a knowledge economy, the promotion of R&amp;D, cross-border cooperation or, indeed, support for the fisheries sector under the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is, I believe, the future for a really vibrant cohesion policy for the European Union, which is very much the jewel in the EU’s crown. It has brought the EU closer to our citizens and it has made us one Union where the Member States would keep us a series of different states.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, the two reports given today show the necessity of the cohesion policy and how that policy should be implemented. Balanced regional development is very important. The focus of Mr Guellec's report was on ensuring that regional funds are sufficient and that they will focus on promoting the needs of the citizens and the needs of the regions effectively. The only way to deal with a cohesion policy is as an implementation tool for the Lisbon Strategy. I would like to thank the Rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Ireland has benefited a great deal from cohesion money and in order for other countries to benefit in the same way we must ensure that increased resources are directed at promoting regional development and tackling social exclusion. Not only must the gap between Member States be decreased but we must also decrease these gaps within Member States as well as the gaps between regions.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Mr Guellec reports on Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece's impressive growth rates between 2000 and 2006. He has highlighted, however, that in spite of this growth, there are great inequalities between regions within those countries.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I would like to thank Mrs Kallenbach as well for her report and I especially welcome the emphasis placed on strengthening the role of local urban authorities in order to make access to public services available to every citizen. There is a need for local empowerment, respect for the environment and a high standard of public services to be universally available so that the urban environment is an attractive place to live and work in.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Sustainable development is a huge challenge within urban areas in the 21st Century and the framework presented to us today by Mrs Kallenbach can help us to face this challenge.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, these reports comment on the disparity between the rural and urban economies, between rich and poor, especially in eastern Europe, and between the disadvantaged and the rest of society.</p>
      <p sl="en">The answer, apparently, is to offer a vast catalogue of cultural, economic, technical developments and social engineering provision. It notes the success of such programmes in Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece to relieve these inequalities and encourages similar strategies, frameworks and action programmes to generate progress in affected areas, especially in eastern Europe. Above all it mentions cohesion funds. We get to the nub. EUR 65 billion on such programmes in needy western countries in the last few years, but eastern Europe is much poorer than those countries ever were. So these subsidies – for that is what they are – will be taken from those countries still receiving them and from an ever smaller pot as the chill economic winds from the USA reach us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately for all its citizens – the well off and the poor alike – these subsidies are self-defeating for they strip away initiative from people and produce a culture of dependency.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you really want to help, listen to Professor Buchanan of the London School of Economics. His paper states clearly that ‘to help a poor country, trade is worth six times more than aid’. Will you ever learn that? Or, to put it another way, if, in a poor country, you give a starving man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and you feed him for life.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion is of major political significance certainly does not need to be repeatedly underlined here. I agree with the rapporteur on all the basic issues and congratulate him on his good work. He rightly emphasises that the anticipated new challenges can be dealt with only if cohesion policy remains a Community policy, which is anyway in accordance with the Treaty. His report clearly rejects, therefore, all attempts to renationalise this policy. The prerequisite, however, is a balanced cohesion budget for the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yes, adequate resources must be available in order to safeguard the harmonious development of all regions in the EU and deal with the new challenges. A different view exists, however, regarding the choice of wording in the report on the demand for financial resources for cohesion policy post-2013. Like many of my colleagues, I do not feel it is right that at this early stage, in 2008, the report should contain anticipatory demands for more financial resources for the future, not least in view of the fact that we are quite rightly facing criticism that we do not always draw down, on time, all the funding which is already available.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Committee has therefore found good compromise wording which, however, only applies to the text of the resolution and not to the recitals. So we should not include any conflicting statements in the recitals, but should remain consistent with the wording 'adequate resources for a balanced cohesion policy'.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ultimately, this is about credibility: in the past, cohesion policy has been able to achieve sustainable successes and can do so in future too if it is adequately resourced, without our calling for more financial resources at this stage. Commissioner, you referred in your introductory statement to adequate financial resources to deal with future challenges. That is a good formula.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is hands that build the town, and men that build the city. Jean-Jacques Rousseau must certainly have favoured the integrated approach. It is a method that falls directly within the scope of this approach of building cities and not fragmented towns, as set out in the Leipzig Charter and the Territorial Agenda.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore wish to thank all those responsible, especially Mrs Kallenbach, for their excellent cooperation on this task. I welcome the scope of the proposals in relation to social and economic aspects, the environment, spatial development and territorial cohesion, and likewise the close attention paid to proposals intended to improve the report submitted by our Socialist Group.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Paying closer attention to the territorial and urban dimensions of EU policies, especially through integrated development plans and better cooperation between urban and periurban areas, will draw all the benefits out of this integrated approach. Cooperation, however, must not end there. Provision must also be made for a relationship or some kind of connection between rural areas, urban and periurban areas. Here I must stress the importance of stimulating the attractiveness and competitiveness of rural areas as a tool to combat the mass exodus from the countryside.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the main points in this report had to be specified, my first mention would be the urgent need to create integrated multimodal transport networks supported by Europe to improve infrastructures, especially environment-friendly transport such as bicycles and walking.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Identifying the signs of decline in certain areas and stepping up work to implement a social integration policy constitute a framework for a public policy to reduce inequality in an efficient manner and prevent social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Positioning human beings at the very centre of the construction of infrastructure policies by reconciling urban concerns with human concerns, and all the more so within the current context of a housing crisis, in a society where not everyone has a roof over their head, and placing more emphasis on decent affordable housing, are still essential, and constitute a crucial factor of social integration and standards of living in cities, within a context of sustainable urban development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is for this reason that I call on all my colleagues to vote en masse in favour of this report, which demonstrates the EP’s wish to support the sturdiest form of territorial cohesion and a comprehensive integrated approach that will finally allow us to build the city.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is difficult to single out any one thing from these two excellent reports, but I wish to express particular thanks to Mr Guellec for the extent to which his report addresses the issue of disparities within regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">For, even in those that can be classified as relatively prosperous overall, there may still be certain groups that are disadvantaged or excluded. This may be a matter of their territorial location. Inhabitants of islands and mountainous and scarcely-populated border and peripheral areas can be cases in point. So, too, can fisheries-dependent communities, particularly when they are to be found in areas of the kind just mentioned. Which is why I, too, very much hope that Parliament will approve Amendments 19 and 20, which seek to reinforce their position.</p>
      <p sl="en">But disadvantage and exclusion may be at a more distinctly social level. I am thinking of a project back home in Aberdeenshire called Can-Do. It has provided occupation for people with learning difficulties, in sorting cans and bottles for recycling. It lost eligibility for European support when funding for the current period was relocated to parts of the country where deprivation is more widespread. But the people concerned remain just as much at risk of social exclusion as before.</p>
      <p sl="en">Both examples show that, if we are to target funding at those most in need, we need to develop a more sophisticated approach to quantifying that need. I ask the Commission to pay particular attention to the call in the report for improved statistical tools to allow more accurate measurement of the extent of cohesion and better assessment of the contributions of local actions aimed at achieving it. Such tools would also allow us to pinpoint actual cases of disadvantage and decide how they can best be addressed.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, cohesion policy makes a crucial contribution to the integration of societies within the Union, as is emphasised in the report. Nonetheless, administrative and procedural obstacles preventing regions with weaker infrastructures from attaining the level of developed ones continue to multiply.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Who is such a complicated procedure for mobilising Union resources supposed to help? After all, in the case of road infrastructure, funds could be transferred directly to the relevant local authority departments that are under the control of institutions in the Member States. It would not then be necessary to wait several years for construction or repair work to take place.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Clearly, other principles must apply regarding individuals, law firms and associations. If we really want to achieve something in the less developed regions, we should transfer targeted aid to local authority budgets, even without input from their own resources, because sometimes they cannot afford even a small contribution as they are so poor.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the report by Mr Guellec presents the European Parliament's position on the Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion. The latter contains information and analysis regarding the effectiveness of cohesion policy. In effect, pursuant to the procedure adopted, it represents the first stage in the debate on cohesion policy in the new programming period. Mr Guellec's report therefore presents proposals as well as opinions on the analysis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The debate on the future of cohesion policy must take account of the new conditions and challenges. Ongoing implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, climate change, changes in energy policy and appreciation of the implications of migratory processes mean that the European Union is facing new challenges. All this also means that action must be taken to reduce new disparities in development. Obviously the question arises as to which actions should be financed from common funds and which should be undertaken as Union policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the debate on the future of cohesion policy we refer to the debate on the future of the European Union. We often speak of a so-called Union of action or Union of results and of a Union such that it is appreciated and accepted by its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, we are aware that so-called reformers are promoting new solutions, such as, for example, renationalising cohesion policy. In essence, that would amount to negating the policy of solidarity. We must bear in mind that the Member States are implementing their own internal policies to narrow disparities and that they are doing so independently of European funding, drawing on their own resources. The richer countries are therefore proving most successful. In effect, renationalisation will amount to restricting cohesion policy and we must oppose that. Accordingly, if we want to create a so-called Union of results or Union of action, we must strengthen cohesion policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the fourth cohesion report provides evidence of the positive effects of EU cohesion policy, so the EU must continue to assist EU regions to achieve economic and social prosperity and convergence.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now addressing new challenges, and have agreed that our efforts must be directed towards dealing with these. However, I would like to emphasise a problem we addressed in July 2007 in the form of the resolution adopted on the poorest regions in the EU. Unfortunately, no further attention was given to that important issue. Just as the outermost regions have had a special strategy, we now need priority treatment and a strategic approach for the least prosperous regions, in order to overcome their specific difficulties, which are a combination of socioeconomic problems and territorial and spatial characteristics. I hope the Commissioner will address that issue in her Green Paper.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs. Mr Guellec’s report highlights the fact that, while there is economic convergence occurring between Member States, there is also a widening of regional and local disparities.</p>
      <p sl="en">That situation goes to the very heart of cohesion policy and clearly indicates the need to include a significant territorial dimension in all policies, but particularly in the Lisbon Strategy. I have seen this situation occurring in my own country, Ireland, where convergence with the EU average has been achieved – indeed surpassed – but where the economic gap between different regions is widening. It is extremely important that this gap does not continue to widen, and one of the ways of ensuring this is to increase investment in innovation, research and development in those regions that are lagging behind.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to thank Mr Guellec for including my suggestion on the importance of social capital in boosting regional economic growth. We are all aware of the role played by physical capital, natural capital and human capital as the basis for economic growth and development. However, social capital, which is the latent resource residing within and among cooperating groups, provides the added value. Data from the UN Handbook, which relates to a very significant number of countries, indicates that the contribution of social capital to economic growth is in the order of 5% of GDP.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, in response to the comment by Mr Clark, who suggests we should have ‘trade not aid’, I would say that in the EU we manage both – trade via the single market and targeted aid where needed. That is the best of both worlds.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the scope of this report is so broad that I shall limit myself to commenting on a couple of issues.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One of the main challenges facing the development of the Union is the swift spread of built up areas, together with energy consumption, transport and demographic changes, such as the depopulation of certain parts of the Union and the widening disparity between richer areas and less affluent ones. An integrated development policy focusing mainly on modernising infrastructure, improving energy efficiency and introducing cheap environmentally-friendly transport will help to ensure continuity in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another aim of the strategy in question ought to be focusing on the development of rural areas so as to make them more competitive, and thus slow down the depopulation of those areas, which is so significant for the new Member States. I would also like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation between urban and rural areas in order to promote the development of the territory as a whole. Access to information and communication technology should play a vital part in creating territorial cohesion and developing individual areas, and that is where our greatest problem currently lies.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, as regards Mrs Kallenbach's report and the Leipzig Charter, yes, we must consider spatial planning in a European context to a greater extent. But does this require new European powers in respect of housing policy and spatial planning? There is a very big question mark here, to my mind. As regards Mr Guellec's report and specifically the prospects for future structural policy, the regional challenges posed by globalisation, demography, climate change, migration and so forth are all accurately described. The same applies to the political outlook.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should stick to the tried and tested objectives of structural policy, and we should supplement them with these new components. I welcome the integrated approach advocated by the rapporteur, also as regards the challenges arising in relation to rural development. However, we should be focusing, as a general principle, on the European value-added of these programmes to a greater extent. Whether in relation to cohesion, innovation or transnational funding, Europe should only be providing support where we can genuinely make a sustainable European contribution.</p>
      <p sl="de">To achieve success in the future, we must also be looking more critically at the instruments hitherto deployed. The one-off operational subsidy does not create any European value-added, whereas long-term expansion of research, education and infrastructure certainly does! We can only enhance the efficiency of structural policy through greater transparency in the deployment of funding and through leverage effects, for example by funding loans and with more public-private partnerships.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although we certainly have not exploited all our options here, I cannot support the rapporteur's blanket call for more money from 2014. We need to evaluate the current period first of all, and we need to gear our instruments more efficiently towards challenges such as climate change and demography. Then we can start demanding a budgetary contribution.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report rightly recognises the enormous efforts made (particularly in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland) in terms of growth and convergence. However, these efforts must be continued and expanded, not just in those countries which are most lacking solidarity and cohesion, but also in certain regions of those countries as the wealth assessment process cannot solely depend on GDP but must be extended to other criteria.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this respect, I made contributions aimed at clearly recognising insularity and remoteness as factors restraining development. In particular, in accordance with Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty and as stated by Commissioner Hübner, accessibility problems form one of the main obstacles to development. This is why it is essential to adapt the Community policies to take account of this constraint resulting from insularity and remoteness.</p>

      <p sl="fi">It is also worth remembering that the northern regions produce added value in areas such as mining, wood processing and tourism. Research in the north and new technology applications in cooperation with universities, businesses, the public sector and consumers continually produce fresh and important innovations, from which the whole of Europe benefits.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would also like to remind everyone of the opportunities afforded by combining the Baltic Strategy with the Northern Dimension in, for example, the utilisation of energy resources in the Barents region.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Finally, I want to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent reports and thank Commissioner Hübner for her interest in the northernmost corner of the Union.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, I should also like to congratulate the two rapporteurs on their very important reports.</p>
      <p sl="el">Cohesion policy is important because it has helped in the economic and social development of many regions. It has reduced the gaps between regions, brought regions closer to the norm and reduced disparities within them.</p>
      <p sl="el">There is still much to be done. Uniform development has not been attained. There are divergences, which are acute in many cases. Any thought of a renationalising cohesion policy ought to be rejected. New Member States have joined, with regions that are very far removed from the norm. The term ‘territorial cohesion’ described in the Lisbon Treaty needs to be worked on and further analysed.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, particular attention ought to be paid to isolated regions and islands, as in the case of Greece, where cohesion policies will significantly help the local population to stay put, find employment, have access to new technology and professional opportunities, and to comply to the Community norm.</p>
      <p sl="el">For these reasons, the terms in the cohesion policy report are correct: funding will need to be secured and increased, even for the period after 2013. The challenges are significant and the cohesion policy ought not to fall short or be delayed because of financial inadequacy when all parties recognise its usefulness.</p>
      <p sl="el">In closing, I also welcome today’s statements by Commissioner Hübner and the Commission’s determination to progress with the cohesion policy. We await with interest the Green Paper and the conclusions that it will contain.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, reducing the social and economic disparities between European regions is a fundamental aim of the European Union. We are aiming to create a Europe where all regions are equal.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Following the latest enlargements, it has become increasingly necessary to strengthen the cohesion aim. This is because, according to certain estimates, at the present rate of economic growth, countries such as Poland, Bulgaria and Romania will take more than 15 years to reach a level of GDP equal to 75% of the average for the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Full use of structural funds pursuant to Community legislation is a sine qua non for reducing social and economic disparities between European regions. This applies especially to the new Member States. The latter are experiencing many problems. For example, Polish local authorities have recently had to cope with difficulties caused by the continuous fall in the value of the euro in relation to the Polish currency, thus reducing the actual value of Union funds allocated to the implementation of regional projects that had already been confirmed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, the cost of labour and production in Europe is constantly rising, which leads to an increase in the cost of investments funded from Union resources and to a reduction in the value of those funds in real terms. Consequently, implementation of many Union projects is threatened.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must firstly highlight the excellent work carried out by Mr Guellec and the intelligent and determined manner in which he emphasised and defended the optimisation and reinforcement after 2013 of a policy of solidarity towards the European regions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In truth, with this report, more than with the assessment of the cohesion policy’s impact in 2000-2006, we have opened the debate on what type of cohesion policy we want for post-2013. Accordingly, I must make one comment on the present and three on the future.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My first comment is that, as shown by the Fourth Report, the cohesion policy continues to be essential for reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and for encouraging the least-favoured regions that are lagging behind or, in other words, for creating a European Union that is more harmonious and viable and has a greater sense of solidarity. However, we should not forget that, in addition to this essential objective, the cohesion policy has made a decisive contribution to the construction and expansion of the internal market, to the success of the successive enlargements, to the creation and consolidation of the single currency and to the increasing identification of citizens with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My second comment is that the cohesion policy must now revamp its role, boosted and reinforced by the new territorial dimension to cohesion enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, by taking advantage of the diversity and complementarity of the territories and by firmly targeting the polycentric development of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report by Mrs Kallenbach, who I also congratulate, offers us some good guidelines in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My third comment is that the cohesion policy must increasingly encompass and respond to the current challenges such as those represented by globalisation, migration, population ageing, climate change, energy diversification, research and technological development. In order to be coherent, we must therefore consider increased resources for a reinforced regional policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, a new perspective for the most remote regions will be necessary to guarantee that these can continue feeling comfortable within the European area. It will be vital to find new answers to the serious problems, such as isolation, lack of accessibility and competitive disadvantages, that these regions face.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much, Mr President. Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Kallenbach and Mr Guellec on their excellent reports, both of which are milestones in the debate on cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There are significant differences in the development of our regions, but if we look into it more deeply there are even greater chasms between individual areas within the regions. We have not managed to deal appropriately with liquidating rural poverty and bringing into line those areas that have fallen behind, within the framework of agricultural policy. There is a need for much greater effort in this area, within the framework of a renewed, integrated cohesion policy that is capable of turning round the negative processes in the areas that are growing poor.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The synergy between cohesion and the reinforcement of competitiveness must be strengthened, because they cannot be subordinated to each other. New challenges have emerged, such as ageing or even the matter of energy efficiency and climate change, which we must also deal with. For this very reason it is vital to reinforce cohesion policy, and we must reject its being put at national level. If we put solidarity and cohesion at the heart of the European project, the Union will truly be strong and competitive. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, the well-planned and responsible development of urban areas is becoming extremely important, in particular in the face of challenges such as congestion of urban transport networks, environmental damage and land development. This is why I very much appreciate the adoption of the Territorial Agenda and the Leipzig Charter.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Cities have a unique responsibility for climate protection: this protection should be a priority at all political levels. Cities could help solve a bad traffic situation and lower global emissions causing the greenhouse effect by, for example, interconnecting different modes of transport and developing an infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians. I would also suggest that cities prioritise energy-efficient buildings and use already existing buildings for new purposes, instead of developing new sites.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to stress that not only metropolitan regions but also suburban areas and rural areas are successful in meeting cohesion goals. This is why I appeal to the Commission to monitor such successful projects and to prepare, on their basis, a development model for smaller and medium-sized towns outside metropolitan areas. One of the characteristics of Europe, in spite of its relatively small size, is her geographical diversity. This is why it is necessary to be mindful of unique regional features and resulting differences, and to give people in different regions the chance to make use of the unique opportunities and potential offered by the areas in which they live. To me it is also very important to include, among our policy goals, the need to solve territorial issues relating to islands and mountain areas, border regions and sparsely populated regions, so that the quality of life of people who live there is also enhanced.</p>
      <p sl="sk">To conclude I would like to stress that urban development must follow an integrated and well-coordinated strategy, supported at all levels by both the government and the private sector.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Thank you, Mr President. We are debating the Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion and the reports by Mrs Kallenbach and Mr Guellec at a time when the first subjects for the 2014-2020 budget plan are beginning to emerge.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to link the two and to emphasise the importance of such a link. I do not fear that cohesion policy funding will disappear from the budget plan but I would not like to see the extent of this fund during the life of the next budget in any way reduced. In addition to that, as the rapporteurs rightly point out, major regional disparities still exist, including structural problems, and since this situation has worsened due to enlargement, it is necessary to contemplate giving more weight to this chapter of the budget.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As the reports correctly point out, the situation is so complex that we cannot solve it at Commission level. Although governments of the Member States play an important role in this matter, it is becoming more and more clear that it will not be possible to solve the problem without the participation of regional and local authorities. Their role lies not only in the possible synergy between them and the government in the process of making decisions on the issues of development in their territories but also in the responsibility for this development and, last but not least, in providing feedback about how development and cohesion are progressing.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Who can provide more information about the real development in a region, if not the people who live in it? Therefore I appeal to the Commission not only to include in its monitoring process the macro-economic indicators but to be creative and to draw on such information …</p>

I personally support the use at this time of the word ‘sufficient’, especially when many of the funds in those areas have not been spent.

      <p sl="el">Once again, the European Parliament is confirming its very clear position on the importance and role of the cohesion policy, which brings Europe closer to its citizens. This is a policy with very clear added value for the whole of the EU. In future, this policy should not just be maintained; it should be strengthened with the requisite resources.</p>
      <p sl="el">Both reports point to this approach. I should like to highlight the importance of:</p>
      <p sl="el">the partnership and participation of local authorities in particular, at all levels,</p>
      <p sl="el">synergies between Community policies, particularly the cohesion policy, and the rural development policy,</p>

      <p sl="bg">Regardless of the existing difference of viewpoints, let us recall the raison d’etre of the cohesion policy and its objectives, i.e. it embodies the hopes for more prosperity and better all-European future.</p>
      <p sl="bg">All Europeans strive for better life and the cohesion policy is the instrument to support them in these efforts. Let us remember that there are a lot of differences within the European Union and, at the same time, financial resources tend to dwindle.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Therefore I believe that the cohesion policy must be reinforced and strengthened. I also believe that it is worthwhile to ensure its optimal implementation. Some procedures and rules are still too complex and, probably for this reason, inefficient. A procedure like an overall review of the cohesion policy could contribute to its general improvement to the benefit of all Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the cohesion policy, which is a Community policy par excellence, has a vital role to play in achieving a Europe which offers solidarity, which is close to the people and which is by everyone and for everyone. It is a clear manifestation of the importance of the Union to the everyday lives of every European citizen.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The enlargement to 27 brought about changes in the nature of Europe. The goals now being set are different from those which existed at its genesis. The challenges to which we must now respond, such as globalisation, population falls, desertification of certain regions or climate change, combined with the increased frequency and scale of natural disasters, are much more demanding and require a greater effort on our part.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Innovation is also giving this policy new goals but, despite facing greater challenges and a larger Union, its budget has not increased in proportion. However, it has been adapted, in the name of solidarity, which has led, for example, to regions which were previously in Objective 1 now being regarded as wealthy regions not eligible due to the statistical effect.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is therefore imperative that the disparities are reduced through access to an adequate budget, without having to abandon certain regions in this vast Union to their fate.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon reinforced this need and firmly enshrined in law the territorial cohesion which is the most important aspect of the cohesion policy. It is essential that this policy tackles not only economic and social cohesion, but also solidarity between regions …</p>

      <p sl="en">I work closely with Scottish local government bodies on their concerns, and was delighted that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) recently welcomed the draft EU Treaty as far as local government is concerned.

      <p sl="en">It was no surprise to me that regional policy was among the five key areas recently raised with me by the COSLA. In the context of reduced EU structural monies and funds, regional development monies must be better targeted – as many speakers have said – at local areas and local authorities, which must be the key deliverers of those funds.

      <p sl="ro">All these things, together with climate changes, and depopulation of rural areas, are challenges we are forced to take into consideration, both at a European level and at the level of local administrations managing these policies.</p>

There are many points to which I cannot respond now, owing to the lack of time, but which I will take with me. These include the concerns expressed with regard to small and medium-sized towns, as well as the issue raised about urban transport development.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a clear link between the past and the future in your reports. You are in fact building a bridge, which is why I would like to say a few words on the stage reached in the public consultations on the future of European cohesion policy. We launched those consultations at the end of September 2007, and to date more than 100 well-elaborated statements and opinions have been submitted, not only by national, regional and local governments, but also by a number of European spatial planning associations, as well as economic and social partners, academics, research institutions and private citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the request of one of the governments, we have extended the consultations until mid-February, because there are still opinions being prepared.</p>
      <p sl="en">A preliminary assessment of those opinions clearly shows there is overwhelming and impressive support for the policy. The direct impact on growth and development is pointed to, as is the fact that this is a policy that triggers new ways of thinking and also performs a very effective leverage role by attracting additional financial resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is strong interest in the delivery mechanism and broad support for all the principles we have jointly developed with the European Parliament in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also strong support for the need for this policy to respond to the challenges that you have been discussing today, and which are linked not only to globalisation, but also to demography, climate and energy, and restructuring in general, with strong support for the integrated approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the issues of importance you have raised today is how we will proceed with the Green Paper, which will be adopted by the Commission in September. We will then have a broad period – probably of four months – for discussion in all formats, not only on the web. In the mean time, our services are organising a meeting with the key stakeholders for mid-April. This will help us to take into account further views.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would be prepared, if there is such a need, to organise a hearing with Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development and with any other institution interested in sharing with us its views on the Green Paper, ahead of its adoption by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another issue raised, which is also a concern for the Commission, was that of statistics and indicators. Through our analytical institution, ESPON, which we have strengthened very substantially, including financially, for the years to come, and which now has a significantly higher budget, we will endeavour to measure some of the new dimensions and some of the existing dimensions of territorial cohesion. That work is ongoing, and we hope to have the results soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure you that the Commission will also continue to look into appropriate indicators to complement both the GDP and employment indicators, and will in the Fifth Cohesion Report propose a new composite type of indicator.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I would also like to say that cohesion is a major European policy. I also think it was portrayed as a major theme in the House this morning. This is an important point, particularly in relation to future tasks. The Commissioner said earlier that we are dealing with a report, but obviously it is the future that interests us. She realises expectations are running high with regard to territorial cohesion, and what this represents once it is taken up in the Lisbon Treaty.

Commissioner, you have made it clear that, together with this House, you are interested in the practical steps: the integrated approach, indicators which produce measurable outcomes, the definition of the territorial dimension, the Green Paper. I think we will particularly need your help in ensuring that the Council is on board. Again, I think it is regrettable that no one from the Council is present at this important debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">The conclusions drawn in these two reports must lead to an amendment of the Lisbon Strategy and must genuinely underpin the new Community objective, the territorial dimension, in practical terms; otherwise, they will be nothing but empty words.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me make one final appeal to my fellow Members before the vote: let us be practical. Let's not only review and analyse again; let's make it a condition that we demand the integrated approach for the provision of funding from the Structural Funds, and let us establish clear commitments for the reduction of greenhouse gases as well. Climate protection must be implemented in the cities; otherwise, all our pledges at European and national level have no value at all.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The economic and social cohesion policy is the foundation of European solidarity. This feature of European policy is the envy of regional integration initiatives in other parts of the world. The unique nature of the European project is largely due precisely to the notion of cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the case of regional initiatives in Africa and South America there are no funds for even a token cohesion policy. Plans for enlargement of the Union are often assessed in terms of the potential to conduct effective action in order to increase cohesion. It may be stated quite unequivocally that cohesion policy is a great success for the Union and for all its Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is no doubt that the Union's own citizens assess it in terms of whether, in their view, cohesion policy is being implemented and is attaining its stated aims. In many Member States, especially in those that have acceded to the EU only recently, there are very high hopes of cohesion policy. It is hoped that solidarity will not prove merely a fine term, but will translate into a specific commitment to those who fate has treated less kindly. Cohesion is also an instrument for creating equal opportunities and a splendid advertisement for the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is for that very reason that we should not consider limiting the financial resources allocated to increasing economic and social cohesion. On the contrary, we should contemplate allocating more financial resources to cohesion, if only because of the many new challenges arising. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, cohesion policy is not one of the key policies that have been present in the European Union since it was first established. It was no accident that cohesion policy was devised when relatively less developed countries acceded to the European Union as these countries did not cohere well with the six original Member States. From that time on, cohesion has gained importance, becoming a pillar of European integration and central to treaties and budgets. The allocation of more than EUR 308 billion to cohesion in the framework of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective is evidence of this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A tendency to question this fundamental Union policy has arisen of late. Curiously, the tendency has coincided with the expansion of the European Union to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The latter have the most ground to make up, for historical reasons. That is why it is not proposed to do away with cohesion policy outright, but to radically refocus it, due to alleged waste of Structural Funds and abuses in the area. That is the greatest mistake we could make! Irregularities must be detected and eliminated, but it is precisely regional policy that makes the Union's presence felt in all 27 Member States. Cohesion means creating equal opportunities and a sense of fellowship and must not be subsumed into other policies. The latter, competitiveness and combating global warming for example, ought to have their own budget lines. Assessment of what should be financed within the framework of cohesion should remain within the competence of countries and regions. They have a far better understanding of their own needs than the Brussels authorities.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Commission’s Report refers to the depopulation of rural areas, against the background of the absence of workplaces except for agriculture or due to poor living conditions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Rural Development Fund contributes, together with the other funds, to the economic and social cohesion. The efficient use of the rural development funds represents a timely solution to these problems.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Nevertheless, the condition for the efficient use of these funds is better knowledge of the potential beneficiaries of the financing opportunities offered.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The access to information is even more important in the new Member States, which are not yet familiar with using the Community financing instruments.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to offer an example from Romania, the country I represent: according to a study, half of the rural environment inhabitants know nothing about the existence of the funds designed for them and only one citizen in ten knows which institution he/she should address in order to access the funds. It is regrettable that the Government of Romania has not made enough efforts to inform the citizens and, at the same time, it is obvious that nobody can replace the Romanian Government’s work.</p>

      <p sl="de">The EU's enlargement on 1 May 2004 has increased the economic and social disparities within the EU. In January this year, a new programming period for cohesion policy began. This will focus on new priorities and objectives: environmental protection, competitiveness, and the creation of more and better jobs.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU's cohesion policy is intended, through its four separate programmes, to help make Europe and its regions more competitive, for example through innovation, the development of the knowledge society, and strengthening economic competitiveness. It is also intended to increase the attractiveness of the regions for investors and residents through sustainable regional development. Better and above all more jobs are to be created, and the regions developed further in order to promote opportunities and reduce disparities. With its further enlargement, EU funding now has to be divided among 27 Member States. The money must therefore be used better, more efficiently and transparently.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards the financial framework, the European Council has made EUR 307.6 billion available for the period 2007-2013. This is a great deal of money. It is important that regions with development problems in the wealthy Member States such as Austria also have a fair share of the funds. Mountain regions in particular require further support.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Whilst reviewing the last three years of the alignment policy, and seeing the good things, but also the mistakes that need to be corrected, the European Parliament is not only looking back but also looking forward.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In order to speed up the development of the underdeveloped regions, we must change two things. We must pay much more attention to the effectiveness of the programmes, including increasing the amount of value created on the scene. (There is a need for further theoretical work in connection with this, so that the results can be assessed more accurately.) However, we cannot keep quiet about the fact that we must guarantee more resources than at present for programmes that use aid effectively and that are free of corruption and political influence in the period after 2013.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Aligning the underdeveloped regions more quickly is in the interests not only of those who live there but also of citizens living in more developed areas that guarantee the necessary resources.

      <p sl="cs">I welcome the promise the Commissioner for Enterprise made again yesterday as regards speeding the matter up, but I am not sure if he is aware of the importance of having the marking registered in foreign markets. Until this happens, it will be impossible to sue for damages in cases of manufacturers and importers who misuse the European conformity mark symbolising the safety of the product to gain unfair advantage and deceive customers both in Europe and abroad. It would surely help to free the market of unfair competition.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much. It was a shocking experience to enter the Gaza Strip and come face to face with the everyday consequences of the occupation and blockade. 80% of the population is unemployed, the Israelis cut off the electricity and water supplies from time to time, many people only get to eat once a day, and the vast majority of the population have not been able to leave an area smaller than Budapest for years. As an Israeli professor said, Gaza is a prison, and its residents are prisoners from whom it is difficult to expect rational behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="hu">At the same time, it is also embittering that some Palestinian groups are using rockets from the Gaza territories to threaten the lives of innocent Israeli civilians. The crisis goes too far back for it to be solved in the traditional way. By now, both sides have become the prisoners of their own extremists and are unable to make real concessions because of them.</p>

How could it possibly be any different? Only 25 of its 47 members are free democracies, nine of them are not free and three, China, Cuba and Saudi Arabia, are among the greatest human rights offenders in the world. These countries trample the UN Declaration of Human Rights underfoot and defend themselves and other regimes against any criticism. In some cases the Council has simply undermined the overseeing of human rights. The Council has still not pronounced the slightest condemnation of the world’s current largest human rights crisis, Darfur.

The report tackles the hard fact that there are many more elderly than young people, because both medical care and lifestyles enable all of us to live longer on average – not all of us, unfortunately, but on average.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the merit of the Castex report is undoubtedly that it indicates the enormous demographic challenges with which Europe is faced. Admittedly, a lot of good questions, trains of thought and solutions are enumerated. More and better relief for children must indeed be urgently provided, older workers must indeed also be provided with continuing opportunities within the employment markets, and health services must indeed urgently prepare themselves to face the challenge of the accelerated aging demographic.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On the other hand, this Parliament is straying off course in considering immigration as an instrument with which to secure the demographic and economic future of Europe. Just recently, one of the British Prime Minister’s most important advisers, Lord Turner, described the axiom that immigrants are necessary to make up for the shortage of workers as, and I quote, ‘economically illiterate and completely incorrect’. Europe already has a million unemployed immigrants, coupled with all the problems which go along with that. As more immigrants enter, these existing problems can only get worse.</p>

Under the framework of the proposed new working method, citizens’ queries and complaints should be handed back directly to the Member States in question.

      <p sl="it">The European Parliament in Strasbourg has proposed a new way of regulating products placed on the Community market. These products will have to comply with the rules in force and, following a careful appraisal, will be able to bear the CE mark.</p>
      <p sl="it">Over and above the introduction of joint liability on the part of importers and foreign manufacturers for damage caused by non-compliant products, the report proposes the development of a complex system of monitoring which lays down penalties proportionate to the seriousness of the offence so as to constitute an effective deterrent against improper use.</p>
      <p sl="it">Consumers and businesses can therefore look to the future with renewed optimism. The removal of barriers, the cornerstone of EU free-trade policy since the very outset, and the creation of a business-friendly economic climate will reflect a high level of protection both for consumers, through the observance of high standards on health and product safety, and for businesses, which will benefit at last from a rigorous system of checks and balances to protect goods made in Europe.</p>

The recommendations made in the report will bolster the EU’s efforts to protect consumers. The CE mark tends to be misunderstood as a safety mark, when in fact it is simply a statement of the product’s conformity with EU legislation. It is essential that we make sure that the mark is not abused and inform consumers of what the CE mark guarantees.</p>

      <p sl="sk">As rapporteur on behalf of the PPE-DE Group for the draft report by Mrs Schaldemose on the common framework for the marketing of products, I would like to express my satisfaction with the results of the vote: the compromise achieved has already made it possible to finalise the legislative process at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The agreed compromise includes the transfer of some of the articles dealing with the CE mark to the report by Mr Brie on market surveillance, so that they can be put into practice more quickly. Our decision to do so was based on clear information proving that products made in developing countries and wrongfully CE marked, that is bearing the CE logo that indicates that a product is in conformity with European legislation, keep turning up more and more often in the European database of dangerous consumer products (RAPEX).</p>
      <p sl="sk">Trusting or not trusting the CE mark cannot be based on the CE mark alone, out of context. There must be trust in the entire system of accreditation, notification and market surveillance.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I see no reason for introducing additional marking on products, not even if these were quality marks. Such new marking could be confusing for the end consumer and furthermore the extra cost could be reflected in the price of the goods. This is why I will curiously await the results of the impact study assessing the usage of national markings alongside the CE marking that the Commission should prepare, as requested by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Commission’s argument for proposing this Regulation is that ‘the “principle of mutual recognition” … is hampered by several problems’ (in other words, products marketed in one Member State may be prevented from being marketed in another). It believes that the possibility of national technical rules creating unlawful obstacles to the free movement of goods between Member States should be minimised. It therefore lays down requirements which authorities must meet when implementing a national technical rule and imposes on them the burden of proof. In other words, it is imposing conditions with the clear aim of restricting the possibility of each State applying its own rules.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For its part, the European Parliament report actually adds further obstacles to the action that each State may take, for example: ‘The aim of this Regulation is to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, with free and undistorted competition, by improving the free movement of products whilst ensuring a high level of consumer protection and product safety’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In practice, the Member States will be prohibited from restricting the sale in their territory of products where these are manufactured and marketed in another Member State, even though they may not fully comply with the rules of the Member State of destination.</p>

The document aims to clarify and define the role of national authorities and economic operators in the implementation of the mutual recognition principle. While I am in favour of increasing the efficiency with which the mutual recognition principle is implemented, it must not affect the single market’s base of further harmonisation. Furthermore, safety aspects must form part of the principle’s implementation. I am confident that the report sufficiently deals with these issues and therefore voted in favour of it.</p>

      <p sl="en">We do not agree with the mutual recognition principle as a guarantor for advanced consumer, social or environmental rights. The principle says that if the product is accepted somewhere in Europe, it cannot be denied access to another Member State unless the authorities can provide evidence that the application of a national technical rule is justified. However, the criteria for exceptions to the principle are already established by EU court rulings. And these apply to all Member States, regardless of whether or not we adopt the goods package.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to that, consumer rights at EU level are strengthened with the goods package.

      <p sl="de">I am in favour of the Internal Market for Goods Package, because it is essential to have a common framework for the marketing of products abroad. In an internal market which is based on the principles of technical harmonisation of rules governing the sale of products in the European market and the mutual recognition principle, we cannot have a situation in which the marketing of products which can already be put on sale in one Member State is substantially delayed or, in a worst-case scenario, actually obstructed due to excessive bureaucracy in another.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore welcome the reports by our fellow Members, Mrs Schaldemose and Mr Brie, who advocate a reduction in red tape and a common legal framework for future sectoral provisions so that in future, as much coherence as is politically and technically feasible is guaranteed. Finally, however, I would point out that both proposals require further refinement so that key definitions and especially the scope of the legal framework are properly clarified. If these proposals themselves lack clear terminology, achieving the desired harmonisation will be impossible.</p>

This legislation is so necessary that I have honestly wondered to myself why consumers and SMEs have had to wait so long.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The principle of mutual recognition was formulated by the Court of Justice almost 30 years ago and is now enshrined in legislation.

This, unfortunately, was the case with the 1995 resolution on the distribution of pension entitlements in the event of divorce and the resolution on the situation of spouses helping with SMEs, aimed at rectifying the many discriminations still suffered by women, and the terrible plight of far too many men in relation to paternity leave.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome Françoise Castex’s recommendations regarding Europe’s demographic future. The overall message of encouraging economic competitiveness while preserving the European social model is one that I feel is both logical and just. I agree with the report’s focus on the role of areas such as education, childcare and financial mechanisms in securing this goal. There also exists a necessity for the promotion of professional equality between men and women along with a well and calmly thought-out immigration policy that incorporates the goal of successful integration. The report deals with these issues and I voted in favour of its recommendations.</p>

The first is heralded as a miracle cure for the second, but merely leads to ethnomorphosis – in other words, to Umvolkung: the forced change of the population's ethnic composition. Unless the EU establishment finally starts to lobby for a pro-birth policy for the indigenous Europeans, promotes the traditional family with many children, finally takes action against attempts – such as gay marriage – to destroy the traditional family, and reintroduces zero tolerance to immigration, also in relation to family reunion, in fifty years' time we will be sitting here palavering about the Kosovisation of Europe, just as we are doing now with the Kosovo issue itself.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The EU must respond to serious demographic changes if it wants to preserve its demographic and territorial balance. On the one hand it is necessary to deal with population ageing. The situation is alarming. Each year after the year 2010 the number of people at work will decrease by 1 million and that will threaten intergenerational solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="sk">On the other hand there are the problems caused by the decreasing birth rate; these problems have already existed for several years. Postponing childbirth until later in life may be the reason for an increase in infertility of couples. Protection of mother and family must be the focus of all EU policies. Pension systems must not punish women for being mothers.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In recent years the differences between the Member States have been reducing but at the same time the differences inside the individual Member States have become much deeper. Disadvantaged regions in particular are less developed and on top of that they are also the ones most affected by demographic changes, namely by population ageing and migration. Since there are not enough well-paid jobs, qualified workers leave for the big cities. Heavy concentration of economic activities in capital cities erodes the demographic, economic, social and environmental balance and leads to a population decrease in rural areas that often lack the basic infrastructure needed for development.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Castex on the demographic future; this is one of the important reports. We have to realise that demographic development is a fundamental component of all policies, whether they are medium- or long-term.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The renewal of the European population is a crucial factor in ensuring a balance between the youngest and oldest and in increasing the working-age population. The consequences of the current falling birth rate and increased life expectancy will be an increase in the old-age dependency ratio and a decline in the working-age population. It is therefore essential to take steps to promote demographic renewal which will ensure a more productive and advanced Europe with a high degree of social protection and solidarity between the generations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We must develop policies that encourage the continual renewal of the European population and which ensure continued economic competitiveness, at the same time as preserving the European social model.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We cannot ignore one other aspect of this issue which is linked to Europe being a point of destination for significant migration flows, given that these populations invariably help to increase birth rates. The combination of the demographic issue with the migration issue poses potential risks and we cannot simply count on these populations for demographic renewal. I therefore want to stress the measures aimed at stimulating the birth rate, accompanied by appropriate policies on education and training and on solidarity between the generations, intended to halt the demographic decline of Europe.</p>

A number of proposals in the wide range of solutions, to say the least, that the report mentions are practised and have worked well in Sweden.

It also leads, however, to the gradual ageing of the population. In the long term, this situation can only upset the balance between the productive population and those who are past that stage. It is a threat to solidarity between the generations, because a smaller number of professionally active people than at present will have to bear the ever-increasing cost of benefits, allowances, pensions, care and health services for those who are not in work.</p>

The report recognises, in the recitals, that ‘increased financial resources for cohesion policy must be guaranteed in the future in order to deal with the anticipated new challenges’ (whether or not this actually relates to cohesion is a separate issue which has yet to be clarified). However, in the articles, or in other words in the actual proposal, the report merely alludes to an ambiguous need to reinforce the cohesion policy, to which ‘sufficient’ financial resources should be allocated.</p>

These amendments aimed, for example, to recognise that there are countries and regions which are at odds with the EU, to prevent use of the cohesion policy for other purposes, particularly to finance objectives included within the Lisbon Strategy which would be contrary to cohesion, to recognise the need to increase Community financial resources for cohesion, to impose conditions on Community aid for enterprises so that relocations are discouraged, to highlight the need to adopt permanent measures with adequate funding for the most remote regions and to recognise the role of fishing in cohesion.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have recorded strong growth. Similar help must be available for the new Member States. Like everyone else who grew up and lives in a more remote region, I know that there are pronounced disparities between regions, and even inside individual regions. Sometimes these disparities are even greater than disparities between individual countries: disparities in living standards, in the number of jobs available, in income and in education opportunities. This is why I emphasise that there is a real need to reduce the disparity between territorially accessible regions and regions facing structural disadvantages. I see the way forward as prioritising such policies that would decrease the pressure on capital cities and support the development of second-tier cities. It is necessary to support the development of rural areas; this is where small and medium-sized towns play an important role. It is also necessary to direct the funds towards projects intended to make each region attractive in its own right.

      <p sl="pt">However, not everything has been successful in this area. Firstly, it is essential that the cohesion funds are increasingly integrated with other funding programmes in order to guarantee that the benefits of these funds are not lost in the absence of a concomitant investment in policies directly aimed at more advanced stages of development. Sometimes it is necessary to take bigger steps, otherwise we will always be lagging behind.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are witnessing yet another crisis in East Timor. This crisis cannot be resolved without the involvement and cooperation of the East Timorese authorities. The latter must bring about the dissolution of all paramilitary groups and disarm civilians. Armed criminal groups must also be disbanded. Those responsible for attacks on the most important people in the country must be taken to court. All the political forces, both those in power and those in opposition must refrain from the illegal use of force.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Recent events indicate a strong likelihood that East Timor will become yet another country whose key institutions no longer function. It may well be deemed a failed state. We are all aware of the threat posed by such states. I am sure I do not need to quote examples, but let me just mention Somalia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In view of the role it played in setting up the state of East Timor and its continued involvement in it, the international community cannot allow such a bleak prospect to become a reality. The European Union's commitment to supporting democratic forces and institutions remains essential. On its mission, Parliament should assess the effectiveness of that support.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As underlined in our Group’s motion for a resolution, it is currently vital to express our solidarity with the East Timorese people and to condemn the attacks on the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister of East Timor. We would stress that such attacks can only increase the instability of the East Timorese political situation, created by the events of 2006 and 2007 and maintained by the political process resulting from the recent legislative elections in that country. We call for a thorough investigation, within the constitutional and legal framework of East Timor, to identify and try the main perpetrators of these attacks. We must be alert to any manoeuvres which, in light of these events, may aim to justify further outside interference and which may threaten the independence and sovereignty of East Timor.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore reject the joint resolution of the European Parliament which, among other aspects, seeks to ignore all the outside interference which has tried to condition and mould the free choices of the East Timorese people. Also, by trying to lump everyone together, it seeks to exempt from responsibility the main perpetrators and mentors of the violence and destabilisation of the situation in East Timor. It also seeks to ignore the fact that, in order to understand the current situation in East Timor, it is vital not to forget that its people were victims of colonialism, brutal repression and the destruction of their country and that its people heroically won their independence and sovereignty, in particular over their natural resources, in a fairly recent past, even after having been abandoned, at fundamental points in their struggle, by the international community.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Despite referring to respect for the sovereignty of the people of East Timor, this resolution forms a basis for interference in the internal affairs of that country. In fact, it adopts a stance which seeks to present East Timor as a failed state. Finally, this resolution ignores the fact that the solution is political and lies solely in the hands of the people of East Timor. In the past, the East Timorese people have more than adequately proven their dignity and courage and we express our confidence in their ability, by their own hands, to declare East Timor a sovereign and independent state.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I also want to call for an independent investigation, as requested in the motion for a resolution before us which we support, to find out who carried out the attacks, what they represented and what has failed in the security system of East Timor, both within East Timor and, in particular, internationally.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that this episode indicates that the international community must make further efforts to reinforce the state institutions of East Timor and, in particular, to reform the security system which was also called into question in the 2006 crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In addition, the issues relating to justice, compliance with justice and law and order must be considered. In this context, I must say that the attempts at national reconciliation with the rebel groups may have given a negative and counterproductive signal of impunity which has led the rebels to carry out this miserable attack.</p>
      <p sl="pt">East Timor is not a failed state and bears no similarities to Somalia with which Mr Onyszkiewicz has tried to associate it. East Timor gained its independence heroically, despite the international community’s silence, and the East Timorese people have already demonstrated on several occasions that they are committed to democracy. They once again demonstrated this in an exemplary manner in the presidential and legislative elections that took place last year during which I had the honour of heading up this Parliament’s mission.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The international community now has a responsibility to show its support for East Timor, to coordinate this support which it clearly failed to do in relation to the security system, and to resolve the basic issues of the structure of the East Timorese state.

      <p sl="pt">Unfortunately, on 11 February, crisis returned to East Timor, once again at the hands of the same people who were responsible for the crisis two years ago. This prompts us to ask questions about the return of those who would harm the stability of this country and the gravity of an attack which seriously injured, and could even have fatally injured, the President of the Republic, José Ramos-Horta, and which also, fortunately without any personal consequences, affected the Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmão.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The violence and the disruption of the normal functioning of the institutions have once again laid bare the failures of a country with the history and circumstances of East Timor, which courageously fought and is fighting for independence, democracy and progress.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Anyone having supported East Timor from the beginning cannot fail to feel renewed sadness at this incident which we vehemently condemn. We hope that President Ramos-Horta will fully recover and we call for a thorough investigation into what happened and into the necessary response to this.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Unfortunately, the international forces were slow to act, with the exception of the Portuguese GNR (National Republican Guard). There are also clear failings in the rule of law in East Timor which is not functioning fully and which has in fact never functioned fully. East Timor needs to rebuild the very core of its security system in order to ensure law and order.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The international community must assist the East Timorese people in these steps. This is not a failed state; it is a state with failings that we must support.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the main responsibility obviously lies with the East Timorese people who must try to achieve a cross-party compromise for lasting peace and respect for the rule of law and judicial decisions, without hesitation, without prevarication and without complacency. They have already managed to reach agreement on what we would call a national consensus with regard to the very core of the state’s operation.</p>

It would, in fact, be a good idea if some of our friends, Spain included, for instance, took a leaf out of the Portuguese book and assumed their responsibilities in terms of legacies from former colonies, as is the case in Western Sahara.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is, however, obvious that all these cases are no simple matter, nor do they produce immediate results. Mention must be made of the difficulties experienced by East Timor where, following peaceful elections a few months ago, there are still many disturbances, including an attempt on the life of President Ramos Horta. Here I wish to add my best wishes to those already sent by the House for a speedy recovery, and also to Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão.</p>
      <p sl="es">No one, I feel, will dispute the willingness to reach agreement, as demonstrated by President Ramos Horta, among many others, and I am sure that even after this attack President Ramos Horta will lead any work that is required to find a political agreement between the opposing factions to settle differences in a democratic, non-violent manner.</p>
      <p sl="es">For this, however, the international community must be fully committed, and the UN mandate renewed, as some countries have suggested. It must be renewed in any case until 2012 and at all times in response to the needs and requests of the Timorese Government and democratic forces.</p>
      <p sl="es">The UN presence on the ground also ought to be in line with the needs of the country and should be reviewed not only in terms of reconstruction and dealing with basic necessities, but also in terms of the ability to act in a preventive fashion and react to disturbances.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, the EU must set up a delegation in Dili as soon as possible and Parliament must also make arrangements for a delegation of observers to support the democratic forces in the country and to assess the focus and effectiveness of EU assistance at the present time.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, East Timor is certainly not a failed state. However, the fact that on 11 February 2008 both the democratically elected President and the Prime Minister became victims of armed attempts on their lives is proof of how fragile a young democracy can be.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to make three points. First, we are really worried about the lack of timely and efficient reaction by UNPOL and other international forces to these attacks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Second, the EU has a responsibility to assist the democratic institutions of East Timor and to consolidate the rule-of-law system there. The motion for a resolution rightly emphasises the urgent need to reach a national agreement on core issues of democracy.</p>

The attacks were carried out after the President had attempted to achieve a negotiated solution with the rebels.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The EP motion for a resolution on East Timor is entirely appropriate. It explains the tragic situation of the people of that country and the powerlessness of national authorities, international institutions and the peacekeeping forces. The internal conflict is still continuing, despite many efforts and substantial international aid. People are losing their lives, livelihoods are being destroyed and cultural heritage damaged. There is widespread poverty affecting almost 80% of the population, unemployment, disenchantment and illiteracy. All this is having a negative effect on the people, leading to despair and inciting revolt.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The people of East Timor want to live in peace and harmony. They want to work, learn and develop their country's economy. For this to happen, the democratic authorities in the country must be strengthened, and aid from international institutions increased. The authors of this resolution therefore rightly call for East Timor to be assured political, technical and financial support. They also recall that both the European Union and the United Nations have made public commitments to supporting independence, democracy and rule-of-law governments. The Union for Europe of the Nations Group will support this resolution.</p>

I will say it again, because who does not recall the pictures from last year, following the appointment of Gusmão, of hundreds of houses and some government buildings in flames?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Indeed, an international force is probably necessary in order to deal with the current crisis. However, it certainly must not create the impression by so doing that the government needs foreign soldiers to protect itself against its own people. A foreign force can maintain stability by manu militari in the short term, but in the long term the people of East Timor themselves must ensure their own future. In order to guarantee political stability, democracy and respect for human rights in the long term, in the first place they need an independent and reliable media, they need a reformed police force and they need a sound judicial system.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, East Timor is widely considered to be the most successful example of a transformation process in the history of the United Nations. East Timor does, however, seem to have forgotten the sacrifices it made during its war of independence to put an end to its brutal occupation by Indonesia lasting 24 years, and the joy with which it celebrated its own independence. Less than six years after regaining its independence, however, East Timor now stands on the brink of chaos. The transition to democracy and independence is never easy. It is not the end of the journey but only the beginning. One thing is absolutely certain, however, namely that violence never can be and never has been the way to deal with problems. That must be made quite clear. The way to resolve problems is through dialogue, political pluralism, strengthening democratic institutions such as the parliament, an independent judicial system and governments working under democratically elected leaders.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Thank you, Mr President. Eighteen months have now passed since the last European Parliament resolution on East Timor. Officially, this country became independent in 2002. Four years later a civil war broke out, triggered by a group of demobilised soldiers. After the attack on President Ramos Horta on 11 February of this year, East Timor experienced yet another political crisis. A state of emergency was declared and a request made for the then 1 600-strong peacekeeping force to be reinforced.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The political crisis in East Timor is accompanied by an economic one. Unemployment is in the order of 80%, and 40% of the unemployed are living below the poverty threshold.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The country cannot be stabilised unless all the political forces reach a consensus on the fundamental functions of the state. We must condemn the brutal attack on the President and the Prime Minister and call upon the government of East Timor to put an end to violence, including the activities of gangs. The international community, notably the UN and the Security Council, must support the consolidation of democracy. It should also be remembered that East Timor urgently needs economic aid to combat poverty and develop administration and infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="en">The young democracy of East Timor is still extremely vulnerable in its political, judicial and security institutions. The country is confronted with poverty and high unemployment, especially among the young people who have so far little expectations for a prosperous future and are amenable to violent groups.</p>

      <p sl="pl">author, Mr President, most of the political prisoners held in Belarus were recently released, in fact nearly all of them were, with only one exception. This does not mean we can be confident that things are moving in the right direction in Belarus. On that very same day, the homes of a whole range of individuals connected with the opposition in Belarus were raided. In addition a secondary school teacher was sacked. By way of explanation he was told that since he was a member of the opposition Civil Party he did not represent an ideology in line with that of the State.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A very strange situation exists in Belarus. In that country, there is a concept of state ideology, and therefore it is hardly surprising that when candidates apply to study journalism, law, and international relations, they have to present recommendations from the authorities. That is how the selection process works. This is totally unacceptable, although we do welcome the step taken and are cautiously pleased about it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As for Belarus itself, the question that immediately springs to mind is what the underlying reason for such action can be. It would appear that through this action and by consenting to the opening of a European Commission delegation in Minsk, President Lukashenko wishes to demonstrate that he does not feel irrevocably bound to adopt a pro-Russian policy to the exclusion of all others. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly difficult to conduct such a policy in Belarus. The country does not wish to become totally absorbed by Russia. In this instance, even Mr Lukashenko has adopted such a stance, but events speak for themselves.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Russia is quite simply buying up Belarus. Gazprom has just concluded yet another transaction, as a result of which it now owns one quarter of the shares in the companies controlling the oil and gas transit routes through Belarus. Gazprom's share will soon increase to 50%. It also seems that Russia will succeed in persuading Belarus to adopt the rouble as its national currency.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As a result of all this, the situation is becoming increasingly threatening. Support for independent action in Belarus and for civil society is all the more necessary. Support is already being made available, but it must be scaled up. In particular, support must be provided for the institutions that have just been set up in Belarus. I could focus on television broadcasts to the country, which are an important resource for ensuring that the local people know what is actually going on. In my view, we should keep Belarus in the forefront of our minds, because this is an issue for Europe as a whole. We cannot tolerate a situation in which there is a country like Belarus, run by a dictator, in the very centre of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, in spite of the strongly critical tone of the contributions I am happy to say that we have at least two positive aspects here.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The first one is the opening of the European Commission delegation in Minsk, which as far as I know, has also been approved by the President of Belarus. I believe that opening an EU delegation provides the bases for further development and activating of relations with the European Union in such mutually advantageous areas as energy, transport, transit and even protection of the environment.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The other positive factor I consider important is the meeting of experts in Brussels last June, which concentrated mainly on the issues of energy supply and also the planned expert talks on transport corridors and the environment. I consider this development to be extremely important. We must not forget that Belarus itself is still struggling with the extremely serious consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Present trends in mutual relations reveal that a certain view of Belarus has taken hold among the political circles of the European Union and that view is very critical and one-sided.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We need not just criticism but also cooperation. The time has come for a positive step on the part of Belarus as well, and I think that the official Belarusian regime should offer at least a moratorium on the death penalty, which could enable us to open new negotiations regarding the status of Belarus’ membership of the Council of Europe. On the part of the EU, I would welcome for example a relaxation of the visa system or support for young specialists from Belarus on work experience by providing them with opportunities to get to know the workings of the European institutions at first hand.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this afternoon I would firstly like to welcome the positive sign of relations between the EU and Belarus. The recent developments on the agreements to establish the European Commission’s delegation in Minsk are a positive step toward renewing dialogue with the European Union and Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would like to encourage the Commission to use the full potential of the opening of a delegation. The time has come for the international community as a whole to extend more support to civil society in Belarus, in particular to increase financial aid to the independent media, to non-governmental organisations and to Belarusian students studying abroad. The Commission’s decision to give financial support to the European Humanities University in Vilnius is very wise. The Commission and the Council should consider offering financial support to the project, which is already in existence, to create the independent Belarusian television channel Belsat.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the European Parliament calls on the Commission and the Council to take further steps towards the facilitation and liberalisation of visa procedures for Belarusian citizens. We call on Member States in the Schengen area to use all available tools, mainly national visa costs, in order to facilitate the movement of Belarusian citizens within each Member State’s territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we call on President Lukashenko’s regime above all to move towards liberalisation and democratisation, to release all prisoners of conscience in the country, to introduce the rule of law and freedom of media associations and to abolish the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I would like to express this afternoon our solidarity with the United Democratic Opposition of Belarus, the leader of the democratic movement, Alexander Milinkevich, and all Belarusian citizens in their struggle towards an open society.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Thank you, Mr President. The actions taken by Mr Lukashenko's dictatorship against his own people in Belarus are widely known. Since the beginning of this year alone, three peaceful demonstrations have been brutally suppressed. The authorities are systematically persecuting opposition activists. They have brought in restrictions on travel abroad by members of the clergy and religious instruction teachers. Some rather curious provisions have also been introduced. For example, anyone wishing to study law or journalism must be approved by the ruling authorities. Against this background, imposing stricter sanctions against Belarus unfortunately seems to be the only possible response to recent events. We must not forget, however, that it is our moral right and duty to create and support civil society in Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One of the immediate measures to assist the opposition is to overcome the news blackout. A good example of this is the initiative taken by the Polish national television service, which began to broadcast to Belarus on 10 December 2007 through the first independent channel, called Belsat. Unfortunately, as Mrs Romaszewska, the producer responsible for this project, told me today, no financial support from the European Union has yet been received. There is not even a budget line from which human rights and democracy in Belarus could be supported.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that the high cost of Schengen visas is another mayor problem for the people of Belarus. If access to the European Union for members of Mr Lukashenko's regime is restricted, we must make access to the Union easier for people who are not connected with that regime.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in January of this year, 10 young activists of the Belarusian Popular Front Youth and Malady Front (‘Young Front’) were arrested after they met a delegation of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe (DEMYC) in Minsk, and then faced expulsion from their universities.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the last real dictatorship in Europe. Belarus still has the death penalty, political prisoners, arbitrary arrests, media censorship, violence and restrictions on access to the internet. All Europeans should not take their liberty for granted, and young Europeans should follow the DEMYC example in showing solidarity with their neighbours by standing up for democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Belarus cannot be a partner of the EU while this intolerable intimidation and targeted arrests continue. Reading the official internet biography of President Lukashenko, I became aware that he considers himself to be ‘notable for his in-depth understanding of events, hard work, sense of duty, realism, fairness and fidelity to principles’. Why, then, can Mr Lukashenko not realise a very simple and plain fact: Soviet-style tyrants belong in the past?</p>
      <p sl="en">As to the students, repressed and deprived of their fundamental right to education, I urge our Parliament to join me in paraphrasing the song: Hey, Lukashenko, leave the kids alone!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Belarus is and remains the problem child in our Neighbourhood Policy. Dictator Lukashenko continues to ensure that his country systematically distances and isolates itself from its neighbours. He tramples human rights under foot and maintains the death penalty. This is not only a concern for us; it is also encountering massive opposition among Belarus's own population. More and more young people are leaving Belarus. It is a dramatic situation for that country.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union's task is therefore to help Belarus to return to the path towards democracy. From my perspective, this will not happen with Dictator Lukashenko and his presidential apparatus, but only with the opposition, civil society and the young people who could form the country's future elite.</p>
      <p sl="de">So I appeal to the Member States to change their visa policy for these people and give them the chance to engage in exchanges with young people in the European Union, a chance of democratic education and a chance actually to experience democracy for themselves by visiting the European Union. Visa policy must not become an insurmountable obstacle which obstructs the path to democracy. That is extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="de">In negotiations with Lukashenko, however, there should be no concessions on human rights. There is consensus on this point in Parliament, across all the parliamentary groups: we want the release of all political prisoners, a moratorium on the death penalty, media freedom and respect for all the basic principles of democracy. That is the fundamental prerequisite for negotiations. No concessions. The crucial factor here is what happens at the next elections. I hope very much for the Belarusian people that they take control of their own destiny.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Belarus is a neighbour of the European Union. It shares with us a difficult history of Communist domination, but still does not enjoy democratic rule and respect for human rights. The regime of President Lukashenko brutally represses any attempt to create civil society. I would remind the House that Mr Lukashenko infringed democratic procedures in order to gain a further term of office. Journalists and leaders of independent youth organisations and independent trade unions are being intimidated. Members of the political opposition have been arrested. I could mention the Kazulin case that Mrs Gacek referred to just now, and the repression of national minorities, including the Polish national minority. Latterly the regime has become concerned about the financial independence of small entrepreneurs and taken repressive measures against them. Such is the sad state of affairs in Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is the European Union's moral duty to provide financial support and information for all those striving to defend human rights and democratic freedoms in Belarus by way of the independent media, for instance through television broadcasts to Belarus.</p>

Ten years after the Chernobyl disaster I took part legally in a demonstration in Minsk.

In addition, however, I should like to mention another very important issue, namely that we cannot deal with policy on Belarus in isolation from the European Union's eastern policy as a whole. We had a tendency to forgive the Russian administration a great many undemocratic actions. That should be borne in mind. I know that events in Belarus do not bear comparison with what is currently taking place in Russia, but they most certainly did and do bear comparison with what took place in Chechnya. We cannot adopt one course of action for Belarus and a different one for Russia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Conducting our eastern policy from the point of view of enlargement of the European Union is another very important issue. The fate of Ukraine currently hangs in the balance, and if it swings towards democracy it will enrich the whole of Europe. If we are prepared to open the door to the people of Ukraine, it will send a signal to the people of Belarus and show them that there is another option, one involving closer links and relationships with the European Union. In the future it may also involve membership of the Union, although that may not come about for many years.</p>

The official reason for his expulsion was that he had failed to attend classes. The reason he had been absent, however, was that he had been arrested. Expulsion from university means that a person's education comes to an abrupt end. It also means that there is a strong chance of being conscripted into the army. I imagine that only people who have had personal experience of living under a dictatorship will understand what service in the regime’s army can be like for a member of the opposition. It could prove very dangerous for this young man. I believe we should do all we can to assist in resolving the situation in Belarus.</p>

The only way to counter a dictatorship is through democracy. I would say to the Commissioner that, if I were in her place, I would make every effort to assist in training the thinking democratic elite. If we do not succeed in doing so in Belarus, we might yet do so in other countries. Someone needs to lead the way, and I would be inclined to rely on those elites.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, recently, the situation in Belarus has been evolving rapidly. Since mid-January, five of the six political prisoners previously identified as such have been released. One of these political prisoners, though, former presidential candidate Aleksandr Kozulin, is still in jail and in a poor state of health.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, for its part, through my colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, has expressed its satisfaction with the release of the prisoners, which has been a long-standing request from all EU institutions, including the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we have equally been clear that we want to see all political prisoners freed, and that we want to see an end to the systematic harassment of Belarusian civil society, before we can give a new dimension to our relationship with Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="en">In other words, our message to Belarus remains the same: there cannot be a full partnership with Belarus until Belarus takes convincing steps towards democratisation, and respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the gist of the European message to Belarus that the Commission released over a year ago and which includes the ‘12 points for democratisation’ that your resolution mentions. Again, the release of all political prisoners would be an important step in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, we will be closely watching the parliamentary elections set for September 2008. The organisation of free and fair elections would be seen as a decisive step on the part of the Belarusian authorities. We hope that the OSCE will be able to send a full-scale observation mission to this election and that the European Parliament will also be able to send representatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another important point that your resolution demands is that Belarus should apply a moratorium on the death penalty. The European Union has carried this message to the Belarusian authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Coming back now to the recent developments in Belarus, another issue close to our hearts has been progressing fast over the last months: the opening of the European Commission’s delegation in Minsk, which we officially requested more than two years ago, is now imminent. We hope to be able to sign the establishment agreement soon, so that our delegation can be opened without delay.</p>
      <p sl="en">This delegation will allow us to reinforce our links with Belarusian civil society and also to develop contacts with the middle rank of the administration that could be open to democratic change.</p>
      <p sl="en">On this matter, as your resolution underlines, we have had a number of meetings at technical level with Belarusian experts on matters of mutual interest, such as energy, transport and environment. Let me, however, reiterate that the scope of these meetings remains limited as long as the current political conditions prevail in Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards to the Commission actions to support civil society in Belarus, the Commission remains committed more than ever to supporting Belarusian civil society, and our 2008 assistance plan is aimed in particular at cementing Belarusian civil society and independent media. In addition, the Commission has also made clear that its support to the European Humanity University in exile in Vilnius will continue as long as necessary. I will also pass the message about the Free University on to Commissioner Figeľ. I think that this is very interesting and a bright idea.</p>
      <p sl="en">A few other comments to Mr Pinior and Ms Schroedter. The opening of the negotiations on visa facilitation and on readmission is amongst the elements that would be considered in the event of a real breakthrough in our relationship. According to EU policy, visa facilitation can only be considered in the context of the European Commission readmission policy as part of a real partnership in external relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">This was explained to Belarus in the verbal notes sent by the Commission on 8 May. The European Union’s willingness to enter into such negotiations with neighbouring countries with an action plan in force has also been reaffirmed, by the Commission communication on this matter of December 2006. In the case of Belarus these conditions are not met.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the point raised by Mr Bielan, Commission contracts are awarded following strict tendering procedures in order to ensure a transparent and fair competition. This means that the Commission does not support radio and TV stations as such, but specific programmes instead. The ENPI Regional Information and Communication Programme includes support to media activities of EUR 7 million over three years for seven countries. The tendering procedure is ongoing, and media from both European Union and partner countries are eligible to submit tenders for contracts.</p>

      <p sl="pl">As joint author of the European Parliament's resolution on Belarus, I would like to draw attention to the state of democracy, respect for human rights and in general to the situation of the people of Belarus. Belarus is not only a near neighbour of the Union, involved in the European Neighbourhood Policy, but it is also an immediate neighbour of my country, Poland. We share a common border.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is probably the best explanation of why the issue of fulfilling the real hopes and expectations of ordinary people in that country is so important to me in my work here in the European Parliament. After all, one cannot remain indifferent to what one can see happening just across the border: restrictions and administrative pressure on NGOs, intimidation, persecution and imprisonment of democratic opposition activists, including leaders of the youth movements known as the Belarusian Popular Front and Young Front.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Genuine dialogue between the Belarusian authorities and the European Union should therefore be set up quickly. It is not only the Union's right but also its duty to require the Belarusian Government to free all political prisoners, guarantee media freedom, the independence of the judiciary, and also respect for democratic values and the fundamental rights of the people of Belarus. Priority must be given to abolition of the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For its part, the European Parliament has moved towards making it easier for Belarusian citizens to enter EU territory and spend time there. The reduction or even total lifting of visa charges is currently under consideration. That is the only way to prevent Belarus and its citizens from becoming even more isolated.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this Parliament is rightly paying great attention to what is going on in the former Belgian colony of the Democratic Republic of Congo and in particular to the continued fighting, forcible displacement, rape and mass assassination in the east of that vast country. These horrors have been part of the conflict in the neighbouring countries of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. Internationally recognised state borders have little meaning for groups of people who must seek new territories as a result of being expelled or the continuing lack of means of existence. Everything is in motion in this region, and the thing is that the slightest movement one way or the other potentially stirs up either violence or horror. Warlords who acquire respect, power and wealth by their innate love of conflict increase the already existing problems and make them even more difficult to solve.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Very recently, on 17 January, we discussed the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo here in this House and adopted a resolution that stated our wish to see all horrors cease. I fear that we could adopt many more resolutions on this matter without any solutions coming of it. The expectation that last year’s elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo could solve the problems has ended in disappointment. The incumbent president, Kabila, has won, but he represents different points of view from the movement from which he originated, and the outcomes of both the presidential and parliamentary elections were controversial for the opposition.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The question is, how is such a large country with poor lines of communication and a wide range of peoples to function in a way that is supported by its whole population and all its divergent political forces. It does not seem that this is likely to succeed in an area like the Democratic Republic of Congo, where life-threatening diseases reign, the environment and the land are over-exploited, and people remain completely without rights. The question is whether the armistice of 23 January for North and South Kivu, which takes for granted the disarmament of the warring factions and the return of refugees to their places of residence, is feasible, and whether the United Nations can contribute on the ground to this end. It will not succeed by electing parties in the midst of conflict but possibly by persuading parties, the warring party for example, to abandon sexual violence and allow doctors in.</p>

    <intervention id="4-232" speaker_id="28282" name="Alain Hutchinson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I do not intend to discuss the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo in its entirety, but rather the north-east of the country, and the Kivu region, where a vile war has been raging for years, and even more intensely in recent months.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You might say that all wars are vile, but I feel this one is much more so. This war has produced, and continues to produce, hundreds of thousands of victims, deaths and displaced persons, but hundreds and thousands of women, little girls and grandmothers have also suffered what is now called sexual violence. It is more than that, however; it is the use of rape as a genuine weapon of war, and this goes on amid a certain amount of indifference in public opinion and the international community, and more specifically European public opinion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This vile war has been raging for two years between rival factions: the rebel troops led by Laurent Nkunda, a dissident Congolese general, the former perpetrators of genocide in Rwanda who were imported after the end of the campaign in 1994, but also, unfortunately, certain elements of the recently dismantled Congolese army. That is enough. Fortunately a peace conference was held there recently, attended by all the factions involved, and it led to a cease-fire. Unfortunately, Mr President, the cease-fire is extremely fragile and tension is again mounting.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore propose two essential priorities: the first concern is protection for civilians, to provide means for the MONUC mission on the ground to defend them. In accordance with Chapter VII of the UN Charter it can use weapons to carry out the mission, for these massacres simply must stop. The second priority is to support the peace efforts discussed there, because the solution to the problem in the Great Lakes region would be a political solution involving all parties, including Rwanda, which must honour its commitments to repatriate its nationals operating in Kivu.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, since the end of the Second World War, no other conflict has been as cruel and barbaric as that in the Congo. Armed conflict in North Kivu province has continued with variable intensity for the last 10 years. It has resulted in more than five million victims. Some 1 500 people are dying every day as a result of the fighting.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mass killings, the rape of young girls and mothers, and forced conscription of civilians and children into the armed forces are the order of the day. Many other serious violations of human rights have also taken place in recent months in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. They have been committed by the rebel groups loyal to Laurent Nkunda, by the fighters of the democratic forces attempting to liberate Rwanda, and by the Congolese army itself. The eastern part of Congo is in need of immediate medical aid and food supplies, as recent events have forced most humanitarian organisations to suspend their activities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore call on the Council and the European Commission to make crisis funding available in view of the unusually grave humanitarian situation in this region.</p>

    <intervention id="4-234" speaker_id="2229" name="Bernd Posselt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, anyone who has ever seen the Great Lakes region of East Africa from the air might think that it was paradise. In reality, it is often more like hell on earth. It is a region of fantastic natural beauty and a wealth of natural resources, on the one hand, and appalling suffering, on the other: natural disasters, war, expulsion, famine, disease, massacres, mass rape and ethnic conflicts – worse than almost anywhere else. There are 800 000 internally displaced persons in North Kivu alone.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important to recognise that this problem of expulsion exists on both sides of the border. In Africa, there is a phenomenon which does not exist in this form anywhere else, namely that people are not just displaced from one specific side of the border to the other. Instead, each country expels people from its side of the border into the other country, so there are refugees and displaced persons on both sides. As a result, the countries are completely unstable. That is why we need to provide humanitarian aid, and we need a massive presence here in order to help the people.</p>
      <p sl="de">In essence, however, that is merely tinkering with the symptoms. Unless we can establish reasonably viable state and rule-of-law structures, the disaster will never end, no matter how much assistance we provide. That is why it is extremely important for us to play a major role, also politically. The cease-fire of 23 January is extremely fragile and only really exists on paper. That is why we need to force all the parties, as a matter of urgency, to get round the table and talk to each other, but it also means that we have to play our part.</p>
      <p sl="de">Regrettably, Europeans often profit from these disasters. That is why the call for us to take certificates of origin more seriously, e.g. for natural resources, is justified, for often it is the Europeans who brutally exploit the people's suffering for their own economic interests. We have a responsibility here too, and we should not be content with making pretty speeches and applying sticking plaster solutions.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, we have a new episode today in this tragic serial set in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this case the scene is North Kivu, but the plot and the victims are the same, as covered by an emergency resolution in the January part-session.</p>
      <p sl="es">Almost five and a half million people have died in the war since 1998, and forty-five thousand more die every month, directly or indirectly due to the war. The upshot of this is that one thousand five hundred people die every day: in other words, since we started this part-session on Monday, six thousand people have died already in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
      <p sl="es">The last few months, moreover, particularly in the east of the country, have seen an increase in massacres, rape of little girls and women, and forced recruitment of girls and boys. Both Laurent Nkunda’s rebel troops and the soldiers fighting in the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda are responsible for all this.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also ought to remember that the MONUC mandate is based on Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, giving it the authority to use all necessary means to dissuade any attempt to use force that jeopardises the life or integrity of civilians or constitutes a threat to the political process.</p>
      <p sl="es">To date, however, the MONUC presence has proved totally insufficient to bring an end to these barbaric acts. We must therefore again appeal to the Security Council to react and provide all available means to curtail these massacres.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, although we must welcome the Goma Conference paving the way towards political negotiation, its agreements, especially agreements concerning demobilisation, remain ambiguous, and their application is unclear.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, this is another chance, as Mr Posselt has already said, to again call for control mechanisms to be activated and implemented such as the Kimberley Process for diamonds producing certificates of origin for natural resources imported by the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Joseph Conrad referred to Congo as the heart of darkness. From the beginning of its existence, that is to say from 1960 onwards, Congo has been the scene of horrific pogroms, killings and civil wars. As a result, Congo has never been able to stand on its own two feet despite being endowed with abundant natural resources. The conflict in the area is the most cruel and barbarous to have occurred since the end of the Second World War. Sadly, it is still ongoing, claiming the lives of almost 50 000 human beings every month. Half of the victims are children under the age of five. The passage of the armies is accompanied by all kinds of crimes against the civilian population: rapes, looting and murder. That is why we welcome the outcome of the Goma peace conference and have such high hopes of it. It could mean the end of armed conflict in the Kivu region, but whether it does will depend partly on us too.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It may, however, prove impossible to resolve this conflict without support from the international community and neighbouring countries. It is important for international support not to be limited to political declarations, but to focus first and foremost on providing appropriate financial, organisational and technical assistance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, according to the aid agencies, the situation in North Kivu is in some respects even worse than in Darfur. North Kivu is not in the spotlight, however, and no one in the international community is taking notice of what is happening there. Since the official peace agreement in 2002, Kabila's government has attempted to integrate the regional militia into a national army, so far without much success. The civilian population is still vulnerable to the impacts of the armed conflicts. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) highlights the difficulties facing relief workers in gaining access to the civilian population due to the continued fighting and says that malnutrition is another major threat to the population in North Kivu.</p>
      <p sl="de">We therefore urge the Council and the Commission to provide aid immediately and to launch comprehensive medical assistance programmes for the civilian population in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo without delay. We also urge the Council and the Commission to ensure that the recent strengthening of the UN mission leads to substantial improvements in the security of the population.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, despite the agreement reached in Goma on improving security and development in Congo, human rights are still being violated in Kivu province. Three hundred thousand individuals have been forced to leave their homes due to rising violence since the end of 2006 alone. The violence affects women and children in particular. They become the victims of rape or are forced to join armed groups. To date, six million individuals have been displaced, and five million have died as a result of conflict and war fuelled by economic interest groups and supported by governments eager to benefit from the riches available there.</p>
      <p sl="pl">That is why what is needed is more than debates and resolutions in the European Parliament and humanitarian assistance to the inhabitants of Congo.

According to the UN, since the start of the conflict 800 000 people have fled their homes. Thousands and thousands of women and young girls have become the victims of vicious rapes, and children are forced to take part in the fighting.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Furthermore, we must not forget that the members of the Nkunda militia are not the only ones responsible for massive cruelties. No, all parties, including the government soldiers, have systematically committed crimes against humanity. There are not many ‘good guys’ in North Kivu. Ultimately, therefore, the same number of culprits must be tried. They must answer for their atrocities.

I wish to draw attention to a situation I have seen for myself, namely the high numbers of children orphaned in the area as a result of the conflict. In my view the funding should go to missionaries to enable them to care for those children, especially the boys, so that they are not conscripted into the armies.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission remains very concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in the Kivus, and North Kivu in particular, where the number of internally displaced people – currently exceeding 800 000 in North Kivu alone – has as much as doubled in the course of 2007, thus alarmingly increasing the vulnerability of the population already suffering hardship.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we are aware of, and condemn, the severe human rights abuses – including recruitment of child soldiers and widespread sexual violence – taking place in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet, in this context, it is important to remember that today’s critical situation in North Kivu, while exacerbated by the fighting taking place in the second half of 2007, is a result of years of war in the region. The root causes of the Kivu conflict can be traced all the way to the Rwandan genocide at the beginning of the 1990s, while also bearing in mind that there are several local components – such as insufficient political representation of ethnic minorities, pillaging of natural resources and land tenure issues – that significantly contribute to the instability and insecurity in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why the Commission welcomes the recent Goma Peace Conference and the following cease-fire as positive steps towards solving the enduring conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The Conference restored President Kabila’s credibility after the army’s defeat against General Nkunda’s troops at the end of 2007, and launched an inter-provincial dialogue process – something that the Commission has always advocated.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, along the lines of the commitments made by the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda in their Nairobi Joint Communiqué in November 2007, the Goma Conference also re-emphasised the need to tackle the problem of the ex-FAR as a priority. At the same time, it was made clear that there is a need to address the root causes of the conflict, while restoring the State authority in the east.</p>
      <p sl="en">That said, it should not be forgotten that nothing was definitively solved at Goma or Nairobi. Finding a permanent solution to the root causes of the Kivu crisis, and thus a sustainable restoration of peace in the region, will take time. Indeed, while complementing each other, the Nairobi Joint Communiqué and the Goma Conference represent an encouraging start – but only a start – of a difficult and lengthy process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main challenge ahead is now an effective implementation of the Nairobi and Goma commitments. It ought to be assured that all the concerned stakeholders stand by their commitments. The EU will continue to follow closely and participate actively in this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, international action in support of the Congolese is very much needed. The Commission, together with the Member States, is ready to continue to play an important role in the Kivus. We have traditionally been one of the most important donors in the east, via our humanitarian assistance and our rehabilitation and capacity-building programmes. We are willing to further increase our support for the region, especially through European initiatives, as well as in close collaboration with the United Nations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I rise on behalf of my group with an oral amendment to the proposed amendment. While freedom of expression is laid down in the Commission’s non-paper, the internet is sadly not particularly included or singled out. Therefore, to be factually correct and to include all freedoms of expression, not just on the internet, we ask that the phrase ‘on the internet’ be removed from the amendment.</p>
