      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Court of Auditors’ Annual Report. I am delighted to welcome the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Weber, to this House.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-013" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Hubert Weber" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Court of Auditors">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Vice-President Kallas, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity today of participating in your debate on the 29th Annual Report of the Court of Auditors, for the 2005 financial year, at the plenary session of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">I presented this report to the Committee on Budgetary Control in Strasbourg on 23 October and to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) in Brussels on 7 November. Each annual report from the Court is the culmination of complex and exhaustive audit work performed in situ by our auditors over the course of the preceding 12 months at all levels of the administration of EU resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">In accordance with the principles of international auditing standards and as corroborated by external experts, the audit evidence of the Court is based on the exhaustive examination of samples of transactions from the individual budget areas and on assessments of the functioning of the internal control systems for expenditure. Only serious formal errors and errors with financial consequences, inflated expenditure claims, ineligible beneficiaries and expenditure form the basis of the Court’s Statement of Assurance.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of the Court’s primary duties, and one that it has been required under the Treaty to carry out since its inception, is to perform cost-benefit analyses, the results of which the Court publishes in its special reports. In addition, the Court's assessments of the internal control systems, which are required for the annual Statement of Assurance, form an important basis for these cost-benefit analyses.</p>
      <p sl="de">Allow me now to turn to the Court's key audit findings for 2005. In respect of those areas in which considerable improvements have been achieved, the Court duly recognises the Commission’s success in managing and implementing the change from cash-based to accruals-based accounting. The Court has reached the conclusion that the consolidated annual accounts of the EU general budget for 2005, totalling EUR 105 billion, are reliable. I must qualify this audit opinion, however, in the light of the net overvaluation of assets and the inconsistent application of cut-off procedures.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards the legality and regularity of underlying transactions, the Court again provides an unqualified opinion on revenue, funds commitment, EU administrative expenditure and pre-accession strategy, excluding Sapard.</p>
      <p sl="de">A positive view can also be taken of the Integrated Administrative and Control System (IACS), which covers 56% of expenditure within the framework of the common agricultural policy. As in 2004, the Court confirms that the IACS has, where properly implemented, successfully played its part in preventing irregular agricultural expenditure. In practice this is the case in the EU15, with the exception of Greece. In the new Member States, the implementation of IACS has progressed well, although these systems are not yet fully effective.</p>
      <p sl="de">As the Court’s detailed audit evidence shows, the remainder of the areas of expenditure, which accounts, in terms of value, for the majority of the EU budget, is still characterised by material errors of legality and regularity in the underlying transactions. In other words, the Court is once again unable to approve without qualification the expenditure areas, in particular, of agriculture (taken as a whole), structural measures and internal and external policies. This is the result of the high level of irregularities found, which include inflated expenditure claims, duplicated cost listings, ineligible beneficiaries and/or projects, claims for expenditure not actually incurred and breaches of the rules governing public tendering procedures.</p>
      <p sl="de">These irregularities are able to occur because the current internal controls on EU expenditure are inadequate. According to the EC Treaty it is the responsibility of the Commission to ensure that the internal control systems are in place and work effectively in practice at all levels of EU administration. Not only has the Court found evidence of the inadequate performance of checks on payments under shared management, namely agricultural expenditure and structural measures, but it has also found that the Commission has failed to lead by example in respect of EU expenditure managed directly by it, that is to say internal and external policies. Thus, in the field of research, for instance, the Commission considerably reduced its checks on expenditure claims in 2005 despite the continuing high levels of error and the inherent risk in this type of expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission argues that the errors found and reported by the Court are of little import since the various multi-annual correction mechanisms detect and correct errors and irregularities when the programmes are finalised.</p>
      <p sl="de">The audit work of the Court shows that in practice these corrections are insufficient and that they are not directed towards the final beneficiaries in all areas. Furthermore, there are numerous shortcomings in recovery procedures. In the areas of shared management with Member States, for example, the Court’s findings were as follows. As regards agricultural spending, the financial clearance procedures are much delayed – the last fully cleared financial year was 1998 – and, due to failures in the system, the conformity decisions imposed fines only on the authorities of Member States. Since, in most cases, excess amounts paid to the final beneficiaries are not recovered, the burden is borne by the national taxpayer rather than by those final beneficiaries who overclaim.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards structural measures, the 1994-1999 programmes have still not been completely closed and the Court finds that a number of the programmes that have been closed still exhibit substantial error levels. Moreover, the Commission closed a number of programmes without making financial corrections despite there being significant reservations in respect of the certified expenditure. This clearly highlights the risk that errors in intermediate payment claims may not be corrected in practice.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to emphasise the fact that the Court, clearly, welcomes recoveries to the benefit of the EU budget. However, it must be pointed out that flat-rate financial corrections are made for weaknesses in the control systems of the Member States. As a consequence of this, these corrections do not, as a rule, lead to rectification of the errors of legality and regularity in the underlying transactions at the level of the final beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the Court’s opinion, there are a number of measures that should be taken to address these shortcomings. There needs to be a logical chain of effective internal controls based on unambiguous and appropriate rules and on common principles and standards, taking into account risk assessment of the nature of transactions and types of management. Effective recovery and sanction systems should likewise be applied in all areas of the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">For its part, the Court of Auditors is keen to explore more intensively areas of common interest with the national audit institutions. For the meeting of the Contact Committee of the Heads of the Supreme Audit Institutions in Warsaw next month, the Court has suggested extending current levels of cooperation to cover assessment of internal control systems in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union is facing renewed challenges in the shape of the rules of operation, the completion and closure of the current structural funds spending programmes and the opening of the 2007-2013 programmes, as well as the imminent accession of two new Member States. Allow me to conclude by setting out how EU financial management should approach these challenges.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission, together with the authorities in the Member States, must ensure that there are efficient and reliable internal control systems across all levels of EU administration; that these systems, in turn, include sufficient checks which are properly carried out, reported and followed up; and that the systems in question are based on simplified regulations governing EU expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should all be aiming for a European Union which has its budget under effective control for the benefit of its citizens. Thank you for your kind attention.</p>

    <intervention id="2-014" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="et">Madam President, Mr Weber, ladies and gentlemen, I presented my initial position concerning the annual report to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 23 October. The committee is presently actively taking follow-up action and correcting the errors that have been identified. On the day after the Court of Auditors’ Report was published, the committee sent a letter to the Member States, in which it asked them to present comments and clarifications concerning errors identified in the countries concerned, and eliminate those errors.</p>
      <p sl="et">Thus we will take the conclusions of the Committee on Budgetary Control into consideration fully and promptly. Like you, however, the committee has also contemplated the political significance of the report after its publication. It is clear that the above-mentioned report is not yet a general positive statement of assurance.</p>
      <p sl="et">As Mr Weber, the President of the Court of Auditors, said, the Court submits a statement of assurance concerning the ‘legality and regularity’ of expenditures, obligations, pre-accession strategy expenditure, administrative expenditures and common agricultural policy expenditures that are part of the Integrated Administration and Control System. The Court of Auditors does not, however, present a positive statement of assurance concerning other areas, for instance research programmes and structural funds. The main reason for this is that the Court of Auditors has found too many errors in the sampling of transactions in these areas. As Mr Weber stated, the cause for these errors is ‘simple negligence or oversight, poor knowledge of the complex rules and presumably also fraud connected with the EU budget’.</p>
      <p sl="et">I think that the criticism in the area of research programmes that was presented as a result of last year’s control is, unfortunately, justified. The reduction of the number of auditors in this sensitive area by nearly half, and our recovery procedures should be more rapid and more forceful. It is true that we failed to notice many errors that the Court of Audits later detected.</p>
      <p sl="et">I believe that in both this and other areas, the poor knowledge of complex rules is the main cause of errors. Frankly, I think the Commission has done too little too slowly to simplify and clarify the rules and guidelines. We are addressing these questions in the Action Plan and in proposals for the new programming period. We welcome the continued attention and advice from the Court on how to improve the situation.</p>
      <p sl="et">I would also like to look at the topic of fraud. How much fraud is there in the performance of the European Union budget? Any suspicions of fraud will be investigated thoroughly by OLAF, as witnessed by the two cases recently reported in the media in connection with the Chernobyl project and the Office for Infrastructure and Logistics in Brussels. Yet is the entire European Union budget ‘riddled with fraud’, as some journalists write year after year?</p>
      <p sl="et">Let me quote from the report on the management and auditing of EU funds published yesterday by the UK’s House of Lords. The report finds that ‘much of the coverage in the press suggests that there is a significant culture of corruption in Europe’s institutions. Our investigation has uncovered no evidence to support this suggestion’.</p>
      <p sl="et">Based on data from the Member States, the Commission possesses fraud estimates concerning two areas in which spending is greatest – agriculture and regional aid. These estimates show that 13-15% of notified irregularities are cases of suspected fraud, corresponding to 0.05% of the expenditures of agricultural funds and structural and cohesion funds. Last year the Commission wrote off EUR 90 million as irrecoverable financial losses, representing some 0.09% of the budget. Thus the rate of fraud is marginal. That does not, of course, mean that we should not seriously combat each specific case.</p>
      <p sl="et">This also appears to be confirmed by the Court’s audit work in 2005. Of all the information, audits and about nine hundred sampled transactions the Court looked at in 2005, in only four cases did the Court have cause to suspect fraud or serious violation of the rules and regulations and inform the European anti-fraud office (OLAF). After analysis, however, OLAF was unable to confirm any of the fraud cases of which it had been informed. However, the Court traditionally has once again provided useful data that is useful to OLAF in its operational work.</p>
      <p sl="et">Mr Weber, Madam President, now that these comments on our weaknesses, the need for simplification and the level of fraud have been presented, I presume the discharge authority would also like to assess the impact of the errors on the ‘price-quality relationship’.</p>
      <p sl="et">The Court of Auditors’ report (page 138) reveals that the Court audited 95 projects funded from structural funds, and found significant errors in 60 of them. Does this mean that two thirds of structural funds has been lost or wasted? Does this mean that the objectives of these projects have not been achieved? It clearly does not. Some ground-breaking research may have been done without all the necessary paperwork, and conversely, one can find projects that were brilliantly executed in terms of the formal rules, and all the paperwork was done, but the objectives were not achieved.</p>
      <p sl="et">Unfortunately the report gives no information on the true impact of the Community funding. Thus one wonders what conclusions Parliament and the ordinary citizen in Member States can draw based on the Court's overview of the errors in structural policies.</p>
      <p sl="et">The Court often states that it is only a messenger, and that the Treaty obliges the Court to give a statement of assurance on the whole budget each year. It does this through its samples of transactions and other audits. It tests compliance with the rules. This work, the Court does professionally, within the limits of its human resources.</p>
      <p sl="et">Who, though, then evaluates the impact of these errors on the achievement of policy objectives? On what basis should Parliament make such evaluations? After all, together with Council, you are the budgetary authority and have the final word on future budget allocations. The Court’s report should offer you a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of budgets approved in the past.</p>
      <p sl="et">In this perspective, I think one should invite the Court to evaluate how significant an impact the errors have had. We know the Court has the expertise to do this. It does this kind of ’price-quality’ evaluation in special reports, which we highly appreciate. So why is such analysis absent from the annual report?</p>
      <p sl="et">For the Commission, sound financial management means reaching policy objectives in an efficient way and at a reasonable cost. It necessarily takes a multi-annual view of each aid programme, and ensures that the expenditure on control over the programme is in balance with the costs and benefits.</p>
      <p sl="et">The Commission is well aware that few university professors who apply for funding for research programmes are qualified accountants, and it knows that some will make mistakes in their applications for EU funding. Should the funding of research stop for this reason? Absolutely not. We reduce the scope for error, but live with what remains. In terms of choices, there is clearly something missing between a negative DAS and a positive discharge.</p>
      <p sl="et">The Treaty – Article 248.2 of the Treaty on the European Communities – requires the Court to assess the soundness of financial management. Could it not also assess whether, in a given year, the Commission has indeed taken the steps necessary to ensure value for money? This would not simplify the Commission’s task, but it would give us all a clearer point of view!</p>
      <p sl="et">You may think this sounds too radical. Perhaps it is, but the UK House of Lords goes even further in a very serious report published yesterday. The House says that ‘substantial improvements are needed to the methodology underpinning the Statement of Assurance’ and proposes, among other things: that the Court ‘should distinguish clearly between irregularity and fraud, publishing separate figures for the level of fraudulent transactions and administrative mistakes’; that ‘the Statement of Assurance should focus on giving a detailed summary of financial management in each of the spending categories and Member States’ listing those Member States demonstrating poor management of European funds’. The Commission will carefully study this interesting report.</p>
      <p sl="et">Allow me also to touch on the issue of recoveries, or ‘clawbacks’. In this year’s DAS statement, the Court appears to cast doubt on the relevance of clawbacks for the DAS, arguing that recoveries do not right wrongs, nor do they dissuade the final beneficiary from making errors.</p>
      <p sl="et">This Commission thinks this does not fairly represent the actual situation. Every year, very significant amounts are clawed back by the Commission from Member States and by Member States from the final beneficiaries. This system contributes to the effective protection of the Union’s financial interests. It has a preventive effect, by giving Member States an incentive to improve their management and control systems, to prevent, detect and recover irregular payments to final beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="et">We – actually the Member States – should receive the credit for that, and it should affect the DAS declaration as well. I would like, Madam President, to continue on a more positive note. The Commission has established working relations with many national audit offices and found a positive attitude towards auditing EU funds in shared management. I am very encouraged by the announcement made by President Weber that the Court is intending to propose joint audits with these national audit offices, starting with the areas of Structural Funds and financial corrections performed in Member States.</p>
      <p sl="et">Indeed, we could much more effectively convince Member States to take more responsibility for spending from EU budget, if the Court were willing to work with – and eventually use – the results of audits produced at the national level.</p>
      <p sl="et">I would like to end with a comment on some of the good news in the Court’s report. Its President, Mr Weber, has pointed out that ‘the Commission successfully implemented the new accounting system with notable rapidity, and it now offers additional key information that is significantly more complete than that provided through the previous cash-based system’. We are proud of this achievement.</p>
      <p sl="et">To sum up: the DAS is once again negative. The Commission regrets this. It will correct the errors made and take further actions to correct systemic weaknesses, as announced in the Action Plan for an Integrated Internal Control Framework. In acknowledging that there is still much work to be done, the Commission also notes that important progress is made every year and that the overall management of EU funds is sound. It is under control, but there is further scope for simplification of complex rules. Together with my colleagues, I look forward to the more detailed sectoral discussions in the discharge hearings ahead.</p>
      <p sl="et">Finally, the Commission would like to re-emphasise that there is a missing link between the list of errors reported by the Court and the discharge procedure. The Commission would welcome an audit approach which also looks at effectiveness or ‘value for money’. We believe this would assist the discharge authority in carrying out its important task.</p>
      <p sl="et">Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, President Weber, Commissioner, this year we are once again being presented with the report by the Court of Auditors on the management of the Community budget and, this year once again, the European Parliament will pay the greatest possible attention to it, since it represents the most credible and reliable reflection of the state of the European public accounts. As the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture, Mrs Fischer Boel, said yesterday, we are genuinely going to subject the Union’s finances to a proper health check.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do not intend to demand that the institutions take responsibilities that go beyond their particular competences. The Court of Auditors plays its role, often with little cooperation from the Member States and their national control institutions. I hope that Mr Weber will achieve in Warsaw what we have not been able to achieve over all these years.</p>
      <p sl="es">Despite its defects, the European Commission does an extraordinary job, an extremely difficult job, given its lack of resources and the huge quantity of work. We do not therefore want this report to become an object of controversy, but rather a genuine instrument for improving public accounts.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Council and the Member States also have their own responsibility, since, with the current institutional architecture, it is difficult to go any further with financial control of the budget and the execution of spending. Previous speakers have already said it: 80% is spent in the Member States but we do not even get the Finance Ministers in those Member States to declare the reliability of spending.</p>
      <p sl="es">There still remains much to be done, therefore. Amongst other things, I intend to use ‘value for money’ as a basis for the cost-benefit analysis. The guiding principle of our report will be good financial management. We shall attach great importance to management, both shared management and direct management and decentralised management, and to the recovery of funds.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, Madam President, we would like to see a new approach to the statement of assurance, but we shall talk about that over the coming months.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, those of us in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament too are, of course, unhappy about the fact that it is now getting on for many years in a row that the Court of Auditors has not been able wholeheartedly to approve the EU accounts and to give a positive statement of assurance as to their reliability. We should like to begin by, of course, emphasising this but, at the same time, also saying that, although there are many points of criticism, we are working in a balanced, progressive and proactive way with a view, of course, to solving the problems. It is not only a question of criticising. It is, first and foremost, about discovering what specific type of problems we are facing and how we can solve them.</p>
      <p sl="da">We think there is good reason to commend the Court of Auditors on its detailed report. We in the Socialist Group have on many occasions asked for further details. We have sought a higher degree of differentiation in relation to the various types of error. This has been provided, but the situation is still not good enough. We might have wished, for example, for more of a distinction to have been made between what is, factually speaking, fraud and what are, factually speaking, errors.</p>
      <p sl="da">Praise is due to the Commission for introducing a new accounting system: the integrated financial control system for agricultural expenditure. There are quite a few areas in which progress has been made, but there are, of course, also grounds for criticism, especially in relation to internal policies, where the Court of Auditors’ report shows that things have in fact deteriorated since last year. We shall, of course, use the discharge procedure to look more closely at these matters, to demand some answers and, presumably, also to look ahead and come up with some better proposed solutions. We in the Socialist Group earnestly call on Commissioner Kallas and the Court of Auditors to continue their cooperation with a view to solving these problems in the best way possible.</p>

    <intervention id="2-017" speaker_id="1965" name="Jan Mulder" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, this debate is one we have been having for many years, with a number of recurring themes. Yet again, there is no Statement of Assurance, much to the discontent of everyone who is well disposed towards European cooperation, and yet again, it is not entirely clear why this should be.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Every year, we ask the Court of Auditors for more detailed information and every year, we are faced with those typical phrases in the report, of which I should like to quote you a few: ‘The Court of Auditors has concluded that generally, where CAP spending is concerned, mistakes of material interest still occur’. With regard to the structural funds: ‘For both programme periods (1994-1999 and 2000-2006), the Court of Auditors has concluded that spending was not free from irregularities of material interest’. Indeed, we have been asking for high-risk and low-risk budget components for years. Is it not possible for the Court of Auditors to be a little more precise and, among other things, to specify what error percentages would be acceptable? This would allow us to measure any improvements that are made.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I get the impression that the Commission is becoming a little more assertive, and I see that as totally justified. It is not only a matter of bookkeeping, but also a matter of effectiveness. It is unfortunate for this Parliament that neither the President of the Court of Auditors, nor Commissioner Kallas have spoken one word about the new financial perspectives. This is new. We would ask that someone who carries political responsibility at a certain level would issue a statement of assurance annually. For Parliament, the question is essentially: How does the Commission intend to do this? It is unfortunate that the Commission has given no indication of this, and that the Court of Auditors, for that matter, has not mentioned it either. Since it forms part of the multi-annual budget, it is up to the Member States and the Commission to implement it.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Mr Weber, Commissioner Kallas, I am, above all, grateful to the Court of Auditors for the report, which I regard as a sound one. I also think that the standard of its editing is continuing to improve. The report has been written in clear language and, above all, has recourse to ‘naming and shaming’, something I appreciate enormously. We are facing a special discharge, because this is the first budget year for the whole of which, the enlarged Union has had 25 Member States, and that falls entirely within the current Commission’s remit.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In that sense, I have to say that I am a little surprised, even shocked, about the rather defensive speech Commissioner Kallas gave here today – shocked, because when he came into office, he was the very man who stated on this platform that, during his tenure, we would at last see a positive Statement of Assurance being issued. What do we see now, though? The Court of Auditors’ criticism of key components of the budget remains unchallenged, and Mr Kallas goes into the defence with a report, which I read last night, and which is actually worth reading, from the House of Lords. This is not, of course, the right way of going about things.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Having read the Court of Auditors’ report, I can tell Commissioner Kallas that it contains very specific elements. For example, the integrated management and control system for agriculture works perfectly for those Member States that apply it. Greece does not. This was already mentioned in last year’s report by the Court of Auditors and was an important component in Mr Mulder’s discharge last year. What have you done about this since then? What have you done to call Greece to account? According to the same report by the Court of Auditors, there are serious problems involving export refunds. In Denmark and the Netherlands, exporters can simply seal their lorries without customs officers having to be present. What have you done to counter this? These are, after all, specific questions, and there is no need to adopt a defensive stance.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have two specific questions for Mr Weber. The first question is: On 7 November, when you addressed the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, did you finally make it clear to the Ministers that it is vital for them to sign off their accounts? Secondly, will you entertain the request made by the House of Lords that a black list should finally be drawn up of Member States that do not manage European funds very well? I should like to have an answer to both those questions, Mr Weber.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Today, Parliament has the pleasure of discussing the enlightening report by the European Court of Auditors about the spending of European funds in 2005. Once again, the auditors are not impressed. There are still too many errors that are too substantial and too structural in the way in which European funds are spent. In that sense, this report is not very different from its eleven predecessors. What is different, though, is the reaction to the Court of Auditors' negative verdict.</p>
      <p sl="nl">European institutions, the Commission among them, would formerly indulge in regular sessions of mea culpa and promises of improvement. This time round, the Commission has mounted a full-on offensive, and the Court of Auditors is being accused of being overly critical and having produced an ambiguous report. They even claim that we must learn to live with some mistakes.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is a fact, however, that Europe is the proud owner of 200 000 virtual cows that receive subsidies even though they do not exist. It is a fact that major errors have once again been flagged in the areas of olive oil, the export subsidies and the structural funds. It is a fact that, as a result, funds do not end up where they are most needed. Also, it is a fact that, as a result, the European public is increasingly losing faith in the Union. A grown-up institution should be able to use criticism to its advantage. The European institutions are demonstrating that they, even at the age of 50, have not yet reached this level of maturity.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, all of us in this House are saying that the Court of Auditors has produced a good report – it is informative and clearer than it usually is. What does the report tell us? Well, it tells us that anomalies are continuing to occur just as much as before, and we have to ask ourselves whether we are to continue living with such anomalies. What we have here is, of course, an entirely unreasonable approach to the problems. What is needed is an examination of how and why things have got into this state and clear proposals from the Commission concerning what is to be done. Any examination of this nature would necessarily lead one to observe that most of what goes wrong has to do with the agricultural policy. There are, besides this, very many other reasons to change the agricultural policy, in fact to do away with it all together. If that happened, a very large proportion of the problems that we see in this context would simply disappear.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would nonetheless still like to remind the House that it bears a very great part of the blame for the EU losing its good reputation among the peoples of Europe. This House always votes to back everyone up but in practice never insists on responsibility. It was pathetic to see the leaders of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats standing here in Parliament, practically in tears, telling us that they felt compelled to postpone the granting of discharge to Parliament itself as a result of the scandal relating to the buildings here in Strasbourg. Despite the fact that I pointed out that discharge should not be granted to the Committee of the Regions, it was granted anyway. We cannot go on like this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Court of Auditors has confirmed there is no independent audit of any part of these accounts, including the treasury function, which sometimes sits on a pile of EUR 20 billion or more. I would like the Court to explain precisely how many years it has carried out a full and specific audit of the treasury function, and would also like confirmation as to how frequently, such as once annually, it might undertake such a task in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Court has also confirmed that EU funds are held in the individual Member States before being allocated for use there. The cash flow and interest-bearing consequences of that are important and hitherto unknown. Net contributors like the UK and Germany are at a disadvantage, because a large proportion of their funds are stored in recipient countries. The French, on the other hand, are always holding the funds of net contributors and routinely earning interest on the overnight money markets. How much money has been lost to British and German taxpayers through the use of this system?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as well as for the control of the Commission’s budget, this House is responsible for monitoring the budgets of what are termed the ‘other’ institutions, and if they are to be given a positive discharge, it must be clear that they have used European taxpayers’ money properly. It is at this point that we have a number of things to discuss.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we take our monitoring role seriously, we also have to audit those items of expenditure that we formerly disregarded, for example, the Council’s common foreign and security policy – and I regret that the Council is not present today to hear me say this, for it is in close cooperation with the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Brok, that I am, quite deliberately, making reference to this policy area today and making a demand for transparent cooperation on the part of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">There will be several issues in relation to the Committee of the Regions in which closer examination will be required; the ones I would give as examples are the failure to implement the internal auditor’s recommendations and the questionable use of the weighting, not to mention the wholly inadequate consideration of this topic by the committee itself.</p>
      <p sl="de">The buildings policies of the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and of the Court of Justice raise issues that also have to be addressed, and there are many other matters to be sorted out.</p>
      <p sl="de">OLAF, our anti-fraud office, has also exercised an effective monitoring role with respect to the institutions over recent years, and I wonder why it is that neither the Ombudsman nor the Data Protection Supervisor have as yet concluded an agreement with it. These bodies, too, will have to answer that question.</p>
      <p sl="de">I call on all the interested parties to answer the questions in a transparent manner, to play their part in enabling this House to get an all-round picture and to work together in devising ways of improving things. Only if this is done will we be able to give discharge for 2005.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the report by the European Court of Auditors, which, as in previous years, is the result of very thorough, high-quality work, states that the expenditure of the European budget has been carried out essentially with legality and regularity. I wish to emphasise the significance of this statement because once again this year, as in the past 12 years, the Court is unable to give an unqualified positive opinion.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The reason for this is that some 80% of the European Union’s budget is spent under the system of joint responsibility by the Member States, where the Court of Auditors has, in the course of its very thorough inspections, found fairly high levels of error that have a financial impact. This does not in any way mean that all expenditures of the Union’s budget are burdened with error, nor can these errors be interpreted as indications of fraud.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In its initial reaction, the European Commission objects to the methodology of the Court of Auditors, but continues to set as its goal a positive DAS by 2009. To this end, it has launched a process of reform, within the framework of which it has developed an integrated internal control system; the introduction of a goal-oriented budget management can also be counted as a significant step forward. Now that the Member States have recognised, at the behest of the European Parliament, that the declarations they are being asked to provide are necessary, we can look forward to a very successful Court of Auditors.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am tempted to ask you simply to read the speech I made last year. The comments from the President of the Court of Auditors sum it up very neatly. Overall, the situation has not substantially changed since last year. In fact, the Court’s press statement makes it abundantly clear that nothing has changed, with comments like ‘due to continue in high levels of error’ and the pièce de résistance, ‘errors with a financial impact are found too frequently for the Court to conclude that all is well’. The only real difference this year is that the Commission has been more strident in denying its responsibility for the mess. I must thank Commissioner Kallas for providing me with the rib-tickler of the year, when he said that the perception of fraud in the EU finances is ‘highly unfair’ and that the spending of money in the EU is under tight control. Yes, and Santa Claus really does come down the chimney!</p>
      <p sl="en">Blaming the nation states for most of the fraud is an easy way out. The Commission is supposed to enforce the rules and oversee spending. Therefore it must take the blame for all those invisible cows in Slovenia, a country that has only been a member for two years but has quickly learnt to play the system. Nothing has been learnt and the mistakes go on being repeated.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, as the Court of Auditors' report says, we have made progress in many areas. I would like to thank it for its report. But there is one area in which we have not made any progress: in pointing to Member States individually. We are a group of twenty-five and we cannot just give one mark for the whole of the class</p>
      <p sl="es">The 300 pages of its report contain references to Greece, but you have never said which Member States are mainly responsible for our not achieving the target or — if you do not just want to be hatchet men — which Member States are doing well or are greatly improving.</p>
      <p sl="es">Other institutions do it: the European Central Bank points to individual Member States by name. You are not an assembly of diplomats defending national interests. In your press communiqués, you must point out, amongst other things, which States are doing things well and which are not.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Finnish Presidency is not even represented here, but on the basis of the report by the House of Lords, a report for which we have great respect, I am going to ask, on behalf of the group that I coordinate, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for an initiative report to look into the Court of Auditors' methodology.</p>
      <p sl="es">I well remember how one of its members, the Belgian member, Mr Pinxten, took his post without giving up any of his economic or political responsibilities. In the end, when he was threatened with being brought before the courts, he had to leave by the back door. That shameful episode was not unfortunately the finest hour of the Court of which you are the worthy President.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to say one thing to Vice-President Kallas. In your speech to the Committee on Budgetary Control on the 23rd, you said that 2 100 million had been recovered. You criticised the auditor harshly — I do not know whether that is the best you could do — but I would like you to specify, if possible, which policies, programmes and Member States that 2 100 million recovered relates to.</p>

If we re-read the treaties, we will find that they state that the Commission – and nobody else – is responsible for the implementation of the European budget.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the Members of your House who have had some very friendly things to say about our report, in particular to Mr Staes, Mr Lundgren, Mr Pomés Ruiz and Mr Bösch.</p>
      <p sl="de">If I may come back to Vice-President Kallas, he has lamented the constant focus in the media on the subject of fraud. I can assure you that, together with the many of your Members who have spoken today – among them Mr Jørgensen, Mr Fazakas and Mr Titford – we are giving the Commission our wholehearted backing. It is not acceptable that the same old tune – ‘fraud, fraud, and more fraud’ – should be playing all the time; it is unjustified, it is damaging, and it is something we can do without. We do have rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me now return to the second aspect, that being the recommendation from the British House of Lords, on which Mr Kallas believes we should act. We have a system. Our report cannot confirm that fraud has been committed; that is for judges, rather than the Court of Auditors, to determine. We will, though, look carefully at the report from the House of Lords, which reached us only around yesterday lunchtime. I myself had a hand in an agreement we reached with the Commission, according to which, if we suspect that fraud is in play, the matter is passed on to OLAF. As I have already said, the procedures are subject to rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can wholeheartedly endorse what Mr Garriga Polledo said; collaboration with our sister authorities is vitally important, and we will take with us to Warsaw your best wishes, for which we are grateful.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Mulder asked why it is that the accounts have once more not been approved without qualification, and the answer to that is quite straightforward. It is that the transactions to which the accounts refer are still, to a large degree, not subject to appropriate risk management. Only as and when they are will it be possible to give a positive Statement of Assurance. Here, too, though, the incidence of errors would only result in the media once more putting the spotlight on fraud.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am much obliged to Mr Staes for pointing out that a positive Statement of Assurance would be one result of improvements in the internal auditing systems, and for citing a number of examples; I can do no other than endorse what he said. I expressed myself very forthrightly before Ecofin, and the British House of Lords has highlighted a number of problems, among them countersignature and the blacklist. We received their report yesterday and must first examine it very closely.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will respond to Mr Mote’s comments by saying our concern today is with the Statement of Assurance, although the great importance of the matters to which he alluded is not in doubt, and I am quite happy to continue with him the dialogue on which we have already embarked.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to thank all the Members for their remarks. This is just part of the process, and next week will see the start of more detailed hearings on the implementation of our budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to some of the remarks, I would like to say that the Commission is not pointing the finger at anyone. It is seeking to achieve an accurate picture enabling adequate, balanced evaluation of the implementation of the European budget. We are fully responsible for everything we do, and we are willing to bear that responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it would be unrealistic to expect, in response to an analysis of the implementation of the European budget the thrust of which is that the Commission is bad, for the Commission to say that it is not bad, but even worse. That would be inappropriate, although we fully recognise our weak points. Internal policy issues will be the most vulnerable area of our 2005 activities. During the three budgetary discharge processes in which I have been involved, I have seen real improvements and I know what can be done to improve the situation further. We will do our utmost to improve that situation, and are looking for comprehensive, adequate professional evaluation of the implementation of the EU budget in all its aspects, be this its achievements or weaknesses, errors or fraud, etc. It is our aim and desire to show everybody that although the machinery is huge and could be improved, things are not bad at all. Being familiar with the experiences of Member States in the sphere of public administration, and knowing what happens in different Member States and in other international organisations, I can state that things are indeed not bad at all. It is our desire for the general public, Members of Parliament and the Court of Auditors to also see this side of our activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning Mr Mulder’s question on the financial perspective and the idea of increased participation by Member States in this process – the question of national declarations – I welcome the change in stance. When we started discussing this issue, only one or two Member States shared the attitude that Member States could take more responsibility. That attitude is changing but, as I know from my limited experience in European affairs, this will obviously take time. We are pleased that the Member States have agreed to provide a summary of the declarations of paying agencies, which is a step forward, and we are working with the Member States to take things further.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the declaration itself, I fully share the opinion of the Court of Auditors that this will not solve everything per se. It is part of the much broader issue of systemic and structural control and audit, which should bring the expected results.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us therefore discuss every aspect and not omit anything from the scope of our discussions. Let us also discuss the question of methodology and our actions and weaknesses. Let us hold a comprehensive, professional and adequate discussion on this issue, and then we will all be happy.</p>

Sensationalist press articles then classify all these as ‘fraud’, which they are not.</p>
      <p sl="en">Further progress in eliminating such errors is needed. I would like to see a system where the annual statements of assurance had to be given to the Commission departments and each of the 25 national governments individually, rather than in one single statement for the whole EU.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Most of these mistakes are the result of ignorance of the applicable rules, ineligible expenses or attempted fraud on the part of end beneficiaries (farmers, local authorities or project managers).</p>
      <p sl="fr">Who is to blame for this? Firstly, the Commission, which, according to the Treaties, is directly responsible for the implementation of the European budget. It has to strengthen the quality of internal control, and procedures must be simplified to prevent non-compliance with eligibility criteria, the double charging of costs and the overstatement of costs. Lastly, the Member States must also assume their responsibilities, given that 76% of the funds are spent by national or local administrations. It is in my view of paramount importance that the Member States undertake to submit their annual statements on how the EU funds that they manage are spent.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges on which you are invited to give an opinion is a thorough-going, high-quality report. I wish to thank Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, together with Mr Bradbourn, the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Legal Affairs, for their support for the Commission's proposal on SESAR, a major European project.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Your report, Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, coincides with the Commission’s position, and we support most of your amendments. I shall not go into the details of the debate on all of the amendments that have been tabled, but limit myself instead to a few general remarks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, I note that Parliament and the Commission take the same view of the strategic importance of major technological and industrial programmes like SESAR and GALILEO. SESAR is a vital programme for the competitiveness of the European aviation industry. It forms part of the Community’s technological innovation programme, which lies at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a sector as crucial for the European economy as this one, it is vital that public bodies and the private sector pool their resources to build together what will become the most efficient, most reliable and safest air traffic control infrastructure in the world. This public-private partnership requires a clear division of roles, together with transparent procedures, so that potential conflicts of interest can be pre-empted. The Commission therefore welcomes the amendments tabled by Parliament along these lines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards some of Parliament’s means of intervention, there is a matter of principle at stake. SESAR is a partnership between the public and private sectors, and the essential prerequisite for private sector participation is that the programme is managed as a business. Furthermore, and Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges highlighted this point very well in her report, voting rights in the Administrative Board of the SESAR joint undertaking must be balanced and weighted in proportion to financial contribution, which is one of the sound principles of good management in any private business.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is accordingly difficult to accept Parliament’s amendment aimed at gaining representation for Parliament on the Administrative Board. As Parliament is the Community’s main budgetary control authority, it cannot perform its monitoring duties and, at the same time, sit even as a simple observer on a Board that it is charged with monitoring.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On a similar theme, the industry is keen for the choice of executive director to be based on objective criteria of experience and technical knowledge, rather than on political criteria. It is important to acknowledge that the SESAR joint undertaking is an instrument for managing a technological research and development programme and has no regulatory-type role.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, it would make no sense for Parliament to be directly involved in the process of selecting an executive director of the SESAR joint undertaking. The Commission does support, however, all amendments aimed at ensuring that Parliament be kept properly and continuously informed about the SESAR programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I am delighted with Parliament’s work. I am convinced that a few differences of opinion will not hamper our joint efforts to make this programme a success for the EU. I should like to add that the whole of our environmental policy will receive a further boost, insofar as SESAR means aircraft being able to take off on time and not needing to be stacked, with the result that energy will be saved and needless carbon emissions prevented. This is why, from all points of view – passenger safety, energy saving and environmental quality – SESAR is an absolutely vital project.</p>

    <intervention id="2-040" speaker_id="29019" name="Erna Hennicot-Schoepges" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are today examining a report aimed at establishing a joint undertaking to develop the new generation European air traffic management system (SESAR).</p>
      <p sl="fr">As the technical arm of the single European sky, SESAR is tasked with adapting air traffic control to new technologies, ensuring the safety and regulation of flights, organising air navigation services and defining the respective roles and responsibilities of surveillance authorities and service providers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you said, Commissioner, the project is, on various levels, of paramount importance to the future of European civil aviation. It is also one of the joint infrastructure projects identified by the 1994 European Council. We have already lost a good deal of time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">SESAR will be indispensable, given the fact that air transport, which contributes some EUR 220 billion to the European GDP and employs 3.1 million people, is set to more than double in the next 20 years. Given that, because of its old age, the reliability of the control equipment, whose technology dates back to the 1970s in some cases, can no longer be guaranteed, SESAR will have a major impact on safety.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The same goes for the environment. Once the project is up and running, it will be possible to make appreciable savings on fuel, due, on the one hand, to the optimisation of trajectories and better use of air space and, on the other, to a reduction in stacking. The Commission estimates that greenhouse gas will be reduced by 4% to 6% per flight. Passengers will also see their waiting times at airports reduced as a result.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is proposing the establishment of a joint undertaking. It is to get off the ground quickly, even before the end of the definition phase, which runs from 2005 to 2007, and is to receive some EUR 60 million in cofinancing from the Community budget and Eurocontrol. Between 2008 and 2013, the joint undertaking will take charge of the development phase with a budget of EUR 300 million per year divided between three partners – the Commission, Eurocontrol and a consortium of private businesses. Then comes the deployment phase, which will be taken charge of by the industry and which is predicted to last from 2014 to 2020.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This first public-private partnership in the field of civil aviation will bring numerous job opportunities. It will also be a major research and development project that may extend into markets outside the Union, provided this does not delay its entry into force. The enhanced cooperation procedure between our two parliamentary committees reflects the relevance of this project to two areas, namely research and transport networks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission based its project on Article 171, meaning that Parliament was not involved in codecision. I should like to mention, however, the positive spirit of collaboration with the Commission and to say that Parliament will keep a close eye on events and that it will do all it can to help even if it is not represented on the Administrative Board.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The amendments that we have introduced clarify the text as regards potential conflicts of interest. We also asked the Commission to produce a new document dealing solely with the third phase in order to dispel a significant proportion of the doubts raised by the first project.</p>
      <p sl="fr">SESAR is a project that will serve the citizens’ interests, that will place the European civil aviation industry at the cutting edge of progress and that will enhance our competitiveness. The industry’s interest in the project justifies its financial involvement, and the distribution of voting rights will have to prevent any cumbersome administrative procedures. Parliament believes it has done the right thing in keeping open the possibility of creating a levy given that the industry’s contribution, supported by figures, has yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All that remains, Commissioner, is to express the hope that SESAR suffers neither the delays that affected Galileo, nor the debacle that beset Airbus, and that it shows that European research, Eurocontrol's know-how and the capacities of the industries concerned can come together in the interests of progress. Finally, it goes without saying, Commissioner, that the Member States will have to be prepared to organise the distribution of air traffic control on the basis of technological development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I should like to thank all those who contributed and, primarily, Mr Bradbourn, my co-rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the SESAR project is one which will greatly benefit not just Europe's aviation sectors, but the consumer as well. When SESAR is launched, airline efficiency will be improved, with more direct routing, less congestion in the skies and greater reliability for passengers. The environment will also benefit from the system, because it will shorten routes and reduce stacking and thus reduce the CO2 emissions caused by aviation.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it strikes me that, with such an important project, it is unacceptable, given that the original single skies legislation was dealt with under codecision, for the implementation process only to be carried out under the consultation procedure. That surely raises the question as to why the Commission feels it can pick and choose about when to involve the only democratically elected EU institution in the development of such proposals. More worryingly, the Commission and Eurocontrol are attempting to accrue to themselves 60% of the voting rights on the Administrative Board.</p>
      <p sl="en">The SESAR project should be driven by industry, not by bureaucrats. We cannot expect industry to pay for the development of a project when it will have little control over its direction. That is why I and the co-rapporteur on the lead committee, on behalf of our group, have tabled an amendment to reduce voting rights, to give industry and the air navigation service providers the incentive to be involved from the outset.</p>
      <p sl="en">The SESAR project can help shape the future of European aviation. It can be a positive force for change if it is given the support of all players in the sectors on a fair and equal basis. I therefore call on the House to support our amendment to give this important project just the direction it needs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, over the coming years, we will see more traffic on land, on water, and – above all – in the air as well, and more traffic means new problems, and more of them. The increase in quantity must be managed, the associated health and environment issues must be satisfactorily addressed, and all that will cost a lot of money.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we need to deal with the issues I have just mentioned is above all intelligent solutions, new technologies and better logistics, and it is on these things that we actually ought to be concentrating today. Unfortunately, though, we have not got that far yet. A number of things are already in the pipeline, though, and one that springs to mind is Galileo. At present, though, we are still concentrating on preparatory matters such as: how the administrative organisation should be structured, what we should do about Eurocontrol, how to involve the private business sector in our project, and much else besides.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say a few things of an admonitory nature about public-private partnerships; it is right and proper that we should discuss these and focus on potential conflicts of interest, but we should be doing much more to get the business sector actually involved in our project. It has to be said, though, that previous experience with PPP models has scarcely ever been really successful. One exception I would point to – not least because we will be kicking off its successor in a few weeks’ time – is the Marco Polo programme, where we managed to come up with the right mix of incentives for the private sector and the public interest, and that is the sort of thing we should concentrate on this time – more so than we did before.</p>
      <p sl="de">Quite apart from all that, I want to say how very grateful I am to both rapporteurs for the work they have put in, and that I hope that we will, despite the question as to whether this House should exercise codecision or only be consulted on this issue, head for our goal with concentration and in unity. Perhaps we will manage to tighten up the timetables a bit. That would have a very, very beneficial effect.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her sterling work on the report on a common European air traffic management system, SESAR. I agree that there is a need to develop a new generation of European air traffic system so that we might guarantee safe and smoothly flowing air traffic in Europe over the next 20 years. The current air traffic control systems are outdated and governed unduly by specific local conditions. They are, therefore, not especially suited to a rapid, reliable and economically sustainable development of air traffic in Europe. Therefore, SESAR is basically a sound initiative, which will make the air traffic management system in Europe more efficient. SESAR will mean safer and more efficient transport than is offered under current air traffic control systems, and at a reasonable price.</p>
      <p sl="da">When, however, it comes to environmental considerations, the Commission proposal sheds insufficient light on the challenges posed by increasing air traffic over the next few years in Europe. SESAR must not merely guarantee the safe management of air traffic. The environmental advantages must also be present. I am therefore able to support the amendments emphasising that SESAR must lead to more energy-efficient air routes that require less fuel to be used and are kind to the environment.</p>
      <p sl="da">Another important consideration is that it be made clear what benefit the Member States are to gain from SESAR, that is to say in terms of property rights to the material and non-material assets created through the SESAR Joint Undertaking. At the moment, it is not clear what is to happen regarding the rights of ownership of the assets produced through the SESAR Joint Undertaking when the ownership of SESAR is at some point transferred to industry. It is therefore crucial for the knowledge and assets created through SESAR continuously to be accessible to the constituent members for the purposes of their own, non-commercial product development. We do not want to end up in a situation in which all the Member States have standardised their technology in a European air traffic management system while, at the same time, the rights to this technology are owned by a private undertaking.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would again thank Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges for her report and hope that, through our joint efforts, we can launch SESAR within the planned timescale.</p>

We need a new-generation air traffic management system for Europe to improve air transport safety and environmental performance. SESAR will deliver what the archaic and fragmented current air traffic control technologies are incapable of.</p>
      <p sl="de">The SESAR joint undertaking must be established now in such a way that we avoid unnecessary problems and delays further down the line. The approach of a public-private joint undertaking is still quite a new one and I hope that the Commission will be up-front and transparent on lessons learned from the Galileo joint undertaking. The SESAR joint undertaking needs to be reviewed periodically to make sure that the teething troubles experienced by Galileo are not repeated.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament, as well as the Council, should be kept informed and consulted on issues such as the accession of new members and the appointment of the executive director. It was strongly felt in committee that the appointment of the executive director must be made following an open competition and on criteria of competence and experience. In no way should it be a political appointment or a perk.</p>
      <p sl="de">The committee also stressed the ongoing importance of Eurocontrol. Its involvement is essential, given its experience and expertise.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, on the issue of where the joint undertaking should be located, I agree with the original Commission proposal that for practical reasons the seat should be in Brussels. Opening up the seat as a discussion point would unnecessarily waste time and could prolong the establishment phase of the joint undertaking. This is a point which will not be lost on those MEPs who deplore the waste of time, money and energy caused by the failure to locate Parliament permanently in Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if it is used properly and enters into effect as soon as possible, SESAR will be able to make an important contribution to reducing the gases that are detrimental to climate. It will be possible, by means of good cooperation with weather services and proper arrangement of flying altitudes and speeds, to reduce not only the numbers of aircraft circling over cities while waiting to land, but also the condensation trails that more recent research highlights more emphatically as causes of climate problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">Its efficient functioning is dependent on, among other things, the creation of regions of airspace that are well suited to helping to saving on fuel; it is unfortunate, though, that work on these is progressing very, very slowly, and this is an area in which Austria, like its northern and eastern neighbours, has work to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">The organisational form was a major topic of discussion in our committee, and I do not believe that Eurocontrol should under any circumstances be marginalised. There needs to be some central body to defend the public interest – which includes, and must in our view include, such things as climate protection – and Eurocontrol is probably better suited to doing that than the votes of industry alone, and industry’s participation in this area can be ensured by other means.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, air traffic above Europe is gradually beginning to come up against restrictions arising from the large concentration of airports and the need to cope with ever more aeroplanes taking off. Some of these problems have already been solved by means of the International Civil Aviation Organisation agreement and other legislation adopted at various levels. The issue of air traffic is solved mainly by means of an international convention on managing medium height air traffic above central Europe, which has yet to enter completely into force. The SESAR programme should pave the way for significant progress in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I should like to take this opportunity to raise two questions. The first concerns the funding of the projects. I feel that we should be very wary of using private capital, because this is one of the key projects in this area. It is important, in my view, that the lion’s share of the funding should not come from the private sector. Funding should, rather, come from Eurocontrol charges and from the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="cs">A second question which is certainly important and has long been left unresolved is the definition of the parts of the air fleet to which the new air traffic system will apply. The question of differentiating between aircraft and ultralights remains. There is a different classification in force in Europe to that in the United States. I should therefore recommend that the determining factor be defined in the charter of the joint undertaking as an aircraft standby weight of 600 kg. I believe that harmonising the definition in this way will be beneficial for future negotiations relating not only to air traffic but also to air transport as a whole. To conclude, I wish to say that my group firmly supports the SESAR project.</p>

The problems of air traffic, which is currently growing at a rate of approximately 5% annually, demand a solution that is quick, comprehensive and effective but at the same time caters for the long-term perspective. If the necessary steps are not taken immediately, Europe’s airspace will soon be in gridlock. It is therefore good that we are implementing the joint undertaking SESAR, which will serve aviation management and safe operation of European airports. I am pleased by the news that the measures will improve the punctuality of connections and air safety, as well as having a positive effect on the environment.</p>

Secondly, as you suggested, Commissioner, with a view to delivering efficient air traffic management and technology, without placing too great a burden on the taxpayer, private initiative, the industry, the operators and the scientific community should be guaranteed a role in the management model, and an absolutely central role should be given to the Commission and Eurocontrol, which are the partners with the biggest public responsibility in terms of financial contribution and participation in the vote.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Sornosa Martínez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury (COM(2006)0069 – C6-0064/2006 – 2006/0018(COD)) (A6-0287/2006).</p>

    <intervention id="2-055" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Sornosa Martínez, for her work on this proposal for what is a very important directive, forming part of the Community action to deal with mercury, the Community strategy on which was debated in this House only recently.</p>
      <p sl="de">This has to do with our common desire to prevent more mercury finding its way into the environment, and, in order that we may have no misconceptions about this, what we are talking about here is not just any old poison, but a particularly dangerous one, for mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to human health and the environment. The object of the directive we are debating today is to prevent new measuring devices containing mercury getting into circulation, and, if we were to succeed in that, we would prevent 30 tonnes of mercury – which adds up to a very considerable health hazard – getting into the environment.</p>
      <p sl="de">The proposed directive will prohibit outright the placing on the market of clinical thermometers containing mercury, the reason being that alternatives to them have been available for some time. It will also prevent the sale to the general public of all other measuring instruments containing mercury. These proposals were put together on the basis of a risk assessment and an extensive impact assessment devised for the mercury strategy, followed by consultations with the industry and with other interested parties.</p>
      <p sl="de">The proposed directive will not only ensure the protection of human health and of the environment, but also serve to maintain and strengthen the internal market, as harmonised rules for the marketing of measuring devices containing mercury apply throughout the Community.</p>
      <p sl="de">Members of your House have now tabled a number of amendments aimed at securing derogations. I agree with you that the marketing of antique measuring instruments should indeed continue to be permitted, ‘antique measuring instruments’ being those that are at least 50 years old, and, being in the main collectors’ items, they are, by reason of their value, handled with very great care, traded only in very limited numbers, and the risk of such items ending up in waste is minimal.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can also support a time-limited derogation for new barometers containing mercury and manufactured by a few small specialised enterprises. A transitional period of two years will enable these businesses to adapt their production arrangements to the new rules without a disproportionate risk being presented to the environment. While I regard two years as appropriate, I have to make it clear that there is no reason for mercury to be used in the devices produced by these manufacturers, for they are capable of producing the same results without it, and, under certain circumstances indeed, a better one. There is no argument to support the idea that newly-manufactured devices of this kind must contain mercury. It is not the case that new technology needs to be developed first; the alternatives have been in existence for some considerable time. These manufacturers must be expected to comply with the demands of European legislation, and I am going to be very strict about this; two years really should be enough time in which to adapt.</p>
      <p sl="de">The situation is actually rather different as regards the use of measuring instruments in the health sector. It has been proposed in your House that there should – subject to a review at a later date – be a derogation from these restrictions for devices for measuring blood pressure, and I do in fact believe that there should be one. Sphygmomanometers are, in any case, used only in certain medical applications, and are absolutely indispensable in certain medical situations in which measurements are required to be of the utmost exactitude. We have examined this question in very great depth. Members of the medical professions regard sphygmomanometers of this kind as indispensable, especially in certain life-threatening situations, and so we should wait until safe and equally reliable alternatives to these devices have been developed before extending the provisions to the health sector. It follows that we have not reached the end of this process; on the contrary, more work is needed in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">By way of conclusion, I should like to say that the negotiation process was characterised by close cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and so the Commission can therefore agree to all the compromise amendments proposed by your rapporteur, that is to say Amendments 12 to 18. I very much hope that we will be able to get this directive adopted at first reading.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in this House all agree that it is necessary to reduce the demand for mercury in the manufacture of products and to speed up its substitution. It would be appropriate to introduce Community level marketing restrictions on mercury-containing measuring and control equipment for consumer use and, with some exemptions, in the healthcare sector</p>
      <p sl="es">We must prevent considerable amounts of mercury entering the waste stream. In that way, we shall contribute to guaranteeing a high level of protection of the environment and human health, whilst preserving the internal market, as required by Article 95 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems and wildlife. Initially seen as a diffuse local problem, mercury pollution is now understood to be global, chronic and serious. As regards a potential blanket ban on the use of mercury in all devices, which is the aim of this proposal, it should be emphasised that the experts the Commission consulted came to the conclusion that hospitals need a high level of accuracy to treat life-threatening conditions such as hypertension, arrhythmia and pre-eclampsia. Mercury sphygmomanometers provide the appropriate level of accuracy and reliability to ensure patient safety. We are therefore currently proposing that these instruments be exempted from the ban until there are complete guarantees with regard to the functioning of possible alternative instruments.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also call on the Commission to adopt short-term measures to ensure that all products containing mercury currently circulating in society are collected separately and safely processed. Otherwise, this Directive will be less effective in practice.</p>
      <p sl="es">Its dumping in rubbish tips or its inappropriate disposal causes waste mercury to infiltrate waste water and to be dispersed into the environment. Mercury is therefore found in foodstuffs, posing a particular risk to the aquatic food chain, making consumers of fish and molluscs particularly vulnerable. You said it, Commissioner: 30 tonnes may remain inadequately treated in rubbish dumps.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, I would call upon the Commission to increase awareness within the population, through the organisation of information campaigns on the health risks resulting from exposure to mercury and the environmental problems it may cause, since I fear that the citizens are not sufficiently well-informed about its toxicity.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the amendments presented, like the majority of political groups, I hoped that there would be an agreement, as there has been with the Council and the Commission, with regard to barometers. The agreement we have reached relates to the exemption from the obligations laid down in this Directive for scientific instruments containing mercury, such as barometers over 50 years old intended for sale or marketing on the international antiques market.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the production of mercury for new traditional barometers, we proposed an agreement: that there should be a transitional period for manufacturers to allow them time to conform to the new rules. Unfortunately, not all of the political groups have agreed to this, although I believe that we will have a sufficient majority in this House to adopt it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I hope that Parliament will sign up to the agreement with the Council at first reading, so that it can be applied as soon as possible and so that, in this way, the industrial demand for mercury can be reduced, speeding up its substitution with other materials that are not harmful to human health and do not prejudice the conservation of the environment.</p>
      <p sl="es">In summary, Commissioner, I entirely agree with what you have said. I would like to thank the Commission for its work and for the possibility of reaching an agreement at first reading. Thanks, too, to the Council and to the political groups that have agreed with this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, may I first of all pay tribute to the work that Mrs Sornosa Martínez has done on this report, even though I do not agree with all of her conclusions. Nevertheless, we have worked very well together on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">In March this year the House debated the Commission’s mercury strategy. It asked the Commission to restrict the marketing and use of mercury in all measuring and control equipment but to allow for some exemptions. It also called on the Commission to permit the use of mercury by the small number of professional companies in the EU that produce traditional barometers. Nevertheless, I am sorry to say that the Commission completely ignored Parliament’s wishes at that stage and went on to propose the directive that we are debating today.</p>
      <p sl="de">This directive will ban the production of all new barometers. As Members will be aware, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety subsequently adopted an amendment, which I tabled, introducing an exemption for this long-established traditional European art. Along with Mr Blokland, we have retabled that amendment for plenary to consider. I would point out to the Commissioner that we are not talking about the general introduction of new mercury into the environment – the vast majority of these makers actually use recycled mercury taken out of the environment in the production of these new instruments. There are a very small number of SMEs throughout Europe that continue this traditional art, mainly in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Portugal and the UK.</p>
      <p sl="de">If this directive is implemented as the Council wishes, those businesses would almost certainly be forced to close, thus eliminating places where consumers can take their existing instruments for repair and for maintenance. Let us not forget that there are hundreds of thousands of traditional barometers hanging on people’s walls all over Europe. This directive would of course not affect that, but it could potentially remove places where people could get those instruments repaired and maintained.</p>
      <p sl="de">The banning of new barometers will not stop pollution; in fact it could become more prevalent as the general public would have nowhere to take their instruments. There are also some enormous loopholes in the legislation. It is only the marketing of new devices that is prohibited. There is nothing to stop manufacturers from selling new barometers without any mercury, along with a set of instructions on how consumers can fill them themselves. That is surely more hazardous than allowing them to continue production in carefully controlled and licensed circumstances.</p>

The Tory Party website says that you are going to do that. You have to vote to change things and not just say you are going to do so.

I also want to note the very helpful assistance of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, as well as that of the Commission and the Council in formulating a small number of necessary final compromise amendments.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mercury, as you will all know by now, is a highly toxic substance that we all want and need to get rid of from our lives and the lives of generations to come, as soon as and as effectively as possible. The legislative proposal will begin to put into effect the mercury strategy that we endorsed in March this year and will ban or substantially reduce the presence of mercury in various non-electrical and non-electronic devices. Instruments containing mercury such as the household thermometer will be replaced by more accurate and versatile, quicker and safer measuring devices that do not contain mercury.</p>
      <p sl="de">As with most pieces of legislation, some differences of opinion were encountered in the examination of this proposal. Thankfully, a sensible compromise agreement was reached by most groups, but there are certainly still objections from some MEPs. The problem has been the insistence, mainly by a few English, Dutch and Belgian colleagues, that modern antique-looking barometers manufactured by a very small number of SMEs in England, Holland and Belgium should still be allowed to contain mercury. This is despite the fact that a two-year transitional derogation period has been allowed after the entry into force of the directive; despite the fact that, at the end of the two-year derogation period, the Commission is to review the availability of reliable safer alternatives that are technically and economically feasible for use in such instruments; despite the fact that barometers that are genuine antiques, i.e. more than 50 years old, would be exempt from this directive; and despite the fact that, if the compromise agreement in respect of barometers falls through, the whole legislative proposal effectively falls and has to go back to the drawing board.</p>
      <p sl="de">Do not allow yourselves inadvertently to be used by those who might want to kill the legislation as a whole and those who might want to use the issue of barometers to promote their Eurosceptic views. Please vote in favour of the compromise amendments and help get rid of toxic mercury, for health’s sake.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, mercury thermometers have been banned in Sweden for more than 20 years now. At long last it is time for the EU to follow suit. Mercury measuring instruments are the technology of yesteryear. Mercury is a gravely hazardous chemical that we must stop using as soon as possible. Any claim that mercury is not dangerous is absurd. Even worse is mercury that leaks, finds its way into combustion plants or in some other way is disseminated and converted in the environment into readily absorbable forms that are yet more harmful to people and animals. We cannot, for reasons of nostalgia, continue to produce barometers that are environmental hazards. Anyone who wants to can buy an electronic replica that looks exactly like an old-fashioned barometer. Alternatively, they can buy a second-hand one, as the directive is about the release onto the market of new barometers.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the compromise, barometers have been given a two-year reprieve, which is completely unnecessary from a technical point of view, as the Commissioner said, but was unfortunately necessary from a political point of view in order to make it possible to reach a compromise in the light of far too much readiness to be persuaded by industry lobbying. Anyone voting in favour of anything other than the compromise will be sabotaging this entire piece of legislation and will be preventing any phasing out of mercury thermometers at all. We would then have to start again from the beginning within the REACH framework. The Commission is due to put forward proposals within the next two years for the phasing out, if possible, of other measuring equipment, in particular blood pressure gauges. I would like to remind the Commission that the compromise states: as soon as reliable alternatives are available. This is the case for blood pressure gauges in many instances. Go straight home to Brussels and compile a report on restricting the marketing of blood pressure gauges as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I too should like to take my turn, having thanked and congratulated Mrs Sornosa Martínez on her work, to urge you to support the compromise amendments designed to remove mercury from measuring devices used by European consumers. The compromise amendments are the minimum and most realistic approach for protecting consumers and reflect the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="el">As regards the proposed exemption from the directive for barometers, I call on you to reject it. Any such exemption jeopardises the final opportunity to limit mercury in measuring devices for which there are alternative solutions before the legislation is adopted for the REACH programme. This specific action is of paramount importance in order for the legislation on measuring devices containing mercury to be adopted as quickly as possible. At the same time, I should emphasise that, if the amendments on barometers – with the exception of those in the package of amendments – are accepted, the barometer industry will not achieve anything substantial other than, perhaps, gaining one or two years. It is almost certain that the Commission, either through REACH or through comitology, will revert to its initial position, which makes no provision for barometers to be exempted.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I should like to emphasise that the package of compromise amendments follows our previous cohesive resolution on mercury for which Mr Marios Matsakis acted as rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, although mercury and the compounds produced by it, in particular methyl mercury, are highly toxic, banning the sale of mercury thermometers, including specialised thermometers and other measuring devices with just an eighteen-month transition period is excessive and unreasonable, particularly for Poland and other countries where mercury thermometers are universally used not only in hospitals but for basic home diagnosis. Such a short transition period may have negative effects by compromising diagnosis, with the attendant health risks, and may impose additional financial strains on hospitals and household budgets, especially those of the less well off.</p>

      <p sl="sk">We all have to agree that where a substitute for a measuring device containing mercury exists, such a device must be removed from the environment. There is enough mercury in a single thermometer to contaminate fish in a twenty-hectare lake. However, it is also necessary to realise that there are other devices used in the healthcare sector that contain mercury but that as yet have no equivalent substitute – for example, pressure gauges, barometers and manometers.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Mercury sphygmomanometers used in the treatment of high blood pressure or arrhythmia do not have an equivalent substitute capable of equal accuracy, and alternative methods would be extremely expensive. Therefore, I support the rapporteur’s opinion that the directive should not apply to such healthcare-sector instruments, because while we might be decreasing mercury in the environment we would also be jeopardising patients’ lives.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The priority we must focus on in this legislative proposal is to reduce the amount of mercury in household waste. It will be probably difficult, particularly in the new Member States, to ask all households to replace the thermometers they use for measuring body temperature; however, we should be able to limit their use.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is high time we acknowledged that mercury can and indeed does cause serious health problems. Mercury poisoning through the ingestion of mercury-contaminated food – usually fish – is the main source of contamination in the general public.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mercury and its compounds are not only toxic for humans: they also have very negative effects on wildlife and ecosystems. Therefore, the restriction of the use of mercury is highly desirable.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I acknowledge the need to be realistic in the restriction of certain measuring devices containing mercury. Therefore, I welcome the fact that some medical devices are being excluded for the time being from the scope of the directive. Medical experts have indicated that in certain cases non-mercury devices may not be fully accurate, for example, for some cardiac conditions and in cases of pre-eclampsia. It is therefore preferable to continue to use mercury devices in these limited situations until suitable alternatives are fully examined and endorsed by the medical professions, but with a time-limited review clause for suitable alternatives appropriately validated. Given the toxicity of mercury, that is a reasonable demand to make on the industry, and I invite the industry to respond.</p>
      <p sl="en">I support the amendment originally tabled by my colleagues, which allows for a derogation for antique barometers and scientific instruments intended for sale or trade on the international antiques market and for the production and servicing of traditional barometers using small amounts of mercury in controlled and licensed environments. It is worth noting that traditional barometer-makers do not introduce new quantities of mercury into the marketplace but recycle existing mercury and, in this way, help to control and limit the substance – not to mention the fact that antique barometers are usually highly valued items and so even more unlikely to end up in our waste streams. Remember that the purpose of this directive is to ban the marketing of mercury-containing devices. It will allow the sale of a barometer with a separate phial of mercury to be added later by the consumer if we do not have a derogation for these antique barometers – a far less hazardous option in my view.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, first of all, I too should like to express my support to Mrs Sornosa who has written an excellent report. As all speakers have said before me, given that mercury is very toxic, we must ban its use in all unnecessary applications. Given that alternatives are available, it is to be welcomed that the mercury thermometer, for example, is consigned to the past. Barometers are the subject of much debate, as we witnessed a moment ago.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the Netherlands, the use of mercury has been banned since 2003, but barometers were exempt until 2005 and then, pending fresh European rules, until 1 January 2006. This House is now arguing in favour of another two years’ delay for traditional barometers, which is incredibly lenient of it. Whilst I can, of course, imagine that this is hard news for producers of barometers to take, if we want to banish mercury altogether, we must in any event ban consumer products that contain it. Products may break or leak, so that mercury ends up in the environment anyway. I hope we can finalise this legislation so that the mercury ban can be introduced as soon as possible.</p>

The environmental and health threat posed is, I would suggest, so miniscule as to be out of all proportion to the devastating ban which this directive would impose on future production of barometers. It would kill off an historic skill in return for no meaningful gain. Thus I strongly support Amendment 19 to exempt barometer manufacturers from the ambit of this directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Seeking to include barometers epitomises in a way the fanatical and irrational dogma that all too often drives and brings ridicule to otherwise sensible Commission proposals. I trust that in the name of common sense we will say no to the ban on the production of barometers.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-070" speaker_id="729" name="John Purvis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, what I was trying to tell you before was that Mr Allister’s speech was coming through in a foreign language on the English channel, so the English was being translated into something else, I do not know what. I am sorry Mr Allister, but we could not make out what you were saying!</p>
      <p sl="en">European mortgage loans outstanding amount to some EUR 5 trillion, or 45% of the EU’s GDP, and mortgage lending has grown by 9.4% per annum over the past five years. A home is usually the largest purchase made in a lifetime, and the related mortgage is the most important financial obligation most people ever have. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Commission has focused on this area as it shifts its attention to retail financial services.</p>
      <p sl="en">The mortgage market is fragmented along national lines and opening up this market should lead to consumers being offered better value and a greater choice of mortgage products. There could be more opportunities for those people who currently find it difficult to get a mortgage, such as first-time buyers or people with fixed-term contracts. It should make it easier for people moving to another EU country for work or retirement or wanting to buy a second property abroad.</p>
      <p sl="en">For lenders, a more integrated market would offer greater economies of scale, reduce costs and lower rates for the borrower. On the other hand, local culture and traditions have shaped the products available and consumers will not want any diminution of existing consumer protection standards. Full harmonisation would be expensive for the industry and could limit the range of products it offers. The industry is highly competitive within most of our Member States, so we must not take heavy-handed action that might damage this booming sector. We want to see a European mortgage credit market with a broad range of products at competitive prices and any changes must benefit mortgage borrowers above all.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are therefore against a grand harmonising piece of legislation. It would be bad for consumers and bad for business. Instead, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agrees that we should focus on targeted measures aimed at removing specific barriers to cross-border mortgages. Any measures should only be taken after impact assessments have shown that the benefits outweigh the costs. Non-legislative means are to be preferred wherever possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our first priority should be to bring about a better European funding market. There are a number of obstacles preventing this. I would therefore like to see a database covering the various mortgage markets and mortgage securities, so that investors can better evaluate and price mortgage pools. We suggest a range of standardised packages of European mortgages for trading on the capital markets. Mortgage brokers could play an important role in helping borrowers access mortgage credit from domestic and non-domestic lenders. I am pleased that the Commission has undertaken to assess any problems related to those credit intermediaries.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of the annual percentage rate of charge, we need an EU standard. The majority in the committee wanted an EU standard comprising all the charges levied by the lender, but with information as far as possible regarding any other costs. The report considers that restrictions on early repayment charges and interest rates are likely to restrict the development of new products, especially those for higher risk borrowers, as well as the development of the funding market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Among other issues we raised are removing obstacles to the transfer of loans across borders and assessing the potential of the Euro-mortgage. The law applicable to mortgage credit contracts should be addressed, with the revision of the 1980 Rome Convention. On credit databases, we want to see a consistent format and non-discriminatory cross-border access to both positive and negative credit data, always subject to privacy protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the area of forced sales, we support the idea of a scoreboard, comparing the length and costs of judicial processes in the various Member States. Various professional bodies should agree on common property valuation standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">On land registers, the report favours improving access to standardised information, as well as supporting further work on the European Land Information Service.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tax barriers remain a problem and need to be looked at, even if their resolution is dependent upon the Member States under subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Central Bank and the Commission have the important job of monitoring the potential risks of the massive and increasing levels of mortgage debt and their potential impact on capital markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">I much appreciate the support and input received from my colleagues on all sides of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The Commission seems to be set on much the same line as we propose. We look forward to the White Paper next year and we hope we will be able to continue the excellent cooperation we have enjoyed so far on this important subject.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, the White Paper on Financial Services Policy 2005-2010 sets out a roadmap for opening up Europe’s fragmented retail financial services markets. One of the core elements of this strategy is our ongoing initiative on mortgage credit.</p>
      <p sl="en">The challenges of integrating European mortgage markets should not be underestimated. Differences in product characteristics, distribution systems, consumer behaviour and many other economic, structural and indeed social factors all have a significant impact on the sector. We should not forget that for most European consumers, taking out a mortgage is perhaps the most significant financial decision in their lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given the economic and social significance of mortgage lending, the Commission has adopted an open and consultative approach. Deliberations began in 2003 with the establishment of a forum group on mortgage credit, and a Green Paper was published in July 2005. A cost-benefit study was published in August 2005 to provide insight into the potential benefits of initiatives in the field of mortgage credit.</p>
      <p sl="en">The public consultation that followed the publication of the Green Paper confirmed that the Commission was on the right track. At the same time, however, it identified areas where further analysis was required, for example on mortgage funding, before the Commission could decide on the appropriate policy responses.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your report comes at an important moment in our deliberations. The consultation phase is drawing to a close and we are fast approaching a time when the Commission must decide how to proceed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish to thank the rapporteurs for their hard work in preparing what I believe is a carefully thought-through and pragmatic report. I would like to focus on some aspects of the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to read that you also believe that there are benefits to be obtained from integration. This position is consistent with our own analysis and the feedback that we have received in the Green Paper consultation. As the responses to the Green Paper consultation illustrate, there is a lot of debate on what the right means to achieve these benefits are. You propose a pragmatic and nuanced approach calling for focused measures accompanied by comprehensive impact assessments. As you know, I have a strong personal commitment to better regulation with a full impact assessment identifying the problems and setting out objectives and options. We in the Commission will be looking at the full range of tools at our disposal, not just legislative ones, in finding the most appropriate policy response to each issue addressed in the Green Paper.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the fact that the report underlines the benefits from enhancing product diversity and asks the Commission to ensure that actions do not hamper innovation and competition. A wide range of products is currently available to borrowers in the European Union. However, in no single country can consumers have access to a complete range of products. In some markets, certain groups of borrowers – for example, the self-employed, or borrowers with low or incomplete credit profiles – find it difficult to obtain mortgages or are even excluded. Barriers also exist that limit mortgage lenders’ incentives to operate cross-border, thus preventing new and innovative products and processes from being introduced in other markets across Europe. In this respect I think our goals fully concur with those set out in the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mortgage credit covers many contexts and technical issues ranging from consumer protection, through mortgage funding, to property valuation and land registration, to name but a few of the issues to be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I look forward to continuing our very fruitful dialogue with Parliament on how best to address the policy challenges emerging from this in the interests of assisting the development of a genuine single market for mortgage credit that creates new opportunities for lenders and borrowers alike, and that ensures appropriate protection for what remains for the vast majority of Europeans the most important financial decision the make in their lives.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I believe that the Commission has taken the right approach in relation to mortgages, because, as the Commissioner has said, it is probably the most significant commitment European citizens make in their entire lives: the loan to buy their own homes.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must therefore bear in mind that we are moving towards a single market and, within that single market, it does not make much sense to have 27 different national legislations or 27 different mortgage systems.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, it is an issue that relates to the most essential elements of the legal system of each State. Results will not be achieved either easily or immediately; it will take some time.</p>
      <p sl="es">In any event, we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection wish to stress the importance of making progress in the legislative field. It is not of course possible to adopt complete European Union legislation on mortgages, but it is possible to make some progress, in the field of information, for example, maximum permitted rates, repayment of mortgages at a given time, so that, when a citizen moves from one European Union country to another, they do not find themselves in a legal framework completely different to the one they are used to.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mortgage credit market continues to be divided up along national lines. Why is this so? Is it because of difficulties with language, because of the different financial cultures, the legal framework, or is it because people have confidences in lenders with which they are familiar and which are on their doorstep? What the Commission is proposing to do is to examine the possibility of harmonising the legal framework in order to increase the volume of cross-border lending and borrowing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Such an inquiry is to be welcomed. Even more to be welcomed is the statement in the Green Paper to the effect that extensive studies are still regarded as necessary before proposals for regulations can be made, and the Green Paper’s own emphasis on the difficulty of the matter in hand.</p>
      <p sl="de">Legal differences in the Member States are not to be found in one area alone, although they certainly are present in mortgage law, but – as both Commissioner McCreevy and Mr Medina Ortega have just pointed out – they affect many aspects of the law, among them land registration, the practices of notaries, the law in relation to forced sales, the law of contract and the protection of consumers, all of which areas of the law are interconnected. In some of them, the European Union has no power to enact regulations, and harmonisation from the centre in one area could have seriously detrimental effects at the national level, doing, in fact, more harm than good.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is unreservedly to be welcomed, though, is further promotion of the refinancing markets, and so I want to say an unreserved ‘yes’ to this being investigated and analysed and to the efforts at achieving integration, albeit primarily through convergence. While I do not want to exclude the possibility of Europe-wide regulation, we do take a rather sceptical view of European legislation as a consequence of its capacity for destroying functioning markets. Extensive studies are, in any case, still needed. We also, perhaps, need to face up to the fact that this is where we reach the outer limit of what can be standardised in Europe through legislation at the European level. I do not think this House’s role as legislator is without its problematic aspects, since it, when the Commission itself says that more extensive investigations are needed, must, to some degree, stay its hand and should not be precipitate in calling for legislative initiatives – and, indeed, has not done that. I endorse the essence of the report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks to Mr Purvis for the work he has done. The Green Paper on mortgage credit that the Commission published in July 2005 triggered intensive debate on whether the EU’s legislators should initiate action, and, if so, in which areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">Attempting to enact regulations applicable across Europe as a whole would seem to run up against very considerable differences between legal systems, and, above all, between financial cultures, but buying real property is the biggest decision on matters of expenditure that many households will take, and so the mortgage credit required to fund that is of commensurate importance. Studies show that private customers still – despite the euro and the internal market – have recourse to a credit institution they trust, as a rule to the bank with which they have an account, and that does of course have something to do with the fact that, of all financial markets, that for mortgage credit is the most complex. The giving of mortgage credit is therefore still carried out on a largely national, or indeed local, basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of all mortgage credit, only 1% is taken out across borders, not least – or so one surmises – as a consequence of the market and tax barriers involved; further integration would represent an estimated net 1% gain for European mortgage markets – a not inconsiderable sum that would be achieved over no more than ten years. If, then, we want an internal market in mortgage credit, we will have to guarantee that new rules applicable to it will result in a measurable added value for private customers.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of the most important things from the consumer's point of view is the ability to compare the various credit offers before signing a contract, along with the option of early repayment of part of the loan and the conditions subject to which variable or fixed interest rates may be agreed. The ways in which various associated charges are calculated must also be both comparable and transparent.</p>
      <p sl="de">Any new rules must also improve the situation of borrowers with poor or incomplete credit ratings, above all by enabling them to afford mortgages. Persons in this category include workers on short-term contracts and younger workers in particular, and these potential borrowers should not be excluded from the mortgage market. Experience has shown that the voluntary code of conduct to which over 3 000 lenders signed up in 2003 has not, in fact, been complied with, and here too there is a need for the Commission to review the situation and take action.</p>
      <p sl="de">In any case, though, the further integration of the EU’s mortgage credit market would be beneficial not only to consumers but also to the economy.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to thank the rapporteur for a well drafted report and to emphasise the importance of the initiated discussion on a common European mortgage market. New needs in the mortgage sector are emerging due to the rapid integration of the EU labour and capital markets, and the development of the internal market. We think it is extremely important to duly assess the emerging challenges.</p>
      <p sl="lt">First of all, there is a need to reduce the costs related to capital increase by creating a common market for mortgage financing and offering attractive and safe investment products. Secondly, there is a need to create favourable conditions for transition from the mortgage market of one country to that of another country in view of the increasing mobility of the labour force. Thirdly, there is a need to suitably organise the network of brokerage consulting services in order to provide the population with better choices and better access to more flexible and modern mortgage products. Fourthly, it is very important to enhance market transparency, as well as competitiveness, by unifying the payment procedures for various mortgage products and disclosing all costs related to the purchase of mortgage products.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Acquisition of housing is one of the major and most significant life investments; therefore, the impact of all proposals must be thoroughly assessed and considered. Presently, mortgage crediting is mostly developed within domestic markets and is very fragmented, while development of a common mortgage market is considered to be a possibility for the banks to offer their mortgage products via their branches in other European Union countries. Therefore, the creation of a new mortgage market will be a serious and demanding challenge for all of us.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is at present difficult to speak of a common European financial market. The financial market is highly fragmented, which causes legal, fiscal and regulatory problems. The majority of mortgages on the market are financed by the savings of small savers. Less than 40% of mortgages are financed by the capital markets, whose share is growing slowly, although this growth is insubstantial.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In Sweden and Germany there are quite extensive markets in mortgage bonds. In Denmark, for example, mortgage institutions issue bonds to the entire value of the mortgage credit. While the market for mortgage credit-based bonds is strong in many EU countries, there are some countries where they do not exist at all.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Over the last decade or so this market has also advanced a great deal in Poland, and this has had a substantial effect on economic growth.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs on this report, in particular, Mrs Mastenbroek and Mrs Kudrycka, who have contributed to the final draft.</p>
      <p sl="it">Corruption represents a serious problem for the transparent management of public affairs: it undermines credibility, increases distrust of democratic institutions and jeopardises human rights and the rule of law, allowing organised crime to prosper. Corruption is an age-old problem of which there are many literary accounts: Cicero spoke of it as early as 70 BC. Unfortunately, the cancer of corruption has also gained a foothold in the workings of the European Institutions. It is worrying that the European Union Court of Auditors refuses to approve the Community budget because of serious doubts held over the proper use of funds, and it is equally embarrassing that the Belgian judiciary has opened legal proceedings against Commission employees for alleged payoffs for the acquisition of funds allocated for the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the same way, we see the problem of corruption in the use of the Structural Funds, as the funds are often managed for individual gain, or, as is the case in my region, the classifications are falsified, to the extent that the European Commission has had to impose fines of EUR 75 million. This is why we believe that problems of corruption are both subtle and dangerous. The fight against corruption must be a priority for the European Union, and, in our opinion, this Convention should also be signed by all the Member States of the European Union. In addition, we call on the Commission and the Council to take action so that, as well as this Convention being signed, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime is also signed. I believe that this represents a significant contribution towards the fight against organised crime, which is, unfortunately, still on the rise in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Mr President of the Republic of Georgia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you most warmly on behalf of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Three years ago, following parliamentary elections annulled by the regime of the time, the Rose Revolution took place in your country and history will associate your name with that revolution, Mr Saakashvili.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Led by yourself, your compatriots demanded fair elections and an end to the corruption and bad governance that was ruining your country.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Although the previous regime refused to accept your demands, it was brought down without a single drop of blood being shed. ‘People power' prevailed and the Georgian people were able to elect you en masse as the new President.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Mr President, the European Parliament has supported democratic change in your country. We sent a mission of observers to the elections and our Committee on Foreign Affairs had the pleasure of receiving you soon after your inauguration as President, not here in Strasbourg but at our site in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Rose Revolution reawakened hopes for real and free democracy in areas even further east of the Baltic, of Central and of Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">A year later, the Orange Revolution took place in Ukraine. At that time the future seemed full of promise, but we are now seeing that many problems and obstacles have arisen on a journey that is certainly no easy ride.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">You have achieved a great deal over the years that have passed since then, but the conflicts in the break-away regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia have become worse.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">It is clear that Russia is now putting great pressure on your country – I can tell you that your country was discussed at great length at the dinner with President Putin – and you now have a great opportunity, on addressing the European Parliament, to explain the situation so that the representatives of the peoples of Europe can hear directly from you about the difficult circumstances being experienced by your country and the problems relating to energy dependency on your great neighbour.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The European Parliament and the European Union as a whole fully support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of your country; there is absolutely no doubt about that. We have also said that the conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia must be resolved at the negotiating table, and by exclusively peaceful means. There can be no military solution to that problem either.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In a resolution that we approved last month here in Strasbourg, we called upon Russia to put an end to all acts of repression and harassment against people of Georgian origin living in Russia and to revoke any measures recently taken against your country, including the suspension of all transport links and postal services. Nevertheless, we would also call for restraint in any verbal comments from all sides that may raise the tension unnecessarily.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We believe that the Council and the Commission must find a way to help your country to overcome and compensate for the economic and social effects of the Russian measures against you.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Mr President, we would like to express the European Parliament’s support for the approval of the Action Plan on the European Neighbourhood Policy by the EU-Georgia Cooperation Council, which has taken place today in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We welcome you once again and I hope that your presence here will give us the opportunity, through dialogue, to overcome the problems faced by your country and which affect all of us.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">You have the floor, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="es">President of Georgia. Thank you very much for you words and your invitation, Mr President. They are very important to our country.</p>
      <p sl="es">Distinguished Members of Parliament, I wish to thank you for this kind invitation today. That we meet in Strasbourg is especially meaningful to me. It was here as a young student, coming fresh from the Soviet Union, that I first discovered Europe in all its diversity and richness. It was here that I first learned about human rights and the solemn obligation of the state to protect, rather than persecute. What a revelation! And it was here that I dared to dream that one day what I studied could be applied to my own country and that I could plant those seeds which only now have finally blossomed. At that time, it was a radical and maybe even rather a dangerous dream, but it is one that I have never forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="es">Strasbourg is also important for me for another reason. It is the place where I met my wife Sandra at a human rights course.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">I called my mother from the street phone in the Orangerie across from the Council of Europe building where I was on an internship at the time to tell her that I had met a beautiful Dutch girl. Well, they are now sitting next to each other up there in the gallery.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">I am very proud that our multinational family is represented here today with three generations, including my grandmother. I want to say thank you, therefore, and thank you to this city and its institutions for giving me both knowledge and love, two priceless assets that I will never part with.</p>
      <p sl="es">Let me begin my remarks with a few words in Georgian. We do not want to be part of a debate as to whether we are part of old or new Europe, because I believe we are the oldest Europe, so we are observing from the side.</p>
      <a text="(The President spoke Georgian. This is a translation)"/>
      <p sl="es">On behalf of my country, I wish to express my gratitude to all of you – to the European Union, and to you the parliamentarians of Europe in particular – for your existence and your activism.</p>
      <p sl="es">Europe has always been home to many diverse nations, small and large alike. Georgians have been Europeans since the time Prometheus was chained to our mountains and the Argonauts came to our country in search of the Golden Fleece. When debates take place about the identity of Europe, if Georgians are European we do not participate in them. We are an ancient European nation. Georgians are not only Europeans, but we are enthusiastic Europeans and Europe was always the first choice to turn to for help and moral support through all the troubled periods.</p>
      <p sl="es">That which brings us together is a common and unbreakable bond, one based on culture, on our shared history and on a common set of values that has at its heart the celebration of peace and the establishment of fair and prosperous societies. This is the substance of what is often called ‘the European project’. My nation is proud to be part of that just project and to contribute to its stability, strength and permanence. For in Georgia please know that you have a strong and reliable partner now and in the future, for ours is a common destiny.</p>
      <a text="(The President switched back to English)"/>
      <p sl="es">I just want to ask whether you have ever considered for a moment what the post-Soviet world would be like had there not been a European Union. At times like this, I am reminded of the vision and leadership that led to a united Europe, expressed so eloquently in 1950 by Robert Schuman. I wonder what Schuman would say today when presented with Europe’s map and its current challenges?</p>
      <p sl="es">From the rubble of war, you have created a beacon of justice, peace and prosperity. In that respect, your actions have provided the answer, as Schuman’s vision continues to endure.</p>
      <p sl="es">In particular, your readiness to welcome new members from the former Soviet region has significantly strengthened peace and democracy in Europe. The success of these new Member States encourages countries like mine to move forward, for we have benefited and will continue to benefit from their experience and expertise, and your vision and prudence.</p>
      <p sl="es">Perhaps the best way in which I can express that gratitude is to state that we wish to emulate you! But here let me be very clear: I do not want to alarm you by requesting outright that Georgia be admitted to the European Union. Membership is a distant goal, and it is not on our immediate agenda. Rather, it is the principles on which Europe is built that provide the cornerstones for our development. Here I see cause for optimism, based on enhancing our partnership. The Georgia we are creating is built squarely on the rule of law, human rights, democracy and peace. Our European path has been chosen by the Georgian people themselves. For them and for me, it is indeed the embodiment of our country’s enduring European identity. It is the only way forward.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am in Strasbourg at a symbolic moment, because we will soon be celebrating the third anniversary of our Rose Revolution.</p>
      <p sl="es">As many of you know, three years ago Georgia was basically a failed state. Imagine a country where daily survival was a mighty struggle for all but the privileged few, where insecurity reigned and disorder prevailed, and where the security of the country was subsumed in the interests of larger neighbours. Georgia was a country with rampant corruption and endemic injustice, and certainly there was no rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, three years on, Georgia has changed beyond recognition. We are reforming our institutions and economy to bring greater prosperity and stability to our people and our region. Had the changes of the last few years not been made, today we would be a totally failed state not only in our region but also in the European neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, however, I believe Georgia can rise to the challenge of being a model European neighbour and that is the message I should like to share with you this afternoon. I make this claim before you because for the past three years we have consistently pursued four straightforward goals: the restoration of democracy and rule of law, the eradication of corruption, the creation of revenue for our citizens and the protection of our territorial integrity.</p>
      <p sl="es">All, as you can imagine, are interrelated and all have as their first assumption the strengthening of institutions and public accountability. For this vision to succeed, in essence, the poetry of democracy must be supported by the prose of the rule of law. In substance, this means enacting reforms based on the understanding that justice should reign in the country. When I say justice, I mean it in the European sense: democracy must be served by an infrastructure of values and institutions that give protection and opportunity to every citizen. The rule of law must prevail in a transparent manner that is equal to all. This is, of course, easy to say but harder to do, and I welcome the European Union’s support in realising this vision.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today in Georgia we have completely reformed our police forces. As a result, Georgian drivers no longer worry about being arbitrarily stopped by traffic police demanding bribes. Georgian business owners do not fear random harassment. Three or four years ago a Gallup poll in Georgia showed that the rate of confidence in the police was less than 5%. Basically, the police force was the most hated institution in the country, but now, the rate of confidence is in the upper seventies. It is one of the most trusted institutions in the country and certainly more trusted than in any other countries in the post-Soviet region. This is a big change.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have made an irreversible commitment to reforming our judicial system and, through strong collaboration with European institutions, we created and are now funding a comprehensive multi-year programme.</p>
      <p sl="es">I wish to comment on some highlights. Today we are strengthening both the independence and professionalism of our judges and legal professionals, while at the same time reducing the powers of the President. With new constitutional changes, the President will no longer be able to appoint judges directly. I hope these changes will be adopted this December.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are reforming our legal education system and strengthening the protection of human rights by further educating our law enforcement officials. This is a matter of national interest. We are building new prisons that meet the standards of human rights monitors and streamlining legal procedures to ensure due process in due time. This is a matter of enforcing fundamental rights. We will continue to overhaul our system of justice, because without it our reforms will lack foundation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today I am pleased to state that our Parliament exercises an unprecedented level of oversight. As Head of the Executive, I can attest to the fact that budgets are scrutinised, oversight is vigorous and careful consideration is given to Parliament in the decisions of the Executive.</p>
      <p sl="es">Georgia also enjoys one of the most liberal environments for the free press and a vibrant NGO community. Our media freedom legislation is one of the most – if not the most – liberal. Unfortunately for politicians, under Georgian law the media cannot be sued under any circumstances. That is good, because it offers more opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="es">Perhaps one of my biggest regrets to date, however, is the fact that Georgia still does not have an opposition that is sufficiently robust to challenge the Government. I do not say this lightly. It is not a good thing, but nothing would be more dangerous to a fledgling democracy than to artificially manufacture an opposition. It is bad for an aspiring government not to have a strong opposition which will be more responsible and more competent and which will test the Government. I am sure that this kind of opposition will be created as society develops. Perhaps one day – but I hope not that soon – it will prevail in open and fair elections. We have certainly established a political and legal environment in which that can happen. Now it is up to opposition groups to take the next step.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our path of transformation began with a very simple idea: that every citizen must feel secure. To achieve that, corruption had to be stamped out and that was our major goal. In order to provide a social safety net, we have been aggressive and imaginative in our economic reforms. Georgia today is an attractive target for investment. For a country with relatively few natural resources, we are left to work with our own ingenuity and discipline. That is why we have established the lowest tax rates in Europe, some of the most flexible labour laws and some of the simplest trade, customs and regulatory procedures. Liberal reforms have proven to be the best tool to fight corruption, while guaranteeing the freedom of business and protection of property rights. It has also proven the best way to generate revenue, so that we can build more roads, schools and hospitals. Today, I am proud of the fact that two years ago not a single school in Georgia had access to the internet, but now 80% of our schools have computers and internet access, and next year the process will be finished. We are building new schools comparable to the best schools in the Netherlands, Germany or the Czech Republic. This year we built 340. That is a lot for a small country. More roads have been built this year alone than since independence in 1991. At its annual meeting in Singapore this year, the World Bank ranked Georgia the most successful reformed country in the world and one of the best places in the world to do business. In two years we have switched from being one of the worst to one of the best places in the world to do business.</p>
      <p sl="es">Georgian economic growth this year will be strong, since, according to the World Bank, we are also the top-performing country among transitional economies in Eurasia in fighting corruption. In fact, the EBRD ranks us among the three most non-corrupt nations in Europe. Maybe other figures will say more about our achievements.</p>
      <p sl="es">The year 2004, the first year after our Rose Revolution, was the first time since 1991 that we had a positive immigration and birth rate. Last year, in a country of just under five million people, almost 100 000 more Georgian citizens came back to Georgia than left. They were in fact voting with their feet. It is an amazing story. So I do not think Europe should be afraid to open up to these areas, because Georgians are not going to flee to Europe overnight – they are coming back.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">An amazing symbol of this is the main central hospital in Tbilisi. It stopped being a hospital and was occupied by internally displaced persons from the war in Abkhazia. Last year a large team of Georgian high-level professionals came from the United States, Spain, Germany and Russia. They re-established the hospital. We helped them and carried out repairs. We provided the IDPs with assistance to leave and now it is one of the best hospitals in the world. Some Europeans said that there is only one other hospital of its kind in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is the symbol: Georgians like Nina Gedevanovna Ananiashvili, who was a top ballet dancer at the Bolshoi, are coming back and trying to recreate our country. She left a very lucrative career with the Bolshoi to come back and recreate our ballet group from scratch. It is now a very powerful group, perhaps one of the best in our part of the world, and it will soon be touring worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our goal now is to focus on steady job creation. With my economic advisor Mr Marklar, former Prime Minister of Estonia, who was one of the architects of the Estonian economic miracle, we have established very successful on-the-job training programmes. Our reforms in that sector will only be complete when every Georgian feels that he or she has a real opportunity for employment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Georgia is a country of tremendous warmth, hospitality and beauty. In fact I was just showing President Borrell an album of Georgian sites. It is a country that European travellers have enjoyed in the past and are now rediscovering. We are, in fact, Europe’s best kept secret from that point of view.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to share with you a brief quote from the writings of Sir Oliver Wardrop, who in 1888 wrote a book entitled The Kingdom of Georgia. He wrote: ‘There is no reason why Georgia should not become a popular resort. It is not so far away as people think. It has the great advantage of being almost unknown to tourists, there is none of the impudent extortion which ruffles our tempers nearer home and it is, after all, cheaper than Scotland’. Please, those of you from Scotland, do not be angry with me. I am only quoting. But in fact it is true!</p>
      <a text="(Laughter)"/>
      <p sl="es">Reviewing the combined effect of our reforms, I believe it is fair to state that these steps have allowed us to move closer to Europe institutionally and culturally. You have provided the framework for further growth through the Neighbourhood Policy. Today we will be signing the Action Plan that translates many of our mutual priorities into detailed results. But in the spirit and the substance of that effort we must continue to build, for I want my country to work with Europe so that Europe knows it has an utterly reliable partner and friend in Georgia.</p>
      <p sl="es">For some, however, our strategy has proven an irritant, and it seems Georgia’s reform path means we are departing from former – and, in their eyes, still applicable – spheres of influence. I believe, as you rightly said in your landmark declarations two weeks ago on Georgia, that the time of ‘spheres of influence’ is over.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">I would like to thank you for that declaration and for the very appropriate and specific language it contained. Each nation must have the chance to freely decide how and with whom it wants to build their future. We base our strategy on being a secure and reliable partner, not a tame and weak satellite. We are a nation with a long history of independence. That independence was interrupted 200 years ago with the violent expansion of the Russian empire. For three brief years between 1918 and 1921 we enjoyed another moment of independence. That again was taken away from us. What were the circumstances?</p>
      <p sl="es">In 1921 the Bolshevik Army, claiming to protect a minority population in one of our regions, entered Georgia and reconquered it. During that period, more than 500 000 Georgians perished in the gulags, including several members of my own family. It was too expensive a price to pay and we are not willing to pay it again. We will not allow that history to be repeated, whatever it takes. After all, we are living in 2006, not 1938 or 1939, 1956 or 1968.</p>
      <p sl="es">At what point are small countries asked to sacrifice their aspirations for liberty? How often can we ask the smaller party to tone down its voice and resist reacting to provocation? Let us hope that we will never be asked to succumb and say that justice lies with size, numbers and power in this age, that might makes right and not vice versa. Let us hope that never again, when our or any other European nation is threatened, will the spectre of that famous reference by one statesman in the 1930s to ‘quarrels in a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing’ be seen as an adequate response.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thankfully, I hope that policy has been left permanently in the past. I hope one day that Georgians, as well as proud representatives of that then far-away country the Czech Republic, will be equals in the European family.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">Today, because we have chosen to move as close as possible to Europe and to align ourselves with Euro-Atlantic institutions, Georgia is punished. Because we are a democracy, the pressures we are under have only resulted in further consolidation of our society. People who exercise pressure do not understand: you do not pressurise democracies, because you get exactly the opposite result from that you want to achieve. That has become increasingly challenging because, as you know, Russia has closed its market to Georgian goods. Our prized Georgian wines and mineral water – major sources of revenue – are now banned from the Russian market. The situation has worsened in the last few months as Russia unilaterally introduced a complete ban on transport and postal links with Georgia. Just a few days ago Gazprom announced a non-commercial more than doubling of the price Georgia must pay for gas. Altogether, in plain language, the sum of those measures can be called an economic blockade.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do not wish to use this opportunity to further elevate tensions between Georgia and Russia, or to see this afternoon as a chance to create anti-Russian feeling in the heart of Europe. We have enough tensions and enough mudslinging. Such rhetoric would serve no constructive purpose. Rather, it is now time for diplomacy, discussion, the constructive identification of areas of mutual interest and mutual responsibility.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">On behalf of my Government and my people, I stand ready to pursue that approach, for it is the only path. Let these words once again stand as an open invitation to our colleagues and all interlocutors to return to the path of normality and harmony through dialogue. I believe that the leaders of both countries share the responsibility for making sure that, under our leadership, relations between the two countries do not deteriorate beyond repair. Let us move forward with haste and good intentions. Like all of you, the people of Georgia are not and never will be anti-Russian.</p>
      <p sl="es">Please permit me to make reference to another great European statesman, Konrad Adenuaer, who, in his memoirs had this to say about his situation then: ‘We were a small and very exposed country. By our own strength we could achieve nothing. We must not be a no-man’s land between East and West, for then we would have friends nowhere and a very dangerous neighbour in the East’.</p>
      <p sl="es">Geography is a little different today, but I could apply some of those words to my country as well. Chancellor Adenuaer’s words still resonate today. Our European aspiration is simply to be allowed to develop according to our own free choices, in harmony with all our neighbours, as many of you did decades ago. In that respect, I believe that current measures are temporary and that through patience and level-headedness, through dialogue and mutual respect, they will be lifted and our relations will and must normalise.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is a desire for which I have the full support of my people. However, if anything today gives me pause in our relations with Russia, it is the very issue that was raised so poignantly by the EU in Lahti and Luxembourg some weeks ago. Quite simply, it is the issue of justice.</p>
      <p sl="es">Here I would like to make reference to the great Russian author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose then forbidden books I read with great passion as a teenager. He said: ‘Justice is conscience, not a personal conscience but the conscience of the whole of humanity. Those who clearly recognise the voice of their own conscience usually recognise the voice of justice.’</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that your solidarity during this difficult period most clearly reflects the very same sense of justice. For when children with Georgian names are expelled from schools, all our children are at risk. When famous artists, writers, actors, sportsmen are hounded and silenced, we are all silenced. When thousands of citizens are forcibly deported from their homes, taken off the streets in handcuffs, we are all deported.</p>
      <p sl="es">I and the people of Georgia are grateful for your expression of support for our country. When we feared isolation, Europe raised the banner of our values. Indeed, this very Parliament has raised the voice of morality in Europe. We will never forget your solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is the awakening of fundamental values to which we all aspire. We see these values alive in Europe, in your statement.</p>
      <p sl="es">When I went to Lithuania after the Russian ban on Georgian wine, I saw young Lithuanian volunteers, including students from the Universities of Vilnius and Kaunas, going around supermarkets, together with their professors, telling shoppers to buy Georgian wine. They said that this was freedom wine, that Georgians were paying the price for freedom and needed immediate help, and that shoppers they should therefore buy that wine out of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Polish army has decreed that at officers’ receptions it will only serve Georgian wine, which is something we are very grateful for. We do not need arms from the Polish army, as this is a great help in itself.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the greatest expression of solidarity came from within Russia itself. In fact the most powerful voices we heard were from there. I was moved by those Russian citizens who spoke out. There are many examples: in many parts of Russia ordinary citizens walked the streets bearing yellow stars with the words ‘I am Georgian’; in Moscow, some high school directors threatened to fire any teacher who handed over lists of students with Georgian names to the police, at the risk of they themselves being fired on the spot for such acts; in St Petersburg, taxi drivers instructed by the city council to refuse lifts to passengers who even looked Georgian, and to refuse to take passengers to some of the numerous Georgian restaurants in the city, refused to obey those orders and threatened to go on strike if pushed.</p>
      <p sl="es">The acts of individuals can make a great difference. I was very touched by the words of the famous Russian actress, Inna Churikova, who recently said, ‘Is every misfortune the fault of Georgians? I do not like it when they try to brainwash me from the television screen. I already see the results: people are against Georgians and soon they will turn against Armenians and the others. This is shameful. I want to ask people – what are you doing? Wake up!’ What courage and determination.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to single out one more individual, the renowned Russian actor Alexander Saladasky, who is today’s modern Russian hero because he applied for Georgian citizenship as a protest.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another modern Russian, and indeed European, hero is Shurshadze, formerly called Shurshin, a young student from St Petersburg about whom I read in the press. He, together with a number of his fellow students, in defiance of policies of xenophobia and hate, took a very bold step and changed his last name from Shurshin to Shurshadze, thereby giving it the Georgian ending.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think we are all inspired by the examples set by those Russian citizens, who have chosen to dissent from a policy that is contrary to what we call European values. I wish to thank all those people today from this place, the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">My purpose in travelling here today is to share with you Georgia’s European vision. Part of that vision means applying 21st century European solutions to modern challenges. We are a small democracy which believes that only through and with Europe will our country and region become secure and lasting partners. We are unavoidably beholden to each other.</p>
      <p sl="es">And so, through European approaches to conciliation built on mutual interest, as well as on common values, we can arrive at solutions that will create an all-inclusive society where no one is a loser.</p>
      <p sl="es">To meet those standards, I want to give you some assurances and clarifications. In many circles, Georgia is labelled as a provocative state which is trying to restore its territorial integrity through force. I can say to you categorically that this is not true. Our intentions are peaceful and exclusively so, because we know what war is, we know what victims look like because they reside among our population today, and we know this cannot be a solution.</p>
      <p sl="es">I myself have dedicated my career and education to the study of human rights, specialising in particular in minority rights. I did my university thesis at the Norwegian Institute of Human Rights on minority rights, and more specifically those of the South Ossetian and Abkhaz peoples. Today fewer than 40 000 ethnic Abkhaz live in Abkhazia and fewer than 20 000 ethnic Ossetians in South Ossetia. I want you to know these figures because sometimes it seems like we are talking about hundreds of millions. They are a very small number of people, and as such I am especially sensitive to their concerns. I know what they are feeling. On the one hand these small groups have become pawns in a larger game – hostages if you like to big politics and a zero-sum vision, with the resurgence of imperial feelings. On the other hand, they have real and genuine concerns which I understand and with which I deeply sympathise.</p>
      <p sl="es">I know their concerns and we are trying to listen to and meet their needs. Unfortunately, there are many who continue to suffer from these conflicts. Over 300 000 ethnic Georgians, as well as Jews, Greeks, Russians and Ukrainians, were thrown out of Abkhazia. Even now we witness the property of those expelled peoples being inhabited by others, and in many cases sold illegally. Indeed, just recently one of the most famous Georgian-French film makers, Otar Ioseliani, while commenting on the recent campaign, remarked that history seems to be repeating itself, targeting the same victims for a second time. He reproached the world for being silent, just as it was the first time.</p>
      <p sl="es">He had this to say: ‘The Russian administration first undertook ethnic cleansing in Abkhazia in 1993, where 500 000 people became refugees. Those who could not escape by walking through the high mountains were massacred by the hands of mercenaries. They devastated and destroyed the country. And by the way, then everybody was silent too.’ And now the same people are being picked up on the streets of Moscow. On my way to the European Parliament this morning I met two people from Abkhazia. They told me they had been deported from Russia, had paid a bribe to a policeman to be deported to France. It is all happening again. The first time was in 1993 and now it is happening again.</p>
      <p sl="es">So this is the painful legacy we have inherited. This time let us not be silent. Today we do not need retribution. The Ossetian and Abkhaz peoples are our fellow citizens, and here again I am drawn to the timeless words of Sir Oliver Wardrop, who in his book The Kingdom of Georgia wrote in 1888: ‘At the very outset it is necessary to remove from the mind of the reader an opinion which is almost universally held in Europe and which is, perhaps, the chief cause of that apathy with which politicians look upon the Caucasus. It is generally believed, even by some of those who have been in the country, that Transcaucasia is inhabited by a vast number of tribes, more or less wild, having nothing in common but the doubtful benefits of Russian rule. Nothing could be more misleading. Students of ethnography may amuse themselves by making elaborate investigations into the origin of the Khevsur, the Svan, the Pshav, the Osset (and the Abkhaz), it is sufficient for us to know that all these people are, politically at least, Georgians, and have fought under the Kartvelian kings since the days of William the Conqueror’.</p>
      <p sl="es">Georgia is a multi-ethnic state and I believe that diversity, that tapestry, is one of our greatest strengths. Not a weakness, but a strength.</p>
      <p sl="es">I was proud that just a few days ago I opened a new Ossetian language school outside South Ossetia, the territory we control, because right now we have twice as many ethnic Ossetian language schools outside South Ossetia as there are inside.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are still a unitary state, but we are certainly open to all kinds of arrangements under which all minorities are accommodated and there is considerable wide autonomy for all of them, such as the ones in Southern Tirol and in many other places in Europe. For these reasons, our task is to extend our hand in peace, justice and reconciliation, to try and solve our problems through negotiation and compromise so that these areas and all the peoples who call them home can share and be blessed by the same prosperity and guarantees of security enjoyed by the rest of Georgia today.</p>
      <p sl="es">Some suggest that our separatist problems are simply an internal Georgian affair. Unfortunately this is not so. Our disputes have continued because they are based on recidivist territorial claims – remnants from the Soviet period when an empire collapsed and elites sought to retain their privilege and fiefdoms. Generals fought wars for dachas in Abkhazia because that was the main private property in Soviet times, and they are still clinging to those dachas.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this scenario, the tactic so visible today is to provide support to local proxies and create institutional blockages to bilateral discussions and negotiation. In this scenario it is the people and future generations born into a climate of fear and hate that lose.</p>
      <p sl="es">My message this afternoon is one of reconciliation, of openness and of recognition and protection of minority rights. We cannot have 19th or 20th century solutions. We appeal to your objectivity, interests, and above all sense of fair play when evaluating these challenges.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, my remarks are founded on the conviction that, today, we must build 21st century European solutions, so that we never again witness the fatal responses of the 20th century, where ‘might is right’ and small states are inexorably torn apart by larger states.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that my conviction and responsibility as a democratic leader can be recognised. I will never remain silent or inactive in the face of a great threat to democracy and to the territorial integrity of my country. No: in such a difficult situation, Georgia must demonstrate calm and show that it can be constructive. That is precisely what we are going to do.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our aim is to continue with our political, social and economic reforms, as difficult as they may be, and build on our successes and our progress in order to send a positive message.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the 1990s, Russia used an economic blockade as a weapon to prevent the integration of the Baltic States into the European Union. In the end, however, these blockades served only to speed up the reorientation of the Baltic economies from the East to the West. The same will apply to Georgia.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, I take advantage of the opportunity of this forum to propose a way forward calling for the strengthening of cooperation between the European Union and Georgia, in particular, by consolidating our cooperation in terms of the neighbourhood policy, and by exploring ways to deepen this relationship so that Georgia may forever become a model demonstrating what the European example can accomplish. We are ready. To achieve this, however, we need your judges, your legal experts, your economists and your security experts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We want a Georgia that secures its borders, so that Europe itself may be more secure. With your involvement, we can overcome the effects of the current embargo, in particular, if we are given the opportunity to trade freely with Turkey and to progress in this direction with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Spare us from having to ask for your help, by allowing us to trade. Let us work together to overcome our territorial disputes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have proposed talks with Moscow and with the leaders of the separatist regions, in order to find common ground. We have asked European governments to become involved in order to facilitate this process. The time has come to build confidence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Together with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the United Nations and the European Union, we have offered the greatest possible forms of independence to South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and I confirm this proposal before you today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">May we who, in the past, have all been victims of war, work together today to build a better future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not in the interests of Europe, Russia and Europe's neighbouring countries to allow this issue to continue without creating a new framework for the emerging challenges.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, if we want to prevent rampant separatism, we must begin a new approach, a European approach reconciling individual beliefs with self-determination and territorial integrity. This is vital for our collective security. Together, we can achieve it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It has been my privilege to share with you today my observations and thoughts on Georgia’s European choice. I believe the path forward – one of engagement and mutual benefit – is finding greater resonance in the capitals of Europe and in European institutions, and this trend should be encouraged.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In closing, I return to the words of Robert Schuman: ‘Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity’. I believe that today we are seeing the emergence of that solidarity. It is certainly present in this Chamber, and it is in our hearts and in our actions as we move forward together.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, experts agree that the trend towards flight from the land will intensify still further over coming years, and the high death rate among farmers is a factor in that. This disturbing tendency has also been encouraged by our misguided subsidy policy, from which, as a rule, only the big players benefit, not to mention the long years over which rural areas have been neglected.</p>
      <p sl="de">It follows that we have to ensure that small farms and those in mountainous areas can survive, with the creation of equivalent living conditions in town and country, and that we must press on with the development of the infrastructure in individual regions and the establishment of links between them. It is for that reason that I have voted in favour of the Daul report’s adoption.</p>

      <p sl="el">The Commission proposal on the development of energy crops and biomass production crops endeavours to mitigate the impasses created by the new CAP in the rural economy, for workers in agricultural product processing industries and for small and medium-sized holdings, from its first year in application and which will intensify on its completion.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, the incentives contained in the proposal and the preconditions for paying them benefit large farm holdings in the northern countries of the ΕU which have a comparative advantage due to their soil and climate conditions and size, but do not benefit countries with a dry summer climate and small holdings, because they are of a horizontal nature and deliberately overlook these differences.</p>
      <p sl="el">In our country, for example, there are no areas which were entered into the set-aside scheme in order to be cultivated with energy crops, with the result that there is no benefit from this measure, while the surface area subsidy of 4.5 euros per decare is insignificant and is not therefore an incentive of any substance.</p>
      <p sl="el">That is why we disagree with the proposed regulation, despite the fact that we consider the Commission proposal for the new Member States as regards energy crops to be positive in principle, because it moves in the direction of equal treatment, even though it does not constitute equal treatment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the public are becoming more and more mobile; there is no longer anything exceptional about working or studying in another EU Member State, or about living in one in retirement, and so a number of complex issues and problems – which we have not yet resolved – arise with regard to social security. Although a certain amount has been going on since the first Community rules and regulations on this subject were enacted over 30 years ago, there is still a need for action in this respect, to which I do not believe the Matsouka report does justice, and it is for that reason that I abstained from voting on it.</p>

      <p sl="el">Businesses in the aquaculture sector, following the rapid development of the sector in indigenous species of fish and shellfish, want to get into the cultivation of non-indigenous species.</p>
      <p sl="el">The proposal for a regulation makes provision for certain safety procedures because there is a clear danger of disrupting the natural biodiversity in an area once non-indigenous species have been introduced and released.</p>

      <p sl="el">On the other hand, the facility to import such organisms and the possible economic benefits which will accrue can be counterbalanced by fishing and/or cultivating them in countries where they constitute natural populations – in other words, with no danger to natural ecosystems. This would also allow these countries to develop, for the benefit of their peoples too, in direct disproportion to any economic results there would be in the Member States of the EU.

      <p sl="sv">It is unacceptable for the EU now to attempt to bind all its Member States to a third party in an international treaty. The whole idea of the United Nations Convention against Corruption is one based on voluntary participation and respect for the national right of self-determination. The rapporteur, Mr Catania, has chosen to cite 26 assorted articles in his report as support for the proposal. None of these articles accord the EU the power or competence to enter into a legally binding treaty with a third party. The EU should instead focus on the widespread corruption within its own institutions. Internal corruption within the EU is a growing problem that is in the process of eroding citizens’ trust in the whole European idea.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We feel that the Commission should table a fresh proposal in order to create genuine modulation, which would guarantee greater fairness and release financial resources by introducing a maximum limit to aid per holding (capping) and a percentage increase in aid for farmers who receive the least from the CAP (modulation), for example, by proposing a 15% to 20% increase for farmers who receive less than EUR 5 000 in aid and, in addition to this figure, taking various circumstances into account.</p>

It also calls for ‘wages to respond more rapidly to changing economic circumstances’, or in other words for wages to be reduced depending on the cycle. These intentions could not be clearer.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Not satisfied with this, the rapporteur also promotes the liberalisation of services and energy, the strict application of the Stability and Growth Pact and compliance with the Lisbon agenda: the very blueprint for the European neoliberal consensus.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Hence our vote against the report.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Even though Sweden decided, through a referendum, not to participate in economic and monetary union (EMU), we have chosen to vote against the report and would like to take the opportunity to explain why we have done so.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The report provides a clear picture of how EMU goes hand in hand with the creation of an EU state. According to the report, macroeconomic policy between the countries of the euro area is to be coordinated, and the euro area is to speak with one voice in international financial institutions and fora. The report advocates better fiscal, especially budgetary, coordination and the coordination of national fiscal calendars. Moreover, the objective of introducing a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base in Europe could be achieved through the mechanism of enhanced cooperation if Member States were unable to reach unanimous agreement.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We can only conclude that the representatives of the ‘no’ campaign in Sweden’s EMU referendum in 2003 were entirely correct in their argument when they pointed out that EMU was a major step on the road to a United States of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">As an oceanographer, I am delighted to support this report on the Strategy on the Marine Environment. The EU has for too long collapsed rural policy into agricultural policy. Finally this has begun to change in a positive way to recognise that farming is only a minority, if important part, of the rural economy. We face an identical problem with respect to maritime policy. It has been seen as fisheries policy writ large, but now, with the Commission Paper on maritime policy currently out for consultation – I recently participated in a conference on the subject in Weymouth organised by the South West Regional Development Agency – this report and the Lienemann report voted earlier today, it looks as if we are going to finally move away from a one-dimensional maritime policy to a policy that embraces our seas, oceans and coasts as vital for food and the environment, transport and tourism.</p>

      <p sl="sv">In this commentary on the strategy on the marine environment, the rapporteur brings up many interesting and important issues. One example is when he states that the Common Fisheries Policy must meet the requirements for sustainable development, whilst those Member States that wish to adopt more urgent measures in order to protect a particular stock should have the opportunity to do so.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Amongst the negative aspects of the report are the comments on funding; the rapporteur is concerned about the lack of resources with which to implement the strategies, the implication being that resources from the Community budget should be contributed for this purpose and that it would be a good idea to use resources from, for example, the Structural Funds.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This own-initiative report is aimed at creating a single European market for mortgage credit and the promotion thereof at cross-border level. The banks and the capital markets have a major interest in this issue given that in 2004 the volume of outstanding loans was EUR 4.7 billion, equivalent to 45% of the EU’s GNI. This is very much a growth market.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report follows the neoliberal line. It provides for more competition in the sector, European or cross-border mortgages, a secondary market for mortgage credit and the possibility for it to be negotiated on the capital markets, cross-border mergers and acquisitions in the financial services sector, the opening-up of this market to institutions other than credit institutions, guaranteed freedom to provide services and the liberalisation of these services, restrictions on the State’s ability to regulate, online marketing of mortgage credit and access for foreign organisations to customer credit databases, including non-compliance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is not difficult to see the risks involved with all of these proposals, in terms of market volatility. This would jeopardise mortgage assets, that is to say, the savings of many workers and other home buyers. We therefore voted against the report.</p>

      <p sl="nl">It goes without saying that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are in favour of opening up markets, including the market in mortgages. I am therefore well disposed towards the Purvis report, which suggests investigation into different measures that might benefit the consumer through, for example, competition among mortgage lenders, but I have no choice but to vote against it on the grounds that the report is not very clear about the different systems of tax benefits when mortgages are concluded, and particularly harmonised. This is an exploratory first proposal in which, above all, the call for further analysis is prominent. The legislative phase is a long way off.</p>

I refuse, though, to lend my support to the harmonisation of the system of tax deduction of mortgage interest via a backdoor in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Time after time, politicians stress that Europe must look after the core themes and cross-border issues, but this statement by the European Parliament is at odds with that. Most of its Members do not appear bothered about the fact that tax policy is not one of the EU’s competences. That is why the Dutch People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy delegation in the European Parliament deemed it necessary to vote against paragraph 45 of the Purvis report and, indeed, against the report as a whole. I find it regrettable that, since none of the big groups dared apply for a roll-call vote on this matter, the European citizen can only guess how individual MEPs have voted.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome the Green Paper on Mortgage Credit, which explores how competition in the EU mortgage market could increase consumer choice and reduce costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Consumer confidence in banks is of paramount importance. Therefore the willingness of a borrower to deal with a foreign lender will be determined not only by the competitiveness of the mortgage, but also by the level of consumer protection that will apply to the foreign lender.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ireland enjoys a relatively sophisticated mortgage credit market in EU terms, including access to the full range of competitively priced mortgage products. Expansion of this market across borders may develop naturally through subsidiaries or branches abroad on a more widespread basis, if the market is encouraged in other areas. Therefore I believe that legislative intervention should only be used as a last resort and to address proven market failure.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully encourage the Commission in creating electronic land registers which can be accessed online. The fact of the matter is that lenders cannot enter other markets without absolute certainty regarding the security of their collateral. Given the experience that many citizens have had purchasing overseas property, an online register reflecting all relevant charges affecting property ownership rights is vital.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Any Community measure concerning the European mortgage credit market must, above all, be of direct benefit to the public. However, consumers often come up against too many obstacles, be they legal or economic.</p>

    <intervention id="2-198" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, when the lights went out across Europe last week, our interdependence as Europeans was laid bare for all to see. In a flash, greater integration ceased to be some abstract ideal. For millions of our citizens, it became a necessity. The incident – dare I say it – was illuminating. The argument for more Europe has not so much been won, as rendered superfluous. It is now clear to everyone that we face more shared challenges than ever before – thanks in part to the forces unleashed by globalisation. And shared challenges demand shared solutions, whether they relate to growth and jobs in an increasingly competitive world, climate change, energy security or, indeed, international terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can be proud of our response so far to this rapidly changing landscape. First, we renewed the Lisbon Agenda and placed the emphasis squarely on growth and jobs. As a result, it was possible to restore confidence in the Stability and Growth Pact, putting it on a more realistic and workable footing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe’s leaders agreed to put globalisation at the centre of its policy agenda, and the Commission has been busy equipping the European Union with the tools it needs, and using those tools, on a whole range of concerns that European citizens share. To boost growth and jobs, the European institutions have continued work to unleash the full potential of the single market. At the same time, we have renewed our commitment to social solidarity, including the setting-up of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, a useful shock absorber for the powerful motor of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">To ensure that Europe thrives in the knowledge economies of tomorrow, innovation became a central part of our economic and social strategies and today innovation is at the core of the concerns of European leaders. The establishment of the European Institute of Technology will help reverse the fragmentation of research, education and innovation efforts, which has stunted progress so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">The document ‘Europe in the World’ tackles the need to develop a global voice which matches our economic weight in the world. This will also reinforce our efforts in areas where we have already exerted leadership, notably in the debate on a future international climate change regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">And we have successfully steered Romania and Bulgaria towards European Union membership. We have proposed the two new Commissioners and allocated the portfolios. One will be responsible for consumer affairs and the other for multilingualism, to protect and to reinforce European cultural pluralism and diversity. Intercultural aspects are more and more important in the Europe of today. I am very proud that this further step – Romania and Bulgaria joining the Union – has taken place and that my Commission has made an important contribution to it. I think we should all be very proud of what has been achieved through successive enlargements. Let there be no doubt: in centuries to come, historians will say that enlargement was the greatest instrument for peace, prosperity and stability of our generation.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">On that note, I would like to say it is more than time we stopped talking about ‘old’ and ‘new’ Member States. More than ever before, we are now one Europe, united in all our diversity, and that is something we should celebrate.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also laid the groundwork in many other areas that concern us all – sustainable development, maritime policy, and energy efficiency, to name just a few.</p>
      <p sl="en">We still have much to achieve by the end of this year. I hope that the European Council will approve the enlargement package we adopted last week. We need to move forward on immigration and innovation policy and we still have important proposals to adopt in areas like labour law, copyright levies, neighbourhood policy, CO2 emissions from cars and emissions trading.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the first years of this Commission, working in a spirit of partnership with this Parliament, have meant renewing, reorienting and re-tooling, to create a Europe of results, a Europe fit to face the shared challenges of the 21st century. These efforts are already bearing fruit: growth has been revised upwards to its highest level in six years; unemployment has dropped to its lowest level since we started collecting EU25 data in 1998.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now 2007 – the year we celebrate 50 years of European construction – will mark a turning point. It will mark the moment when a Europe of 27, after careful preparation, throws the full weight of the Union’s re-tuned machinery behind the delivery of solutions to our citizens’ shared concerns. It will mark the moment when a new budgetary framework unlocks modernised financing programmes, which move towards Europe’s new agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this is the context for our 2007 Work Programme. It is a new type of programme that has greatly benefited from input from this Parliament, the Council and the other institutions: valuable input that will continue with this debate and the resolution you adopt.</p>
      <p sl="en">This Work Programme addresses many of Parliament’s concerns that have been conveyed to me and to the Commission. This new Work Programme is more political. It is focused on a smaller list of 21 strategic initiatives. The Commission is committed to delivering all of these next year, and they will not be subject to a mid-term review. A second list of priority initiatives fills out our work in other important areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, we have responded to calls from Parliament to include a list of simplification measures and withdrawals of legislative proposals in the Work Programme. This underlines the message that Better Regulation is now an integral part of the Commission’s day-to-day tasks. Today, in the College meeting, we adopted our strategic review of Better Regulation that takes stock of progress to date and sets out an ambitious programme of new initiatives. This includes new action in the following areas: impact assessment, where we will establish an Impact Assessment Board; simplification, where we will add important new initiatives to our rolling programme; and administrative burdens, where we will suggest a target to the Spring European Council next year to cut such burdens at European Union and Member State levels by 25% by 2012. In parallel, we will present an action plan in two months’ time defining priority areas for action.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also continuing to screen, and in a number of cases withdraw, pending proposals. We are recommending that future Commissions do the same at the beginning of their mandates as an expression of the changed political composition of a new Commission, so showing the importance of political legitimacy and political leadership. This review responds to a very large extent to the priorities of the European Parliament, as expressed in several reports earlier this year. I hope you will give your full endorsement to this package, including to its practical implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what does the 2007 Work Programme feature? Let me highlight some key areas, those I believe to be politically very sensitive.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, energy. Building on our Green Paper and measures for greater energy efficiency earlier this year, we will present the first ever Strategic Energy Review for Europe. This will include the building blocks for an integrated European Union energy policy, for example measures to complete the internal market for electricity and gas; to accelerate take-up of new low-carbon technologies; and to diversify and secure supplies both within and outside Europe. The goal is a common European energy policy that will ensure our security of supply, while maintaining Europe’s competitiveness and safeguarding our environmental objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Closely linked to this – in fact I could say they are two parts of the same agenda – will be action on climate change. We will put forward options for a European Union climate change policy and perspectives for international cooperation post-Kyoto. A revision of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme will provide greater stability for investments and accelerate the momentum to cut greenhouse gases.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe’s demographic squeeze calls for greater efforts to attract economic migrants, particularly those who are skilled. A European regime for labour immigration will give such migrants a secure legal status, while clarifying their obligations and their rights. In order to reduce illegal immigration and exploitation of workers, this will be coupled with a clampdown on unscrupulous employers of third-country nationals who enter Europe illegally.</p>
      <p sl="en">European public policy can have a fundamental impact on the way people live their lives. To be effective, it must be properly attuned to the needs of modern society. The Commission will undertake a fundamental stocktaking of European society, which will serve as a basis for European policy-making into the next decade. As I have said several times, Europe is more than a market. Europe without the concept of solidarity is not really a European Union.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">Our core business, in terms of our competences under the Treaties, will not be forgotten either. The Commission will continue to defend, extend and modernise the single market. A key target for 2007 will be the defence industries and markets, which have been fragmented for far too long. We will also set out the way forward on services of general interest in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p sl="en">A final area of concern to all our citizens is security. The Commission will bring forward additional measures to combat terrorism, with a particular focus on fighting terrorist propaganda and the sharing of expertise – on explosives for example – for terrorist purposes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The year 2007 will also mark a turning point in our search for an institutional settlement. The Berlin Declaration, marking the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, will allow Europe’s leaders to renew their commitment to an enlarged, global and competitive Europe, where solidarity is a central principle. I believe it should be a short, sharp political declaration, affirming what unites us and – above all – making clear where we want to go and what we want Europe to be for the next 50 years. Following my initial proposal, I am happy to see that everything is now moving in the direction of having a joint statement, a statement by the Member States, the European Commission and the European Parliament, thus showing that the commitment to the European Union is today a shared commitment of the main political institutions of our Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to see that the search for an institutional settlement is also a priority for the German Presidency. So I am confident that the elements are in place for an important breakthrough. This is important, because Europe needs an institutional settlement. There are indeed serious costs derived from not having a constitutional treaty. We need the constitutional treaty because, as a European Union, we need to be more effective in our decision-making, more coherent in our external action and more transparent and democratic in our working. Make no mistake: the Commission will be an active player in the search for solutions here.</p>
      <p sl="en">When this Commission took office, there was unfinished business to deal with and to reform. With the help of this Parliament and the Council, these things have been dealt with, put behind us, or turned around: we now have the financial perspectives; we now have the revised Stability and Growth Pact. In fact I hope tomorrow we can say we will have the revised Services Directive, to be approved by a parliamentary vote. That shows that we are solving some of the planning problems and proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has been hard work, but it is already bearing fruit. The 2007 Work Programme builds on these new foundations.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we can conclude the work on decisions that were already in the pipeline but also launch new, very important, projects for the work of Europe, such as energy policy. For the first time we have the chance to have a real common approach to energy, to be more ambitious in the fight against climate change, to look at the entire field of justice and at the fight against illegal migration. This is a new frontier for Europe and we need to take a European approach. So we see that Europe is on the move. There are problems. We know the problems that exist, but there are great possibilities and there is, more than ever, the need for a strong Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">So as we celebrate Europe’s 50th anniversary next year, we can do so with much greater confidence. Once again, I believe Europe will be able to show its relevance by reinventing itself for the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="en">To show our commitment to practical results and to working hard for a stronger European Union, this can be a fitting birthday present for the 50th anniversary of Europe, a birthday present for Europe and all its citizens.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>

    <intervention id="2-200" speaker_id="2025" name="Françoise Grossetête" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioners, I should like first of all to congratulate the European Commission, which is presenting us with a much more political programme today and which, for the first time, is going all out for simplification by presenting a reduced number of priority sectors in its legislative and work programme for 2007. That will be useful to us in a year that promises to be crucial for the European Union, as it is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. It will indeed be necessary to breathe new life into European integration by renewing the link with our fellow citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You are, indeed, presenting to us a series of 21 strategic initiatives – perhaps rather too many for some people – which will be at the heart of the Commission’s activities in 2007, as well as a series of priority initiatives which will have to be adopted in the course of the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This legitimate demand for flexibility appears, at least to our Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to entail two possible disadvantages. Firstly, the drawing up in parallel of two lists of priorities inevitably creates some confusion concerning the relative importance to be attached to each type of objective and concerning the links between the two categories. Secondly, spreading the programme out over 18 months means that there is a danger of slowing down the work of the Commission. Our group therefore believes that it would be more appropriate to retain annual, twelve-month, structuring and, above all, to require ourselves to respect the deadlines, something that does not always happen at present.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also need to remain alert to the fact that many of the ambitious objectives announced by the European Commission need to take account of the budgetary provisions in force. Nor must pointless structures constantly be created. I am thinking, for example, of the creation of new agencies in order to solve this or that problem. One has the impression in the end that, when no solution is found to a problem, the decision is taken to create an agency. That being said, a number of agencies manifestly continue to be effective, on the model of the European Medicines Agency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Before going on to create other structures, however, let us firstly take stock of the existing structures. Otherwise, you are in danger of one day proposing to us the creation of a new agency designed to divide up and supervise the agencies in each Member State. Do we really need to have 27 agencies because we shall have 27 Member States? Costs must remain reasonable and produce what our Anglo-Saxon friends call proper value for money, that is to say a sound cost-benefit ratio.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission’s work programme also emphasises the importance of impact studies and re-states the Commission’s intention to create a new body responsible for supporting such studies and monitoring their quality. Parliament will keep a watchful eye on these impact studies and emphasises the need for objectivity so that they are carried out with the greatest possible transparency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to improve European competitiveness, we shall ensure that there is a reduction in all forms of bureaucracy and that any superfluous legislation is done away with. In this area, it is important to involve the European Parliament more and to improve the ex post evaluation of the measures adopted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For this reason, Mr President, our group believes that the number of strategic initiatives needs to be reduced so as to avoid the pitfall of having too many of them. There is indeed a risk of moving away from a practical work programme – a development that could harm the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our group is nonetheless very pleased with the six priority areas defined by the Commission for 2007. I shall not go back and list these priority areas, but I should like to emphasise a number of points, including the energy issue. The European Union’s growing dependence where energy is concerned is a factor of which account needs to be taken from now on, and that is all the more the case since last week’s power failure. The EU will have to seek other means of reducing the harmful effects of energy dependence. Our group believes that energy efficiency, the increased use of renewable sources of energy and a structured dialogue with the producer countries and with consumers will enable this objective to be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A number of studies suggest that the European Union could create a million direct and indirect jobs in the energy efficiency sector. Thus, not only would the search for greater efficiency enable the European Union’s economy to save considerable sums. It could also make a major contribution to competitiveness and employment, which are key objectives of the Lisbon agenda.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We would also ask the Commission to continue to play a pivotal role in the fight against global warming, which has consequences in economic and social, as well as strictly environmental, terms. The European Union will have to bring all its weight to bear in requiring the use of certain ecologically more effective products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is more, 2007 will be the year of an important new stage in the historic process of enlargement of the European Union, as it is then that our Bulgarian and Romanian friends will join us. Moreover, you yourself, Mr President, have just told us that enlargement of the EU is the most important tool for peace of the last fifty years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is therefore essential for these priority areas to be seen as challenges that will have to be taken up. It is also, however, a question of communicating more with all Europeans. Our group welcomes, moreover, the Commission’s initiative in making communication one of its strategic objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I would point out to you that, having arrived at the half-way point of our term of office, we almost want to say: let us stop talking about programmes, as our fellow citizens hate lists of promises. The watchwords are: action, more action and still more action. Mr President, we are ready to support you as we go down that route.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if you, as I have done, read the Commission programme for 2007 carefully, you will actually say, with some satisfaction, that this is a good programme. If all this becomes reality, we will be able to be satisfied, proud and happy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, though, one gets, on reading it, the feeling of having been here before, of having read it already. Where, though, I asked myself, and so I had a look in my archives and dug out the legislative and working programme for 2006. Aha, I knew it: I really had read all this before!</p>
      <p sl="de">I then came to the conclusion that this is not an argument against the 2007 programme; on the contrary, indeed, it is actually evidence of continuity in the ideas that the Commission is putting forward to us today, and there is nothing wrong with that; it is not a bad thing, for the goals set out in the working programme are good ones. Yes, indeed, climate change is the number one challenge; that energy policy must be central in the coming year is not a matter of doubt.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since all those who hold power under you are present here, Mr President of the Commission, let me tell you and them, speaking as a father, that the safety of children’s toys is indeed important, and vitally so. Doing away with roaming charges will be a tremendous thing; as one who uses the phone a lot, I am behind you all the way on that. Reducing bureaucracy is vitally important if we are to make the EU more efficient. All these things are important, and I could turn to any and every one of your Commissioners and tell them: ‘your portfolio is the most important of all!’</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, I ask myself the question as to why, when we are doing all these good, right and important things, we are not getting through to people. Why is it, then, that, despite all these things, people are not enthusiastic about the European project? I think I have found the explanation for that. For years on end, the radical free-marketeers, not least in the Commission, have been telling us that all that is needed is to deregulate, to do away with the rules and regulations, and leave it to the market to sort everything out. They have been telling us that the internal market will create the economic dynamism that we need in order to create jobs, to guarantee living wages on which people can live securely, but reality is something else! Yes, go on, applaud!</p>
      <p sl="de">It is you radical free-marketeers who, with the deregulation of the European internal market, have enabled us to achieve the highest unemployment figures that Europe has ever seen; that is what the reality of this internal market has turned out to be.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">That, Mr President of the Commission, is why something you have said, in this debate, something you have said for the first time in a long time, may well be more important than the work programme as a whole, and the important statement that you made was that, without solidarity, without social responsibility, the internal market will not come to be. If that is the line that the Commission is taking, if that is the spirit motivating your working programme, then you have our backing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Poettering’s spontaneous applause shows that he is both Christian and social, and I think your statement is one of the most important that you have made to this House for a long time, and it is for that reason that the approach you have set out today is a good one.</p>
      <a text="(Interruption: ‘CDU, not CSU!’)"/>
      <p sl="de">While we are talking about this strategic work programme, perhaps I might say something else to the President of the Commission about his new Commission, for the Commission sitting here is an old one, to be joined by two new Commissioners. I have read, Mr President of the Commission, that you want to give the Romanian candidate the job of Commissioner for Multilingualism. I am sure that, as the hearings progress, I will find out more about what is meant by that, but I have to say that I think it rather insubstantial. The multilingualism portfolio is not worthy of Mr Orban, nor does it make sufficient demands of a Commissioner, and so I do not understand why he is being given such a thin portfolio.</p>
      <p sl="de">I surmise that it reflects the view that we have to watch out for Europe’s diversity, that we have to safeguard and sustain the European Union’s multilingual character, and that we think is absolutely the right thing to do, so why not create a proper portfolio for it?</p>
      <p sl="de">Something that this House has had to discuss over and over again during the last few plenary sessions is the threats facing minorities in the European Union, among them a growing potential for extremism, not least of a right-wing nature, for xenophobia and anti-Semitism, for minorities, even in the European Union, are increasingly under threat, under attack, and in need of protection. Minorities, and, for example, their languages, are a sign of the diversity that makes Europe so strong.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is for that reason that I recommend to you that you give some thought to expanding this portfolio and including within it not only multilingualism, but also the protection of minorities in general. That would make it all the clearer what you intend to achieve by it, and then – or so I could well imagine – you could get even wider support for this proposal in this House.</p>
      <p sl="de">Speaking in general terms, I would have been glad if the Presidency of the Council had been present to take note of the Commission’s strategic work programme, for many, many things that the President of the Commission has come here with his Commissioners to put before us can be realised only if the men and women in the individual governments of the EU, whom the Council represents, put into effect those things that the Commission proposes and we enact. Their absence from this debate is symptomatic of their attitude towards this European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioners, researchers into time found out this past week that the second half of life passes much more quickly than the first, and that which is true of life is also, of course, true of the lifetimes of legislatures, so, since your Commission has not much time left, it should be all the more ambitious in its approach to doing its work. What that means in terms of the work programme is that it ought to have been the prelude to a final spurt, aiming high and promising speed. Can that, though, be said of this document? The Liberals and Democrats take the view that it cannot, for it ushers in nothing of the sort.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me begin, though, by talking about the good things we have found in your programme, like the focus on the reduction of bureaucracy, on the assessment of the costs that legislation will entail, on simplification, in other words the emphasis on better lawmaking – and certainly on less of it; that is a very good thing to aim at, and in that respect we are wholeheartedly behind you. What I want to say for the benefit of those who fear that the EU is turning into a neo-liberal, completely deregulated market economy – and in saying it, I will also highlight Mr Poettering’s spontaneous applause for something Mr Schulz mentioned as an example of what the Grand Coalition is all about – is that those who think the EU is a neo-liberal market economy probably also think that Cuba is a democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now for my second point: you prioritised communication with the public, and that, too, is something we think is a good thing; we are glad that you are doing this, for, if the EU loses its basis and fails to build a citizens’ Europe, then it will not achieve anything worth mentioning either. The EU needs the public as its constant partner in dialogue; it is on them that a single European Union will be founded.</p>
      <p sl="de">If I may turn to the structure of the document – and Mr Schulz should read it more carefully – it differs substantially from last year’s, in that it is clear how the text and its annex fit together, whereas their failure to do so last year was something of which we were critical. We urged to you to make the connection between the two clear, and you have managed to do so, so many thanks for that. It even specifies the legal basis for each legislative initiative, and that, too, makes a great deal of difference – and you provide explanations of them, which makes the whole thing so much more manageable. Why, though, are the existing legal acts, the ones to be continued in 2007, not listed alongside them? Why, too, does the structure not make it even clearer what is about legislation and what is not? Why, then, are you – in essence – changing the picture?</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me add something on the subject of multilingualism. I have heard speculations in this House to the effect – Mr Barroso – that this was your very subtle way of highlighting the possibility of there being too many commissioners, and that this portfolio was intended to show this up in, so to speak, a symbolic way.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the course of this debate, my colleagues will be discussing the various policy areas, energy, climate change and legal policy among them, but I would like to take this opportunity to give you an idea of what overall impact your programme has had on our group. We very definitely see ourselves as having the role of accompanying you in your work in a spirit of constructive criticism, and that, of course, means cooperating with you, but with an emphasis on constructive criticism.</p>
      <p sl="de">We see this programme as a puzzle with many individual pieces, one that cannot really be put together in such a way as to produce a big picture. We cannot find in it any clear policy guidelines, nor any answers; not even attempts at answers to the big questions facing the EU in the shape of enlargement and the constitutional treaty. Nor can we understand why it is that there is not one word in the whole document about humanitarian aid and help with development, areas in which the EU is the biggest player on earth, so why are they not mentioned? Even though your Commission has not achieved much – to put it politely – where the completion of the internal market is concerned, you are carrying on down the same path, and there is no evidence we can see of a holistic and comprehensive approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">Innovation, too – which is quite crucial to Europe, being at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy – is mentioned, so to speak, only in passing and in terms of the European Institute of Technology and the Seventh Research Framework Programme. Our view is that what innovation needs most of all is freedom and the right conditions rather than institutions and more support measures, which tend to take us in the wrong direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">This year’s programme does not, in fact, have a title. Why not, then? It does rather give the impression that not only are the pieces of the puzzle difficult to put together, but also that some of them may well be missing.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, in drafting these few lines on your work programme, I wanted, in the brief time allotted to me, to draw attention to the draft Constitutional Treaty’s motto, 'Unity in diversity', as I think that, in the current international and European political context, we have more need of unity than of diversity in the European Union. We need unity, and it is for the Commission in particular to be the standard bearer for this unity. I also believe that, in view of the current weakness of a divided Council - I am thinking, for example, of the failure of the Working Time Directive - we do not expect the Commission to anticipate the divisions of the Council but to be bullish in the proposals it is to put to us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When objectives are not achieved and when self-imposed obligations to produce results are not met, there must be no question of lowering one's sights or reducing one’s targets. On the contrary, more resources have to be demanded and, in these conditions, I think that you will have Parliament’s support. Of a number of areas to which the strategic priorities shared by ourselves apply, I want specifically to quote the example of the subject on which my group has probably worked most during the last two and a half years, namely that involving the climate, energy and transport. We have sent to your department and to the departments of your colleagues details of an energy policy strategy that would enable us to achieve a 30% emission rate for CO2 and greenhouse gases between now and 2020.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Barroso, the European Union must fulfil its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, but it is not at present doing so. That is why we think it necessary to put restrictive arrangements in place, similar to those with which we are familiar in connection with budgetary discipline. By that, I mean that the European Union should not only assume obligations in terms of results but also give itself sufficient resources. That is why we think that the emissions trading system needs to be improved and to be coordinated by the Commission and that it needs to be possible under the system to impose sanctions on Member States that do not respect their own objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the case of renewable sources of energy, we think that the Commission needs to propose sectoral objectives and not only general objectives. As for energy efficiency, we are waiting for the Commission to propose a revision of the ‘Buildings’ Directive to cover all buildings. As Mrs Grossetête has indicated, the construction industry also creates economic activity, as you well know.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this area of the climate, energy and transport, we must, in other words, reduce gas emissions, reduce dependence on energy imports and reduce the risks. It is because of this last concern that we continue to be opposed to nuclear power. We must finally, in Nairobi, make serious preparations for ‘Kyoto 2’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to quote another example where European unity should be in evidence: the imperative need to introduce common minimum social standards at European level. We cannot give up this commitment. That is why we want the Commission to propose a framework directive on services of general interest.</p>

    <intervention id="2-204" speaker_id="28248" name="Gabriele Zimmer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, even though I do not doubt that the Commission’s staff, in drafting the work plan for 2007, did their work with great exactitude and precision, I have to say that I do not think that either the priorities for the work to be done or the tendencies it highlights really respond to the demands of the present time.</p>
      <p sl="de">They have to do with problem areas for which the EU does indeed bear responsibility, but which go well beyond its bounds. I am thinking here of such priority areas as poverty, social exclusion, growing inequalities and divisions in society, or, indeed, the commercialisation of social life, the destruction of nature and culture, and of such issues as the loss of democracy, repression, war, militarisation or, speaking more generally, the way in which global problems are addressed and commitment to the achievement of the millennium development goals – something that we ought particularly to care about in view of the fact that the UN has again found that the number of people going hungry is increasing further.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact is that these problems and conflicts are not at the heart of the work programme, and it is not on them that the Commission is concentrating its efforts. Despite the good things in the working programme, which we certainly endorse, I do believe that its being put into effect will entail these problems getting worse, for what is still central to the Commission’s efforts is the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, which has competitiveness as its objective, and I believe that will lead to global social and economic problems becoming more acute.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is no room in all this for the question of social models, which we in this House have debated for so long. What that ultimately boils down to in the Commission’s work is the issue of greater flexibility, and I have to tell Mr Barroso that such a narrow view will not, I think, enable the social dimension of the European Union that he has announced to become reality.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a second priority area that I would like to address. It is stated in the programme that what economic life demands is more internal market rather than more regulation, and the programme prioritises the creation and development of a European internal market for armaments. Perhaps I might make bold to ask that someone might tell me of just one deficit within the European Union that this European internal market in weaponry, thus created and brought in through the back door, might actually remedy, and also inform me as to who actually authorised the Commission to develop one.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was, after all, not least because of something of that sort that the draft constitution failed and was rejected. I regard this as irresponsible, and I think that adjustments are needed here as a matter of urgency if policy is actually to be developed in the European Union instead of people merely throwing slogans around. These adjustments must result in people once more being able to identify much more strongly with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">General statements about people’s fear of the dismantling of social services are of no use to us: we have to actively do something to counteract it. What people need is real projects and initiatives; that is why we have to address the real issues. There are alternatives, though, and I believe they can be summed up in three projects: making the EU democratic, making it socially and environmentally sustainable, and making it into a force for peace, one that endeavours to resolve global problems democratically and in a spirit of solidarity.</p>

    <intervention id="2-205" speaker_id="2109" name="Brian Crowley" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the UEN Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to welcome President Barroso and the Members of the Commission to the Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two points struck me immediately in the speeches and comments I heard earlier on. Firstly, when did it become a sin to be radical; when was it ordained that we should not try to create something new and different and, when we see mistakes, not try to right them? In particular, the fact that we live in such a rapidly changing world brought about through innovation and technology requires a more rapid response from the European Union to ensure that we can defend as best as possible the interests of all EU citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, there are obviously going to be carry-over issues from one year to the next on which agreement has yet to be reached. We have already seen this when dealing with the Services Directive over the last six years, where even now we are only at second reading. We will have to deal with many more issues like that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would, however, like to make three points. Firstly, with regard to the Lisbon Agenda, there is still so much lacking in terms of the necessary legislative framework that must be put in place to make Lisbon a reality. The whole area of innovation, research and development is one that we talk about a lot, but in which concrete legislative action to protect design, patents and copyright, and to allow for proper investment in research and development, in financial terms, is still lacking.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have spoken many times in this Chamber on the European Institute of Technology and the wonderful advance and focal point for excellence that would represent. However, this is the positive side of things, and we seem to be regressing in other areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is talking about a harmonised taxation system, but wherever harmonised taxation has taken place it has been contrary to good competition, economic growth and employment growth. Tax competition within the European Union has been healthy for growth and has been beneficial and of assistance. One must of course have a level playing field as regards state aids and other similar areas, and we do have this. We can quite rightly bring Member States under control when they go above and beyond what is allowable as regards assisting industries or assisting employment creation opportunities. However, taxation is solely a national interest issue. It is one that still requires unanimous agreement, and I think it behoves us to stand up and say that the legal bases of the Treaties do not allow the Commission to come forward with a proposal for tax harmonisation. They do not allow it to force countries to increase taxes, and they do not allow it to force countries to lower taxes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the CFSP has been one of the European Union’s key successes. Take Kosovo, Africa and other developments around the world, where the European Union has responded positively to putting peacekeepers and police forces in the field and to promoting other constructive developments on the ground. We must continue to enlarge and expand that role.</p>

    <intervention id="2-206" speaker_id="1275" name="Jens-Peter Bonde" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the IND/DEM Group">
      <p sl="da">Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, it is just as well that the Commissioners do not have voting rights. Otherwise, we could soon be voted down in this House. It is also good that the Commission is proposing more voluntary coordination through communications instead of binding rules, but I fear that the compulsory dimension will, rather, come from the European Court of Justice and from the Commission’s own use of rules governing competition and state aid. That is, of course, what the Commission has done, for example, with its communication on music rights. Parliament had adopted one position, which the Commission did not like. The Commission then turned to matters relating to the abuse of monopolies and adopted a communication instead of rules, which it would perhaps never have been possible to adopt. The European Parliament and the national parliaments should demand that all draft communications be submitted to them. In that way, we can make it known whether we want to have binding rules or a cocktail of communications and of decisions by the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="da">I wish to commend the Commission for having, every week since 15 September, sent proposals to the Member States for submission to the proximity and necessity test. As far as I know, the parliaments have not, however, responded once. How lazy can they be as representatives of the people? On Monday and Tuesday, the national parliaments will come together for the COSAC meeting in Helsinki and they should not miss the opportunity to put some order into the jungle of laws from Brussels. Let all the specialist committees and European Affairs Committees colour-code every single proposal: black, if the national parliament wants to see binding EU laws; green, if there are to be minimum provisions with the option of better protection for welfare, health, the environment, the working environment, security, consumer protection and animal welfare; yellow, if the desire is merely for voluntary coordination instead of binding laws; and red, if the EU is to steer completely clear of a matter. With colour-coding like that, it would be very easy for the Commission to see at a glance what is wanted. In this way, it would be possible to obtain bottom-up European cooperation instead of the centralism that we have at present.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-207" speaker_id="1956" name="Frank Vanhecke" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I gather from the work programme that the Commission – and I quote – would like to listen more to the citizens in order to involve them more in the policy process. As the Dutch cabaret artist Wim Sonneveld might have said: nou breekt m'n klomp, ‘that takes the biscuit’ – or something very like that. Perhaps I might remind the Commission that the European public, to whom it is referring, has already made its opinions abundantly clear, for example about the so-called European Constitution, and that they have, by means of referendums, consigned this project to the wastepaper basket in the Netherlands and in France, and that the Commission, despite everything, repeated only a few weeks ago that the spirit of this Constitution – whatever the citizen may think – should in any event remain intact. Listen to what I have to say about citizen involvement but do not, whatever you do, judge me by my actions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Incidentally, there is no reference in the document to the petition of a million European citizens about the travelling circus, swallowing up millions, that is the European Parliament. I know, strictly speaking, it should be the Council that should be lectured on this, but the Commission – which interferes in God knows what anyway and whose own budget, moreover, is being slated year after year by the Court of Auditors – could have sent out a signal about the fact that the European citizens are fed up to the back teeth with the Eurocrats’ squandering of money and enjoyment of privileges. We should no longer keep quiet about this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Then there is public opinion to consider. It is indisputable that the European citizens reject en masse the accession negotiations with Turkey – which is not a European country – and yet these negotiations are simply continued, undoubtedly also beyond December. This proves, in fact, that the so-called ‘open ending’ of the negotiations is nothing but total bunk and that the Eurocracy, including the Commission, decided a long time ago that the Turkish accession must, come what may, be rammed down the throats of these European citizens that have – or so they say – been listened to so well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to finish off with a final comment about an important matter, namely what is termed economic immigration and the idea that new immigrants must be attracted, which, if it was up to the Commission, would certainly not just be a handful of highly educated individuals. This view has just been confirmed by the President of the Commission himself. The absurdity of the idea that massive immigration of non-Europeans is economically profitable in order to alleviate the effects of the demographic situation in Europe has been demonstrated before.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The immigration that we have experienced first-hand is an immigration of people who cannot read or write, combined with religions and cultures that cannot be assimilated. Putting it bluntly, we are importing even more unemployment, even more rootlessness, along with the effects of this all, namely crime, run-down areas and de facto apartheid. This also involves enormous economic costs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For those reasons, and many others, I conclude that we can do no other than express our disapproval of this work programme that is so full of platitudes and good intentions that cannot be kept and in which the essential concerns of the European citizens are completely overlooked.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-208" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Manuel Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would firstly thank the honourable Members for their comments. Members do confirm that this is a more political programme, as recognised by Mrs Grossetête, whom I thank for her general support for the programme. Our objective is, indeed, to join with the other institutions, notably Parliament, in better targeting the priorities each year and placing them in the context of Europe’s overall efforts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since I cannot reply to all the specific questions, I shall reply at least to those that I think particularly important, beginning with the principle of annuality. This principle is not called into question. Far from it. We are establishing very clearly the 21 strategic initiatives for next year and committing ourselves not to withdraw any of them once they are under way. At the same time, however, we are offering Parliament and the other institutions the opportunity to acquaint themselves, in the course of the next six months, with what we are including in our programme and the opportunity to draw their conclusions in advance if the work is complete.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is a good example of the combination of flexibility and security. Secure in the knowledge of what may be done in the course of next year, you have increased flexibility which, in turn, means that Parliament can do a better job of setting out its programme. That is what we aim to achieve, and I also hope that it is in keeping with what you need in terms of your work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Schulz recognised a number of features from other programmes. True, there is a degree of continuity. We want to maintain an element of coherence. The work done by the Commission and by the other European institutions cannot consist in re-inventing the wheel each year. One of my country’s great thinkers said that in speaking the truth, one cannot be original every day. There is some truth in that. We are sticking to these objectives. We need to keep the pressure up and show great determination. The achievement of a large portion of these objectives does not depend simply on the Commission and Parliament. It also depends on the Member States. That is why we must continue to be coherent over time, and to be so in the interests of a Europe that is not only more competitive but also characterised by greater solidarity and by greater resolve on the world stage. In the light of this, there is indeed an element of continuity, which is also to be found in the motto ‘Unity in diversity’, referred to by Mr Jonckheer and other Members.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To reply specifically to Mr Schulz’s question, I would say, as I have already done to Mr Orban, that my idea is for the Commissioner appointed by Romania to assume responsibility not only for multilingualism but also for interculturalism in Europe, so supplementing the work done, under my direction, by the Bureau of European Policy Advisers (BEPA), which organises meetings on this subject. It is also what Commissioner Figel' does on the subjects of education and culture.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As soon as his appointment has been confirmed by the institutions, Mr Orban will therefore be given responsibility for multilingualism, which is a very important subject for Europe. It is by no means a ‘second class’ portfolio. When you think how many languages are used in the EU, a policy not only on multilingualism but also on interculturalism seems to be more and more necessary if we really want to respect the diversity of the EU. Dialogue between the various cultures needs to be established, and efforts made to integrate the different communities, without of course neglecting the minority communities within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe, therefore, that it is a highly important portfolio that will be entrusted to Mr Orban as soon as his candidacy has been approved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the question put by Mrs Koch-Mehrin, I accept, above all, the point on which we most agree, namely the need to go all out for less bureaucracy and more efficiency. This is not a mere statement of intent. At the meeting of the College that took place this very day, the Commission approved a reduction in the obligations imposed on small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe to supply statistics. Instead of asking them all to make the presentations designed for statistical purposes, we shall ask for information on a sampling basis and confine ourselves to requiring only a portion of the information otherwise available. I believe that this is a practical measure to reduce the administrative burden on our companies, and particularly on small and medium-sized companies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We shall, of course, study the proposals for combating climate change presented, in the person of Mr Jonckheer, by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Be assured that we want very much to continue to be a world leader on this issue, and we in the European Commission have, in particular, committed ourselves to strengthening the emissions trading system, to attaching more importance to renewable sources of energy and to working to achieve better levels of energy efficiency. Perhaps there will be a number of differences in terms of practical objectives, but I believe that there is a convergence of views between our institutions about the point of the actions to be taken and the ambition behind them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Regarding the issue of climate change, I want to tell you that, in our view, it is closely linked to the energy question. In this area, we do see the solid outlines of a possible accommodation between the concerns of those who, like yourselves, are more ambitious where the environment is concerned and those who are more ambitious when it comes to competitiveness. The two sets of concerns are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary. Contained therein are extraordinary economic opportunities for the Europe of tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the same way, I think that there is an opportunity to be seized in the area of innovation and, in this connection, I would particularly thank Mr Crowley for his support for the European Institute of Technology, which I think will be Europe’s workshop of the future. More and more, the work that needs to be done is that on combating climate change and on pursuing a coherent energy policy and a Europe that is not only more competitive but that also derives its strength from a sustainable economy marked by solidarity - all of which presupposes, of course, greater investment in innovation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I shall try to reply to the question put to me by Mrs Koch-Mehrin, who was wondering what was the main theme that drew everything together. At first sight, it is difficult to see the connection between such diverse areas. The common theme resides, however, in the objective of preparing Europeans to confront the age of globalisation; not to submit to it, but to face up to it; and not to see it as the end of Europe but, on the contrary, to have the courage to affirm our values and interests while, at the same time, helping - by means of our beliefs and our values of democracy, freedom and, indeed, solidarity - to shape that very globalisation and the future of the 21st century. Therein lies the common theme linking the areas of energy and climate change to the areas not only of justice and home affairs but also of innovation and education. That is our programme.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I too have great appreciation for the policy statement by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and I am delighted that he now has a grasp of Dutch. He can understand Dutch. The Commission President understands Dutch. I should like to make five comments with regard to the statement.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am delighted about his remark that Europe is more than just a market. When you say this, though, you also have to follow it through. This means to us – and we will be putting this request in the resolution – that you have to outline the consequences of the internal market on the European citizens. Once those consequences have been mapped out, it is possible to respond adequately.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to make a second remark by way of priority. The combination of work and family, more people within this labour market, is also one of the priorities in the Lisbon process. We would like to see more action on this score.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, a Green Paper on labour legislation is pending. We have seen this announced for a long time, but when exactly will it be issued?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Fifthly, I should like the Social Affairs Commissioner to attend more to all matters that are still outstanding in the Council, namely posting of workers, working hours legislation, but also the mobility of pensions, which I happen to know leads to major problems and to which a number of improvements are now being made at Commission level too. We as a group in Parliament are happy to have further discussions with you on these matters.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have taken note of what the President of the Commission has had to say about the new Commission, particularly about the new Commissioner, Mr Orban, and I have to tell him that a certain amount of clarification is still called for, not least in consultation with Commissioner Figel’, as regards, among other things, the question of who is to have responsibility for dialogue between cultures and religions, although it has to be said that this sort of expansion goes some way towards meeting the expectations of Social Democrats like ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, and still on the same subject, we will of course be asking the new Commissioners about their commitment to the programme for a social Europe and to solidarity, to which you have made reference. It is because the Commission is a collegial body that we will be questioning all new Commissioners as to their actual commitment to this social Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, Mr President of the Commission, there is growth and social security; you were right to describe this as a political programme, and important steps have indeed been taken in this direction, but let me give you two examples of where we see progress as being needed. The energy sector, for example – although Commissioner Piebalgs appears not to be here – is an important factor in terms of growth and job creation, but when a Head of Government asks how we are meant to run a single European energy policy when everything is geared to liberalisation and nothing else, then that is when the Commission must establish a political framework for the European energy policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">If I may turn to the trans-European networks, indirect reference has, today, been made to your having at one time been very much in favour of using measures taken by the individual countries as a means of pressing on with coordination, and it is this coordinating role that I would ask you to exercise. I would also emphasise once more that we see solidarity as the principal objective of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commission, fellow Members, ladies and gentlemen, I intend to devote my speaking time to three elements of the Commission’s work programme, namely global competitiveness, green growth and energy. All three of these issues are crucial dimensions of a competitive Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Firstly, then, global competitiveness. Europe’s future lies in competing at the cutting edges of research with quality and with skill. Only in that way can we retain the European model. The Seventh Framework Programme is therefore the most important document on industrial policy for many years. I am afraid I have to say that there is to some degree a lack of drive in this work programme. It is a good and important thing to engage in space exploration, but where are the ambitions in relation to the medical industry? Why is IT mentioned only in the context of IT crime? If I were to express one wish, it would be for a more cohesive strategic plan to enable us to compete in the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Secondly, the environment and growth. All too often, when documents such as this are presented, one gets the feeling that the environment and growth are somehow mutually opposed. I am convinced that this is not so, something that I think is proved through the work of REACH. In the next few decades, the world will be forced to do something about the climate issue. This will involve new technology for saving energy, new technology to power cars and so on. There will be an enormous market for environmentally friendly technology and for energy-efficient products. That is where our European companies should be. I therefore wish that, over the next year, the Commission might devote more energy to developing environment-driven growth.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Thirdly, energy. Europe’s competitiveness stands or falls according to whether or not it has a secure and economically feasible energy supply.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is easier to fight for your principles than to live up to them, but I hope that the Commission manages to do the latter when it comes to global competitiveness, green growth and a secure and sustainable energy supply.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to point out to the Commissioner that we are going to have to carry on talking about old and new Member States for as long as we have the transition periods to which my colleague, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten referred.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I was also very pleased to hear Mr Barroso talking about dealing with unscrupulous employers. I assume by that he means those employers who keep people in conditions approaching slavery, pay them extremely badly and exploit them, with this applying, of course, not just to those who employ not only third-country nationals but also EU nationals, as we have been hearing about recently. I assume that measure will be part of driving up job quality, as we have talked about so often, by getting rid of low-quality, poorly paid employment, and I look forward to seeing that mentioned more explicitly in the Commission’s programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">As others have said, we are very pleased to see as well this continued mention of sustainable development and linkage with climate change, which is something we have long argued for, and I agree entirely with what Mrs Ek was saying about environmentally-driven growth. We therefore look forward to the action plan on sustainable production and consumption next year, which we assume will be a move forward in terms of eco-efficiency and in spelling out how we are to decouple environmental damage from growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also look forward to the stocktaking social reality document, which is extremely important as regards benchmarks of wellbeing. We assume this will also include environmental factors, given that we know that the poorest people often live in the poorest and most degraded environments and housing, with the effects that has on mental health.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would rather have seen a framework directive on social services, but will nevertheless be looking to see whether the proposals brought forward also take into account the effects of existing European legislation on the future of services.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we would have welcomed something that picked up on the sustainable development strategy as regards the issue of targeted training for professions in helping to meet climate change requirements. If you cannot fit solar panels and cannot repair your energy systems, you are not going to meet your climate change targets.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, reading the legislative programme and listening to the presentation of the Commission’s work for 2007, we can but conclude that we are in for more of the same; more of the same neoliberalism, which is undermining social and labour rights, which is making work more unstable, which is returning to old methods of exploitation, which is promoting the liberalisation of services, including public services, leaving no one in any doubt as to the intentions behind what is referred to as the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the name of flexibility, the completion of the internal market and globalisation, employment contracts are being trampled underfoot, and there is a danger of more multinational company relocations, as in the case of GM Opel in Azambuja, Johnson Controls in Nelas and Portalegre, and Lear in Valongo, to name but a few of the most serious cases currently threatening thousands of workers in Portugal, where unemployment is already very high following redundancies in the textile, clothing and footwear industries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is these unemployed workers who are now at the mercy of temporary employment agencies and other unscrupulous bosses, as in the recent cases we have heard about in the media of hungry and penniless Portuguese workers in the south of the Netherlands. Is this the social responsibility of business in action? At the same time, in the name of the single currency and price stability, the European Central Bank regularly raises interest rates and governments use the Stability and Growth Pact to undermine manufacturing, hinder social development, undermine micro and small enterprises and create a culture that is conducive to the shameful exploitation of emigrant and immigrant workers and their families.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore stress the need for a sea change away from these neoliberal policies. The time has come to prioritise social development and welfare policies and I should like to call for solidarity in the case of hungry, exploited Portuguese workers such as those in the south of the Netherlands whose cases have just come to light.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, European integration is just part of the solution to the question of economic growth in Europe. The Member States themselves, making their own decisions relating to public finance and economic reform, have a key role to play here.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this respect we have many examples of good practice. The success of domestic reforms in some countries has allowed them to quickly absorb enlargement in 2004 and to adopt the principles of the common market in all areas. The success of countries such as Ireland, Finland, Holland or Great Britain has allowed these countries to regard world competition more calmly.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the other hand, a social model based on rigid and short working time, and on avoiding competition not just at a global level but at the level of the common market is the road to social and economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This political and economic alignment of forces within Europe gives me serious doubts as to whether the oft-mentioned Constitutional Treaty is a good solution to our economic pains. It will give those countries which are less adept at resolving their internal problems increasing influence on EU affairs. We will lose the balance between different models and restrict competition between systems. This diagnosis of the alignment of forces has come as a result of the debates on services, working time and worker delegation. Speaking figuratively, I am worried by a treaty which as regards legislative and regulatory matters will give us less Britain and more Germany and France.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Of all the activities the Commission plans to undertake in 2007, the most important to me are those in respect of better regulation. It is a disgrace that an organisation that has for 50 years given voice to the four basic freedoms enshrined in its treaties, today costs business EUR 600 billion per year. And it is an even greater disgrace that despite the agreements made in the last year, it has been impossible to reduce red tape and or to improve European law.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I hope that 2007 will mark a breakthrough in this respect. However, this will not happen if we cannot honestly answer questions about the reasons for this failure in 2006. How is it that proposals for streamlining, codification and unifying European law face resistance? And who is resisting them? Where are the Gordian knots that we have not managed to cut?</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would very much like to hear an answer to these questions today.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, legal certainty means that the exercise of power and the administration of justice can be anticipated on the basis of legal rules. It is clear from its legislative and work programme for 2007 that the Commission expects the draft Constitution to be implemented. This is despite the fact that large majorities in the Netherlands and in France have rejected the draft. The struggle between the political establishment and the peoples of Europe continues apace, then.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The European project is on a dangerous road. The European Court of Justice will lose its legitimacy as a result of the arrogant attitude it displays towards the popularly elected governments of the Member States. The Court of Justice is, in reality, a self-appointed power in Europe. It chose to declare itself the guardian of the principle of the separation of powers even before the Amsterdam Summit of 1998. It did this without any democratic or political basis whatsoever. The Court of Justice has also made clear to the national courts that they cannot regard themselves as independent, but rather that they represent the extended arm of the Court of Justice, through which it performs its judicial activism.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would therefore call on the Members of this House to think things over before it is too late. The EU does not need more concentration of power with no democratic basis. The EU needs competition, not just between companies on the market in order to create better products, but between countries in order to come up with sound political solutions to the problems of the day.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission will review the operation of the single market, and about time too. I hope that the Commission will read the report by the Conseil d’Analyse Economique, a high-powered economic committee of the French Government chaired by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin. That report says ‘economic integration has stagnated and no longer promotes growth’. It says that the euro’s creation has not produced the knock-on benefits expected. Then it gets serious: ‘We are convinced that the situation we describe is perilous’. It says that poor economic performance is driving away investment and damaging employment and social provision and it speaks of ‘a manifest exhaustion with Community procedures threatening to trigger a vicious circle which will unravel the acquis communautaire’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope the Commission will note the estimate by its own Vice-President, Günter Verheugen, who says that the costs of excessive regulation in the single market amount to EUR 600 billion a year. That is nearly four times the Commission’s own estimate of the trade benefits from the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">In a recent UK study of more than 1000 CEOs commissioned by the think-tank Open Europe, a clear majority felt that the EU was doing more harm than good and that Britain should renegotiate its relationship with Europe to something more like a free- trade deal. The position is very clear: Europe’s share of world trade is shrinking fast. Membership is costing far more than any benefits it offers. EU regulation and the EU social model are doing huge economic damage. The EU is making us poorer and less democratic and less free – and we have had enough of it!</p>

      <p sl="de">I think, Mr Schulz, that we may have a semantic problem here. For me, the market means meeting customers’ needs and providing a range of services and products that the public actually buy. That is my understanding of the market. That, I think, is why your speech received so much applause. We must not design the European single market and determine what we offer on it in future without taking into account the needs of the public.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second thing – and it is something I see as very important – is the energy issue. Energy – together with agriculture – is going to be one of the big issues full stop. We will need more initiatives to be taken on the renewable energy front, and, on the food front – considering the way prosperity is on the increase in China, India and many other countries around the world – we will need a lot of energy for new and relatively high-quality foods. We see the opening up of markets on the international level as having absolute priority. We should be creating new openings for our farmers and food producers to sell their products in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moving on to the CO2 debate, I would like to ask what we are supposed to do when a barrel of crude oil sells in Russia for 8 dollars – and to heavy industry, too – whereas here one has to fork out anything up to 80 dollars and emission trading also means that we have to pay the CO2 levy, so that our energy – and hence our raw materials industries – are subject to double taxation? How, this being so, are we supposed to keep jobs in Europe?</p>
      <p sl="de">A debate on the subject of these disparities on the market is urgently called for – and in the sphere of foreign policy too. We will indeed see whether Russia allows its neighbours to pay the same prices as it charges at home; this will make for exciting debates in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">From the employment and social standpoint, I find this work programme very disappointing. Yet again we are promised little more than a raft of Green and White Papers and communications, recycling the same old material. We are about to get a Green Paper on labour law that lists questions that were put and answered ten years ago by Allan Larsson while he was the Commission’s Director-General for Employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The communication hails flexicurity as a means of realising opportunities offered by European labour markets. In reality, it has been shown to have no positive meaning for working people. For millions flexicurity is a weasel word, a codeword for exploitation, insecurity and uncertainty. We need an EU legislative framework to tackle unfair and exploitative employment and quasi-employment relationships. All workers in all regions deserve access to decent work to give them and their families the chance of a decent life.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, social Europe is at a standstill. The last piece of EU legislation in the social field was adopted over three years ago. The Commission’s lack of ambition reflects its own imbalanced policy perspective. Better regulation means no legislation in the social field but also reflects the poor prospects for any proposal in the Employment Council. Employment ministers need to begin to play a positive role and they could start by doing something positive on working time and temporary agency work. Lisbon promised more and better quality jobs. What has been done to deliver that promise for working people? Precious little.</p>

We want to make it a priority to bring people who are excluded into the job market, elderly and disabled people included. That is why the 2000 Employment Directive should be fully implemented. But we must do more, especially as 2007 is the European Year of Equal Opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I welcome the Commission’s commitment to cutting down on unnecessary legislation. That is why I ask the Commission to reaffirm its intention to withdraw the Temporary Agency Workers Directive and also to consider separating the issue of calculating what is considered as working time where someone is on call, from that of the individual opt-out from the Working Time Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we are really to achieve growth and competitiveness, legislation should only be brought forward in the employment field if it cannot successfully be enacted at local or national level. In the field of health and safety it should brought forward only if scientific and medical evidence prove the need for it, as is the case for an amendment to the 2000 Biological Agents Directive to protect workers from needlestick injuries and contracting hepatitis or HIV.

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I wish to comment on three points in the European Commission's programme on employment. The first relates to the Commission proposal to encourage the creation of common principles to strengthen job flexibility and security. The Commission even notes that this combination has been recognised as a necessity. By whom has it been recognised? Obviously by the employers who approve the framework of the pure market. However, no one should cite the workers, because it is they who suffer from minimum working times, breaches of working times and flexibility of the market.</p>
      <p sl="el">My second comment concerns the question of immigration. The Commission says that, because the needs of the market have increased, immigrants need to be approached. That is exactly the message which the exploiters are waiting for in order to import cheap labour and use it to 'break' domestic markets and reduce wages. Immigrants should not be used as battering rams, but as people with the same rights alongside local workers.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, as with the directive on the liberalisation of services, the same with the Commission programme: the workers and citizens are not suffering from a problem of reduced perception, as some have said; they simply disagree and no one should misinterpret that.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party. The Commission communication on competitiveness is a necessary step towards implementing policies aimed at improving the Union’s economic performance in the global context and within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy. It is important, as proposed, to create a framework encouraging technological development, innovation and support for the area of industry that, through research and development, is capable of expanding the EU's competitiveness in the more innovative sectors.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore support the proposals for the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the new generation of cohesion programmes and the guide to innovation proposed by Commissioner Hübner, which encourage the regions to focus more closely on development, and which, I hope, will provide sufficient information and support to allow our smallest and most vulnerable enterprises to respond to the new energy and commercial challenges in the international environment. In fact, I believe that is fundamental to support a key factor in the European economy: small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular those in manufacturing, which are, by nature, less inclined to innovation and more vulnerable to the globalisation of the economy.</p>
      <p sl="it">While I welcome the adoption of good internal practices, I also believe that it is essential for small and medium-sized enterprises to be suitably protected, above all in the area of international trade, particularly in connection with markets that exploit unfair competition and often do not reject practices that damage workers’ rights and at times even violate children’s rights to childhood.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to address the Commission with some thoughts and suggestions. Since within Europe there is a desire for Europe, I believe that the responses that people expect are those of a strong Europe that is able to provide, to direct and to propose. This is the main reason why I believe that we need to put across a clearer summary of the truly significant propositions of our programmes. Furthermore, I believe that the Commission, Parliament and the Council are making quite good progress, having succeeded, in recent years, in delivering a series of directives and regulations responding to the demands for quality of the environment, quality of life and greater integration.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are, nonetheless, important areas of European and international policy on which we must be more adventurous. These areas have been pointed out to us in many of the speeches made today: the environment, energy, employment, security and immigration. A common thread runs through all of these topics, that of equal opportunities for all: for young people facing the world of work, who have a level of training that differs too much across the various Member States, and equal opportunities for women, who, in this old Europe, have not yet managed to attain the equality to which they are entitled even in the world of work.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In the field of the ecology-energy partnership, which the Commission is extremely keen to see put in place and which Parliament will most certainly support, we need to give some thought in advance to the resources required for bringing this about. These do not amount solely to that capacity in terms of competence that the Constitution would supposedly have given us, but also to capacity in budgetary and taxation terms. The Commission needs therefore to lose no time in setting to work on revising the financial perspective so that this exercise is not simply compensatory but is marked by an ambition equal to what is at stake for the European Union in the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of the 21 strategic initiatives, only one falls within the competence of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs: the idea of a communication – a further one – on social services of general interest. There is not a word about the proposal you withdrew from the Commission’s work agenda – a move unanimously condemned by Parliament. I am talking about the withdrawal of the proposal on mutuality. Ask Mr Barroso what has become of the initiative in this area. Parliament is awaiting a proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the area of financial markets, the exercise we are involved in is a dialogue between institutions. We had made some definite and practical requests concerning micro-credits, alternative funds and rating agencies. The Commission proposals have nothing to say about these subjects.</p>

      <p sl="es">In other words, the Union, and the European Commission, need legislative priorities and budgetary priorities that are in unison.

      <p sl="es">I shall end by mentioning the budgetary principles laid out by the European Parliament for the conditions for releasing the reserve for European Commission staff posts in 2007.

      <p sl="es">I would like to say to the Commission, which is here today — I regret that the Vice-Chairman of our Committee on Budgetary Control is not here and I thank Mr Almunia for listening — that unless we spend properly, the Council will continue to reduce the budget and we will end up without any Community policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">If your work programme says nothing about controlling the Europeans’ money, what will happen in the end? We will not even reach the 1% threshold. Next year we will have 0.9% of the budget and we will end up with no Community policies in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">Get your act together please. State that we want to spend well, better than the Member States, that we want to put the Member States in a position in which that can say that they agree with the way spending is carried out. The citizens must be aware that, if money is spent badly, it is not just the Commission’s fault, but also the fault of the Member States, of the agents.</p>
      <p sl="es">Let us get our act together, let us do something, not just for transparency, but for good spending.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by following the chairman of my group, Mr Schulz, and highlighting something Mr Barroso said to the effect that, ‘without solidarity, the internal market will not come into being’. He got that absolutely right, and it comes up again in the text of the work programme, in which the Commission commits itself – and I quote: to ‘the delivery of an active policy agenda focusing on citizens' expectations and needs’. That is precisely what is needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not, however, enough simply to keep on saying that; it also has to be brought to life. It is evident to me, from looking at the measures, that the ones that really matter in the internal market are not there, particularly those needed for the protection of consumers. The term ‘consumer protection’ is nowhere to be found. Now you are looking to appoint a new Commissioner to handle it. Does that mean that you want to have a rethink or a closer look and see to it that consumer protection really is put centre stage in policy? If you do, that is something that really will get across to the European public.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also note the lack of any progress towards harmonisation in European policy that might point to the Member States sharing in it, that might indicate an opening-up of borders in the services market and elsewhere, for these things need to be tackled with much more vigour than they have been, and there is plenty left to do on those fronts.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, the most important thing is that the primary competence should be political. You are always talking about impact assessments, but what sort of impact assessment should be carried out? Any impact assessment should also take into account social life, gender policy and other areas as well.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, there is a tendency for all speakers to consider their issue as the most important in the debate. As we are talking about the European Commission's legislative and work programme, I wish to say – as I shall be referring to regional development – that we shall not have very important issues to debate next year.</p>
      <p sl="el">This year we passed the legislation and the major challenge for the European Commission is for this legislation to be applied correctly. We need to start the application of programmes promptly, so that the appropriations are taken up and, more importantly, European taxpayers' money is used for the benefit of social and economic cohesion. This is the major endeavour and Parliament wants to participate actively in this endeavour, which we must jointly make together with the Member States and the regions. We shall be present, therefore, to control what the European Commission is doing. Within this framework, the fourth report on cohesion which the European Commission is to present and which we are awaiting will obviously also be important.</p>
      <p sl="el">Within the framework of the purely legislative initiative, there is the question of the Solidarity Fund; in other words, the fund which covers problems which arise from natural and technological disasters. Here we have finished the first reading, but there is an unjustified delay in the Council. The old regulation is out of date and the European Union needs to demonstrate its solidarity in the areas affected, especially when we are talking about major disasters, because that is how it gets closer to its citizens. The Commission, therefore, needs to stand by Parliament. We need together to convince the Council which, for some reason – perhaps because the Ministers of Finance, who are competent, do not want to give any more money – does not understand the need for us to proceed further. We are therefore waiting for tangible proof from the European Commission.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the legislation that applies to the European Union as a whole needs to be based on an analysis of where we are, which of the measures that have already been taken have been effective, and what new measures are needed for us to achieve the targets that have been jointly set. This sort of approach is vital in environmental policy in order that we can focus on those matters that require swifter attention than any of the others.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The European Commission promised to put forward a proposal to revise the Sixth Environment Action Programme this year. We have not received one. It is not included in next year’s Action Plan either. It would nevertheless be a concrete instrument for specifically evaluating where we are and what should be done in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Commission says that it intends to examine the Environmental Technologies Action Plan next year. That is good. We also, however, need to look at areas other than developments in energy technology. One challenge we face is legislation on chemicals. Harmful chemicals need to be replaced with new, safe ones, and for that we need technology. We need technology to find solutions to air quality. We need new technology for material efficiency, and in this way we will also be able to redeem our promise of improved competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, there is a time for words and there is a time for action. I think that quite a number of those who have spoken this afternoon, on various subjects, have demonstrated the absolute necessity for the European Commission to take action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We want more innovation, more security, more solidarity and more competitiveness, and I am disappointed to see that the text presented to us by the Commission includes just a few lines on what is certainly the main heading in the European Union's budget, given that the 2007-2013 financial perspective allocates EUR 308 billion to the Structural Funds. However, if we want to provide real answers for ourselves and for our fellow citizens, with the Member States and with the various players, we need to make good use of the tools provided by the financial measures included in the Structural Funds, amounting, as I said, to EUR 308 billion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What, therefore, is the issue for 2007? Are we going to use the billions at our disposal to give our fellow Europeans real answers in the context of the regulations we adopted in this very House in July, or, mired in administrative mazes and in many and varied problems, are we going to reach 31 December 2007 without having got much further forward? I and my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development brought these matters up with Mrs Hübner; we are disappointed that the Commission's document before us today pays hardly any attention to how the Commission intends to set out to achieve its objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We want these objectives to take particular account of circumstances in the new Member States, which will receive funds but will also need to be in a position to use those funds wisely. We have made proposals, as Mrs Hübner knows, and we are now waiting for practical responses to help these countries to use this money properly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is another point that I, as chairman of the Urban Housing Intergroup, must obviously not neglect: how can towns and cities act as a real driving force in a Europe that needs to be more competitive and more innovative? On this matter, too, we are waiting for further action from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, on behalf of my colleague Mr Davies, who cannot be here because he is at another meeting, I would like to say to the Commissioners that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is partly satisfied with the proposals on the environment, but that, as in the case of the previous point on the Structural Funds, we expect practical implementation – we expect action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, Commissioners, we have no complaints about your communication skills, but we now expect practical action.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it is evident that the Commission is pressing on with the policy that deeply divided European society last year. Were the riots in the suburbs of Paris not warning enough? Having seen them, we in Europe surely cannot continue with a policy that writes off some members of our society. How, having had this experience, is it possible that the Commission should seek, in the new work programme, to address social issues quite separately from the growth strategy? Why is it abandoning the former consensus according to which social inclusion policy was part of the Lisbon Strategy and hence an expression of social cohesion?</p>
      <p sl="de">Are we, in future, to have a state of affairs in which everyone will no longer be allowed, irrespective of where they live or of their social status, to share in Europe's economic successes and in its prosperity? Our group does not accept such a thing. It does not accept that people such as those in the banlieues of Paris should no longer be allowed to benefit from Europe’s strategy for prosperity, for a policy of social division will demand a high price from all of us.</p>
      <p sl="de">The work programme, lamentably, perpetuates this general trend. As well as the one-sided Lisbon Strategy, the Gothenburg strategy is also to be treated in isolation, with economic growth being treated as having higher priority than sustainable development in what is a completely backward-looking policy that represents the selling out of our living resources and amounts to writing off our rural areas, thus abandoning the interconnection of our economic, social and environmental goals.</p>
      <p sl="de">How does the Commission justify using ear-marking within the structural funds as a means of taking money away from territorial cohesion and sustainable development for all regions and making policy only for prosperous cities and thriving economic hubs, while many European regions, the young people in the banlieues, and their counterparts in rural areas, are treated as less important?</p>
      <p sl="de">That will not do. Sustainable development must be brought back to the heart of European politics.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, I thank our Commissioners for the work we do with them – often constructive, often with great thought, often with what I hope is constructive criticism. I say to the Commissioners that we look forward to what they are going to be doing in the coming year, although perhaps I could start with what they are not going to be doing, because it would be helpful to hear from them again a new list of steps that they are not going to take. We have had the first tranche of that as part of the Lisbon Agenda. We would like to know a little more about where the Commission is pulling back so that it can concentrate on the things that really matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">Linked to that, in terms of better legislation, we look forward to the development of environmental and health impact assessments in such a way that they are seen to, and really do, contain an element of independent assessment. I would suggest that we need a panel of independent experts, not a new building or agency, but people on whom we can call to help to ensure that the impact assessments are effective. I believe we would also want to ensure that the agencies for which we are responsible are efficient and effective. There are some key ones in health, medicines and food safety which need sustaining. They are mostly new ones and doing good work. I would like to see prioritisation between agencies as well as good support for those that we cover. We would want to see proper enforcement as well. So perhaps the package is to do less than we have done in the past, but to do what we do even better.</p>
      <p sl="en">In our committee we look to the work in the health sector. We have seen that prosperity is not an alternative to wellbeing. Healthy people and a healthy environment are prerequisites for healthy economic growth, competitiveness and jobs. We want to see more work to improve health promotion, collaboration between health services, not only on patient mobility, patient safety and the new areas of mental health, but also on continuing areas such as flu preparedness.</p>
      <p sl="en">The environment goes hand-in-hand with growth and jobs. Eco-innovation is a major component in winning the fight against global warming. I certainly call on the Commission to lead initiatives in the post-Kyoto process outside the European Union, developing the ‘green diplomacy’ concept.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having recently been in Gaza and seen the devastation to people in the hospitals there, we urge that, with the new opportunities coming from the appointment of the new Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, the European Union should work closely with that authority and the Israelis to stop what is happening in Gaza and to promote real reconciliation and peace.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The legislative programme before us today is just a quiet renewal of the programmes for previous years. Even so, I find it quite remarkable that the Commission has not said a single word on two major reforms on which it is currently working, namely the review of the financial perspective and the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy. These are politically very difficult issues, but we cannot just ignore them. The fact that the constitutional, budgetary and agricultural debates are all taking place in 2007 means that the institutions really need to prepare themselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the reduction in administrative costs set out by the Commission, the vision of European policy that underlies it is, in general, very simplistic and penny-pinching – it is a short-term vision from which our political priorities will suffer. Instead, we should reconsider whether the resources, particularly in terms of staff, provided to the Commission are adequate for the implementation of the policies we are seeking to promote.</p>
      <p sl="fr">True, the solutions proposed by the Commission in its citizens' agenda are based on the idea of a proactive political programme targeted at the needs and expectations of Europeans. Unfortunately, though, I cannot now find in this document any specific or new proposals for how to achieve the objectives of this programme. The same is true of the Lisbon Strategy, which we are told has been relaunched. I cannot share your optimism. Finally, let us not forget that, every year, the overall budget allocated in fact contradicts the document that you are presenting to us today and distorts the political will demonstrated and voted on by our Parliament. Does this document today not ultimately come down to words and pious hopes?</p>

New energy efficiency technologies such as hydrogen, fusion, LED light, and solar and wind power are important, for example. Energy consumption in Europe is growing, even though it should be falling. We cannot live like this. The high cost of energy hits the poorest. In my view, the Commission should establish a social programme for the supply of energy for our poorest citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is said that without solidarity there will be no Union. I suggest introducing a barometer to gauge solidarity throughout the EU. In addition to the results of opinion polls and internal market infringement proceedings, Eurostat and the Commission should publish a wider comparative evaluation of the Member States. We need to find out openly and simply and in comparative format to what extent countries are fulfilling their promises – in other words, how much solidarity there is between us. The schemers should be penalised. Is the publication of a solidarity barometer appropriate and necessary? What does Commission Vice-President Wallström think? It might at least help the public understand better what is going on. It is important that we get the framework programme on research and development through, and certain other programmes as well.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I wished to stress how strange it is that there are no concrete legislative proposals for a common policy such as the Common Fisheries Policy. The fact that the Commission’s document takes a very horizontal view of the priorities cannot be used as an excuse for the lack of commitment to a policy which furthermore is at a crucial moment both internally and internationally.</p>
      <p sl="es">Fishing management is going to be affected – it already is – by a whole series of measures, programmes and policies that respond to the Union’s very diverse commitments within the framework of the Law of the Sea, the Johannesburg Summit, sustainable development, environmental strategies, climate change and biodiversity, amongst other things. Within this context, the Commission’s general attitude to the fisheries policy is marked by a surprising lack of legislative activity, a lack of political impulse and lack of ambitions and commitments in the face of these challenges.</p>
      <p sl="es">Legislative activity in the field of fisheries is increasingly focussed on routine matters and minor day-to-day modifications, and on the rare occasion when the big outstanding issues are dealt with, they are dealt with by means of mere communications with no legislative weight, as in the case of discarded catches, or which come extremely late, as in the case of eco-labelling, or which are at risk of fading to nothing, like the proposal on the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="es">This gives the impression that, faced with the challenges I have mentioned, the fisheries policy has chosen to remain at the lowest possible level and allow itself to be led by the priorities of other policies, ignoring the fact that fisheries has a lot to say.</p>
      <p sl="es">Madam President, in order to deal specifically with certain matters which remain outstanding and which are extremely urgent, we would call upon the Commission to make immediate rigorous and coordinated legislative proposals on undeclared and unregulated illegal fishing.</p>

The Commission is going to make two decisive proposals with regard to the immigration of manual workers and of highly skilled workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are absolutely opposed to accepting undeclared, exploited workers. We therefore also need to provide legal immigration routes for people looking for work. The plan is for the European Parliament simply to be consulted, but we would like to obtain commitments, so that we can be fully involved and our voice can be heard in the discussions on these two decisive directives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also welcome your proposal to set minimum penalties for employers who exploit immigrants by forcing them to work illegally.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My group recently went to the Puglia region in Italy, where hundreds of immigrants have been reduced to slavery on agricultural holdings. As we are all aware, this is not just an Italian problem: the enslavement of thousands of people is a problem throughout the European Union. We are therefore calling for common provisions to protect immigrants' rights in work, for uniform penalties for exploiting illegal labour and for support for employers who regularise the status of their workers.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, two years ago the European Parliament gave Mr Barroso’s Commission the green light, but only after he pledged to make fundamental rights a top priority. However, it seems that Mr Barroso – who unfortunately is no longer here – forgot his pledge the very next day, because fundamental rights have disappeared altogether from the strategic objectives. The work programme for 2007 lacks vision, ambition and courage in this respect, which is very cynical in the year of equal opportunities. Better lawmaking is a good thing, but we actually need more action on fundamental rights, not less.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament has repeatedly called for a horizontal directive banning all forms of discrimination. We called for urgent action against discrimination against homosexuals and against rampant homophobia. None of this is in the work programme. Why are human rights not the centrepiece of the Union’s external policies?</p>
      <p sl="de">Security is indeed a priority, but not the selling-out of democracy and civil liberties. Measures are being taken in backroom deals that are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny or judicial review. They are neither proportionate nor effective, and citizens are increasingly defenceless against abuse and mistakes by the authorities. Where are the Commission proposals addressing this issue and aimed at resetting the balance?</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, on democracy and transparency, the Commission floated proposals for a European PNR policy and positive profiling at an informal gathering of ministers, so how is it that these proposals do not feature in this official document? And why is the Commission going along with the Council in informal get-togethers on security policy, such as the ones on 16 August or with the US last week?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, my speech follows on seamlessly from what Mrs in 't Veld said. You may recall the exciting plenary debates that accompanied this Commission’s appointment. After all, in his speech, in which President Barroso asked for the confidence of this Parliament for his team, he referred to the much-debated nomination of Mr Buttiglione and he said – and I quote:</p>
      <p sl="nl">‘However, one good thing will have come out of this unfortunate incident: it has highlighted the importance we attach to decisive political action by the European Union in the fight against all forms of discrimination. For this Commission, civil rights and an anti-discrimination approach will be top priorities.’</p>
      <p sl="nl">A group of Commissioners that would mount concerted action against discrimination was said to be on its way, and I should like to know how often this group meets, what is on their agenda and what has, in fact, been achieved so far. Why have you not yet floated any proposals, as was suggested here a moment ago, to raise the scope of the directive for equal treatment irrespective of sexual orientation, religion or conviction, age or disability to the level of the Race Directive, since the latter does not only cover the labour market, but also the provision of goods and services?</p>
      <p sl="nl">After all, could you, Madam President, perhaps explain to me why, according to European guidelines, a black heterosexual man may not be discriminated against when he applies for a loan from a bank or when he rents a house, but a homosexual man, to all intents and purposes, can? On 16 January, Commissioner Frattini said that he wanted this straightened out, but that the Commission would not propose it because it would not attain the required unanimity in the Council of Ministers.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Well, Madam President, that is not leadership. Will the Commission in future only make proposals if the Council is already in agreement? This is the wrong way round, in my opinion. Moreover, we should capitalise on the increased openness displayed by the Council of Ministers. The Member States should own up to the fact that they are opposed to equal treatment. Let a cross-border, public debate take place on this subject, because I would be interested to see whether Commissioner Wallström would agree with me that only then would Europe come nearer to the citizen.</p>
      <p sl="nl">2007 is the year of equal opportunities, and it appears to me that, as a result, we have no time to lose. Since the Commission has not yet done a great deal in this area, I wanted to make the life of the European Commission a little easier. I have already put a proposal for a new directive on paper on your behalf. That way, there will be no more excuses. It is now up to Mr Frattini to translate Commissioner Barroso’s fine words from October 2004 into action, and I will presently hand the proposal for a directive to the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I note that the Commission’s strategy has changed: before, we used to have such sound proposals, now, even these have disappeared. President Barroso’s speech leaves us very concerned. In fact, as regards the Commission’s priorities for action in 2007, we feel that there is a lack of drive by the Commission to ensure that a practical common policy on immigration is launched. Simply acknowledging that we need to marry security and solidarity does not strike me as a positive legislative principle for 2007. It seems a somewhat empty statement, void of real meaning, which does not contribute to building a genuine policy on legal immigration safeguarding economic immigration and abandoning the current prohibitionist approach that is leading more and more people to their deaths in the Mediterranean or in the Atlantic Ocean, and is encouraging more and more migrants to arrive illegally on our territory and to remain here illegally.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the Commission should provide real drive, by proposing a policy on legal entry to our territory. In my opinion, it is not enough to state that security is a priority, although this may well be true: we also need to agree on what security means. I believe that Europeans should be reassured of the fact that there will be no more illegal flights by the CIA in Europe, that European citizens and asylum seekers will no longer be kidnapped, and that the systematic checks on Europeans will be dropped – I refer to SWIFT, to PNR and to data retention.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, when discussing security, I believe that, first of all, Europeans should be reassured that their rights are being protected. I do not think that the Commission’s efforts are heading in that direction.</p>

My submission is that the hidden agenda and programme for 2007 will include a resurrection of the constitution, that slain vampire, after a small blood transfusion. The nationals of those countries who rejected it will be told to vote again because they did not understand that it was compulsory.</p>

I also note a proposal from the Council to improve cooperation between EU police and security forces. This contains a proposal about sharing information at European level, including sharing with Europol. This has been questioned and resisted before. It is an infringement of the rights of British nationals, some of whom already have an EU criminal record for plane-spotting.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating the Commission on its intention to reduce the administrative burden by 25%. This is a very important objective, and I would advise you to be as practical as possible in pursuing it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the Netherlands, we have now managed to bring about a 25% reduction, but communication with businesses and citizens has resulted in continued complaints about far too much bureaucracy. The citizens and businesses did not feel much of the effects, because the reduction was mainly at macro level. At micro level, however, bureaucracy persists. I can think of a very simple way of solving this problem, for example, by raising the bottom threshold in public tenders.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I live in a village of 25 000 people where a new swimming pool is being built that, in accordance with European rules, must be put out to tender, with all the red tape that this involves. Is this really necessary, or could we not raise the lower limit a little so that it is only really important projects, where real international competition is needed, that fall under this rule?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Turning to impact assessment, we in the European Parliament have repeatedly demanded this, and that it should be comprehensive, including fresh legislation, comitology that affects citizens and businesses, and soft law. After all, an increasing number of issues are being regulated using soft law, which may trigger an administrative burden of its own.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, we have repeatedly said that we would like the quality of this impact assessment to be subject to an independent review. So far, we have seen a great deal from the Commission in this respect, but none of it was satisfactory. We want this independent review, since this can also generate more transparency. It is, of course, a step in the right direction that this should under Mr Barroso’s presidency, be brought within the Commission’s remit, but, since there is no transparency within the Commission, I fear that we will be waging a bureaucratic trench war between the office that falls within Mr Barroso remit and the Commission offices that are required to draw up the impact assessment.</p>

      <p sl="de">It is clear to me that soft law instruments appear – at first sight, at any rate – to fit better into the ‘better regulation’ agenda, but it has to be said that such instruments are neither enforceable nor binding and will end up as sources of even more disappointment for the public and for businesses.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to highlight on the basis of my own working experience a number of things that I find lacking in the work and legislative programme, namely initiatives that the Commission has promised in other contexts, but are not to be found here, such as the standardisation of the consumer protection acquis, the term of protection of copyright, further developments in patent law and the applicability of EU law in sport. The ECJ has produced a new ruling that fundamentally changes the position in this area and makes for greater legal uncertainty in it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Together with the first batch of initiatives to be withdrawn, the statute for mutual societies and the statute for a European law governing associations went back as well, and, in the debate at that time, Vice-President Verheugen promised us that this would be reviewed and consideration given to the possibility of improved initiatives in this area, but I cannot see them here; perhaps they are not regarded as having high priority. It is a matter of complete indifference to me whether they are or not; what matters to us is that we should know whether or not to expect their appearance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, there are two points in this work programme that I want to say something about; one has to do with basic freedoms and the other with civic participation in the European Union. Reference has frequently been made in this debate to the problem inherent in the lack of any preferences or priorities on the part of the Commission in the field of basic freedoms and third pillar, a problem that we need, firstly, to address as a matter of urgency, before, secondly, establishing the cause of the lack of political will.</p>
      <p sl="de">Reference has been made to the fact that Mr Barroso, at the beginning of this legislative period, set up a working party made up of Commissioners and tasked with addressing the issue of basic freedoms. I find myself wondering what this working party has been up to over the last two years, since no report has been forthcoming. So have they been doing nothing? Drinking coffee? In all seriousness, though, we must, if we are to take this subject seriously, know what is to be discussed in this context.</p>
      <p sl="de">What I find worthy of criticism about this work programme is the fact that – in parallel with the efforts by G6 states to do something about legal migration and by the few states gathered around the Federal Republic of Germany that have launched the Prüm Convention – parallel structures are developing into a third pillar outside the third pillar without the Commission – whose role as guardian of treaties is about more than making laws – intervening or making any kind of forthright public comment. The fact is that, if we are to act on the judicial and police cooperation front, we have to do so within the framework set for us by the Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since my time is running out, I will conclude with a brief point, which is that, on page 10 of the programme on civic involvement is written, in English, the following – and I quote:</p>
      <p sl="de">‘This includes a commitment to listen and to deliver.’</p>
      <p sl="de">We have done so. We have handed one million signatures to the Commission and the Council concerning the seat of Parliament. Two-and-a-half months on, we have yet to receive a reply. I believe that, as far as ‘listen and deliver’ is concerned, the ball is now in the Commission’s court.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, one of the main measures for 2007 is border control. This will be achieved with the second generation Schengen information system, the VIS, the operation of Frontex, broader use of biometric data and the creation of central databases.</p>
      <p sl="el">The pretext for all this is the security of citizens and the management of immigrants entering the Union. In reality, however, a European fortress is being created, emphasis is being given to policies to stop immigrants, protection notwithstanding, and, at the same time, the creation of a police state is being served. As regards collaboration between the public and private sectors in the field of security, as proposed, the question which arises is who will exercise control of the honest function of private individuals and how. The possibility of intervention by private individuals – with interests often politically controlled – in the configuration and management of security policies is unsettling.</p>
      <p sl="el">Furthermore, one of the Commission proposals refers to combating terrorist propaganda and the question we are asking is where are the limits of freedom of opinion set and who will set them, politically and ideologically impartially, when today liberating movements are condemned and political parties are called terrorist organisations.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-253" speaker_id="4538" name="Malcolm Harbour" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to begin by addressing the question of the internal market. I think I am out of sequence, because the internal market was discussed earlier by some of my colleagues. However, I want to welcome the review of the single market strategy on behalf of the members of our group. I am pleased we are now focusing on the name ‘single market’ because that describes much more accurately what we are working for. We will therefore give the Commission a lot of support for that and indeed for other initiatives to make the single market work better.</p>
      <p sl="en">That leads me onto a broader concern I have on the work programme and the priorities as presented to us. It is a big improvement on the one we had last year, of which I was very critical and in which there was a very long list of unprioritised proposals. We still have a long list of proposals. I think there are 21 initiatives and, as my colleague, Mr Grosch, said, the difference between strategic initiatives and priorities is not entirely clear. I would again make the point that a list of priorities longer than five is not a list of priorities at all.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I want to make the fundamental point that the issue of delivery, which I am pleased to say is included, is picturesquely described as ‘delivery a daily task’ as if it were a routine issue – we still have daily milk deliveries in England and I am pleased to say in pint bottles. However, it is not a routine issue but a fundamental one! I really want to know what resources the Commission is putting behind the implementation of its policies. On the single market, we know that Mr McCreevy estimates that 90% of the legislation is already in place. Delivery is fundamental. Where does it say what resources the Commission is putting behind its initiatives? Where does it say what resources the Commission is putting behind a transposition plan for the Services Directive we will approve tomorrow, which is a fundamental piece of work? If the Commission does not put the resources behind it, it will not be delivered.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to ask Commissioner Wallström, whom I understand is responsible for communication, for the next package to be grouped together. I do not want to see the single market policy scattered throughout this document: I want to see the priority for the single market set out with the actions next to it, the delivery resources next to that and the Commission’s simplification plan next to that, and I want all this to be lumped together with the percentage of resources the Commission is putting behind it. That would be a logical and clear document and clear communication.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on the Services Directive, I am delighted Mr Schulz is here, because I note from a press release he issued today that the Services Directive is an enormous success for the Socialist Group. Well, colleagues on this side of the House, it is an enormous success for this Parliament and all of us working together. I hope people will have the humility to accept that. However, I notice that he has finally joined our liberal club because the release states that he supports the flexibility necessary to enterprise and the promise of new job creation. Welcome to the market liberalisation club, Mr Schulz!</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, 2007 will certainly be an important year in terms of whether citizens are won over to Europe or whether they continue to distance themselves from it.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to make three comments on this. The first is that the Berlin declaration represents a good opportunity for us to demonstrate the idea of Europe and the European project. I hope that this declaration concentrates on the future rather than focusing too much on the past. Europe has its origins in the field of energy, and this same field may also present a vision for the future – if, for example, a large-scale energy project were proposed that met all the criteria we are aiming at. I am thinking here of the solar–hydrogen economy, which would be a real challenge for this continent and even for the international community.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second is that we need to make progress with the constitutional process. This is the responsibility of the Presidencies, of course, but also of the other institutions. I hope that the Commission does indeed provide input to show citizens what they stand to lose if the Constitution is not ratified, and that it also makes proposals for overcoming the crisis. The June Summit spoke of ‘additional elements’ that need to be developed, and I hope that 2007 sees the Commission, too, proffering some thoughts about what that means in practice.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third, Madam Vice-President, concerns democratic infrastructures. We have European citizens’ initiatives. One million signatures must not go to waste. I think that we need a framework for how the institution receives mass petitions such as this. These are important tasks for 2007.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it was with real pleasure that I welcomed the points of the last two parts of the programme presented, that is to say the part containing strategic initiatives and priority strategies. It specifically addresses communication, and I would like to thank Commissioner Wallström for preparing this unusually important section, particularly in 2006, as 2007 is to be a crucial year. In 2007 internal reforms will have to be undertaken, and preparations made for constitutional reforms primarily geared towards the introduction of the European Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, I fear that the Commissioner was left without support here, and that the Commission does not attach sufficient attention to this area, and is not giving her sufficient assistance in the preparations needed for reforms, even though they are her own. I would like to ask the Commission what it has done to enable it to operate under new conditions in 2009, under a new treaty, and will there be a greater number of commissioners or not?</p>
      <p sl="pl">The final matter I would like to raise are the internal affairs of Europe, which should be a better and safer place for all of our citizens to live. This is the expectation of all citizens of the European Union, but the citizens of the new Member States are in a less favourable situation. They have fewer rights in many areas and are discriminated against in areas such as cross-border travel, where the SIS and Schengen are concerned, and I would like this element to be eliminated. If this fact were eliminated, we would no longer be discussing forced labour camps in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, whilst I should like to thank the Commission warmly for this communication, I have to start with somewhat more worrying observations. I deeply regret to have to say that a clear development standpoint is what is lacking in the Commission communication. I should like to remind you of the three objectives of the European Development Policy, as described in the Treaty, namely sustainable development, the fight against poverty and the gradual integration of the developing countries into the global economy. Although these deserve a special mention in the communication, they are not there.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, I should like to appeal to the Commission to tackle the problem of the relationship between other areas of policy and development policy more effectively. I am particularly thinking of the relationship with fisheries, trade and migration. This is an important criterion in order to be able to achieve our own development goals and also to make a meaningful contribution towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals which we all agreed upon.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I am appealing to the Commission to include in the list of priorities communications in the following areas: the latest with regard to the EU’s contribution to the development goals; secondly, any headway made in European development policy with regard to the WTO’s development round, and thirdly, the implications of the Commission proposal on more highly educated immigrants on the brain drain in developing countries. Finally, particularly the absence of the Millennium Development Goals and the fight against poverty are striking and disappointing in the paragraph that describes Europe as a global partner.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the Commission on having attached a high priority to a communication policy and, in particular, on having already implemented it within Parliament. I can say that, with regard to foreign affairs, we are now in constant, constructive contact with the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, this just adds to the consternation with which we look at the Commission's programme on foreign policy and human rights. In my view, communications in this regard have been elliptical, and almost subliminal. There has been radio silence on the Mediterranean. So, what has happened to the spirit of Barcelona and the concept of an alliance of civilisations? Little or nothing has been said on policy towards Africa, beyond the development policy, and you have been very tight-lipped regarding Latin America, even at a time when the European Parliament is involved in establishing Eurolat. Last but not least, there has been absolutely no reference to our human rights policy, even though it is our brand image for the outside world and even though we have just managed to obtain a specific instrument for it. In this regard, it is worth bearing in mind that the conclusion of the action programmes with Israel, Moldova and Ukraine is going to result in difficult negotiations about which the communication has nothing to say.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, foreign policy, as presented here, seems to be based more on the European Union's bilateral relations with certain countries than on a regional policy or a policy of great communities. It is all rather lacking in ambition, attractiveness and life, and that is a great shame for the people of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, 2007 will be the key year for us all to find our own way to escape from the constitutional crisis and I am very pleased to hear from President Barroso that he plans for the Commission to play a central part in that exercise.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission strategy for change across the policy spectrum must be framed inside a constitutional context. Policy reform will be given practical effect by its connection with the issues of the EU’s competences, the instruments, the powers and procedures. As far as external affairs are concerned, for example, the Union needs its legal personality. Public opinion supports the EU as a global actor. We need success on completing the Doha Round for trade and development. We should be stalwart in persevering with enlargement, despite the problems that we experience at present, some of which at least are clearly foreseen and foreseeable.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission and Parliament must be steadfast to support the deployment of so many European forces, not least at present in South Lebanon, as this exercise surely provides the greatest test for the development of our common foreign security and defence policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as foreign and security policy coordinator for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to make a number of critical remarks.</p>
      <p sl="de">A few points have been raised. Mrs De Keyser expressed exactly what I feel when she questioned where we stand. We can see the arc of crisis over Iraq, Iran, Libya – the Middle East. Europe, a global player, makes professions yet comes up with a static work programme consisting of, on the one hand, a banal statement of the problems devoid of political substance and, on the other, instruments that – those of them that are actually new – the Commission does not even acknowledge as a quantum leap.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point I should like to express our disappointment that the five new external-policy instruments that are due to enter into force as of 1 January, and that will support the Commission’s external policy, civil conflict prevention, crisis management and reconstruction work for the first time, are not given due attention, but instead constitute just a single indent in the work programme.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then there is the Commission’s concept of ‘neighbourhood policy’. The Commission must clarify in political terms what it means when people now talk of ‘neighbourhood policy light’. A political definition is no longer being given for this. Any old words are being used, and I have the impression that a political definition is virtually being avoided.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to finish with a positive comment. I welcome the fact that the Commission is tackling the defence-equipment market at long last; it is just that what the programme has to say about this it has been saying for years. Parliament has given the green light, and awaits results at long last. Consequently, I am afraid we are not satisfied in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European Union has done much to raise its visibility in the world arena in recent years. In order to enable this process of emancipation to develop, we have to face up to significant problems. Since the enlargement of 2004 we are neighbours with a very troubled part of Europe to the east, where in recent years we have seen Russia return to a policy of coercion in respect of its neighbours, countries which today are also neighbours of the European Union. Often these countries – such as Georgia and Ukraine – are included in our neighbourhood policy, which the Commission rightly believes should be strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, a successful reform of financial aid instruments is not everything. In order to play an important role in the world, particularly when we think of the European Union as a ‘soft power’, takes credibility. This credibility is a vital test, and we cannot be a global or even regional player if we do not protect Belarus from annexation by Russia, something which may only be a matter of months away.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We will not become a global player if we trade human rights in Russia for gas, or if we close the door to the pro-European, democratic and pro-western policies of Ukraine and Georgia in a cowardly way. These are key objectives for our instruments in external policy. If we do not succeed in using them successfully, the world will see a growing gap between our often moralising declarations and the reality. The world does not need such a European Union, and the world would certainly have little respect for such a European Union.</p>

We are cursing Russia, with whom we have an energy-dependent relationship, and we are caressing Turkey, which says provocatively, 'I am Turkey and can impose whatever I choose on Europe'. As you see, it is insisting that we talk with it at a time when it does not accept the 25th Member State of the European Union, Cyprus. That is our policy. We do not see what is happening in Gaza. When, at long last, will the European Union see what is happening in this area of the world, where children are being killed every day? There have been about 500 000 deaths in Iraq. When will we take an initiative at long last? When there have been a billion deaths?</p>
      <p sl="el">So what is Europe? Europe is on the American car carrier which drives us wherever it wants. Fine, we have handed them the steering wheel, but let us at least take over the brakes, so that we count for something. Otherwise we are no more than servants of the foreign policy of America, which drives us where it wants, when it wants.</p>
      <p sl="el">What are our relations with China? Do we know? Are they hostile? Are they friendly? How do we address this factor? A Sino-Russian axis is developing. What will we be? The ham, the salami in the sandwich which the United States of America wants to fix? Let us decide on a foreign policy of our own. Let us draw up our own policy. We cannot see it anywhere.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as coordinator for the PPE-DE Group I would like to stress the following points.</p>
      <p sl="en">We realise the importance of the external competitiveness aspects of the Lisbon Agenda and the coordination of internal and external actions, and we reiterate our commitment to the multilateral approach in trade policy and support for the WTO as the principal forum for the management of globalisation. We therefore deplore the suspension of the WTO negotiations and strongly urge the Commission to come forward and fight for a settlement on the Doha Round in 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the EU communication on global Europe competing in the world. We stress, however, that bilateral regional agreements should remain supplementary, as I said, to the multilateral trade system. But here I have real concerns, and I would like to question the Commission on this particular point. Why have we not made progress with the USA on regulatory issues between the EU and the US by completing the transatlantic single market? We must make a commitment to that over the next decade. We cannot have a free-trade agreement with the US; that would undermine multilateralism. But we can have an agreement on regulatory issues which are outside Article 34.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, something that is particularly close to my own heart: there is grave concern over the growing feeling of protectionism and trying to set goals that are outside the Lisbon Agenda. Member States are increasingly using protectionist methods. If we are going to have a settlement, we have to move away from that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I have serious concerns about EPAs and economic partnership negotiations, and I support the Commission in its proposal. We must go ahead with it and push it forward. It is a real chance, probably the last chance we are going to have, to do something to help those poor countries. If we can get an agreement on that, it will be a great thing. I look forward to that in the coming year.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, many citizens are sceptical about present-day Europe, and its mission is ambiguous. Too much money is being spent on the old priorities, such as agriculture, while the new priorities, the Europe of the future, such as education, migration policy and fair trade, are being neglected. Europe must be social not only inwardly, but a social Europe is needed outwardly too. Just like soft power, a cohesive, united Europe can make the difference in the world.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We do not need unilateral actions like the invasion in Iraq, but active commitment in Darfur with the help of the Security Council. No relapse to bilateral trade agreements, but a multilateral trade agreement in the World Trade Organisation that respects national public services such as water, education, social security or public housing. No export subsidies that bring about unfair competition for Africa. These hugely distorting agricultural subsidies and dumping must cease before 2013. The funds that are freed up as a result can be used for the development of regional agricultural markets in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We must also open our markets for products with value added from those poor countries. Aid and trade, you are arguing in favour of sound initiatives for more coherence and coordination. In the areas of migration, agriculture and trade, massive inconsistencies continue to exist. These inconsistencies could seriously hamper the conclusion of the regional trade agreements that are currently being discussed. On the subject of migration, you emphasised the suppression of the problem, but an effective solution to prevent the brain drain is absent. Why not go for a Green Card initiative?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, you have accepted the Development Co-operation Instrument (DCI), but no attempt is being made to streamline the Cotonou Agreement in the same way. Also, there is no energy or time for the real implementation in 2007. For national policy documents, this involves consultation over there and over here. It means working with public documents. It means creating real ownership in the developing countries with the local NGOs, the parliaments and governments. Just as the DCI is deployed, our Parliament here must be given real influence and control in the same manner.</p>
      <p sl="nl">2007 will be the year of truth for the Commission. Will unilateral market thinking at European global level persist or will fair competition and solidarity prevail, and will we Europeans prove to Africa that the Millennium Objectives are achievable after all? Africa is going downhill. 2007 should be the year of the U-turn.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all my warm thanks, on behalf of the whole Commission, for all your important and constructive contributions to the debate on next year’s work programme, which I have been listening to since 3 o’clock. My first comment will be a political one and then I would like to say something about the process. But what I have heard is really a common call for sustainable development, meaning that a majority of you have mentioned the need to create jobs and growth. This is the start of the debate, but we have to respect the most important resource we have, people, and make sure that we have a social security and social protection system that reaches out effectively to all citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has to be sustainable growth, which means we have to take account of natural resources, energy issues and environmental constraints. That is exactly what sustainable development is all about, making sure that we do it the European way, ensuring that all these three elements are covered by an ambitious policy for jobs and growth in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have heard these calls for quality jobs and investment in education and innovation, research and development. As you know, this has been part of our political agenda from the first day of the Barroso Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">We propose to respond to this, because it is totally in line with this Commission’s political ambitions, and we propose reforms in this work programme. We propose social cohesion and I think it is important to mention in that context, since there was also a debate about regional policy, that we now have in place all we need – budgets, regulations, etc. – for a regional policy for 2007 to 2013, and that we are negotiating right now with Member States on the programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">We hope for close cooperation with Parliament on implementation. The urban dimension is taken very seriously by the Commission. The earmarking takes account of the needs of both more and less advanced regions in Europe, because there have been references to unfair cohesion policy and we say that all three dimensions of cohesion must be taken seriously. This is also reflected in the new regulations, where partnership is in principle obligatory and 82% of the structural funds goes to poorer regions. Investment in people is one of the three objectives of the cohesion policy and I think that point should come out in the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also proposing security measures. Security includes making sure we can live free from terrorist threats and crime and from environmental pollution. We say we need to approach this with a lot of optimism and in partnership with all the stakeholders involved, but engaging with Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">This has to do with the issue of soft law. Many of you have mentioned soft law, compared with other measures and legislative acts. It is important to mention that this Commission work programme for 2007 contains 34 legislative proposals, representing 36% of the total, 57 non-legislative proposals and one negotiating mandate. That is more than last year’s 24 legislative proposals, 57 non-legislative proposals and five negotiating mandates. This figure shows that the proportion of legislative initiatives has increased from 27 to 36%. At the same time, the proportion of non-legislative proposals has slightly decreased.</p>
      <p sl="en">With a more diverse Europe, we also have to invest more in working with Member States to ensure that we prepare for good and better regulation and legislation that will be implemented. Therefore we need better consultation and better-prepared proposals in order to see better results, and that also applies to working methods.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Harbour asked about resources. In some cases, perhaps the Commission should ask the European Parliament to give us the resources we need. As you know, at the moment we are discussing how we can have enough resources to do everything Parliament has put on its wish-list. I have heard so many proposals for things that ought to be added to the list and things that you have missed – initiatives or legislative proposals – that should be on this list: energy initiatives, migration initiatives, the single market review, the social reality stocktaking, the emissions trading scheme, a European strategy for social services, a Community framework for efficient health services, etc. These 21 strategic objectives cover exactly the three pillars of sustainable development. If we are to add more of these initiatives or more work, we also need the resources and we cannot pretend otherwise. We are concerned about the budget for the Commission. We have to explain to our auditors, the European Parliament and the other institutions, how we use our money. However, we can discuss the structure until the cows come home, but in the end we have to choose and we have chosen to make this a more political document and explain the priorities of the Barroso Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The different structure you propose makes a lot of sense, but I think this is the way to ensure we can have a real political debate about priorities. That has been our wish from the beginning, in engaging with the European Parliament to discuss the work programme. This reflects the kind of dialogue we have had with the European Parliament for a long time, with contributions from all the individual committees. I think I am speaking on behalf of all my colleagues when I say that we have welcomed this and have enjoyed that debate and interaction with the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to say that when several of you ask for things that you feel are missing, that is in a way the tip of the iceberg. So much is being done all the time in the Commission and our departments. Here you find the strategic objectives, the strategic initiatives, that we say we will give priority to. At the same time there are a number of things in the pipeline. You are right on that point, Mr Harbour: you have to decide to give priority to a number of them. You will also find a list of communication priorities. That is in response to some of the very important remarks on human rights and anti-discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, next year will be the Year of Equal Opportunities. That is one of our communication priorities, on which we will definitely engage with the other institutions. Whether or not there should be a directive will be debated constantly with the European Parliament, but we can only present directives when we are ready and the circumstances are right. That will be debated later with the different committees. Anti-discrimination and human rights are part of everything we do and clearly a political priority in all our activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome your contributions. I find in your comments support for the high ambitions that the Commission has for 2007 and I also welcome your firm support to work together to achieve them. We are also committed to listening to citizens and to delivery, to becoming more accountable, transparent and effective. We thank you for your support in pursuing and strengthening our efforts towards better communication.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now the Commission will study the content of the resolution you will be adopting in December. The Commission will respond in the most appropriate and timely manner. The presentation of the annual policy strategy for 2008 could be the moment when the Commission explains how it intends to take account of the resolution on the work programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to reiterate that the Commission attaches the greatest importance to our framework agreement. It has proved a solid basis for productive working relations between our two institutions. It should remain our common objective to make the best use of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Duff, we meet regularly in discussions about the constitutional treaty and, as you already heard from President Barroso, we have great hopes also for next year. We shall now start preparing to move the institutional issues and hopefully the constitutional treaty forward next year. We will have to work with Member States and engage in a dialogue with them as to how we can do this in a balanced and effective manner. But it is clear that the problems addressed by the Constitution have not gone away. They are there and accentuated by next year’s enlargement. That is why we have to come back to the issue. We have to engage in a debate. However, it has not been a detour to say that we also have to have a period of reflection and that we have to engage with citizens. That has given us a lot in return. It has been necessary, because we can see a change of debate and atmosphere in many Member States. It is important to know that we can mobilise that support in trying to find a solution to the constitutional issue.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 30 by Manolis Mavrommatis (H-0881/06)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: European universities</p>
      <p sl="unknown">A survey carried out in 2006 by the Times Higher Education Supplement, ranking universities on five continents, lists 40 European universities, mainly in the UK, among the top 100 universities in the world. Most of the other 60 universities are in the USA, Australia and China. The survey also reports that the annual budget of Harvard University which retains top position in 2006 - amounts to 26 billion dollars.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Will the Commission take further measures to support the competitiveness of European universities and what will those measures comprise? Does the Commission intend to increase further its co-funding of institutions of higher education and does it plan to draw up an official ranking list of European universities?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-274" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Ján Figeľ" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Under the principle of subsidiarity every Member State of the European Union retains full responsibility for the content and organisation of educational systems. I have just come from the Education Council which completed its work today under the Finnish Presidency. The Commission played and will continue to play a role in building a policy for the modernisation of higher education as part of the implementation of the important Lisbon Strategy, through policy dialogue and mutual learning, in particular through the open method of coordination in education and training as well as in the field of research.</p>
      <p sl="en">As set out in the Commission communication on delivering a modernisation agenda for universities, measures in higher education are needed, ranging from curriculum reform to governance and funding reforms. The main responsibility, of course, lies with the Member States’ national authorities and universities.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also financial support for the modernisation agenda from the Community programmes in education and research. There is potential for substantial support from the structural funds under both the competitiveness and the convergence objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to university-based research, it should be noted that the forthcoming Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development substantially widens the opportunities for enhanced university research activities. As you know, total eligibility for projects is going up from 50% to 75% and programmes in lifelong learning and research for the next seven years will both see a very substantial increase in their budgets for the 2007-2013 period.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think a very important message is sent out by the European Institute of Technology. That is not something outside the framework of this question. It is a very important initiative to boost the transfer of knowledge by those who intensify investment in creativity, innovation and the improvement of our competitiveness. The EIT can improve European competitiveness in all three parts of the knowledge triangle: education, research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to ranking, which is an important part of the question put by Mr Mavrommatis, there are indeed several international rankings worldwide. Each has its own strengths, but also its own weaknesses. Although they are useful in terms of giving an impression of the competitive position of universities, the diversity of universities’ missions means that no single set of criteria can be considered as an objective measure. Different ranking systems give different weights to various criteria and consequently arrive at different results. However, provided the criteria are explicit, they can be a useful tool for both policy-makers and managers. At this stage, to answer the question directly, the Commission is not planning to draw up an official ranking list.</p>

    <intervention id="2-275" speaker_id="28574" name="Manolis Mavrommatis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, do you believe that many of the higher education institutes in top positions in the general classification of another two new surveys since carried out owe chiefly their progress and progress in their courses and of their students to the fact that they have private education standards and, if so, does the Commission perhaps intend to subsidise Member States which will try such an endeavour, irrespective of the private grants that many of the universities in the world receive?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-276" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Ján Figeľ" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I think that Mr Mavrommatis is right in pointing the finger at the teaching, because when teaching is separated from other activities, namely research or even the transfer of knowledge, via innovation, into real practice and the real economy, then all those aspects become rather weak or average, and we fall in the rankings, moving into a second division.</p>
      <p sl="en">The best answer is therefore to invest more and better. The question is slanted towards more investment in teaching and research, whereas better means efficiency and the way we organise ourselves, how we transfer knowledge and how we build partnerships between public and private interests and between academia and society. All these can be improved in our various policies, and in the EIT, which I mentioned as one of the examples of how these issues could be integrated. Secondly, there is also a need for more investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would not call this a subsidy from the European Union, but rather support for European cooperation, because we put together monies and distribute them in line with agreed rules, and these rules should lead us to excellence, the transfer of knowledge, and the rewarding or promotion of quality, not just quantity, in our academic institutions. That is our shared responsibility and common task.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I can follow on seamlessly from where the Commissioner has just left off. Research is important, but education and teaching of students are undoubtedly another of the lofty objectives of universities.</p>
      <p sl="de">When I worked as a professor, I was saddened to find that some universities, particularly those that always appear right at the top of the major rankings – for example British elite universities such as Oxford and Cambridge – were extremely reserved when it came to the Erasmus programme, in contrast to many other universities. Could participation in the Erasmus programme be made one of the criteria?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-278" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Ján Figeľ" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The rankings which have emerged and, whether we like it or not, will be part of our debate, are based on a certain set of criteria chosen by institutions that organise these rankings. A famous one is that of Shanghai University and another is The Times Higher Education Supplement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I said that there are limited criteria for evaluation. We are not going to organise our ranking around Erasmus, but Erasmus is a trademark or highly important, popular way of improving mobility in Europe. There is competition in terms not only of eligibility, as is now the case in most universities, but also of numbers and the content of the Erasmus programmes. Three years ago we established Erasmus Mundus. Erasmus is not only about thousands of people studying around the world. The European credit transfer system came about as a result of this cooperation in the 1990s. Then the Bologna Process began in 1999, as a logical process for providing more and more students and citizens in Europe with qualifications gained or complemented by studies abroad.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my view, we are not going to organise rankings but we want to celebrate and promote Erasmus as an important tool for the internationalisation of our studies and for making Europe and European universities more attractive worldwide. We organise a lot of joint actions in third countries far from Europe. When I speak to partners from outside Europe, I find that Erasmus is well known, especially now that Erasmus Mundus is seen as a competitive instrument used by European universities to make an internal and external difference to the image of Europe. So I would prefer not to speak about rankings but about our delivery in building a more attractive European education area.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 31 by Chris Davies (H-0896/06)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: CO2 emissions from new motor vehicles</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What is the Commission's current estimate of the average CO2 emissions from new motor vehicles being placed on the European motor market?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-280" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Davies, the Commission attaches great importance to the voluntary commitment on the part of the automobile industry to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars. These commitments have made it possible to achieve considerable reductions in consumption by new passenger cars. In 2004, average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars were 12.4% lower than in 1995, falling from 186 grams of emissions per kilometre to 163 grams.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is in the industry’s own interests to keep to the commitments it has entered into. Failure to attain the target value of 140 grams per kilometre would threaten the credibility of voluntary commitments as an alternative to legally binding regulations. So far, all three industry associations have attained the interim targets that were set as part of their voluntary commitment. Although they consider the final target very ambitious, they have all reaffirmed their determination to achieve it.</p>
      <p sl="de">I shall not hide the fact, however, that I am very concerned in this regard. Since the appearance of the report on the progress achieved by the end of 2004, I have been concerned about the fact that the average annual reduction over the coming years will have to be very much greater than before if the final target is to be achieved. We do not yet have any final data for 2005, but I expect no greater reduction for that year than for 2004. If it becomes apparent that the industry is not going to meet its commitments, the Commission – as I have already announced – must step in and propose legal acts to ensure that CO2 emissions are reduced to the level considered necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission is currently reviewing the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars. The CARS 21 High Level Group recommends the future strategy consist of an integrated approach involving all relevant stakeholders and thus a wide palette of measures. I consider this approach essential for achieving a further reduction in CO2 emissions from passenger cars at reasonable cost.</p>
      <p sl="de">A Commission decision on the future strategy is to be adopted at the end of the year. This strategy will certainly require further progress in automotive engineering. We are also considering laying down mandatory targets for motor-vehicle fuel efficiency, for example, but other aspects, too, have to be taken into account, such as policy measures to promote the use of low-carbon fuels, and changing driving habits.</p>
      <p sl="de">Incidentally, we should also pay greater attention to the other two main components of the strategy: labelling of and tax concessions for low CO2 emission vehicles. It must be said, unfortunately, that these two parts of the strategy have had extremely little effect so far, but I do believe that there is potential for improvement in this regard.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-281" speaker_id="4554" name="Chris Davies" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">I am glad the Commissioner is worried, as indeed he should be, because the car industry has comprehensively broken its agreements with the European Union to meet these reductions. This was largely for profit reasons, because there is money to be made in four-wheel drive SUVs or ‘Chelsea tractors’ as they are known in the UK.</p>
      <p sl="en">Three weeks ago, from the very same seat, Commissioner Dimas said legislation would, of course, be necessary. Can the Commissioner indicate what the earliest date will be at which legislation can be introduced, once the Commission has carried out its review to be published in December?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-282" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">I should like to start by responding to Mr Davies’ assessment of the European motor-vehicle market. One of the reasons for the failure to meet the targets – but only one of them – is indeed the fact that European market habits have changed, with one market segment undergoing particularly rapid growth, one that is not exactly helpful with regard to CO2. This is the segment of SUVs: the large, supposedly off-road vehicles with very heavy fuel consumption. Astonishingly, these heavy, particularly high-emission vehicles have enjoyed favourable treatment in regulations up to now. The Commission’s proposal for the ‘Euro 5’ standard plans to put an end to the preferential treatment of these particularly large, particularly polluting vehicles. That is a very important point. This issue is currently being discussed in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as the timing is concerned, for reasons of fairness and trustworthiness, the industry has to be given the time we have granted it: that is, until 2008. If, however, it becomes apparent – as it is doing – that the targets are not being met, the Commission will have to start preparing legislation next year, so that it can be presented in 2008.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, particulate-matter emissions from diesel vehicles are a topical issue. Parliament, together with the Council, lays down high values for pollution. What is planned with regard to emissions? Is there any relevant legislation that relates to diesel vehicles and is aimed at the motor-vehicle industry?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-284" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Verheugen" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Of course, Mr Rack. The proposal the Commission presented at the end of last year to introduce a ‘Euro 5’ standard for vehicles reduces particulate matter from both light commercial vehicles and passenger cars. Our proposal reduces the limit value for soot-particle emissions from diesel passenger cars to 5 milligrams per kilometre as of 2009. We cannot set this value any lower as it would then be impossible to measure. In 2009, therefore, the limit value of 5 milligrams will enter into force, which means that, as of then, diesel vehicles without a particle filter will be a thing of the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">The situation with nitrogen oxides is more difficult as, for a large majority of vehicles, the relevant technology is not yet available – at least at present. The Commission’s proposal provides for a reduction to 200 milligrams per kilometre and is currently being debated in Parliament. A second measure also being discussed at the present time is my proposal to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides from diesel vehicles from 200 to 80 milligrams. This would enter into force in 2014 or 2015.</p>

Of course we have access to such figures, and it is pleasing – in my view – that levels of emissions from new European passenger cars are far, far below the average for passenger cars in other parts of the world. They are significantly below those in the oil-producing countries – the USA and Japan included. It is interesting to note here that such countries with poorer emissions levels than ours have legally binding regulations in place for all fields.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 41 by Bernd Posselt (H-0898/06)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Tax on beer</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What is the Commission’s position on plans to increase tax on beer?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Question No 42 by Justas Vincas Paleckis (H-0925/06)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Method used to calculate an increase in rates of excise duty on alcohol</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The EU institutions are currently examining a Commission proposal on increasing rates of excise duty on alcohol. In order to take into account inflation in the period between 1993, when the current rates of excise duty on alcohol came into force, and 2005, it is proposed that the minimum rates of excise duty be increased by 31%.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">However, the new Member States joined the EU on 1 May 2004 and made commitments from that date regarding minimum rates of excise duty on alcoholic drinks. Under the above-mentioned Commission proposal, the new Member States would be required to increase their rates of excise duty in line with levels of inflation in other countries from before the new Member States joined the EU.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does the Commission consider this to be fair and logical? Should a different method be used to calculate rates of excise duty on alcohol in the new Member States?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-289" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Kovács" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I would like to inform honourable Members that on 8 September 2006 the Commission adopted a proposal to adapt the minimum rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages to take account of inflation since 1993, when the current rates were established. This proposal was inspired by a call made unanimously by the Council on 12 April 2005.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal provides for the proposed increases to come into force from 1 January 2008. However, in order to ease the difficulties that some Member States may have in increasing their national rates to meet the revalorised minimum, transitional periods have been proposed until 1 January 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">The inflationary increase is 31%, based on Eurostat data and the harmonised index of consumer prices. For beer this means that the current minimum rate of 74.8 euro cents per hectolitre per degree will rise to 98 euro cents. In other words, the current minimum duty based on half a litre of beer of an alcoholic strength of 5% will rise from 4.5 euro cents to 6 euro cents, an increase of some 1.5 euro cents.</p>
      <p sl="en">The majority of Member States are not affected by this proposal, as their national rates are already above the proposed revalorised minimum. However, the impact on those Member States that are affected will clearly depend on the level of their current national rates. Germany, for instance, will need to increase its national rate on beer by 24.5% in order to meet the revalorised minimum. This equates to a duty increase on half a litre of beer of just over 1 euro cent. Furthermore, under the transition period proposed, Germany will have until 1 January 2011 to make the necessary increase. Honourable Members will see that the impact of the proposed adaptation to inflation will be rather modest and does not justify the outcry in some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to the specific question asked by Mr Paleckis, the Commission points out that the purpose of the minimum rates is to limit distortions of the internal market through different tax levels being set by Member States. Therefore, the minimum rate should be the same across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Commission’s view it makes no sense to have different minimum rates depending on the point in time one or the other Member State joined the European Union. As mentioned above, the Commission’s proposal contains appropriate transition periods.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to add that the proposal is currently the subject of discussions in the Council. These are proving to be more difficult than one would have expected considering that the proposal sets out a purely mathematical adaptation, which has only a marginal effect in some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to inform honourable Members that on 7 November, just a week ago, when we discussed it for the first time in the Ecofin Council, three Member States – Germany, the Czech Republic and Lithuania – opposed the proposal. It did not, therefore, gain the unanimous support requested, so we postponed the final decision and debate to the next Ecofin meeting which is due on 28 November. As honourable Members are certainly aware, it will also be the subject of discussions in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Did the Commissioner know that, when Bavaria joined the German Reich in 1871, it did so only on condition that beer be recognised as a basic foodstuff whose consumption was permitted even during military service? In Bavaria, therefore, beer is a basic foodstuff. In addition, should a sharper distinction perhaps be drawn between beer and alcopops – that is to say, between a healthy natural product and a load of rubbish? My second question for the Commissioner is whether greater account should perhaps be taken of regional and national traditions. In particular, I should like to ask him whether a better idea might be to reduce VAT and beer taxation for the catering trade, in order to ensure the survival of our high-quality catering establishments – which are essential for health.

As the honourable Members probably know, since 1992, when the current rates were established, there has been no positive excise duty rate on wine. At that time, it was finally agreed that wine would be zero rated. Unless there is another decision to re-evaluate the excise duty, zero remains zero, even if increased by a proposed 31%.</p>
      <p sl="en">I appreciate the views of those who argue there is basically not much difference between wine and beer, and it is also a fact that wine and beer are competing on the consumer market. However, to change the legislation would require unanimity and, as far as I know, at least ten Member States would certainly veto any positive rates on wine.</p>

      <p sl="en">As an honourable representative of the UK you will surely know there are a number of Member States very much opposed to harmonisation in general and in principle.</p>
      <p sl="en">What the European Union has already achieved is harmonisation of minimum excise duty rates, and Member States are free to set their national rate much higher than the minimum. Today we have a minimum excise duty rate on beer and zero rates on wine, which I do agree results in some distortion, but as I mentioned, changing this legislation requires a unanimous decision in the Ecofin Council of which there is no hope for the time being.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, some Member States just apply the minimum rates and some apply much higher rates. For instance, as far as spirits are concerned, I know there are some Scandinavian Member States where the actual excise duty rate is more than ten times the mandatory minimum. This can certainly result in some distortion. However, it is within the jurisdiction of each and every Member State to set the rate above the minimum or at the minimum, but certainly not below the minimum.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Decentralised system for competition law</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Regulation (EC) No. 1/2003, inter alia, replaced the previous centralised scheme with a directly applicable exception system in which the competition authorities and courts of the Member States have the power to apply not only Article 81(1) and Article 82 of the Treaty, which have direct applicability by virtue of the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, but also Article 81(3) of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Are there any initial appraisals of the effectiveness of the new decentralised system?

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in accordance with the principles of institutional and procedural autonomy which underpin the EC Treaty, it is for each Member State to determine which courts are responsible for competition matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most Member States, as you are aware, have specific procedural rules for competition-related issues and these include, for example, referring these cases directly to higher courts, limiting the number or type of competent courts or using specialist courts.</p>
      <p sl="en">National courts also have at their disposal a number of mechanisms in case of doubt about the application of Article 81 and Article 82 to a proceeding. In particular, further to Article 15 of Regulation 1/2003, national courts can ask the Commission for its opinion on any question on the interpretation of the EC competition rules raised by the facts of a case. So far the national courts have done so in some twenty cases. If a binding interpretation of the rules is sought, the national court can refer to the Court of Justice under the preliminary ruling procedure and a number of Member States also provide for the possibility for the courts to refer awkward questions to the national competition authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, of course, welcomes all initiatives taken by Member States to increase the expertise of the national judiciary in EC competition law.

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Support for film productions through tax breaks in the United Kingdom</p>

If so, is this unequal treatment of European productions acceptable in the light of the task of promoting cultural diversity in the EU pursuant to Article 151 of the EU Treaty?

      <p sl="en">The Commission is currently in discussions with the UK authorities concerning the UK film tax incentive scheme, which has been notified to the Commission under the state aid rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is assessing that case on the basis of the 2001 Cinema Communication, which provides that Member States can grant state aid to film production if the content of the film concerned is cultural, according to verifiable national criteria. In line with the subsidiarity principle, the Cinema Communication leaves Member States to determine those verifiable national criteria. Neither Article 151 of the Treaty nor the Cinema Communication exclude the possibility that third-country productions or co-productions can benefit from state aid provided by Member States to support films. However, the Cinema Communication allows Member States to require that up to 80% of the film production budget be spent in the territory concerned in return for state aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UK scheme contains such a requirement. Also it was not quite clear, on the basis of the initial notifications of the UK film tax incentive, that European co-productions which meet the conditions of the European Convention on Cinematic Co-production do not need to pass the UK cultural test to benefit under the scheme. At the Commission’s request the UK authorities have clarified that in their published guidance on the scheme. Therefore, the conditions for European co-productions to benefit from the scheme are in line with commonly used European standards. In contrast, US productions and US-UK co-productions must pass the UK cultural test to benefit from the tax scheme.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the Commission has been supporting the activities implemented by national and provincial health ministries since 1994. A number of non-governmental organisations have also received direct aid from the European Reconstruction and Development Programme and/or from the budget heading for poverty-related diseases. These activities have, by and large, achieved the results targeted by the various projects. Nevertheless, their sustainability, particularly in the social sectors, is a cause for concern due to the ongoing costs they involve.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Two operations with the health ministries are currently benefiting from funding from the indicative programme. First, there are the partnerships for the provision of primary health care, including for HIV/AIDS, which have received EUR 25 million: this programme establishes partnerships between the NGOs and five of the nine provincial health ministries. The NGOs fund scholarships and provide appropriate training to untrained or poorly trained healthcare workers. These healthcare workers give basic care relating to AIDS treatment to patients who previously did not have access to such care. There are currently 187 000 patients receiving care from 5000 providers, and these numbers will increase considerably once the new programme, to which EUR 45 million have been allocated, comes into operation in 2007.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second programme comprises support for the South African Government's Comprehensive HIV/Aids Care Management and Treatment Plan, amounting to EUR 25 million. This programme was approved by the Commission in December 2004. It aims to support the implementation of this anti-AIDS plan, particularly with regard to human resources planning, marketing authorisations for drugs, funding for care and health promotion activities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is also a programme targeting HIV/AIDS in the field of education – the programme on AIDS in higher education, HEAIDS – which has received EUR 20 million. This programme follows up on a project funded by the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DfID) and Ireland. It aims to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in an age group that is particularly badly affected and is showing signs of lapsing into old behaviour patterns, as well as in the higher education community in general.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A regional HIV/AIDS awareness and education programme – which has received Community funding of EUR 10 million, in addition to EUR 20 million provided by the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Ireland – was approved by the Commission in 2002. It is being implemented by Soul City, a South-African NGO. For the last 14 years, Soul City has been receiving considerable aid from the European Community to develop its 'edutainment' – education and entertainment – approach, which involves the use of TV and radio soaps, backed up by leaflets and other documents in a wide range of languages, providing more detailed information on the subjects covered in the broadcasts. This programme covers not South Africa, but eight neighbouring countries. Although its activities in recent years have produced excellent results, it must nevertheless be noted that this programme is facing administrative problems connected to its cross-border nature and to the fact that it is supported by a number of different sources of funding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Alongside the programmes funded by the regional development programme, six projects funded to the tune of around EUR 10 million by various budget headings are currently being implemented in South Africa. All of them have objectives relating to the fight against AIDS. One project worth mentioning is a vaccine research project linking research institutes in South Africa and Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In terms of the use and availability of drugs, the Commission does not have a specific programme in South Africa to promote the use of generic drugs, but it does support the measures taken by the South African health department to rationalise and improve legislation on medicinal products. It should be remembered that the problem is very often not a lack of availability of anti-retroviral drugs, but the reluctance of patients to be examined and treated, together with lack of access to healthcare equipment and staff, particularly pharmacists to see patients and advise them before they start treatment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I believe that the fight against this scourge depends primarily on there being far more consistency between the various players. From that perspective, the Commission has also paid a further significant sum into the Global Fund and it will do so again in the future. At the refinancing meeting in London, we paid something like an additional EUR 90 million into this Global Fund. I must say that this Global Fund refinancing meeting was not as successful as we had expected: even though we succeeded in raising a relatively large amount, we did not raise the amount that we wanted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Next, I believe that the European Union, the Commission, must fund projects and strategies that are effective. We ourselves have neither the necessary expertise nor the necessary ability to become operators or players in this area. We must therefore trust those who do have this expertise and who have already shown themselves to be somewhat effective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This will be a long-term fight. If we think that we can settle this issue quickly, then in my opinion we are mistaken. I believe that this action is effective, but that there is still a long way to go. For example, we cannot, in my opinion, ever do too much to promote the provision of education, if only at primary school level, for all girls in Africa. Indeed, if we really want to have an effective measure in Africa for fighting against this scourge, then we need to start by sending girls en masse to primary school, and to do so very quickly. I believe that this will be one of the most effective preventative measures for fighting this scourge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, yes, Europe is doing everything it can. However, you are asking me a question that I have difficulty in answering. You are asking me whether I think we are being effective. Yes, I think that we are effective, but we will never be effective enough. Nor can I answer the question about when we will eradicate this scourge. We can only bet on the quantity of resources, on the strategy of the experts – of whom there are many, sometimes even very many – and on the strategy and the goodwill of the players – of whom there are many, sometimes even very many.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Personally, I believe that it is in our interest to have coherent strategies, and I am not sure that spreading them, as it were, among all sorts of different players is the right answer. I am very much in favour of the idea of conducting strategies directly with the governments of the countries concerned because I believe that countries must take ownership of the actions that are carried out. Countries must get involved. In Botswana, for example, the government, the State of Botswana is making a real effort; it is really going from door to door. Its work consists in going into every home and explaining about prevention and treatment. I believe that there is certainly a systematic approach to be taken in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To return to the question that you are asking me – it puts me in a predicament. I cannot tell you whether we are effective, because I would be lying if I said that, yes, we are effective. I believe that we are effective, but I cannot make a bet on it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I have just touched on the answer to this question. Personally, I am very much counting on it, because there is, all the same, a logic to this. One of the main Millennium Goals is to provide primary education for all children of primary school age. I believe that we must make a huge effort regarding this aspect, because the fulfilment of this goal hinges on education, information campaigns and a more systematic approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I believe that we must decentralise this strategy to a far greater extent. Let us take the case of Africa, for example: it is clear to those who know Africa that one of the tragedies facing Africa today – it is not spoken of much, but I am very mindful of it – is that all of the policies are centralised. There is very little decentralisation, and when there is decentralisation, it is powers that are decentralised, but the resources are not provided to carry out the planned actions or to exercise these powers. We therefore need to get local communities much more involved. We must spare no expense on education.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You spoke of preventive measures. I see no more important a preventive measure than that. I should like to say in this regard – even if it is perhaps very difficult – that we must stop constantly changing strategy, for want, as it were, of immediate results. A period of action is called for; you cannot gauge the effectiveness of a policy after just a few years. This is a tragic, terrible scourge, and we therefore need to start everything more or less from scratch.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I bear witness to several strategies: Botswana, for example, is working hard and making significant efforts. There are other countries that are making significant efforts. I have just been talking about this issue with Mrs Zuma, the Foreign Affairs Minister of South Africa, a country that is in the process of carrying out a small-scale review of the policy that it has conducted until now in this area. South Africa wants to adapt, and I believe that that is a good thing. I could mention other countries too, but the key preventive measure is, I believe, education. I really see no other base on which to develop our strategy.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Immigration: support for repatriated immigrants</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Given that in the last few months thousands of illegal immigrants from western Africa have been returned to their countries of origin, where the economic conditions which forced them to emigrate remain unchanged, does the Commission intend to adopt measures within the framework of its development policies to make it easier for the returned immigrants to establish themselves in their home countries?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-319" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">For any action concerning migration and development to be crowned with success, it must be exhaustive and integrated, and we must use our financial instruments in the short and medium term and embark on an enhanced political dialogue, particularly with our African partners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission’s strategy for helping the countries of West Africa faced with returning migrants is thus based on three additional lines of action. Firstly, it is a question of responding to the urgent nature of the situation by harnessing the instruments available: I am thinking of the B-envelope, and of the rapid reaction mechanism. Regarding Senegal, for example, the Commission is going to spend EUR 9.6 million on implementing measures for supporting and reintegrating repatriated migrants. This sum is in fact the remainder of the ninth European Development Fund. These measures will be accompanied by other financial measures funded by the rapid reaction mechanism, amounting to around EUR 1.9 million.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, we must work on the medium term by taking account of migration-related aspects when implementing our cooperation instruments. Migration-related issues constitute an important aspect of the tenth European Development Fund programme, in addition to the existing instruments. We have therefore provided a ‘migration’ facility with EUR 25 million, taken from the balance of the B-envelope under the 9th EDF.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are many types of reintegration-related measures that are conceivable in the medium term: to implement effective readmission systems between all of the countries concerned, while respecting people’s dignity and fundamental rights; to emphasise training and admission so as to help returning illegal immigrants reintegrate into their countries of origin; to financially support national and regional programmes aimed at reintegrating migrants; and to promote information and awareness-raising campaigns for potential immigrants on the risks of illegal immigration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, at the risk of seeming somewhat unrealistic, I should nevertheless like to add that we obviously need to ensure that the support and reintegration measures, whatever they may be, do not appear to favour migrants who return to their countries over those who do not leave. If they do appear to favour them, you will obviously encourage others to leave, and I think that it is extremely important to monitor this. Ultimately, in the long term, the real answer, as we know, is to have a policy for training and employing young people, which is one of the policies receiving the backing of the European Community, through its support for economic integration policies and through the negotiation of economic partnership agreements aimed at attracting investment and at increasing economic growth, which are prerequisites for the creation of attractive jobs. These policies are central to the development priorities and the strategy concerning Africa.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must tell you that, from this perspective, I am one of those who believe that, while growth does not necessarily lead to a reduction in poverty, there can be no reduction in poverty without growth: we must remember that. I am therefore convinced that the long-term answer consists in promoting economic partnership agreements and in supporting the emergence of integrated regional markets which, I might add, can go hand in hand with a massive aid effort on the part of the European Union in terms of bringing the qualitative standards of products up to the required level, of technology transfer and of the construction of regional and subregional infrastructure, of infrastructure to improve access, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I am going to take the liberty, Madam President, of digressing in order to make a somewhat personal observation, which deserves to be given some thought. There are immediate measures, which must necessarily be taken and which are sadly often of a security nature, which is something that I can understand because our citizens are worried, are bothered by the phenomenon, and because we have difficulty in managing migratory flows. There are also long-term policies, which are development policies. Alongside these immediate measures and these policies, I wonder whether it would not be useful if we were to start giving thought to what I shall refer to as supported migration. I am not talking about quotas, which is an old idea, and one that I am not very keen on for the moment. I am thinking instead, for example, that funding could be allocated to migration agencies in the migrants’ countries of origin. These agencies could provide potential migrants with information and could also work with the Western European countries that offer job opportunities, without for all that encouraging a brain drain, which is another of my concerns. These agencies could, as it were, play the role of regulator in the two ways mentioned. There is in fact one thing about which I will not be convinced: it is not by closing the borders, it is not by taking coercive measures, and it is not by repatriating people en masse that we will settle this issue concerning migrants. We are going to have to live with this phenomenon for many years yet. Immigration is not a new phenomenon. There have always been migrations. We, in Europe, have the impression that we have suddenly unearthed a phenomenon that did not previously exist. For as long as the Earth has existed, there have been migrations. I am sorry to have to point that out. That being said, I understand that this phenomenon is difficult to manage and I understand that measures must be taken, and sometimes taken immediately, but I wonder whether, precisely because we are Europeans and because we uphold European values, we ought not to start giving thought to what I will call a third way, which I feel is more realistic. These migration agencies could easily provide training so as to enable young people from the countries concerned to become, for example, small business owners, traders and small craftsmen, because what is lacking most in these poor countries is a significant middle class. It is also lacking in both the economic and political spheres, since there is generally more political stability in countries in which there is a significant middle class.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There you have the small digression that I wanted to make, Madam President. I believe that it is important to be a little bolder in our thinking.</p>

      <p sl="es">Thank you, Commissioner, because it seems to me that you are attaching the appropriate degree of importance to the issue of immigration and I agree with almost all of your comments.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, masses of immigrants are currently arriving illegally, particularly on the shores of Southern Europe, causing not just a social and economic problem but also a political one. The mass arrival of immigrants at small islands in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic causes a political problem.</p>
      <p sl="es">I agree with the Commissioner that we cannot ‘stimulate’ immigration, but perhaps we should look at the phenomenon of immigration as evidence that something is going wrong in terms of development aid. This would lead to a policy that complements the policies we currently have.</p>

    <intervention id="2-321" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Louis Michel" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">I have already answered that question. Let us imagine, for example, that we could devote ten times more resources to our development policies. The fact remains that, if you carry out development projects in developing countries in which, for example, there is no State capacity, not even any State sovereign capacity, that is to say, where the State is incapable of providing equal access to education for all children, access to the authorities, access to the judiciary and access to health care, then your development policy will not be truly effective. It will not be truly effective until you have States that are capable of providing their citizens with basic services and of organising society along social lines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why the philosophy that I try to propound in the tenth European Development Fund is all about saying that we absolutely must make these States more able to provide. That is what the debate on governance is all about.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, I recently presented a communication on governance, which was fairly well received by our Member States and which was well received, too, within the context of the meeting of the World Bank, in Singapore, in which we explained what made Europe different. Major development days on the issue of governance, together with numerous round tables, are due to take place in Brussels tomorrow, on Thursday and on Friday. The President of the World Bank will take part in these. Seventeen African Heads of State or Government, countless ministers, experts, Mark Malloch Brown from the UNDP and others will also be present. They will all gather together in order to hold a genuine debate on governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How can we make States more able to provide? The experience that I have acquired in this area leads me to conclude that we will never manage to make a success of development if we do not simultaneously consolidate the States concerned. What applies to Europe – what has applied to Europe, what has applied to our countries – also applies to these countries. I believe, in fact, that if everything that is poured into our development policies is poured into failing States, the consequences will only be negative: a great deal of waste, heavy losses and heavy efficiency losses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have one final thought with which to conclude. As regards development, 75% of the resources that we devote to development are not used in order to bolster States’ budgets. Only 25% of our development expenditure is going to help States, and thus to consolidate them or to give them a chance to consolidate. The remaining 75% goes to parties with an indirect involvement. Admittedly, these parties are useful and important. They need to become partners. However, I find it difficult to hope that developing countries will be endowed with this ability to provide if they are only given a quarter of the development budgets. I recognise that this issue warrants a far-reaching, open debate, but, as everyone knows, I am in favour of a substantial increase in the quantity of budgetary aid.</p>

      <p sl="en">Thank you Commissioner. You have answered part of my supplementary question already. However, does the Commission not feel that rather than pay illegal immigrants to return home, thus encouraging higher levels of migration, it would be better to alleviate the conditions that forced them to leave their homeland in the first place? That, of course, would require much higher levels of development spending than we currently enjoy in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I have already answered that question. It is very complex. Indeed, if the idea is to say that a sum of money will be given to all those who want to leave behind their countries so as to make them stay, that amounts to implementing a widespread intervention system targeted at individuals. That has nothing to do with development. That is extremely dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, I support your idea – since it is also mine – that huge sums must obviously be invested in development projects that, for example, create jobs or work; I am thinking of labour intensive work, which we are, moreover, funding. If you take Rwanda, we are funding road building projects, which are directly carried out by the unemployed, by people who have been put to work, who admittedly earn just one and a half dollars a day, but who have a status, who work and who therefore provide for their families.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, I totally agree with you: maximum investment is obviously required for development, but on the conditions that I mentioned. I believe that to merely pour out resources without having a State that can govern, that can orchestrate all of that, will not amount to very much.</p>

      <p sl="de">May I start by remarking that I found the Commissioner’s views very refreshing. To move on to my specific question: migration and asylum policies in the EU create the impression that the majority of Member States have a policy of doing as they please, not doing what they are supposed to, and everyone joining in, even though we already know that a single European migration and asylum policy is probably the only sensible course of action. For this reason, I should like to ask what efforts the Commission is making towards a single migration policy, and how much longer it will be, in his opinion, before migration policy falls within the powers and responsibilities of the EU.</p>

Every time it makes proposals to unify, to align, the various laws and approaches of our Member States, the Commission – it really must be said – comes up against sharp divisions between our Member States. I therefore believe that things are moving forward, that progress is being made, but I also see the difficulties that exist when it comes to convincing the Member States to take concrete measures. Let us take the example of the efforts made by my colleague, Mr Frattini, to encourage the Member States to adopt a far more consistent and unifying policy. You are therefore absolutely right.

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Qualified majority for an area of freedom, security and justice, and for immigration</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Given the delays holding up the coming into force of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, and the prospect of a further enlargement which will make it still more difficult to adopt decisions unanimously, does the Council intend to push ahead with the legal changes required in order that decisions relating to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, or at least to immigration, can be taken by qualified majority, since there is an urgent need to develop fresh policies in this area?</p>

    <intervention id="2-332" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Paula Lehtomäki" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council that met last June asked the Finnish Presidency to work closely with the Commission to look into ways of improving decision-making and action in the area of freedom, security and justice on the basis of the current Treaties. The Commission has put forward several proposals for this in its communication ‘Implementing the Hague Programme: the way forward’. The proposals are being considered by the European Council, which is expected to return to them at its meeting in December.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The main proposal by the Commission for improving the decision-making process relates to the use of the passerelle clause under Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union. That would bring police cooperation and criminal justice within the framework of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The proposal was discussed at the informal meeting of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs this September, although it did not obtain the unanimous support it needed under Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union. The Presidency will be giving a report on this to the European Council in December.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would also ask the honourable Member to note that the Council gave a decision on 22 December 2004 on applying the codecision procedure in certain areas under Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which are measures referred to in Article 62(1), (2)(a), and (3) and Article 63(2)(b) and 3(b), which concern, for example, the lifting of checks at internal borders, checks at external borders, conditions relating to travel, sharing the burden of responsibility in matters to do with refugees, illegal immigration and illegal residence.</p>

      <p sl="es">At the moment we want to create a great Union market, a great area of freedom, security and justice. Theoretically there are external borders and then internal borders, but the external borders differ from State to State and, therefore, if decisions cannot be adopted in the Council in this area enabling immigration to be regulated in a uniform manner throughout the European Union, it will be impossible to create a great Union market.</p>
      <p sl="es">Do you think it will be possible to make progress at the December Council, at least on this point, in order to ensure that decisions relating to European immigration policy are not subject to unanimity, but to majority, in accordance with the ‘passarelle clauses’ that you have just referred to?</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is the Presidency’s aim specifically to strengthen the Union’s consistent and comprehensive immigration policy, which covers both legal and illegal immigration.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in September the Finnish Presidency proposed some Council draft conclusions on decent work. The proposal has now been debated by three Council preparatory bodies, where the discussions have been on social issues, questions relating to trade and questions relating to development cooperation, because decent work is a vital factor in all these three areas of policy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Council is expected to adopt its conclusions in December. The Presidency’s draft conclusions consider several matters with reference to the Commission communication on decent work, which the honourable Member mentions. Apart from proposing Council draft conclusions on decent work, the Council, during the Finnish presidential term, has spent a good deal of time and done a lot of work on the proposal for a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, something that has been examined by the European Parliament. Finland hopes that this will reach a conclusion as soon as possible so that the fund can be used to help employees who are likely to feel the negative impact of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">At the informal Council meeting of Employment, Social and Health Ministers in Helsinki on 6-8 July, the ministers present discussed how productivity might be improved by developing the quality of working life. They stressed the importance, for example, of the spiral of growth of decent work and labour productivity.</p>
      <p sl="fi">At the sixth ASEM Summit in Helsinki on 10 and 11 September, the Heads of State or Government acknowledged the need to strengthen the social dimension of globalisation and emphasised that productive employment, decent work, the rights of all employees, social welfare and dialogue in the labour market are decisively important for sustainable socio-economic development. ‘Decent work for all’ was also the main theme of the high-level segment of the meeting of the UN’s Economic and Social Council on 3-5 July 2006. The Commission is, moreover, organising a conference on decent work in Brussels on 4-5 December.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Action Programme for Decent Work covers freely chosen productive employment and a respect for rights at work, as well as labour standards, dialogue between the Social Partners, social security and gender equality. The Programme’s scope is an opportunity for the EU’s institutions, especially the European Council and the Council, as legislators, to examine, and encourage various bodies to examine, the notion of decent work in its entirety, both inside Europe and also in the context of Europe’s trade and development cooperation relations with third countries.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The social dimension of globalisation and decent work are the EU’s priority themes in its efforts to achieve consistency in development policy. When the cash in the European Development Fund is allocated, special attention needs to be paid to several issues, including that of decent work. Considerations relating to certain challenges posed by globalisation were also on the agenda at the Informal Tripartite Social Summit in Lahti in October.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: EU-India Free Trade Agreement</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 28 September 2006, the European Parliament's resolution on EU-India Trade and Economic Relations (P6_TA(2006)0388) received ‘overwhelming support’ from across the political spectrum of the House. The resolution makes clear that, whilst there will be no EU retreat from multilateralism, a Doha deal does not preclude a bilateral ‘WTO-Plus’ arrangement, which goes beyond what a lowest common denominator WTO deal could now provide. Does the Council agree that only through greater openness to strategic partnerships will the EU and India achieve our common ambitions in the areas that will dictate the terms of the 21st Century: protection of intellectual property rights, open markets for services and investment, and effective trade defence instruments? What is the Council's opinion of this resolution and, specifically, what is the Council's view of its recommendation for an EU-India Free Trade Agreement?

      <p sl="fi">The Seventh EU-India Summit in Helsinki on 13 October examined trade and economic relations between the parties. In particular, a report by the EU-India High Level Trade Group was examined. The Group was set up at the 2005 summit to look into how bilateral trade and investment relations could be developed and expanded.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Group recommended that a large-scale trade partnership be developed through talks on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement. It was also the Group’s view that a major, comprehensive agreement would also be of significant benefit to both the EU and India. The Group recommended that future talks should cover the areas set forth in the report, such as trade in goods and services, investment, the promotion of trade, public procurement, technical regulations, intellectual property and geographical indications, competition policy, and the settlement of disputes.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Discussions on this at the Summit were constructive and reflected support for the work of the Group. The EU-India Summit took a positive view of the Group’s work and backed its proposal for a future, comprehensive trade and investment agreement. The view was taken at the Summit that both parties should promote the start of negotiations on an agreement of this sort. Both parties are now holding internal discussions on this. The Summit was also confirmation of the undertaking and commitment on the part of both parties to achieve a strategic partnership and close cooperation, which has helped strengthen relations between the EU and India.</p>

So I would say again, as I did in answer to the previous question, that no such dinner was organised by the Finnish Presidency. Perhaps you should also check the calendar to see whether it was actually held this autumn.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I answered the first question and the question submitted in writing on behalf of the Council as a whole and with regard to what was discussed and debated at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 15 September 2006 and the matters on which consensus was reached.

      <p sl="unknown">Question no 6 by Nils Lundgren (H-0885/06)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: The Armenian genocide</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The President of France, Jacques Chirac, said in a speech in Armenia on 30 September that Turkey must acknowledge the genocide against the Armenians in order to become a Member of the EU. Chirac described an acknowledgement of the genocide as a precondition for future EU membership. On 3 October, the EU Commissioner for Enlargement, Olli Rehn, adopted the opposite position, stating that there was no need for Turkey to acknowledge the genocide in order to join the EU. It is after all the Council that accepts new members into the EU. Does the Presidency consider that Turkey must acknowledge the genocide against the Armenians? What is the Council's agreed position on this political issue?</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, accession negotiations with Turkey began when it was considered that that country met the Copenhagen political criteria. This means that Turkey is assumed to be complying with the reform process and endeavouring to bring in new reforms. As the negotiating framework adopted by the Council in October 2005 states, progress in the negotiations depends on Turkey’s progress in the implementation of reforms.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Council of the European Union will not adopt an opinion on the alleged genocide of Armenians in Turkey. Making historical judgments is the job of historians. The Union takes a positive view of certain initiatives, such as the conference in Turkey on the Armenian Question and Prime Minister Erdogan’s proposal to set up a joint Turkish-Armenian commission of historians to research the tragic events of 1915. The Union is enthusiastically encouraging Turkey to do all it can to improve relations with its neighbour Armenia, especially with regard to opening the border between the countries, which would be a very propitious move for the entire region.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It was this summer that the European Council last reconfirmed that it would adhere to its commitments on enlargement. No new criteria should be set midway though the negotiations process.</p>

A democratic state, which is unable to assess its own past, cannot be called democratic. I doubt that Turkey complies with the first Copenhagen criterion. Turkey also fails to meet other requirements, such as the specification of the Ankara Protocol to open Turkish ports to Member States of the European Union.

      <p sl="unknown">I would like raise your awareness of an unfortunate setback in the implementation of basic human rights in Poland. The Polish Selection Committee of the YOUTH Programme has decided to reject the European Voluntary Project on the grounds that it would ‘propagate homosexual behaviour and attitudes among young people’. This sort of statement is extremely discriminatory and against the fundamental rights of the European Union.</p>

Commitment on the part of the Member States of the Union to a respect for fundamental rights is also written into the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: UN Human Rights Council</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has concluded its second round of sittings without adopting any of the resolutions put before it. The debates were dominated by those countries which have a history of human rights abuse, and no leadership was given by those states which are deemed to be the defenders of human rights. Furthermore, although the reform seeks to confer powers to enable rapid action to be taken in the event of serious violations of human rights, the UNHRC failed to deliver an opinion on the situation in Darfur, the attacks on civilians in Sri Lanka, or the consequences of the violence in Lebanon and the occupied territories.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What is the Council's opinion of the outcome of the second sitting of the UNHRC? What role is the Council prepared to play in the UNHRC's deliberations? What measures are planned in order to tackle the challenges it faces if it wants to be an effective body?</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union took an active role in the first and second session of the Human Rights Council. The Human Rights Council should live up to the high expectations which the international community has set for it, and needs to employ effective and fruitful mechanisms to be able to fulfil all its tasks.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The European Union believes that it is too early to judge the work of the Human Rights Council properly. We are establishing a new body with new working methods and processes, and this will take time, patience and creativity. The Human Rights Council’s broad mandate covers the prevention of violations and the building of cooperation and resources, but urgent human rights situations also have a major role. Crucial to the new body’s role are cooperation and dialogue, which are contained in the UN General Assembly resolution, on the basis of which the Human Rights Council was established. The EU thus intends to continue to work steadfastly with other countries in the same spirit, and hopes that the other players involved are equally committed.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU’s view of the second session of the Human Rights Council is that it was a very positive achievement to hold discussions on situations on both certain matters and country situations, within the context of the Special Procedures, and with the UN’s human rights body. Allowing extra time for the Special Procedures was a major improvement in Human Rights Council practices. The quality of the dialogue and the large attendance figures were a tribute to the important role that the Special Procedures and the human rights body play within the human rights machinery, in that, for example, they bring the discussions closer to practical realities and act as an early warning system. This work needs to be developed in future sessions.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU welcomes the active participation of NGOs in the debate both on particular subjects and on national situations. The EU continues to support their active participation in all the work of the Human Rights Council. The EU supported the efforts made by Mr de Alba, President of the Human Rights Council, to draft a concrete ‘omnibus’ resolution, based on a consensus on Human Rights Council results, and relating to certain matters and urgent human rights situations. The EU regrets that the talks on the text did not lead to consensus. The EU is in favour of an approach based on consensus whenever possible, and worked very hard for this at the second session of the Human Rights Council. We will continue along this path in the future too.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It was a disappointment for the EU that no tangible results were achieved regarding the very serious human rights violations that have taken place in Darfur. Action on the part of the Council is also needed in other urgent situations, such as that in Sri Lanka. The EU intends to continue to be active so that the Human Rights Council can fulfil all the tasks within its mandate at future sessions.</p>

It confirmed its complete support in the Salzburg Declaration of March 2006 for the agenda set out at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003 and for furthering the Stabilisation and Association Process.</p>
      <p sl="fi">One of the major challenges this term has been how to ensure support for the current talks on the status of Kosovo, headed by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari.

      <p sl="fi">Since the referendum in Montenegro and the Republic of Montenegro’s declaration of independence, the European Union and its Member States have agreed to develop relations with Montenegro as a sovereign, independent country and have urged both Serbia and Montenegro to continue with their frank and constructive dialogue on future relations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Council welcomed the fact that the elections in the Republic of Montenegro went peacefully and without problems, and the recommencement of talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The Council stressed that the speed of progress of the talks and their conclusion depended in particular on Montenegro’s progress in implementing the necessary reforms.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Work has continued on bringing to conclusion the negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the elections in early October, the Council emphasised that recently elected political institutions needed to accelerate the implementation of all the reforms that were required for concluding the Agreement. The Council also welcomed the report by Javier Solana and Olli Rehn on a reinforced EU presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The purpose of reinforcing its presence is to prepare for, and put into effect, the move away from the current arrangement towards greater local responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Talks with Serbia will continue once it is seen to be cooperating fully with the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The Council repeated that a peaceful, prosperous Serbia, one that is a full ally of the European nations, is very important for the stability of the entire region.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In accordance with the commitments made at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003 and the Salzburg meeting in 2006, the Council has endeavoured to make closer ties to the EU more tangible, by, for example, increasing contact between people by means of agreements that facilitate the issue of visas concluded with all the countries in the Western Balkans. The mandate for negotiations for such agreements was adopted yesterday by the General Affairs and External Relations Council. Similarly, the mandate for negotiations was adopted for readmission agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Macedonia in the former Yugoslavia, Montenegro and Serbia. Albania already has a readmission agreement with the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Negotiations with all the Western Balkan countries are to start on 30 November in Brussels. The purpose is to bring the talks to conclusion as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community’s energy policy is based on the third pillar: security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability. Energy efficiency is a way to promote the achievement of these three main objectives of the Community’s energy policy. This we are aiming to bring about by, for example, improving security of supply by reducing our dependence on outside sources. In the same way, it is important to boost competitiveness in the European Union, so that new energy efficiency technologies can be developed, the position of industry in the Union in the field of energy-efficient products and services reinforced, and energy costs for companies and the authorities cut. To achieve these goals we also need to promote environmental sustainability, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the other adverse effects on the environment which result from the use of some forms of energy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Energy efficiency and energy saving may be regarded as both the cornerstone of the Community’s energy policy and a priority goal, which the Council has been committed to for a long time now. This commitment is clearly reflected in the legislative measures and other measures which have recently been adopted or which are to be adopted in the Council’s conclusions on energy efficiency and energy saving and in the conclusions by the Presidency adopted at the March and June 2006 European Council meetings.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Regarding research and development, the Council would like to refer the honourable Member to the proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme, about which there have been intensive discussions between the European Parliament and the Council. Energy efficiency is one of the objectives in the field of energy that we intend to promote. Special attention is to be paid to coordination of the views on the reasonable and efficient use of energy in the framework programme and in other Community policies and programmes.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As you will certainly know, the Council for its own part has already approved the results of the tripartite negotiations held on 26 October, meaning that efforts to reach agreement on the Seventh Framework Programme will be made at second reading. I believe that the Council and Parliament will continue to cooperate successfully and that it will be possible to adopt the Seventh Framework Programme by the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="fi">You will also certainly be aware of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme for the period 2007-2013, which was recently adopted and will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in the very near future. The budget for the ‘Intelligent Energy – Europe’ programme under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme is bigger than before, so it will help to make it easier to implement concrete action in the field of energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Among the legislative measures and other measures which have recently been adopted or which are to be adopted soon, it is worth mentioning in particular the European Parliament and Council Directive of 2005 for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-using products and the European Parliament and Council Directive of 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services. These two ambitious legal instruments, combined with the measures contained in the Action Plan on energy efficiency adopted by the Commission, will promote the realisation of the potential energy saving figure of 20% proposed by the Commission by the year 2020.</p>
      <p sl="fi">At its meeting of 23 November, the Council will hold a general discussion on the Commission document ‘Action Plan for Energy Efficiency: Realising the potential’ and adopt its conclusions on it. These conclusions will help serve as the basis for the Council’s instructions to the Commission, the Member States and other stakeholders for implementing the measures contained in the Commission’s Action Plan. Implementation of many of the measures proposed in the Commission’s Action Plan is one of the Council’s priority areas over the next few years.</p>

      <p sl="en">President-in-Office, thank you for the response to the question. I have two very brief supplementaries in regard to that.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Barroso said here today in Parliament that climate change and energy are some of the main challenges facing the European Union over the next ten years. One of the elements relating to energy efficiency is that if you turn off your television properly instead of leaving it on standby, you can save 25% of the electricity that is normally used for a television. Maybe, when we speak about design and energy-efficient design, those kinds of design features should be taken out of televisions and radios and computers, so that there is no standby.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, concerning the Stern report on economic environmental matters, I know you cannot speak on behalf of Finland but I also know it has one of the best records on alternative energy use and recovery of energy. The Stern report is quite explicit on the economic savings that can be made with regard to energy efficiency. Can we see legislative programmes directed towards that?</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, climate change has become a more and more important issue over time, not only in internal debates in the European Union, but also in the Union’s relations with third countries, and it was, for example, significant that the subject of climate change was likewise highlighted in the ASEM Summit resolution. Similarly, climate policy will be on the agenda at the European Council held next spring.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The International Energy Agency has predicted that world energy consumption in the last 30 years would have grown by around a third if measures had not been taken to increase energy efficiency. That shows that such measures result in reduced growth in the use of energy, so it is important to put them into effect. As far as the Union is concerned, it still has to be said that there are major differences between the Member States regarding the extent to which measures to boost energy efficiency have or have not been taken.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community’s programme of development cooperation with Mozambique, as with the other African, Caribbean and Pacific States, is accomplished via the European Development Fund. The Fund’s deployment is the responsibility of the Commission, which is the proper body to answer this question.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I can nevertheless say that Mozambique is one of the largest EU development cooperation recipient countries among the ACP countries, and its share of EDF funding is also one of the biggest in Africa. According to the information that we have received, appropriations for Mozambique this year will be approximately EUR 165 million. The proper body to provide information on EDF payments is the Commission, so I suggest that the honourable Member consults the competent body on this matter also.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Mozambique’s significant position as a recipient of development cooperation is obviously a clear reflection of the peaceful development that has taken place there and the successful transition which the country has gone through in the last 15 years since the conflict.</p>
      <p sl="fi">With regard to the honourable Member’s mention of additional funding from the EDF or the Community budget for the Clinton Foundation, this is naturally the responsibility of the Commission. I might say, however, that, to the best of my belief, several Member States also support work of this nature within the context of their national development cooperation programme, and, as the honourable Member referred to the example of Ireland, as minister responsible for development cooperation in Finland, I might add that Mozambique also plays an important role in Finland’s programme of bilateral development cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The presence of the European Union in Mozambique, in the shape of the Community and the Member States, is therefore important on the whole, because, as I have said, appropriations for Mozambique in the Community budget will be EUR 165 million this year, and the national presence of the Member States and the contribution they make are also undoubtedly considerable.</p>

    <intervention id="2-392" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Paula Lehtomäki" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is aware that Iceland has said it is recommencing commercial whaling despite the International Whaling Commission’s moratorium on whaling, in effect since 1984. This issue was discussed at the meeting of the Environment Council on 23 October under ‘any other business’.</p>
      <p sl="fi">On 10 October 2002 Iceland rejoined the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling of 1946, although it expressed reservations with respect to the whaling moratorium. As the honourable Member knows, membership of the International Whaling Commission is open to every country officially aligned to the 1946 Convention. Each Member State can decide itself whether to join an international convention devoted to matters that do not fall within the exclusive competence of the Community. Up till now 18 Member States of the European Union have joined the Convention, and they are also members of the International Whaling Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Commission has pledged to protect whales, as endorsed in the Habitats Directive. The Directive provides for high levels of protection for whales, at the same time banning any deliberate hunting and killing of whales in Community waters. In addition, the import of whale meat and other whale-derived products into the Community for primarily commercial purposes is tightly restricted under Council Regulation (EC) No 338 of 1977.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When Iceland declared that it would recommence commercial whaling, 15 EU Member States that belong to the International Whaling Commission and the European Commission, together with Australia, the United States of America and eight other like-minded countries, made official contact with Reykjavik, urging Iceland to comply with the moratorium and end its commercial whaling activities.</p>

However, it really proves the point that Iceland has close connections with the EU. I would urge the President-in-Office, in the time that she and her successors have left, to do everything they can to urge Iceland to not continue with the unnecessary and, I would say, cruel slaughter of one of the world’s great mammals for unproven reasons.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Oral Question to the Commission by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on gambling and sports betting in the internal market (O-0118/2006 - B6-0443/2006).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-398" speaker_id="2173" name="Arlene McCarthy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am not the author of the question but the Chairperson of the committee that is taking the question forward on behalf of Members. I want to stress that the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection took a unanimous decision to table this oral question to ask the Commissioner for an update regarding the ongoing infringement proceedings against nine Member States concerning restrictions imposed on sports betting markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">The committee would like the Commission to tell us in particular what progress has been made on the infringement proceedings launched on 4 April 2006 and what future steps are planned in this area. Is the Commissioner considering a legal framework for online gambling?</p>
      <p sl="en">As we are on the brink of agreeing the Services Directive, we are well aware of the need for Member States to fulfil their Treaty obligations under Article 49 as regards the free movement of services. The Commissioner will be aware of the committee’s decision to remove gambling services from the Services Directive, not least because of the complexity of the gambling market. However, the freedom to provide services has in the case of the gambling sector clashed with national law in a number of Member States, which have introduced restrictive laws limiting the cross-border supply of online betting and gambling services.</p>
      <p sl="en">We support the Commission in ensuring that these laws are compatible with Article 49, while respecting the rights of Member States to protect the public interest, as long as the rules are necessary, proportionate and non-discriminatory, i.e. not discriminating against other EU operators. It is hypocritical, on public interest grounds, for a Member State to prevent other EU online operators from entering a national market, while at the same time allowing its own national online market to grow considerably while not applying those public interest rules. That is the issue we hope the Commission will address.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to take the debate in a different direction. I believe that we need an EU response to the challenge of the global online gambling market. This is a market set to grow to a value of EUR 20 billion by 2010. In 2003, in the EU-25 commercial gaming industries, lotteries and casinos and betting services were worth some EUR 51.5 billion and there are some 2300 worldwide online casino sites. In the UK, for example, during the World Cup football matches, 30% of those making online bets on UK services were women. It crosses all classes and all generations. The rapid growth of online services and remote gambling and betting services has de facto already erased national boundaries.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, let us not follow the US model of pulling up the drawbridge by enacting the 2006 Bush legislation – the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, making it a crime for banks to process or transfer funds via online betting sites. This is simply protectionism hiding behind a smokescreen of the so-called protection of consumers against gambling excesses. In reality, it is a law to stop foreign operators from competing or undermining the US casino and gambling market, while the States of Nevada and Las Vegas continue to develop their own online and remote gambling services.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe it would be good if the Commissioner, on behalf of the 25 Member States, would engage in the campaign to get an international agreement on standards and rules in regulating eGambling. This is one way to minimise the differences between not only the international community but also the EU Member States, to ensure in the end that all states opt in to high standards both for operators and consumers. The objective would be to ensure that we develop standards to protect vulnerable consumers, in particular young adults and minors, to engender a sense of social responsibility from good operators and investors and to ensure that gambling is not used as a source of crime or financing criminal activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The internet genie is out of the bottle: some 3.3 million EU citizens are regular online gamblers. This is a market that will grow. The EU should therefore be part of a wider international campaign for good and high standards. We need greater international cooperation to curb problem gambling and more research into the extent of participation in remote gambling. The study commissioned by the European Commission on gambling services in the internal market highlights the need to find common international standards and regulatory requirements that will protect EU citizens while allowing the market to operate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope the Commissioner will feel encouraged by tonight’s debate to continue with infringement proceedings. However, in reality, it is a thankless task, which takes years to resolve, often not with a satisfactory conclusion, and I believe the best way forward is for the EU now to be a leader, driving good and high common international standards that can help minimise the differences, protect consumers and force the operators to be socially responsible.</p>

    <intervention id="2-399" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Charlie McCreevy" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, gambling services are clearly services within the scope of the Treaty, and Treaty principles, including those on the freedom of establishment and the freedom of services, apply to gambling. The Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States’ legislation is fully compatible with the Treaty. Therefore the Commission decided in April to ask seven Member States for more information on their legislation that restricts the supply of sports betting services. The Commission has responded to a number of complaints from operators in the sports betting area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having met with the authorities of all seven Member States, my services are now examining the formal replies received from each. At this stage I cannot pre-empt the outcome of that examination. I should like to inform Parliament that I expect that to be completed in the next few weeks. Based on that examination I would put forward a proposal to the college of Commissioners on how to proceed. It would then be a matter for them to decide on the next steps.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to the seven cases opened in April, the Commission decided, on 12 October, to send formal requests for information related to the gambling sector to three other Member States. Complaints from operators, to which the Commission is responding, relate mainly to sports betting services. That is why nine of the ten cases opened so far related to the provision of sports betting services, some of them online. However, in October the Commission also enquired about national legislation in Austria, which prohibits advertisements from casinos licensed and operating in other Member States. We also have concerns that Austrian legislation requires national casinos to protect only nationals from excessive losses, without having similar protection for foreign players.</p>
      <p sl="en">As guardian of the Treaty, the Commission will examine all complaints that it receives. However, at the same time I do not underestimate the sensitivities that exist in many Member States on the question of gambling. Member States are fully entitled to protect general interest objectives, such as the protection of consumers. However those measures must be necessary, proportionate and non-discriminatory. In particular, they must be applied to national and non-national operators in a systematic and consistent way.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission does not seek to liberalise the market in any way, but rather to be assured that whatever measures Member States have in place are fully compatible with existing EU law. Member States are well aware of the case law of the European Court of Justice, which I expect will develop further.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission accepted Parliament’s request to exclude all gambling services from the scope of the draft Services Directive. It was made quite clear to me at that time that the regulation of gambling should be left to the Member States. I fully agree, provided that such national legislation is compatible with the Treaty. In the context of the infringement proceedings I am willing to work in close cooperation with the Member States to ensure compatibility of national legislation with Community requirements and allow for appropriate and effective protection to be put in place, for example to safeguard consumers and to protect minors.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, would you allow me to make a point first, before you start the clock. According to the agenda, this debate was scheduled to start at 10.30. That was quite clear and I notice that a number of my colleagues made an effort to be here at 10.30. So I am disturbed to find that I missed most of the speech of my colleague Mrs McCarthy, because the debate appears to have started at least ten minutes early. I do not think that is acceptable, if I may say so, and I am sorry that your predecessor in the Chair has gone away. If the schedule for the day says a debate starts at 10.30, I submit to you that it should start at 10.30, even if there has to be a short adjournment.</p>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps I could now move on and if you will restart the clock, please, I shall make my substantive points.</p>
      <p sl="de">I very much welcome the fact that Mr McCreevy is here to address this issue and I am pleased that, under the leadership of Mrs McCarthy, we have taken an initiative that I hope will shed some light on this issue. As the Commissioner made clear, this is a highly sensitive issue and it involves many aspects of public interest. But nevertheless, from the point of view of the operation of the Single Market, which is also of overriding interest to us, the situation is, as you suggested, deeply unsatisfactory.</p>
      <p sl="de">Clearly we await the results of your investigations but I suggest that, at the very least, it would be appropriate for you to issue some form of guidelines to Member States on their attitude to receiving applications from reputable and well-established gambling operators who simply want to be able to operate in other EU countries under the law of those countries, which they are perfectly entitled to do. One of the things you did not mention, but which seems to me to be rather extraordinary in terms of discriminatory practice, is that some Member States have tried to restrict access to those markets on the grounds that they do not want to encourage gambling. Yet at the same time those Member States are promoting participation in their national lotteries with billions of euros across Europe. Clearly that is entirely inconsistent. I believe it is sensible and good that the European Court of Justice has struck down some of the restrictions, but I think those guidelines will be important. As Mrs McCarthy said, in terms of operation and protecting the public interest respectable operations are extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="de">The big issue that we have to face is online gambling. Whether Member States want to preserve a monopoly or not, the fact is that consumers are taking advantage of online gambling. I believe it is much better, in the public interest, that we have well-regulated online gambling services than uncontrolled services which come into Europe from other countries outside the remit of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘Rien ne va plus’ [‘No more bets’] is the curious opening of the recent opinion delivered by the Advocate General Dámaso Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer to the European Court of Justice, which had been asked to rule for the third time on Italian legislation on gambling, following the Zenatti ruling and the Gambelli ruling, the latter rightly referred to in the recitals of the oral question under discussion.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is truly important to be familiar not only with the Commission’s findings, but also with the recent measures by the Member States against whom infringement proceedings have been opened, and, specifically, the steps that the Commission intends to take. I believe that it is also important for there to be moderate but definite rules in this sector, also involving the European Parliament directly. That is the only way to help Member States exposed to the risk of appeals and negative judgments in what remains a worthy attempt to protect individuals, in particular minors and the most vulnerable, as has already been said.</p>
      <p sl="it">The explosion of gambling, lotteries and online betting is a problem that cannot be left to market liberalisation, even if the difficulty concerning the non-discrimination principle is obvious. I must just point out that the ‘Services Directive’, which has already been referred to here, excludes gambling precisely for reasons of public order and consumer protection.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I thank the Commissioners and my fellow Members for taking the trouble to discuss this topic, which is, after all, an exciting one. We have left gambling and Internet gambling outside of the Services Directive because we do not dare take a decision on it. It still falls within the scope of Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty and at the moment – as is also evident from the 11 infringement procedures – there is enormous legal uncertainty among the Member States and businesses. How should we tackle it?</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am pleased that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has put this oral question, for the problems are, after all, real. There is the problem that on the one hand, it is very lucrative for the Member States in terms of tax revenue, but on other hand, it also brings with it social problems. The main problem, though, is that, if there is no sound legal framework in place within a market where serious money can be made, this opens the floodgates to a huge number of illegal practices in which criminal organisations reign supreme.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore believe that the politicians, and I hope that the Commissioner will agree with me on this, must take up the gauntlet and dare take decisions. We must not surrender ourselves to the very wise judges in Luxembourg who then have the onerous task of biting the bullet. I fear that many more judgments from the European Court of Justice will follow as long as we as politicians do not take the right decisions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I hope that the Commission and the Council will get there in the end. If not, I hope that Parliament itself will produce an own-initiative report in order to guarantee legal certainty, which is desperately needed given the many problems that exist, including addiction, public health problems, illicit funds, money laundering, and the list goes on. We must solve this with a firm, clear directive on gambling and Internet gambling. I hope that the Commissioner will advise us as to how Parliament should tackle this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner's statement that we must protect minors. To do that it is imperative to take a long hard look at Ireland’s policy of having no age limit on gambling with the state-run tote. Children in Ireland are permitted to place bets at greyhound tracks and horse tracks if these are part of that tote. Other forms of gambling are limited to over-18s. Video evidence exists of Irish children as young as four years of age legally placing bets with the state-run tote. It is not uncommon for birthday, Christmas and first communion money to wind up in the Irish state tote and, ultimately, with the Irish Exchequer.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Chief Executive of Horse Racing Ireland, when asked his opinion of child gambling in Ireland, said that it was no problem and that he wanted to develop the customer of the future. For years you, Commissioner McCreevy, as Irish Minister for Finance, refused to amend the Tote Act and outlaw child betting in Ireland. As Commissioner, will you now change your attitude and, at this late date, support restrictions on child online betting, at race tracks, in bookmakers, on airplanes and anywhere else that this insidious practice persists?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, from the very first vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we decided to leave gambling activities, including lotteries and bets, outside of the scope of the Services Directive. It may be that some, as Mr Manders said a moment ago, were frightened of taking a decision. I am convinced that many felt that the Member States could be given quite a bit of freedom to handle this complex issue in their own way, in tune with the sensitivities and the situations in their countries, according to their own traditions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It goes without saying that, in this respect, the Member States should respect the Treaty, and we already know the answer of the Court to a number of prejudicial questions that have previously been asked. I hope, Commissioner, that the questions that are yet to be asked will not immediately prompt you to advise the Commission to start issuing rules and regulations. Whilst the Commission is, of course, the guardian of the Treaties, and we expect it to take its role seriously, this can also be done with some restraint.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Getting the internal market to operate is necessary and positive in every respect, but this need not be at the expense of the effective protection of law and order, security and the consumer’s mental health. I hope there will also be room for the Member States which, via state monopolies or not, as the case may be, commit to channelling the passion for gambling, monitor the fairness of the game and to donate the financial gain, as and when they can, for cultural, social and sports goals. Clear legal rules can certainly help, but legislation is not always the answer.

      <p sl="es">I do not understand how it can be possible for supranational bodies now to be planning to impose a liberalisation of gambling services on the Member States, when the majority of our societies do not accept it.</p>
      <p sl="es">The United States Congress recently banned on-line gambling, and it seems to me that, at the moment, we should follow the US example in the European Union, on the one hand, in order to protect our consumers from mafia organisations and, secondly, in order to protect all those social institutions in each of the Member States that currently rely on legal forms of gambling permitted by national authorities.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore believe that the Commission is right to look into the issue of gambling, but it must deal with it from the point of view of consumer protection and the protection of the institutions currently benefiting from legal gambling in the majority of our Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Commissioner McCreevy has also had an extremely tiring day today, and so he will understand our desire to present the matter to him with the necessary clarity and brevity.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my personal opinion, gambling and the abundance of lotteries have two different elements. On the one hand, there is the truly cross-border market for online providers that can only be regulated at European level. As Mr Medina-Ortega pointed out, the US has already managed to regulate its market. Europe, too, can resolve the issue of the online market only by joining with the Member States and introducing Europe-wide regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, there is the market in traditional games of chance and traditional sports betting, which tend to take place in written form. In contrast to the infringement proceedings opened by the Commission – Commissioner McCreevy, in other words – we should proceed according to the principle that, if the Member States are succeeding in preventing addiction effectively by orienting their national monopolies towards a range of services that is as limited as possible and offers the greatest possible consumer protection, they should be given the chance to retain these monopolies in future – under the control and auspices of European law and the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">It must be ensured, however, that the monopolies that the Member States already have truly pursue just one objective, namely the prevention of addiction, and that Member States do not use them to pursue other objectives, such as aiding the recovery of public finances or promoting sport.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context, I would be delighted if Parliament and the Commission together could agree on a regime that, on the one hand, establishes European regulation of the online market and, on the other, maintains the national regulations in the field of monopolies for traditional sports betting, provided these are compatible with the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the exclusion of gambling, including lotteries, from the Services Directive appeared to have introduced a measure of clarity to the sector, but we need to go further. We are aware of a number of complicated aspects involving certain types of gambling and betting. It is therefore necessary to guarantee consumer protection and to ensure effective monitoring of the financial circuits relating to such activities in order to prevent or combat money laundering.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Naturally, we must not confuse the appropriate protection of the consumer with the undue protectionism that any particular Member State may want or may employ. In any event, however, it should be pointed out that every Member State has the right to regulate the phenomenon of betting for money on its territory until such time as another, European-level legal instrument appears. In this regard, online gambling deserves special attention from the Commission and immediately from Parliament, as previous speakers have mentioned and as is clear from the debate. Lastly, I welcome the fact that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection raised this issue, with the result that we have made some progress in clarifying it this evening.</p>

    <intervention id="2-410" speaker_id="28198" name="Jacques Toubon" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am going to try to be both quick and slow. This report is timely, and I might add that I consider the remarks made just now to be positive. Everyone would like the European Union to intervene using methods other than simple case-law. This issue does, in fact, involve a range of businesses and services: casinos, lotteries and other games of chance via traditional means or via the Internet. Therefore, this goes far beyond simple online sporting bets, which is the subject of Mrs McCarthy’s question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While it is normal for these services to apply the principles of the internal market, Commissioner, freedom should not go hand in hand with the law of the jungle! For reasons to do with the general interest, health, morality and security, these services need to be regulated and controlled. The Member States must be able to authorise and control public and private operators in the context of fair competition. The importance of ‘cross-border’ games does, however, require us to go beyond the national framework. In this regard, the recent decision taken by the United States is the demonstration that, if those who play and who make others play cannot be controlled, then it is better to take too many precautions than not enough.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, Commissioner, I consider the Commission’s current approach, which is based exclusively on the Treaties and on the Court of Justice, to be inadequate and dangerous. It is clear today that the idea that the national laws are compatible with the Treaties is an unsatisfactory one. Commissioner, you must work alongside Parliament to establish complementary legislation that can organise this extremely important sector, both politically and economically, in a sound and rational manner. Let this sector develop, but let it do so in complete safety for the people and for the Member States!</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, over recent years the system of the state monopoly in the gambling sector, which prevails in the majority of the Member States of the European Union, has been on the receiving end of more and more attacks from mainly private interests.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the European Union summit in Edinburgh in December 1992, the European Council decided, given the principle of subsidiarity, not to regulate gambling and to leave it under the sole jurisdiction of the Member States. The directive adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2000 makes provision for the express exemption of gambling from its scope. The draft 2006 directive on services makes precisely the same provision. Given the peculiarities of the gambling sector, the Court of Justice of the European Communities acknowledges the competence of the Member States to regulate the gambling market in what they consider to be the best way possible.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most important reasons for these decisions is the fact that there is a high degree of risk of addition inherent in the gambling sector, especially of young people, and of crimes being committed, such as fraud, money laundering and so on, and I personally believe that only the state can create the control, guarantee, reliability and transparency mechanisms needed in order to protect consumers.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I am of the opinion that, once the gambling market is liberalised, the system of support for sports in Europe will collapse, taking cultural and social actions and subsidies with it, such as the fight against drugs, education and support for people with disabilities or special needs who mainly have financial support from the state gambling organisation. We believe in the free market, but do not occasionally ignore the risks inherent in uncontrolled gambling.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, for regulatory reasons, we have exempted games of chance and casinos from the Services Directive. I say this despite being a firm supporter of strengthening the internal market. We did not want to throw the baby out with the bath water, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, there are many risks associated with games of chance, and so the argument regarding competition law and the internal market should not be the only one used by the Commission in support of infringement proceedings.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, a clear definition is needed. When we talk about ‘games of chance’, what is covered by the term? Given the differences in the treatment of online markets, sports betting, machines, casinos and lotteries, a single definition is needed to ensure these are dealt with the same way everywhere, and a single legal framework is probably also required.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, I should like to point out to the Commissioner that there are other important fields, too, to be taken into consideration, such as consumer protection, health, taxation, international trade, the problem of money laundering, the prevention of addiction and the fight against crime, including organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fifthly, almost all Member States regulate the field of games of chance. Eleven have special legislative models, and four use the limited-licence model.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sixthly, in 2004, state lotteries achieved sales of EUR 63 billion, which is an average per capita net expenditure of EUR 140.</p>
      <p sl="de">Seventhly, that means that approximately 33% of all takings go on good causes and tax. In the event of liberalisation of the private sector this would be just 3%.</p>
      <p sl="de">Eighthly, it is estimated that the industry generates approximately 13 billion jobs in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ninthly, the sale of lottery tickets accounts for 195 000 jobs within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would ask the Commissioner to consider these arguments when making his assessment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to make one point. Much attention has been paid in this debate to young people and the effects of gambling addiction on them, and yet more people under the age of 12 are trafficked or forced into prostitution because of drug or alcohol addiction and abuse than the gambling addiction that is the subject of our debate tonight.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-414" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Charlie McCreevy" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">There is no specific Community legislation governing gambling. If and how Member States wish to regulate gambling services at national, regional or local level is therefore a matter for each Member State to decide for itself. But the general principles of Community law and the Treaty continue to apply and any national legislation must respect those principles. The diversity of national approaches can lead to legal uncertainty for service providers and their customers, especially where national legislation fails to respect Community law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tonight’s debate helps to illustrate once more the diversity of opinion with regard to gambling services. I am, of course, aware of calls for a specific Community regulatory framework for gambling services. There are equally strong views opposing such Community intervention. In my experience, the first requirement in trying to find a solution is to have a clear understanding of the problem and of the policy options available. The Commission recently published a study carried out on its behalf by the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law. The study illustrates the complexity and diversity of national regulatory approaches. Should Parliament believe that, over and above our efforts to ensure the application of fundamental Treaty principles, more should be done to ensure legal clarity, I look forward to hearing Parliament’s detailed views on what precisely the issues are that warrant Community intervention and what policy options would command a sufficient degree of consensus for a meaningful solution at Community level. In the absence of such a political consensus, legal certainty may ultimately only be provided by the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to add just a few more words to this debate. Mr Harbour put it fairly succinctly when he made the point that there was a great deal of inconsistency amongst many of the Member States, against whom we are now taking some action. We shall probably be taking action against some more. If Member States, their governments and their legislatures want to have very restrictive laws on gambling, etc., they may do so on public policy grounds. But they cannot do the things that Mr Harbour has referred to. They cannot spend millions and millions advertising gambling services for their own national operators or their own national, publicly-owned operators. They cannot allow their own national operators and bar everybody else. If Member States feel, as some Members of this House obviously do, that gambling is a greater scourge than alcohol addiction, tobacco addiction and all these other addictions put together, then they should ban it for everybody and allow no gambling at all in their Member State. That is one option. Then nobody would complain. The Commission would not take action against them and no one would worry about it at all. But it is a bit hypocritical for Member States to allow millions to be spent promoting gambling and at the same time allow nobody else to play the game.</p>
      <p sl="en">In all Member States gambling is regulated to some extent. The point made by Mrs McCarthy about international standards for online gambling is quite a good idea in itself, but first some form of consensus would be needed among the 25 Member States. We can start by getting consensus in this Parliament, but I do not think we will. I am certain that we will not get it in the Council of Ministers. I have about the same chance of getting consensus in the Council of Ministers and Parliament as I have of winning the lottery this weekend. Those would be the odds against it. So there is much to commend what Mrs McCarthy says, and if there was a consensus I would like to go in that direction, but my experience tells me that it would be very difficult.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you read the executive summary in the recent study, which, if I am correct, comes to 51 pages, and save yourself reading the other couple of hundred pages, it does not come down heavily on one side or the other.</p>
      <a text="(comments off-microphone from Mr Toubon)"/>
      <p sl="en">Well, I do not think my honourable friend Mr Toubon has read the report, but you can see from that how complex this problem is and the many different ways it is regulated. It will show you what a gargantuan task it would be to head down that road.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my political life I have not been afraid to take on impossible causes and tilt at windmills and run into brick walls, but I think that if we did attempt some kind of harmonisation of this area, what we would end up with, if anything, would be the most illiberal piece of legislation ever to go through any House anywhere in the world, because it is not possible. I have recognised for a long time that there are great differences of opinion here, long before I came to this conclusion. I recognise that throughout Europe, and even in my home country, there would be very different views about this. Some people, I know, think that it is worse than drinking addiction, worse than tobacco addiction, worse than anything possible, but others do not. I know which category I fit into, but I think trying to get some harmonisation in this area is going to be a long, long process.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0372/2006) by Mr Joan i Marí, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on a new framework strategy for multilingualism (2006/2083(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-419" speaker_id="28412" name="Bernat Joan i Marí" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the colleagues who helped me draw up this report, and especially the members of the Committee on Culture and Education. I also wish to thank Commissioner Figeľ, who has kept in contact with us, for his positions on plurality and on the issues related to minority languages, etc. Thanks are also due to all the other colleagues, from several groups, and other people involved in the report, especially the members of the various NGOs for the normalisation of languages who were in contact with us during the preparation of the report. I would like to mention in particular Vicent Santaló, a member of the legal staff at the Catalan Parliament, who worked with us until his death last summer.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main aim of this report is to move forward the concept of plurality in languages. Plurality and diversity are common values of the European Union. There should be unity among all Europeans in this area, which should have plurality as one of its main aims, because a non-plural Europe is a false and devalued Europe. This is reflected in a certain manner in languages. As you know, in sociolinguistic terms there are ‘normalised’ languages, which are the fully official languages used in all walks of our lives. There are also ‘minorised’ languages, which are not fully official and cannot be used for every purpose, despite the fact they are the main languages in specific language communities. There is also a third group, which is that of minority languages. All these groups must be respected and preserved, and the preservation of language diversity is one of the aims of the European Institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europeans are not as multilingual as we think. Unfortunately, many European citizens have only one language – usually their mother tongue – and one of the main goals of the European Union is to have a citizenship able to speak several languages. In order to achieve that, it is very important for there to be a change in mentality. Our society was formed under the influence of Jacobinist states. Most European states are unilingual officially, and this is a remnant of Jacobinism. However, this is not a true reflection of the facts. The aim of the European Union is not to maintain this point of view, but to preserve genuine plurality and work towards citizens being able to speak several languages.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need a European language policy. That policy should promote multilingualism, improve the language skills of European citizens across the European Union and preserve all languages, whether or not they are official EU languages. To this end, the budget and European programmes must support not just the main languages, but all languages, in order to improve diversity. In this way we must make a special effort to support endangered languages. Every language is good for mankind, and if a language is lost we have all lost something because each language has its own unique expressions. It is for this reason that we must preserve genuine plurality and true diversity. In this sense, it is necessary to draw up a full report on the actions still to be developed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Joan i Marí for his excellent report on the Commission communication relating to a new framework strategy for multilingualism. Not only the framework strategy, but also the report has been drawn up in the spirit of diversity and unity. That should be the leading line in our implementation of policies in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sure we would all like to see a multilingual European society in which the rate of individual multilingualism steadily increases until every citizen has practical skills and at least two languages in addition to their mother tongue. That is the famous ‘Mother tongue plus two’ formula agreed by EU leaders in Barcelona in 2002.</p>
      <p sl="en">I recently set up the internal multilingualism network in the European Commission and established the High Level Group on Multilingualism. These are both implementation initiatives under the new framework strategy for multilingualism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another priority is to develop early language learning. If we want to build a multilingual society we have to start as soon as possible. We have to ensure that language learning in pre-school and primary school is effective, for that is where key attitudes towards languages and cultures are formed. The new lifelong learning programme will offer a wide range of funding possibilities for projects promoting language awareness, for access to language learning resources, as well as for networks contributing to the development of language policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the first time the education and training programme has, as a specific objective, the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity. For the first time also, a transversal action will support multilateral projects and networks in that field. These are new opportunities open to all the languages spoken in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now say a few words on the European indicator for language competence. That was one of the subjects in another recent communication from the Commission. The first meeting of the advisory board took place just two weeks ago, at the end of October. The experts attending the meeting, representing 22 countries, showed much interest and consensus on taking forward the establishment of that indicator.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to note that the report by Mr Joan i Marí recognises the Commission’s efforts to promote language learning and linguistic diversity in the European Union. The report contains a thorough analysis of our framework strategy to create a multilingual society and acknowledges our commitment to achieving the objectives stated in our communication.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for his inspiring report, and would stress that the Commission is determined to pursue the ideas and actions set out in this new strategy for multilingualism in our Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the debates on multilingualism and on the protection of regional and minority languages and the use of languages in the European institutions always lead people to adopt firm positions, which are sustained by underlying political conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This own initiative report, which, let us remember, is aimed at implementing a new framework strategy for multilingualism, has the virtue of extending the debate that was already begun with the Ebner and Bayona report in 2003 and the Portas report in 2005, on regional and minority languages and on the learning of languages by immigrants. Parliament is thus called upon to confirm its previous positions or to amend them in view of the changing situation, for fear of contradicting itself. We tried hard, during the course of our work, to strike a balance that was acceptable to all parties, as was reflected by the outcome of the votes in committee, and, in doing so, we took account of the acquis, and also put the issue of multilingualism into perspective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore call on my fellow Members to act wisely and not to fight the wrong battle. Languages must be the link between the citizens of Europe, not the weapon used to create divisions and to sow discord.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My country, Luxembourg, is the only Member State, the only founder country, whose national language is not recognised as an official European language. Yet, the government of Luxembourg has decided not to request official language status, as it believes that multilingualism is our future. We were given language and intelligence in order to listen to each other, not to fight each other.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sixty-five years ago, on 10 October 1941, the people of Luxembourg had to take part in a referendum organised by the Nazi occupiers, for which they were asked to specify their race, ethnicity and language. Their response to the three questions was: Luxemburgish. As punishment, they were forced to enrol in the occupying army and deported to the concentration camps. The fact remains that, after the war, the generation of victims accepted the fact that German, together with French, was the main language taught at school. Luxemburgish has successfully developed and is doing well. As for our future, I hope that Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which requires the Union to respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity, protects us from any arbitrariness.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased that a framework strategy has been put in place for multilingualism in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our motto, ‘United in diversity’ is a testament to the importance of the diversity of cultures, of customs, of beliefs and also of languages, to the construction of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Charter of Fundamental Rights has made respect for linguistic diversity one of our fundamental values. This principle does not just apply to the official languages, but also to the many regional and minority languages spoken within the Union, including those of immigrant communities.</p>
      <p sl="es">This rich co-existence of different linguistic communities in Europe sometimes leads to extreme difficulties within the day-to-day working practices of the Community institutions. Despite the fact that all languages are of equal importance from a cultural point of view, it makes no sense to take the view that the European Union's institutions could operate if it were using all of them at the same level.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that progress on the promotion, defence and knowledge of this linguistic diversity must be supported by the Member States by means of active policies for promoting and defending languages in education and in the more social realm, including in the media, and the promotion of the learning of at least two foreign languages, with a view to facilitating knowledge of other cultures, promoting mobility and increasing awareness amongst the European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, within the Community institutions, it must be possible for communication between the citizens and the Union to be carried out in their mother tongues. Furthermore, in order to make the use of mother tongues compatible with the day-to-day work of the institutions, we must establish different uses for the different languages and it is in this area that we must work towards agreeing on the basic criteria to use in order to reach a consensus on these working languages, without forgetting any element, either cultural, the number of speakers or the status of the languages in their respective States.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that the new Commissioner responsible for multilingualism, Mr Leonard Orban, agrees with this idea and will work in that direction.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to welcome the Commission's first communication dealing with multilingualism and setting major objectives for the European Union’s linguistic diversity: to promote language learning and a beneficial multilingual economy, as well as to provide all EU nationals with the opportunity to familiarise with the Community laws and other information in their mother tongue.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Today, the European Union represents 450 million people from various ethnic, cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Therefore, the benefits of foreign language knowledge are obvious. Language helps to understand different lifestyles and opens a door to cultural tolerance. Moreover, language competence helps in work, study, travel and communication anywhere in the world.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Foreign language learning should start at a very early age, when the human brain is most receptive to taking in new information. This is my firm opinion as a medical doctor. Thus far, various surveys show that almost half of respondents admit to knowing only their native language. Thus, we have a long-term objective that cannot be postponed. At least 84% of Europeans agree that each EU national should know at least one foreign language. Consequently, we have great support from the society, the importance of which is increasingly acknowledged when adopting laws in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="lt">On the other hand, we must not forget the old European languages, of which my native Lithuanian language is one of the oldest. I would like to emphasise the importance of preserving such languages in the context of European linguistic diversity. We should not only learn foreign languages, but also keep in mind another challenge – preserving and cherishing the old European languages by legally ensuring their rights.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I see the multilingual European as an educated person, who is able to live in a country other than his or her native land and who speaks foreign languages for professional reasons, and is willing to undertake further study. Sadly, quite a large part of the European society still fails to benefit from multilingualism, and the motivation of citizens to learn foreign languages is not very strong. We should promote that by any and all available means.</p>

      <p sl="es">If the Union wants to be true to its slogan ‘United in diversity’, it must give multilingualism pride of place, going beyond just the official languages.</p>
      <p sl="es">Just as protecting biodiversity is and must be a central value in our current societies, the protection of linguistic diversity must be seen as a central element of progress, the promotion of peace and development.</p>
      <p sl="es">Given that many of today's armed conflicts are the results of violations of cultural rights, linguistic rights and identities, it is urgent that we look upon promoting multilingualism as a tool for promoting dialogue, understanding and peace.</p>
      <p sl="es">Though this is important in the world in general, it is particularly important in a European Union which aspires one day to move on from being a Union of values to being a political Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">I want to thank Mr Joan i Marí for the work he has undertaken. I hope that the adoption of the amendments he has put forward can provide a basis for a meaningful EU language policy. As the rapporteur has said, we need to improve language skills and to maintain the whole range of European languages.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colleagues may be aware that Dublin will host an important conference on 24 November, entitled ‘The Legacy of the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages and the Future of Lesser-Used Languages in the EU’. It is important that NGOs such as the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages receive continued funding and that there is project funding for languages as well, particularly languages that are in danger.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully support calls for an EU language plan, for project funding for the most endangered languages, for the Ebner report to be implemented in full, for the EU Ombudsman to have an explicit mandate to act in cases of language-based discrimination, and for a working party to be set up that can work towards giving a legal base to the concept of respect for linguistic diversities.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the draft resolution on the new framework strategy on multilingualism deserves particular attention, as language is the basis of a nation’s culture and a resource that we must make use of. That is the reason why we pay close attention to all attempts to interfere in multilingualism in the European Union and react to all attempts to restrict it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is with satisfaction that we accept the initiative to set up a European language competence index, but on condition that this initiative covers all official EU languages, and will not be restricted in undertakings and in studies to five languages only. For these reasons, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I tabled an amendment to Article 6 deleting those sections that detract from the idea of multilingualism and which allow the possibility of restricting studies just to five particular languages.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, because otherwise this document which is so important and so essential for multilingualism, will not reflect the full intentions and tendencies that inspire us.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, one year ago, in its first Communication on multilingualism, the European Commission set three entirely reasonable objectives: to promote language learning and linguistic diversity, to promote a multilingual economy, with the resulting improvement in work mobility and the competitiveness of the European economy, and to provide all of the citizens with access to information on the Union in their own languages.</p>
      <p sl="es">Everybody is aware of the close relationship between this Communication and the general European objective that we set at the Barcelona Council in 2002 of ensuring that children learn at least two foreign languages in addition to their mother tongue.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is precisely this that the report that this Parliament will vote on tomorrow must deal with; offering the 450 million European citizens a wide range of tools to allow them to learn languages and hence to enjoy the immense social, economic and cultural advantages of participating in our great integration project, a project rich in national histories, languages and cultures, which today represents a dream of unity in diversity, benefiting all of the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">The rapporteur’s opportunistic attempt to use the report to make nationalistic proposals in his own personal interest is entirely inappropriate and entirely undermines the purpose of the Communication.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this regard, we should welcome the result of the work carried out by the Committee on Culture and Education, which has shown responsibility and good sense by using its amendments to redirect the initial text and its ideologically biased approach. The rapporteur’s radical intentions are demonstrated by the fact that he has ended up voting against his own report in committee.</p>
      <p sl="es">Respect for diversity is one of the Union’s principles, but using languages to split up States along ethnic and linguistic lines is an outrage that we in the Group of the European Peoples Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats will always vigorously oppose.</p>

      <p sl="et">Ladies and gentlemen, in the Middle Ages, my home city of Pärnu, like the other Hanseatic cities, traded with Russia, Germany and the Scandinavian countries. Every merchant had to know the four local languages. I concur with the idea that pervades this report – Europeans should know two other languages in addition to their native tongue. Language proficiency considerably accelerated the Estonians’ reintegration into Europe after the Soviet occupation.</p>
      <p sl="et">The ability to understand one another’s language and culture will help Europe’s sense of cohesion to overcome problems caused by the expansion of the European Union and by immigration. There is an Estonian saying – the more languages, the more lives. In the European Union, many people live many lives. People go to other Member States either to work temporarily or to live permanently. Many of the Member States’ significant national minorities became established in the post-World War II era of reconstruction.</p>
      <p sl="et">My mother tongue is one of those European languages that are spoken by one million people. The report emphasises that small languages must be protected. I would like to add that they must be protected not only from the major languages of the European Union, but also from major languages from beyond Europe. Here I refer to Russian. By offering the motivation to learn in addition to language learning, we would alleviate the problems that have been very clearly identified by second- and third-generation immigrants in Germany, France and the Baltic States. They are far from the land of their birth, and they are also unable to participate sufficiently in the culture and life of their new homeland due to their poor linguistic proficiency. In such conditions, the costly efforts to enable official business to be conducted in major languages from beyond Europe are counter-productive, even detrimental.</p>
      <p sl="et">While language learning is the most important means of integration, it is also time-consuming, and must be embarked on as early as possible.</p>

Yes, support for multilingualism is an important factor in cultural, economic and social integration, but is not, and has never been, the major factor in solving the social differences and problems that unfortunately continue to exist.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I should also like to emphasise and lend my backing to the view that in its language policy the EU must adhere strictly to the principle of solidarity, as it should in other areas. We cannot allow language policy to become a source of conflict among the EU Member States or the general public, which is indeed a genuine possibility.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I doubt whether adding another 60 languages to the 21 European Union official languages will achieve the goal of true multilingualism espoused by the rapporteur, since it is not possible to give equal weight to the role of the Welsh and the Russian languages. Experience shows that languages which are used more widely and in a more economically active way ‘devour’ small ones. Just let us imagine that Russian were to become an EU official language. I am almost certain that we would not have long to wait before Latvian and Estonian would no longer be used in general, not only in the European Union, but even in Latvia and Estonia. Before we tackle multilingualism throughout Europe, we ought to set an example in Parliament itself. How much motivation do interpreters have to learn the languages of small Member States? How long will we have to wait before, when you arrive at Strasbourg, the heart of Europe, the border guard speaks to you in a language other than French? I am convinced that we need to begin by strengthening the official languages of the small EU Member States, leaving minority languages policies to the Member States to deal with. In the future, the European Union will continue to be a union of states and not of ethnic groups. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, leaving aside a number of proposed amendments, which I shall be voting against tomorrow, this report in its current form broadly enshrines appropriate principles, which have been acquired over the years, and in particular since 2000, which was named European Year of Languages.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Yet the application of some of these principles is dependent on what the subsidiarity rule will allow. Whilst it is true that everyone has the right to their mother tongue, it remains true that in practical terms applying this principle to the letter, over and above the official languages, would hamper the entire running of the Union's institutions. Moreover, we must prevent the use of what are referred to as minority languages for the purposes of nationalist extremism.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The issue of extending the European indicator of language competence is also addressed. In its current form, it is only for measuring competence in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. This system must not mislead us into fostering the widespread learning only of these five languages. I say this not only on the grounds of the necessary balance and legitimacy but also because the projection of European languages outside Europe is a highly important factor in an era of globalisation, not to mention the historical, human and cultural dimensions of these languages.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Portuguese language – and you will appreciate why I give this example – is, of all the EU languages, the third most widely spoken around the world behind English and Spanish, and ahead of German, French and Italian. Consequently, as in Written Statement 58, to which I was a signatory, I welcome the principle introduced in this report of ensuring that the European indicator of linguistic competence covers all of the Union's official languages, and, should it prove feasible, all the remaining languages spoken in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I would like to express my thanks for this discussion in support of multilingualism in European institutions, an issue that is significant both for individual countries and for our Community as well.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There are several important principles that always define what we are. As part of our culture, languages are not only a technical instrument, but are also important bearers of our heritage, and as a cultural phenomenon they deserve respect and recognition. This is a very important responsibility of the Member States in particular. Therefore, it is essential to take a proactive approach to the teaching and use of languages. Through the programme, the European Commission has created opportunities for the continued support of multilingualism, including minority or regional languages. The European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages (EBLUL) has been a partner, offering opportunities for other activities within the framework of the new programme. The same applies to the language research network, MERCATOR.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Let me remind you that the first piece of secondary EU legislation adopted in 1958 concerned languages. This was just the beginning, and it is extremely important that languages play their crucial role at this stage of European integration as well, a role that is not only political, but also cultural and, of course, economic and social as well.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In conclusion, it gives me great pleasure to observe that I am to be the first Commissioner in the history of the EU to be responsible for multilingualism as a separate policy and that shortly, subject to your consent, the entire sector will become autonomous, in collaboration, of course, with other sectors. Moreover, another colleague, the designated Commissioner from Romania, Mr Leonard Orban, will be joining us. He can be of help not only in promoting this policy but also in ensuring a strong commitment to the development of multilingualism.</p>

      <p sl="fr">There was a time when all humankind spoke one language and used the same words. However, according to the biblical account of the Tower of Babel, people tried to build a tower that could reach the sky and put them on an equal footing with God. To thwart this plan, God multiplied the number of languages so that people would no longer understand each other and would disperse across the Earth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With this report on multilingualism, Europe is implementing an ‘anti-Tower of Babel’ project, insofar as it intends to promote and develop minority languages.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to gauge the importance of multilingualism, we really must understand what it is all about. Cultural and linguistic diversity means showing respect for cultural identity, traditions and religions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am happy to share with you further reflections on the GSP+ scheme and the philosophy behind it. It is an important EU development tool: it contributes to economic progress in developing countries and the reduction of poverty, while taking on board the enduring need for promoting core human and labour rights, as well as sustainable development and governance principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the key priorities of EU trade policy is to be consistent with and to consolidate the objectives of development policy, in particular the promotion of sustainable development and good governance. This goal has been given greater prominence in the GSP+ scheme, which aims at encouraging developing countries to comply with international standards relating to social rights, environmental protection and governance, including the fight against drugs.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is worth recalling that the criteria on which the granting of GSP+ is based are objective and transparent and have been made public in the regulation itself – this is in line with our WTO obligations. The success of the GSP+ scheme is that it provides an incentive for the applicant countries to ratify key ILO conventions in order to comply with the criteria of the GSP+.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has played an instrumental role in the case of El Salvador, which deposited the ratification instruments of the missing ILO conventions on 6 September 2006. The ILO supervisory committees reported that most of the GSP+ applicant countries have made substantial changes to their legal systems in order to comply fully with the rights enshrined in the ILO conventions, which was the precondition for being granted GSP+ trade preferences in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="en">The GSP+ system is an instrument of encouragement and support. It cannot solve everything at once; its role is to give an incentive, as I say, not to punish, and to maintain the momentum of reform. The aim is also to integrate the GSP+ beneficiaries into the world trading system. I am convinced that integration into the world trading system will further help these countries to advance towards greater respect for the principles enshrined in the conventions and to lock in essential reforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the ratification of these conventions, it is clear that actual implementation then needs to be monitored. Progress in the implementation of the GSP+ conditionality is assessed in relation to developments in government policy, to administrative capacity and other institutional, legal and budgetary constraints. Some of these can only improve over time.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding monitoring, the EU relies in its judgments, in particular with regard to the initiation of any withdrawal procedure, on the monitoring procedures and expertise of relevant specialised monitoring bodies, such as the ILO, for which the EU itself cannot be a substitute.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we also have our own role to play in the proper application of the GSP system. Therefore, whenever the Commission receives information from trade unions or other stakeholders about serious and systemic systematic violations of relevant international standards, it thoroughly examines whether appropriate action in line with the GSP regulation may be taken. This is well coordinated, with relevant monitoring bodies, and Parliament should be regularly updated on developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to stress the important role the European Parliament and parliaments in the relevant countries can play, both in monitoring the situation and in helping to bring forward implementing legislation in the countries concerned and ensuring its effective implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say to Members of this House: your interparliamentary contacts are very valuable for sending this important message and I am ready to engage in an even closer cooperation with you with a view to this end.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Generalised System of Preferences has proved its worth, as it actively supports countries in their efforts towards sustainable development and good governance. We trade with these countries and also negotiate with them on equal terms. We open up our markets to them, which also gives rise to competition – only in the medium term, if need be. In other words, it is in our own interests, too, to ensure compliance with the rules and conventions of the United Nations and the International Labour Organization. In this respect, we fully support the Commission’s endeavours.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also ask, however – and the Commissioner has already indicated that he is prepared to do this – that the Commission keep us informed on a regular basis. This relates to, firstly, its observations on the implementation of the various regulations in the beneficiary countries, secondly, any sanctions pursuant to Article 16 and, thirdly, a mid-term review of the effectiveness of the GSP+ rules. GSP+ should put us in a position to provide support whilst also benefiting from trade with these countries. At the same time, we should take account of the legitimate interests of our economy and labour market and strike a balance between these two objectives.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with Commissioner Mandelson’s statement and, as rapporteur for the report on the generalised system of preferences, I would also stress the importance of GSP+ as an incentive to commit the more vulnerable countries to sustainable development and good governance.</p>
      <p sl="es">I take a positive view of the Commission’s decision of 21 December to grant benefits to fifteen countries that requested it and the steps taken subsequently by countries such as Colombia, Venezuela and El Salvador, ratifying important ILO conventions.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the functioning of the system, I would like to mention three fundamental issues. Firstly, the aim of GSP+ is to promote, amongst other things, human and labour rights through trade. This association is essential and must not be squandered. Trade must provide an incentive in terms of human and labour rights. We must ensure that protectionist tendencies do not undermine this aim.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, in order to ensure that the system is successful, the number of benefiting countries must be increased. One of the Commission’s priorities must be to ensure that that number increases significantly, since those countries currently represent just 3% of the world population.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, the effectiveness of the system must be guaranteed, by ensuring that it is applied intelligently, with the participation of the European Parliament. It is important that the Commission cooperate with the benefiting countries in their efforts to meet their commitments, by means of various initiatives and, in particular, by strengthening the rigorous and regular control and assessment of their implementation, transparently and with the participation of the main social actors and benefiting countries, as stated in Parliament’s report.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, the sanctions provided for must be applied in the event of serious and systematic violations of the principles. Those violating them must be punished, but not operators who are fulfilling their commitments properly.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, as the motion for a resolution reiterates, the Commission, before the next review of the Regulation, must carry out a study to assess the impact of the system, to analyse its operation and to lay the foundations for the reforms carried out.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the GSP scheme was designed to help the poorest and most vulnerable in the world trade their way out of poverty. There is not a fixed list of countries that fit into that category. Where the GSP is a success, a country may graduate to a new relationship with the EU. However, not all movement is upward: some countries, through circumstances entirely beyond their control, may now be in a worse position than when the scheme was renewed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Pakistan is such a country. Despite the backing of this House, Pakistan was denied GSP+ status by the Council, at a cost of 300 000 jobs and GBP 40 million a year. Tragically, less than six months after the GSP scheme came into force, Pakistan and much of Pakistan-administered Kashmir was devastated by an earthquake that the World Health Organisation claims eclipsed the tsunami in terms of destruction and human suffering.</p>
      <p sl="de">The major impact of the earthquake in the north-east of the region caused large-scale displacement of Pakistan’s skilled and unskilled labour force. They have traditionally provided a significant part of the workforce for the whole of Pakistani industry, notably in textiles. Many were left homeless, without spouses and with children to care for. Over one year later, they have been unable to return to paid work because they have been waiting for financial grants to rebuild their homes. As a result industrial wages have increased, driving up the cost of production and dramatically effecting Pakistan’s competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="de">Whilst the EU is always very generous in terms of the aid we offer to those countries in need, our pockets are not bottomless. We must revise the GPS in order to make sure that we not only help the poor trade their way out of poverty, but also help the hopeless trade their way out of the rubble of disaster.</p>

    <intervention id="2-443" speaker_id="4524" name="Caroline Lucas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, in order to be credible and genuinely effective, we have to demonstrate that the GSP+ scheme is working properly. In other words, the EU must act swiftly and decisively when there are infringements of the social or environmental standards in question. This is not merely a theoretical or academic discussion, but a very real discussion about real countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The case of El Salvador has already been raised. In fact, El Salvadorian workers have for years seen incredible resistance by their own Government, company owners and the right-wing media to try to avoid, or at least delay, the implementation of core labour conventions, and it is very unfortunate that an EU Member State, Spain, has seemingly supported them in that attempt.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the fact that the El Salvadorian Government has recently ratified four key ILO conventions is not the real victory it might seem, because by reforming its civil service laws the Government has actually succeeded in removing large numbers of workers from any possible benefits of those ILO conventions. That is totally unacceptable, and I therefore formally ask the Commission to initiate without delay an investigation into the situation in El Salvador and to consider a temporary withdrawal of GSP preferences. I would be happy to furnish the Commissioner with further details from the trade union groups and civil societies in El Salvador.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colombia is another case of blatant violation of workers’ rights, despite the window dressing of official enshrinement of ILO conventions. The monthly and often weekly reports of trade union members ‘disappearing’ and being killed tell the true story of the blood toll paid by those who dare to assume that ILO rights officially adopted in theory will actually be respected in practice. We cannot wait until December 2008 before we review these cases. I ask the Commission to review them now.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, the Generalised System of Preferences, GSP+, is a good system that grants privileges to countries in the developing world in respect of their access to European markets, which is an enormously positive thing. There, are, however, a number of strings attached. It is right for Commissioner Mandelson to say that these countries should first and foremost be given encouragement and support. Nonetheless, situations can arise where it is not enough to provide encouragement and support and where, in addition, there is a real need to tighten up on monitoring and perhaps use the tools available if the conditions in the conventions on workers’ rights, and the like, are not met. We know that infringements are taking place today, and we therefore want the Commission to tighten up monitoring and, where necessary, use the tools available to temporarily suspend offending countries.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When such steps are taken, we would further desire the involvement of Parliament in the process, so that we can give our views and work together in order to make the system work. This must happen now. As many other speakers have pointed out, it is also important to carefully review a few points before we evaluate the system in 2008, namely: has the system worked in every respect, what shortcomings does it have and what do we need to consider when we renew the system?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-445" speaker_id="28137" name="Kader Arif" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by adopting the Council regulation of 27 June 2005 reforming the system of preferences that has been in force since 1971, the European Union has chosen to simplify and enhance its principal trade instrument for supporting developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, three systems shall apply from now on: the general system, the Everything but Arms system – which is a tool adapted to the specific characteristics of the least-advanced countries – and, lastly, the GSP+. The additional preferences granted under this last heading arose out of the firm belief that development can be considered only in close conjunction with the democratic process and with respect for human rights, labour law and the environment. Fifteen countries are currently benefiting from this mechanism, which both encourages and rewards those developing countries that are most vulnerable and that make the most efforts in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, if the GSP+ is to genuinely contribute to better governance and to greater respect for the environment, human rights and employment, it must be managed effectively, and that means, firstly, warning countries that are not fulfilling their commitments – of which there are still many – and, above all, making routine threats so as to effectively do away with the preferences granted to those who seriously and systematically violate the ILO conventions and who do not honour their commitments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Next, it is vital that a regular assessment be carried out to ensure that every country benefiting from the GSP+ is honouring its commitments. The assessment must be particularly exhaustive with a view to the renewal of this instrument at the end of 2008. Our credibility and the effectiveness of this instrument depend on what legal experts call the principle of congruent forms. These preferences cannot continue being granted to countries that are politically incapable of fulfilling these commitments. The same goes for the future of this policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I shall try to save you some money by making three points. First of all the Commissioner certainly agrees that we need to maintain high standards of surveillance and invigilation and we intend to do so. We have done so in the case of Belarus and have submitted proposals to the Council accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards Pakistan, granting privileges in trade requires us to keep within the rules that create those privileges and that is what we are doing and what we have done in respect of Pakistan, but I entirely accept the honourable Member’s view that we must do everything we can within those rules to give assistance to Pakistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as El Salvador is concerned, yes, I entirely accept that having granted GSP+ status, we must now monitor, on the basis of reports of international bodies, the effective implementation of the two ILO Conventions in El Salvador, and it is our clear intention to do so.</p>
