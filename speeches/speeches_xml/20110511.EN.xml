There was a very exciting and interesting discussion between President Barroso, Commissioner Lewandowski and the leaders of the political groups, so we are a few minutes late.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the joint debate on:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the main aspects of the common foreign and security policy and the common security and defence policy (Article 36 TEU) (2010/2986(RSP)),</p>
      <p sl="unknown">the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in Syria and in Camp Ashraf and the situation of the Coptic Christian community of Egypt (2011/2690(RSP)),</p>
      <p sl="unknown">the report by Mr Albertini, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) in 2009, presented to the European Parliament in application of Part II, Section G, paragraph 43 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 (2010/2124(INI)) (A7-0168/2011),</p>
      <p sl="unknown">the report by Mr Gualtieri, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the development of the common security and defence policy following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon (2010/2299(INI)) (A7-0166/2011) and</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Before we begin, I would like to say a few words. On Monday, we remembered Europe Day, a day in celebration of the European Union. Without doubt, what we most need in the European Union today is a common foreign and security policy. We face historical challenges, only one of which is the need to overcome the crisis which has been imported into Europe. We must prepare for this kind of situation in the future and solve the problems of the crisis which exist outside Europe, too, and not just those inside Europe.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We also have the growing disorder in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, as well as the renewed unrest in Tunisia and Egypt. We should not forget our eastern neighbours – indeed, a few days ago, we launched Euronest. We have our common European diplomacy, which needs to be an effective tool for action outside the European Union, because it is not possible to solve problems inside the European Union today if we do not begin seriously to solve problems outside the European Union. The European Union must have greater political strength and not just economic strength.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this will be the first of three contributions that I will make to honourable Members this morning, so I want to start by giving you my vision of the issues that face us and also to try and touch upon some of the detail of the issues that honourable Members have added to this debate, knowing the importance that you attach to them. Let me begin.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are storms blowing across the countries we call our neighbours – Arab spring, winds of change, whatever imagery we use. None of us in this House know where it will end and what that end will bring. Aspirations are high and expectations too that the revolutions will have been worth the blood that has been spilt, worth the turmoil and fear, worth the economic havoc in a world already grappling with the worst economic problems for decades.</p>
      <p sl="en">The uprisings across North Africa and the Arab world pose great challenges for Europe, but also opportunities we cannot afford to miss. Two principles have to underpin what we do. The first is that we in Europe know how long and painful the journey towards liberty can be. Our own path to 20th century liberal democracy was a very slow one. The European Union itself was born in the ashes of conflicts that remind us how terrible life can be when democracy breaks down. Add into that the mixed record of Europe’s empires and some humility is in order, even as we assert that democracy is the necessary foundation of human progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, democracy is, of course, about votes and elections – but it is also about far more than that. What we have learnt in Europe the hard way is that we need deep democracy: respect for the rule of law, freedom of speech, respect for human rights, an independent judiciary and impartial administration. It requires enforceable property rights and free trade unions, and is not just about changing governments but about building the right institutions and the right attitudes. In the long run, surface democracy – democracy that floats on the top with people casting their votes freely on election day and choosing their government – will not survive if deep democracy fails to take root.</p>
      <p sl="en">But there is no certainty – not in the outcome in any country – and no quick fix or short-term solution that will create the world so many people want to see. Meanwhile, the spectre of religious intolerance casts its shadow – witness the recent events in Egypt – finding its excuse in uncertain times to play on fear and to wreak destruction. Freedom of religion or belief is a universal human right that must be protected everywhere. We need to condemn all those who seek to use religious belief as a means of oppression, and support those who advocate tolerance, whether in Syria, in Pakistan, in Egypt or elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe has choices to make too. When we look at our neighbourhood, we have to be ready to rise to challenges that are being asked of us. I can make hundreds of statements – and I do. I deplore, I condemn, I urge, I demand, but we also need to act and that action has to come in different forms.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me mention sanctions. We impose sanctions against regimes that treat the lives of their citizens as worthless, with people killed at the hands of police or security services that they command. Sanctions on Syria were imposed yesterday – an embargo on arms, an asset freeze and a travel ban for 13 key individuals in the regime, the freezing of our association agreement and of our cooperation with Syria. Let us be blunt and clear, as I was with the Foreign Minister of Syria yesterday. What is happening in Syria is a popular aspiration for democracy and the rule of law – it is not some foreign plot. By failing to see what it is, the regime loses its legitimacy and estranges itself from the people and from the international community. Violent oppression and threats inside and outside are tools of an era that is long gone. Our concern, in this House and in the European Union, is with the people of Deraa where the UN has been refused access, in Baniyas where the crack-down continues, in Hama where the tanks have moved in. The Syrian people will not bow to tanks. We say to the regime to change course, and to change course now.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">I said yesterday to Minister Moallem, the Foreign Minister of Syria: You must allow immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian support and to the media. Only then can your claims of support for peaceful protests be substantiated.</p>
      <p sl="en">In our eastern neighbourhood – in Belarus – President Lukashenko failed to use last December’s presidential elections to show his readiness for change and a more open and democratic, European society. Not only did he not take this chance but, in using violence against peaceful demonstrators and multiplying the number of political prisoners, he has shown contempt for democracy and the rule of law. I met with the families of those who have been imprisoned and I know that he left us with no other option than to adopt strong sanctions in response, targeting those in the regime responsible for the crack-down, including President Lukashenko himself. I also know that we should step up our support for civil society and for people-to-people contacts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then there is our direct engagement in Camp Ashraf. What happened on 8 April is deplorable and has, and had, my strongest condemnation. I have been adamant that we need a strong united EU response. I have written to the Foreign Minister of Iraq and I spoke to him again yesterday. While I do not question Iraq’s sovereignty over all its territory, it has a duty to protect the human rights of Ashraf residents.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have condemned that violence and called for an inquiry – an inquiry that has to be as thorough as it is independent and that should tell us exactly what happened. But, as honourable Members know from the letters I have received individually and collectively in this House and beyond, there is no simple solution here. Several options for a long-term solution are being considered, with the United Nations in the lead, all of them with challenges. I am very grateful for the work of this House, for the work of those who have travelled there and for the contributions I have received. We need to take this also to the Foreign Affairs Council and we need to discuss this with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Our Ambassador to Iraq arrives today, and she knows the importance that I attach to this issue. We need to pursue and make sure that we find the correct course of action here, but the inquiry and the condemnation are absolute.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Yemen, too, the Gulf Cooperation Council has put forward its proposals and President Saleh has once again hesitated. I spoke to him not long ago. We talked about the discussions he had had with the opposition and the proposals on the table. I told him that he knew what he had to do – in the interests of his country – and that he should do it. In my meetings in the Gulf, I met with the King of Bahrain. We discussed the initiative there for the dialogue without preconditions that the Crown Prince has put forward, and I urged him to pursue that dialogue. The current course there is not the answer. We need to see fair and civil trials, if there are trials in Bahrain, and that the death penalty is avoided in all circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="en">In all of these cases, it is about the direct engagement that we have and the pressure that we apply and the directness of our approach. Be under no illusion: we are very clear, I am very clear, with all of the leaders I speak to about what I believe needs to happen, and I do so with the support of this House and with the support of the Foreign Affairs Council of the 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course I want to talk about Libya. There are Members of this House who wish we had a stronger defence and security policy. I say to them this: in the last few weeks and months, we have seen how far we have come in some ways, but also how far we still have to go. We did engage together to plan the military support for humanitarian needs: ready at the request of the United Nations to support the people with resources from across Europe. Just as we did when the terrible earthquake struck in Haiti – military hospital ships, heavy lifting equipment, civilians and military working side by side in that case. Do not misunderstand: I know that humanitarian aid is apolitical and that humanitarian workers must not be put at risk but, in the primary objective of saving lives, sometimes it is only the military who have the equipment or people to achieve that – delivering aid at speed, putting in place the infrastructure – and that is why, should a UN request arrive, we will be ready to help.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to get faster and smarter in how we do this. I am the first person to say and admit that there is much more we need to do, and I will talk more of that later on this morning.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are improving our collaboration with NATO, sharing details of our operations for the first time as part of continuing to develop our relations. Last Friday, I co-chaired with Secretary-General Rasmussen the meeting of the PSC Committee and the North Atlantic Council in our first ever discussion on Libya. There is also our collaboration with the African Union with President Jean Ping, and the Arab League with Amr Moussa and, of course, his successor, and with the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and Professor Insanoglu, under the leadership of the UN special envoy, Al-Khatib. It was in my discussions with Ban Ki-Moon that we agreed to bring together the regional organisations for a meeting in Cairo and to follow up after the contact group meeting in Rome.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are discussing together how to play our part in the future of Libya – to support the national dialogue, to help with the constitution and to prepare for elections. I have sent two missions to Libya to meet with and work with young people and with the women in Libya. As the leader of my team said to me, it is the first time that they have ever discussed a constitution – words and arguments they have never known before. They talked of how they longed for the end of the regime, so let us also be clear: Gaddafi must go from power and must end his regime.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">I intend to open an office in Benghazi so that we can move forward on the support we have discussed with the people …</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">… to support civil society, to support the interim transitional national council and Mr Jibril (we have had many meetings with him); to support security sector reform; to build on what the people told us that they wanted. They want help with education, with healthcare, with security on the borders, with the kind of support that we are able to give and want to give them. And with all that we do, the silver thread of human rights runs through our work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then, there is the new Neighbourhood Policy – a different level of ambition and vision. Mutual accountability is at its core: the EU and the neighbourhood are responsible to each other for delivering on the commitments that we make to the countries and to the people of our neighbourhood and to the people of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Building on what we have already talked about are mobility, market access and money, or the ‘three Ms’, as a simple way of describing it. Some things are extremely important to support these countries into the future. One example is the mobility of young people. These are young societies where young people long for greater opportunities, and the European Parliament has a big role to play in supporting those opportunities for young people to gain benefits and knowledge from Europe. So too with Member States: the opportunities to travel, to study.</p>
      <p sl="en">For businessmen and women, it is important to have the chance to explore new markets, to sell their goods and services, and they are in the gift of our Member States, some of whom have long relationships with the countries concerned, but who now need to step up and provide those opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">On market access, we know that we have a genuine contribution to make to stimulate economic growth and the recovery. You know the effect of this turmoil on the economies of the countries we are describing. Some of these countries rely on us as their major export market and the source of their imports. Allowing those countries to develop their markets could make a real difference, supporting not just the opening of markets but how they gain access to them, ensuring that they can reach our standards, and ensuring that they have real opportunities. Nowhere is that more true than in small businesses, but we have to have the political will to do it. We have to have the political will to be committed to ensuring that we make our markets available. That is a challenge. It is a challenge in any circumstances; it is a challenge in economic times, but I would argue it is a challenge we have to rise to because, if we do not, then the failure of the economies in our neighbourhood will have a direct impact on us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then there is money, or rather resources. Not just what we can do in direct support – although that is important – but what we can leverage. We have already hosted a meeting of senior officials from around the world and from the big financial institutions to discuss what we might be able to contribute if asked, and will, but in consultation with our neighbourhood, we have to do more to support resources coming together more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nowhere will this policy matter more perhaps than in Tunisia. Prime Minister Essebsi’s speech on television may help as the country moves towards elections on 24 July, but he acknowledged the problems of a country where economic growth rates are down to between 0 and 1%. We have to ensure support to Tunisia, to its economy and its civil society, and that means thinking not just of the long term, not just of the importance of a new strategy, but of what we do now and how we support countries – Egypt, Tunisia and others – right now with the budgetary problems that they have. That is the reason we have started discussions with the financial institutions, with our Member States, with those who are engaged in wanting to support these countries, because helping them deal with deficits when tourism has collapsed, when the economy is not working properly, matters right now. Honourable Members must understand that there is an immediate urgency and there is a long-term strategy, and we need to have both in what we do.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Egypt: I have been there three times in recent weeks and I have spent a lot of time with some of the young leaders from Tahrir Square, and also meeting some of the women. The women in particular are looking for the stronger voice that they believe they have been promised in the future of Egypt. I met one woman who will be a presidential candidate and who is determined to show that women have that role to play in Egypt. I have talked with many government ministers, and let me give you the example of the Planning Minister, Fayza Aboulnaga. She wants to build houses for people; she has a big vision of what building a million houses over twenty years could mean for Egypt.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to take these big visions from countries with whom we are working and translate them into what it is that we can provide and support. So, integrating training and education, infrastructure around housing programmes, opportunities for small businesses to grow, working with UN women – as I am – to consider how we build safer communities around the housing projects, how we work together to design a much bigger, grander vision that is built upon what the Egyptian people want. I am talking to the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Al-Araby, who is committed to working closely with us on the Middle East Peace Process, keen to develop the strength of the relationship that we already have, and keen to see us as partners in collaborating in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">There will be many challenges for Egypt in the coming months and years. We have to be there to support them through each of those challenges and be willing to put our resources, our knowledge, our expertise and our contacts in favour of supporting them.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have always said in this House and beyond that the External Action Service is a force to prevent and resolve conflict, so let me just mention, too, that this is why our role in Serbia and Kosovo matters. It is why the vote that we won at the UN, the voice that we now have, can play its part. It is why we have to engage the leaders in Bosnia to get them to get their eyes off the floor, to get them from thinking only about their own communities to thinking about the needs of their country, and to see their future and to see the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is why too we play a role in the Middle East Peace Process. Honourable Members know well that stability in the Middle East requires peace. The quest for a negotiated agreement has dominated the region for decades. We have brought new vigour to the Quartet in recent months. I hosted a Quartet principals meeting in February and the follow-up of the Quartet envoys has been working with the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators for the very first time since the Quartet was established.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wanted another principals meeting in April, and we have prepared a substantial statement based on our position. I continue to believe a negotiated solution is the way forward, and we will stay engaged and have another envoys meeting later this month.</p>
      <p sl="en">We, too, have been a strong supporter of Palestinian state-building, so when the ad hoc Liaison Committee meeting was hosted by us on 13 April, I listened to the praise for the work of Salam Fayyad, for his remarkable achievements in governance, the rule of law and human rights, education, health and social protection – sufficient for a functioning government according to the World Bank. I have acknowledged the importance of Palestinian reconciliation behind President Abbas as an opportunity and something that the European Union has called for for years.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is happening now is the most serious effort so far to establish unity, which is, in itself, key to achieving the two-state solution. I have been in close contact with President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad, as well as with Egypt, the Arab League, the United States and with Israel. Non-violence, the continuation of state-building and abiding by existing commitments will be crucial, and we must judge this effort by its results. I do believe that Israel should hand over the tax revenues owed to the Palestinians, but I want to be clear that our position on Hamas has not changed and Israel’s security remains a key concern for all of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to say that I do not consider a flotilla to be the right response to the humanitarian situation in Gaza. I have been there twice. I continue to highlight the plight of the people, especially asking for more access to enable the economy to start to develop. The situation there frankly, especially for the children, is awful. We have put forward proposals to Israel to support that greater access. I want to see the people of Gaza with a future, but I also want to see Gilad Shalit, captive for years in Gaza, given the chance to go home to his mother and father whom I have already met.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe’s experience tells us that true democracy is the necessary foundation of tolerance, of peace and of prosperity. In North Africa and the Arab world, that destination will not be reached quickly or without setbacks, but building deep democracy is the only way that destination will be reached at all. We have the experience to help every country that asks us now to help them make that journey to democracy. It is why I am proposing to support the endowment for democracy which will enable us, too, to use our resources to support opportunities, particularly for young people, to engage in political life, to support the development of political parties, to enable people to do what honourable Members in so many countries represented here had to do themselves – i.e. develop the political process by building those political parties, civil society, and deep roots that mean democracy flourishes and grows.</p>
      <p sl="en">I often say when I visit these countries that it is not about electing a government so much as the right to be able to throw a government out. Democracy is about being able to say bye-bye as well as hello, and that is important: knowing that you have the right to use your ballot box, once, twice, three times, four times to change your government, to demand of your government, is critical, and you can only do that when democracy is deep and flourishing. It is why what we have seen happening in Cote d’Ivoire is so important, seeing President Ouattara finally take his place, and the role we have played has been significant in supporting that process. It is why it is good to see the Nigerian elections going well and Goodluck Jonathan now being appointed properly. It is good to see democracy begin to take hold and flourish and deepen, and that is what we have to support.</p>
      <p sl="en">Change does not necessarily ensure progress, but progress absolutely requires change. That means we have to be more determined to act. Some of the things I describe require Member States to act, some require the Commission to act, many need the support of this House, and we have to decide that we will all play our part. If we only do it when the media’s attention is on those countries or on us, then we will fail. We must be in this for the long haul and we have to be determined in saying to our neighbours not just that they should start the journey towards democracy, but that they should complete it.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have been three excellent reports which I shall speak on in my next intervention, but I do want to thank the rapporteurs. I am going to end with a very small quote from an anthropologist, a woman I admire very much, Margaret Mead. She said: ‘Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has’.</p>

    <intervention id="3-010-000" speaker_id="4342" name="Joseph Daul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, foreign policy has been dominated by the revolutions – some more peaceful than others – taking place in a number of neighbouring Mediterranean countries and, more recently, by a symbolic event in the fight against international terrorism, namely, the end of the Bin Laden era.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is Europe’s role in all of this? Are we willingly and actively involved in the situation? Yes, we certainly are. The action being taken in Libya under the auspices of the United Nations and on the initiative of certain European Heads of State or Government has demonstrated that, when it wants to, Europe – or some of Europe – can act decisively in difficult times.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Does this make us a key international player with influence to match our economic strength? The answer is a resounding ‘No’. Europe is still effectively a bit player, at best a Tom Thumb in politics and geostrategy, despite the ever-increasing expectations of European public opinion. Europe backed stability and development aid in the Mediterranean. Yet the people are – quite legitimately – demanding political freedom and are fleeing their countries because there is no prospect of a life of dignity and opportunity for them and their children. The humanitarian assistance that we have provided over recent months has definitely been useful.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, we need to do more. Have we begun to learn from these events? I would like to think so. What is worse is that the waves of migrants coming to our shores in flimsy vessels, who are dying at sea – and let me point out that we have inadequate information on the number of deaths – are all too often met by division, quarrelling, closed borders, with some countries even calling into question the Schengen Area, an essential instrument for freedom of movement.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Is all of this worthy of Europe, of European values, principles and ideals? I do not think so, nor does my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) nor, I am sure, do the majority of Members in this House.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we are meeting with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy this morning is that we sought to give Europe a voice and a face under the Treaty of Lisbon. We now need to move on and take action. That entails making choices and sticking to them. What, then, are Europe’s priorities? Relations with our eastern and southern neighbours? Combating terrorism? A solution to the conflict in the Middle East? Trade policy? Tackling all of the above at the same time is no easy task.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Who are our preferential partners? The United States, emerging countries, or others? How can we achieve the best results? By leaving individual Member States free to define their own policy, as we have for the last 60 years, or by speaking with one strong voice?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, an intergovernmental solution is no longer the right approach to foreign affairs, security and defence: instead, we need more Europe. We need to move away from national egos and towards greater effectiveness at European level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, we will only have a robust foreign and security policy if we put all our weight behind and all our energies into a few clearly defined objectives. Ladies and gentlemen, 2011 should be the year of the Mediterranean, of combating terrorism, even of achieving a breakthrough in the Middle East conflict. If Europe is capable of becoming a key player in this area, it will be able to put the errors of its youth behind it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me close with a quote from someone very familiar to you: John Paul II. ‘Do not be afraid,’ Baroness Ashton. We have made savings of EUR 4 billion in the European budget. Please come up with some proposals for using that money, rather than returning it to the Member States.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>

    <intervention id="3-011-000" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, in a European Union where we are seeing moves towards renationalisation in all areas, the Treaty of Lisbon should be used as a tool for creating a new community policy: the common foreign, security and defence policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is the first important general debate which we have held with Baroness Ashton and, if we look back to the early days, it was already clear then that there were certain governments which did not want the title of ‘Foreign Minister of the European Union’ to be used and this has ultimately led to the name of ‘High Representative’ being chosen. This is understandable, because, alongside tax policy and domestic policy, an independent foreign policy is one of the key features, you might almost say an identifying feature, of national sovereignty. Particularly in the field of foreign, security and defence policy, transferring this sovereignty to a supranational institution is a brave and also a difficult move.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we in the European Parliament, together with the High Representative, need to ask a quite different question. This question is: What is the role of the Union as an independent body in international policy? Over the last few days, I have read articles about Baroness Ashton which have astonished me, because they criticise her absence and her lack of policies. This criticism comes from people who think only about making their own national foreign policy and their own national interests the very top priority and who, without consulting with any of their partners, take unilateral decisions which will ultimately divide Europe rather than unifying it.</p>
      <p sl="de">We only need to look at the mission in Libya. There has rarely been a more obvious split in the European Union’s international policy and in its international involvement than over the question of how we behave towards Libya. There is a tendency in the major capitals of the European Union to regard the EU’s foreign, security and defence policy as a continuation of each country’s own national policy financed with European money. The larger the Auswärtige Amt, the Foreign Office or the Quai d’Orsay, the more pronounced this tendency is. Baroness Ashton, you will undoubtedly receive broad support from Parliament if you say to these people that, although you respect their unilateral interests, the common European foreign policy cannot take the same direction. This policy will be defined by you, the High Representative, in all the areas of consensus.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am in favour of opening an office of the kind you have described in Libya, because you as High Representative, the Union itself, and Parliament as an independent body, all have credibility in humanitarian and political terms. We are more credible than the states which have taken military action in Libya out of necessity, but whose arms exporters also had the largest trade stands at Libya’s most important arms fair last autumn. Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Belgium are the main suppliers of arms to Colonel Gaddafi’s army which is fighting the rebels in Libya. That is not the sort of credibility which Europe needs.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">The credibility which Europe needs is that of soft power, which helps to establish democracy, which opens an office to support developments in civil society and which does not define international cooperation with the European Union in terms of subjugating others to the unilateral diplomatic and economic interests of the Union, but instead encourages policies based on an equal partnership between different regions of the world. That is my vision of the foreign, security and defence policy of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">You have mentioned the three Ms: money, mobility and market access. In the next phase, you should add the three Cs: coherence, concreteness and the community method. In my opinion, with the three Ms and the three Cs, you will find partners in the European Parliament. We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament know that we are still in the early stages of the cooperation between you and Parliament and there are certainly some areas for improvement. This is why I am repeating my offer on behalf, I believe, of the majority of the Members of this House. You will undoubtedly find more support for your vision of a common foreign and security policy here than among the 27 foreign ministers, all of whom I respect, but who all have one problem, which is that they are foreign ministers of individual countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on Saturday, I had a long meeting in Cairo with the new Egyptian Prime Minister, Mr Sharaf. The conclusion of this meeting, and my conclusion also after this meeting on my second trip to Cairo in the last two months, is – as you have indicated – that we need to give massive help to these revolutions in North Africa and especially to developments in Egypt. We must stop making our little paternalistic adjustments that we have announced up to now.</p>
      <p sl="de">I shall give a short comparison. Do you know how much money was transferred under the US Marshall Plan? For years in a row? 1% of GDP every year. USD 162 billion in actual money. And what are we talking about and promising Egypt? One billion. Not 162 billion, but one billion. Not in 2011, not in 2012, but in 2013, when we have the possibility to do so. I think that is nothing at all. What I expect from you and from the Commission – because it is apparently Commission money we are talking about – is not big plans about changing the Neighbourhood Policy. We need to do that in the future, but what I expect is direct budget aid given to Egypt as fast as possible, because by the end of the year, they will have no money in their budget and that could be the beginning of a counter-revolution in Egypt. Direct budget aid or cancelling the country’s debts – that is the way forward immediately. An announcement today in that direction would certainly be helpful for Egypt and for the Egyptians.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second message is about Syria. Let us be honest, Baroness Ashton. Syria is a huge disaster. What is happening there – and I have no other words to describe it – is nothing less than an Arab Tiananmen. An Arab Tiananmen. People massacred by tanks and by snipers every day. 800 people killed to date. 8 000 people arrested to date. People tortured in the most brutal way in order to release passwords on Facebook and the names of comrades working on Facebook. Soldiers who do not want to shoot at their own people are themselves shot by the secret services of the army and of Bashar al-Assad. From what is happening today in Syria, it is very clear that there is only one way to describe Bashar al-Assad, and that is as the most brutal dictator in the world at the moment. That is the clear analysis we can make today.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">So what can be done? I see 800 people killed to date, 8 000 people imprisoned, some of them tortured every day, and we are freezing the assets of 13 people, but not Assad. I say this is an unbalanced approach. It is, in fact, ridiculous, and it is not helping to press the Assad regime to change its direction. It is not enough to say 13 people and one of Assad’s brothers is there, and one of his nieces or nephews is on the list. No, there are hundreds of people you have to put on the list immediately, as fast as possible, to apply real pressure.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can understand your approach a little bit. You are saying that if I leave Assad off the list, maybe it will help him change his attitude later on. OK then, make that very clear here today in the debate. I want you to declare that you give Assad a few days. If, in these few days, he does not stop what is happening at the moment, then freeze all assets, not only of the 13 people but of the whole Assad family.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Impose a travel ban not on 13 people when 800 are killed, but on the whole Assad family and declare what is very important. They are waiting for that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yesterday, we had a link directly with people in Syria who are saying that you have to strengthen the sanctions, otherwise he will not stop. Declare that the Assad family will never be considered by the European Union as the real representatives of the Syrian people, and that they will be accountable for their crimes. Do it right now. That is what we expect today from you. You can help to stop this Arab Tiananmen. It is not true that we play no role: we play an essential role and the people of Syria are waiting for this clear message today. Not tomorrow. Today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the major development in the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) this year has undoubtedly been the establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS). Baroness Ashton, as Vice-President/High Representative, you have recently come under pressure for its lacklustre performance. However, you can only ever be as effective as the Member States will allow you to be and, of course, you are reluctant to use your own powers of initiative – an approach which I fully support. On the one hand, the EU wants to carve out its global role as a diplomatic heavyweight but, on the other hand, the CFSP requires unanimity, which means compromising to preserve the interests of individual Member States, particularly the big ones.</p>
      <p sl="en">This hybrid sui generis approach to EU foreign policy vindicates those of us who opposed the creation of the EEAS in the first place, believing then that the EU’s global ambitions would undermine national sovereignty. Paradoxically, it now seems that national sovereignty is undermining the EU’s global ambitions, as we saw recently over what happened in Libya. The ECR, my group, nevertheless remains constructively engaged with the EEAS. We wish it well. We hope it will work. It needs to bed down, and we want to see budget neutrality and more political accountability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although the Vice-President/High Representative has made excellent senior appointments – I have seen some of these before the Committee on Foreign Affairs – I must ask why she has been short-changed in a stitch-up by the Commission, which seems to have retained a disproportionate amount of resources for EU enlargement and the European Neighbourhood Policy. This split does not provide value for money to EU taxpayers, nor does it serve our foreign policy interests.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I now make some specific requests, firstly on the imminent Gaza Flotilla Mark II? Can you, Madam Vice-President/High Representative, put pressure on Turkey to stop this dangerous provocation at a time when Israel is under enormous tension and pressure, with missile attacks from Gaza and the renewed passage of Iranian warships through the Suez Canal? And how will the EU engage with a new unitary Palestinian Authority that has Hamas, a terrorist organisation banned by the EU, as one of its components?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, Madam Vice-President/High Representative, will you broker a solution for the closure of Camp Ashraf in Iraq?</p>
      <p sl="en">Next, will you condemn forthrightly and totally the passage of the Bahati bill in Uganda, which allows the execution of homosexuals?</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, I entirely agree with Mr Verhofstadt: I commend you in all your efforts to stabilise the Middle East and North African countries and, in particular, your condemnation of the killing of Christians in Egypt, but why, as Mr Verhofstadt has pointed out, has President Assad of Syria been left off the EU sanctions list after the brutal killing of innocent civilian protesters by his forces in recent days?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to put some questions to you today, Baroness Ashton.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, on the subject of Syria, like Mr Verhofstadt, I would like to know what is stopping Europe from placing President Assad on the EU sanctions list? Which country or countries are currently preventing the European Union from taking the only possible decision? Please tell us. If Mr Westerwelle is the obstacle, then tell us that it is Mr Westerwelle: at least that way, we will know what is shaping different Member States’ policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unlike the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we are not going to suggest that President Assad is the answer to President Assad’s dictatorship. If that is what we are being asked to think, it really is unbelievable. The only solution for Syria is for President Assad to relinquish power in Syria: that should be Europe’s position. It is therefore obvious that President Assad and his whole family need to be included on the list – not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow, but today. If that is not feasible because a unanimous decision is required, then you need to say what is hindering progress. It needs to be stated publicly so that we can have a proper debate in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, what is preventing Israel from paying the taxes due to the Palestinians and why? Of course we need to maintain security in Israel, but the Palestinians should not have to suffer in order to maintain security in Israel. That cannot be the solution.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">My last question: 600 people died on the Libyan coast a few days ago. A vessel was in the area. We have been told that it was not a NATO vessel, that it was not the Charles de Gaulle. Apparently it was a Maltese vessel. I would therefore like to know: what boat was it and what information is available? Who failed to rescue the 600 Libyan refugees? In the 21st century, surely no one is going to tell me that it is not possible to identify the ship in question. The lack of action constitutes a crime: that of failing to provide assistance to persons in danger.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, during the course of this debate, you will hear not only praise, but also criticism. To be honest, it is clear that EU foreign policy has failed in some areas, including in the Arab world, in Afghanistan, in finding a resolution to the Palestinian problem and in the conflicts among our eastern neighbours. The question that I would like to ask is: What is the reason for this? With 27 different nations making decisions, how can we reach a consensus within the EU and within the common foreign and security policy?</p>
      <p sl="de">It is obvious that foreign policy is a policy of individual interests. However, the time when the West could assert its own interests without taking into consideration its partner nations and their people is long since past. The EU must show that it is open to adopting a policy of reconciling interests. The main factors which contributed to the failure are double standards and a tendency to think in military terms. The Members of this House almost cheered when the UN Security Council decided to take military intervention in Libya. Today, I think all of us are at a loss when it comes to events there. What are we doing for the people of Gaza or Darfur? How can we give the 1.4 billion people living on one dollar a day the right to a life of dignity? My group is particularly concerned with this question.</p>
      <p sl="de">The revolutions in the Arab countries have one important demand in common. They are all calling for justice and fairness, both in the distribution of wealth within society and in democratic participation in political decision making, including international relations. The EU must respond to this demand. In order to achieve this objective, we must work together to develop international law and not simply interpret and implement it unilaterally.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I have a number of burning questions on developments in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. What position will the European Union take, through its Member States the United Kingdom and France, in the United Nations Security Council in September in respect of the unilateral efforts of the Palestinian Authority to proclaim a Palestinian state, separately, it should be noted, from the peace process with Israel?</p>
      <p sl="nl">This question, High Representative, is all the more pressing after Fatah and Hamas last week re-established Palestinian unity whilst completely ignoring the conditions of the parties, in other words, including the European Union, for a unified Palestinian Government, namely, recognition of the State of Israel, the renunciation of violence and terrorism and compliance with earlier commitments. In the meantime, Hamas is making clear that it does belong on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations. Hence my pressing question: how, in this new situation, will the European Union apply its own Quartet principles? Conducting business as usual with Ramallah implies at any event letting go of these fundamental principles of peace. All of this will cause serious damage to European-Israeli relations and it is of very little help to the peace process, on the contrary, in fact.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of European foreign and security policy is especially crucial at this particular historic juncture, which is marked by an extraordinary wave of protest that has taken hold in the Mediterranean and is also spreading across the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="it">In view of this serious crisis affecting the whole of the southern Mediterranean and now spreading into the Arabian Peninsula, the European Parliament must act as a sounding board for all these protests by ordinary people. They are risking their lives, clamouring to improve conditions and to start the transition to democracy by toppling the current regimes. This House wants to deal directly with the High Representative and Vice-President, Baroness Ashton, particularly because of our role in controlling the budgets of civilian and military missions under the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common security and defence policy (CSDP).</p>
      <p sl="it">The first part of the report particularly concerns the relationship between Parliament and the other institutions, primarily the Council and the Commission, driven by the post-Lisbon approach to European politics. Another very important subject is the EU’s multilateralism, which benefits, above all, from the recent establishment of the European External Action Service, which has at last come into being. In this regard, I have to welcome the recent resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly granting the European Union observer status within the Security Council, thus acknowledging what the Treaty of Lisbon enshrines.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have tried to produce an appraisal that corresponds to the current situation as far as possible. The report rightly highlights the great wave of civil protest in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, and also in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, and points out events, contexts and expectations for each of these countries, as well as other subjects of particular interest, such as our strong transatlantic alliance and our hugely important relations with Russia.</p>
      <p sl="it">Enlargement, support for civil rights and the establishment of the rule of law, diplomatic relations with the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the Arab-Palestinian conflict and condemnation of the bloodiest regimes are some of the subjects of the report that I am submitting to your vote.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the common security and defence policy (CSDP) is going through an extremely difficult time.</p>
      <p sl="it">Just when developments in the international system require the European Union to become a credible actor in security and defence; just when the European approach to crisis management through supporting democracy rather than exporting it appears to be more suited to the challenges of our times; just when the economic crisis makes the option of developing a common defence inevitable; just when the Treaty of Lisbon provides new instruments to develop the CSDP within the framework of an integrated approach; in short, just when a quality leap in the CSDP has become necessary and possible, the European edifice seems to be creaking dangerously and there is a real risk that the ambitions and possibilities of the CSDP will have to be drastically downsized.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report I am presenting seeks to tackle this contradiction and suggests possible answers for the other institutions. With regard to the Libyan crisis, we do not confine ourselves to expressing our disappointment either at the European Union’s inability to define its position and take joint action or at the restrictions placed on the EUFOR Libya mandate. We believe the time has come for a European political initiative, in conjunction with our other partners, to bring about a ceasefire and to hold negotiations that will put an end to the Gaddafi regime and begin a transition to an inclusive democracy. NATO’s military intervention is clearly unlikely to solve anything and it will do well to adhere scrupulously to the mandate of the UN resolution, avoiding any disproportionate use of force.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, we hope that CSDP assets will be used effectively to provide humanitarian assistance to the civilian population under attack and that future operations will be planned in such a way as to support the development of democracy in Libya. The Libyan situation also calls for reflection on a wider scale, and I believe it reinforces the report’s suggestions. Responsibility for the future of Europe and for security and defence, of course, lies primarily with the European Council, its members and also its President, who represents the Union in matters of foreign and security policy at that level.</p>
      <p sl="it">We say to them clearly that bilateral cooperation and coalitions of the willing cannot replace the CSDP as the Union’s policy. We do not find the idea of renationalising this policy convincing, not because we are Treaty purists, but because, if it were renationalised, this policy would not be equal to the challenges that lie ahead. We propose that Parliament should enter into a strategic dialogue with the European Council, which we call on to discuss Parliament’s recommendations, to draw up a proper foreign policy strategy and to devote an extraordinary meeting to European security and defence.</p>
      <p sl="it">We call on you, Baroness Ashton, to intensify your efforts to build a consensus among the Member States and to make use of your multiple functions to improve consistency between the CSDP, the common foreign and security policy and the other facets of the Union’s external action. The European External Action Service is an instrument with enormous potential for this work. The report puts forward several proposals for the role it should play, starting with that of being a crisis management board able to provide a genuinely integrated response to crises, and we are delighted to see that it is taking shape. The Libyan situation also confirms the inadequacy of Europe’s military capability, which is well below the overall high level of national defence budgets.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is quite obvious that strength only lies in unity. This involves pooling, sharing, strengthening of the European Defence Agency, permanent structured cooperation, development of an efficient and competitive European defence market, strengthening of the industrial and technological base, and enhancement of joint command and control capabilities. The inadequacy of these capabilities has been a factor preventing Europe from responding promptly to the Libyan crisis, starting with setting up a permanent operations general headquarters. The report formulates a large number of concrete proposals on this and other issues, such as the integration of external and internal security policies in a way that respects the primacy of the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is noteworthy that in this respect, the main pro-European political groups are united, and I thank the shadow rapporteurs and coordinators for this fruitful collaboration. Parliament is ready to support the development of a CSDP that is fully integrated with the Union’s external action and is rooted in the values and principles of Europe. Baroness Ashton, we hope you can respond convincingly to us both in words and, above all, in deeds.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Henry Kissinger defined the world of his time as militarily bipolar, economically unipolar and politically confused.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, international order is multipolar in all areas and, due to globalisation, is politically complex. Globalisation implies, among other things, the dispersion of centres of power and the collective management of common problems and interests. New international organisations and fora have emerged – an example is the summit diplomacy of the G20, G8, G7, etc. – and there are proposals to reform the traditional international organisations.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this context of change, and given the international legal personality of the European Union, it is vital that we urgently redefine the role that the European Union plays on this stage and that it takes its due place in the multilateral order so that it can fill the role of a relevant global player assigned to it by the Treaty and which this institution is requesting of it, along with European society at large, dare I say.</p>
      <p sl="es">This process has already begun with the approval of the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on 3 May, which will allow the European Union to participate in the General Assembly’s work. This is an historic event and a diplomatic triumph that we need to recognise without equivocation and for which I congratulate you, Baroness Ashton. However, given the complicated nature of the negotiations for the approval of Resolution 1973, we can anticipate the arduous work that awaits you to update and rationalise the representation of the European Union, which is fragmented and dispersed and has an ad hoc status in each of the 249 multilateral agreements involving the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">This does not only depend on you, clearly. It also depends on the non-EU states that are members of the various multilateral organisations. It depends also on organising the most effective form of representation within the European Union, and by organisation I mean an arrangement involving yourself – the European External Action Service – the President of the Commission, the President of the European Council and the now residual participation of the rotating presidencies of the Union. It also depends on the Member States transferring the pre-eminence of representation to the European Union, particularly in the case of international organisations committed to policies for which the European Union has exclusive competence.</p>
      <p sl="es">Baroness Ashton, we can all remember the Copenhagen climate change summit as an example of the useless cacophony that is brought about by over-representation of the European Union and its Member States. We can also remember how well representation of the Union worked in the World Trade Organisation or in the Food and Agriculture Organisation. Moreover, we can remember how disconcerting multiple representation of the various presidencies of the European Union can be in summit diplomacy, or the dysfunction that can arise through not implementing the provisions of Article 34 of the Treaty of Lisbon on the coordination of the European members of the United Nations Security Council when the common positions of the European Union are put forward. Mr Schulz has referred to these flagrant dysfunctions in his speech.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am referring, in this sense, more to the Member States than to yourself, in the call to construct the role of the European Union in a more structured multilateral world order and to draft a real EU foreign policy, setting aside any renationalising tendencies and temptations that are appearing in a number of our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, while we are essentially appealing to the Member States to construct this role of the Union, we are also appealing to your commitment to put your capacity for political initiative and your services to work in order to raise the level of the European Union’s external representation and rationalise it.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are at an historic moment for the world and you have the opportunity to lead the EU’s international role with, for example, initiatives such as the one you have announced of opening a Union office in Benghazi. You can count on the support of this Parliament, and not only its support, in fact, but also its mandate to establish a rational, structured and coherent representation of the European Union on the international stage as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Members for their contributions.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the themes that came through very much in what all of the group leaders said – although Mr Tannock pointed out that his group had never been in favour of the EEAS – was the desire to see, if we have one, the unified approach. I agree. I do not lack any ambition for what Europe can be. What I have to deal with is the reality of what we actually are. We passed a Treaty, and I joked that when the Treaty was passed, I was handed it and given a pencil and those were the resources that I began with. It is pretty much true, but we are not where we will be. The challenge we have is how to make sure that, not just this House and the desire of honourable Members with the passion that I feel here, but also the Commission, the Council, the Foreign Affairs Council, the Development Council, the Defence Ministers – all things that I chair and am responsible for bringing together – move with that same ambition. It does not surprise me at all, and I do not think it surprised honourable Members either, that on the way to this, particularly at a time when so many things are happening, we find that it does not necessarily work as effectively as you would like, or indeed sometimes as I would like.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we need to do is continue that level of ambition for where we want to get to. That applies in everything we do, whether it is the sanctions we impose – where we need the 27 because we need unanimity – or whether it is in the approach that we take on support for the countries of Egypt and Tunisia. As Mr Verhofstadt said, we need the support of the Commission to really move and change and have a new strategy and a new ambition in the long and the short term.</p>
      <p sl="en">Well, we support people right now. All of these things require us to shift and make changes. We are on that journey. I am not complacent about it at all, but I am realistic about exactly where we are. You can challenge me – and you should as often as you like – to try and make this move faster, and I will do so. But do not accuse me of a lack of initiative, of not being ambitious for it, and of not saying this loud and clear in the Foreign Affairs Council, in the media and elsewhere, because that is not true. I am really ambitious for this. I am really determined that Europe can be so much more than it is, but it requires us to get on that journey and stay on it together. It is difficult for individual Member States with individual constituencies to necessarily always be able to look at this through the lens of what is best for Europe in the world, and not what is best for the domestic situation. I understand that too.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with what Mr Daul said about neighbourhood terrorism and the Middle East peace process as being some of the key objectives that we have in terms of the work we do this year. It is why we have been so engaged, for example in Libya, on bringing together the regional organisations – the African Union, the Arab League, the UN and the OIC. This is really significant work in terms of thinking through how we are going to move forward in a process that it is currently extremely difficult. How do we get to the point where Gaddafi has to go? We have the dialogue where people can see the future, and that work goes on all the time. It is absolutely critical and it requires us to have a united front.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Schulz said that there is a long way to go. I agree. We have much more that we need to do, and we need to make sure that the building of democracy is a big part of that journey, but we are on that journey as well in terms of what we can do. I like the three ‘C’s. I think we can become much more coherent. I think we can be better in cooperation and, of course, communautaire is the objective I know this Parliament has. So please keep the pressure on me, but do so also in terms of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the Marshall Plan, I think what General George Marshall did with the initial USD 13 billion that he got from Congress in 1948 is an extremely good model. It is a good model, too, because of the different things he did. He got loans, services, advisers and the breadth of things that could make a difference, so I think that it is a good model. It is not the plan we talk about for obvious reasons. People want something that is new and for them, but it is significant. I agree with you about the support and the issues of debt. That is why we are in discussion with countries with whom those countries have that relationship, and it is also why we are in discussion with the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree about the terrible violence in Syria. I am not in any way lacking in ambition for what we should do with Syria. What we have got is again a journey on sanctions. We started with the 13 people who were directly involved in the repression of the regime. There was a lot of discussion, Mr Cohn-Bendit, about whether President Assad should be on and there were lots of different views. I cannot just give you a list of Member States who said yes or no. There were strong views about how we do this, bearing in mind some of the situations. The decision was taken that for the first list, no, but we will look at it again this week. I assure you that my determination is to put the maximum political pressure that we can on Syria and to try and make sure – as I did when I spoke to Foreign Minister Moallem yesterday – that they understand the significance of what they are doing and that they take this closing window to actually change course and make a difference.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Tannock, you talked about many things to do with the support of the 27, your desire to see us get the proper resources and being short-changed. I do not think we are short-changed. The institutions of Europe are all focused in the same direction. We have got to make sure that the ambitions that you have for what we can achieve can actually be realised. I have to find the resources for opening an office in Benghazi. Supporting better our delegations in Iraq, which some honourable Members discussed with me this morning, requires resources. We have to find them, both by being better and more efficient – I agree with that – but also by recognising what we have to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have already talked about the flotilla, some of the issues concerning the Palestinian authority and the discussions that are going on – Mr Belder, you raised them too – between Fatah and Hamas. I made it clear that our position on Hamas has not changed, but I made it clear that we support ways in which President Abbas can bring unity with Palestinians with his technocratic government and with elections, which is going to be so important. We have not changed our position, and we are very clear that we are cautious in looking at this situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also wanted to make some reference to what Mr Bisky said when he talked about the poorest in the world: ‘support life with dignity’ was his expression. I think what we do with the Millennium Development Goals and the work that we are doing in collaboration in bringing development together is going to be so important for that in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just quickly – because I do not want to take up too much time – I want to talk to Mr Albertini about his report and to quote from it. He talks about coherence and says ‘Coherence requires, first and foremost, the political will of the EU Member States to overcome their differing outlooks’. Absolutely. We know that, if we are going to be successful in implementing Lisbon fully – and this is what the report says – we need that sustainable funding in the next framework as well. I agree with the report in so many ways, but especially on the need to be proactive in promoting our values and in using all of the policy instruments that we have. I am also keen to improve the dialogue that we have.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the greatest difficulties we have is time – how much time to spend – and I want to make sure that we are using the best possible time in discussions with you. Mr Gualtieri, you and I had a good discussion yesterday. I agree about the importance of moving forward, particularly on pooling and sharing which will be part of the discussion with the Defence Ministers next week. We have got to make sure that we use the resources of Europe more effectively. It is a very simple idea to pool and share, but it is very powerful. We have big military potential, largely untapped, so decisions to use military assets and to support each other in pooling and sharing are something that we need to take forward. We are also trying to improve the work of the European Defence Agency and to take up some of the challenges that we have clearly seen in the responses that we have had in recent weeks, especially in Libya.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to thank Ms Muñiz De Urquiza for this report and for her support on the UN. I think in the work that I did at the UN last week I have demonstrated my personal commitment to the power of multilateral action. We have got to look at the EU in the UN system and in all of the other international organisations. We have got to be clearer in our voice and more prominent and more creative in what we do.</p>
      <p sl="en">That just leaves me to thank the first round of speakers and to say that I look forward to some final remarks at the end.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, in the discussion on European foreign policy and Europe’s position in the world, we are agreed that there is a need for improvement because of a variety of different circumstances. However, we could follow the example of a similar area of policy which already functions extremely well, in other words, external trade policy. The European Union has sole responsibility for external trade policy. It is the only player and the only representative of the Member States. It is not constantly being denounced on the basis of national vanity. We may disagree in other areas, but here we are strong and united.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is time for us to use our strength to ensure that the people living in our partner countries can benefit from the values that have helped us: human rights, social security, justice and freedom. This new dimension of European foreign policy is something that we should and, indeed, must follow up to make the world a freer, fairer and more social place in future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mrs Ashton, permit me first to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gualtieri, for his hard work, and also to thank the other shadow rapporteurs with whom I had the pleasure of working. I would like to say that, as a newcomer to this role, I had expected sharp altercations, particularly since the report has a certain military aspect to it, but as it turned out, the work progressed very peacefully.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In Mrs Ashton’s first speech, when she spoke about the conflicts which have broken out in North Africa, she said that we do not know where they will end and what that end will bring. Of course, we cannot say that the common security and defence policy will be a wonder drug for all the world’s evils, but development of the CSDP would certainly mean we would know more about those conflicts and that we could perhaps prevent or resolve them. I am thinking, here, about the conflicts which have broken out in North Africa and the Middle East, and also about the frozen conflicts which are still smouldering in Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria and the occupied territories of Georgia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is to be welcomed that Mr Gualtieri’s report covers many issues – it is a fairly lengthy report. For reasons of time, I will not mention many of them, but I would like to touch on two things. Firstly, the question of the operation of European Union missions. In the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, we spoke many times about how we must learn from mistakes or from certain shortcomings so that these missions function better in future. The question of the planning and management of European Union operations remains an open one. The ministers of the Weimar initiative have raised this in a letter to you, Mrs Ashton. We are hoping for specific action in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to mention EU-NATO relations. I welcome the fact that you maintain permanent contacts with the Secretary-General of NATO and the Secretary of State of the United States. We must continue these contacts, so as not to duplicate what we do – simply in order to save money. We know revolution is not possible, Mrs Ashton, but we do expect you to take action which will aid evolution.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, you have faced many criticisms over the last few days, Baroness Ashton. Some are no more than cheap political moves and my group has condemned them. Others, however, cannot be dismissed out of hand and I would like to share my concerns with you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that we do not always have a clear grasp of the EU’s external policy, particularly in terms of what it is aiming to achieve, in other words, its purpose. Your communiqués are adopted but are often low-key, from which we can deduce that there are probably differences of opinion within the Union, which is, in itself, a message, albeit a negative one. So, you set to work, you have your meetings, make your phone calls, you give it all you have got, there is no doubt about that, but the results of these efforts are, unfortunately, diluted in the media ruckus, and hence the Union’s foreign policy appears extremely weak in the face of the thunderous speeches delivered by some European Heads of State.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet here you have an extraordinary political space opening up in front of you with the Arab revolutions, and the role of European diplomacy in that space needs to be made very clear, because beyond the specific characteristics of each country, it is true that everything is connected. For instance, the Fatah-Hamas reconciliation would have been inconceivable without the Arab revolution in Egypt and also without the recent bloody repression in Syria. Indeed, it is because Bashar al-Assad has crossed the red line that Hamas suddenly no longer feels at ease in Damascus and is considering moves to Qatar and Cairo, and that it wanted to hold last-minute negotiations when it had been negotiating for ages. These opportunities need to be seized!</p>
      <p sl="fr">So what is our current policy on Syria and the Middle East? As I have said, it is unsatisfactory. Furthermore, I share the anger of some of my fellow Members regarding the Syrian exception and now the exception for Bashar al-Assad, who has avoided sanctions. This needs to be explained to us better, Baroness Ashton.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One more thing. Unless an eleventh-hour candidacy is received from Kuwait or Nepal, at the instigation of the United States, we could well see Syria heading up the UN Human Rights Council on 20 May. Can you really see Syria chairing the UN Human Rights Council?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, sanctions are not enough. Have you campaigned against Syria chairing the UN Human Rights Council? Have you pushed for an international inquiry into the massacres? Even if you do not manage to persuade the Heads of State – and I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit here – say so, do not leave us guessing! It is this ambiguity that weighs us down.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the Middle East, I am not exactly in agreement with you. You have cautiously welcomed the Fatah-Hamas reconciliation, but will you engage in dialogue with Hamas? Are we to repeat the mistakes of 2007? As we know, the situation is certainly very complicated. However, I think we need to grasp this opportunity. Hamas has supported the Arab peace initiative. Both parties have made incredible concessions to form this government. In the agreement governing the formation of this future government, which will take place in a month perhaps, there was acceptance of the concept of elections, of the Palestinian Authority, of the fact that Mahmoud Abbas could take part in negotiations, and of the concept of the 1967 borders, which are both an essential requirement and an implicit recognition of Israel. So do not tell me that you still stand where you stood two years ago. That would be unthinkable for us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, the matter is urgent. Caution in politics is no replacement for boldness: they must go hand in hand. Parliament will always be behind you if you have the courage to provide a strong vision.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we are still a long way from a common foreign policy which is really worthy of the name. You are being criticised for this, but it sometimes seems to me that you have been made the scapegoat in a situation which is outside your control and which is caused by the fact that the Member States do not have the political will to agree on a common approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us take the example of Libya. First of all, Italy blocked the imposition of sanctions, then France recognised the transitional council in Benghazi without any consultation and, finally, Germany abstained during the vote on the resolution in the UN Security Council. There is nothing you can do to change this, but it gives Europe a negative image. In Syria, we should have imposed stronger sanctions, but here, we also needed unanimity. There are some Member States – Greece, Italy and Spain have been mentioned in the press and Germany may also be one of them – which are opposed to this. In this case, you must stand up here and say: ‘We have only been able to put 13 on the list’.</p>
      <p sl="de">The need for unanimity is paralysing us. It no longer works with 27 Member States. We must make the next quantum leap forward in our common foreign and security policy. I would like to make this quite clear to Mr Tannock and his Tory friends.</p>
      <p sl="de">What can you do? Make public the fact that European cooperation has failed and identify who is responsible. Make use of the community instruments, in particular, to promote democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was surprised to hear you speaking here so openly about the European Endowment for Democracy. We are in the process of drawing up a report on the subject with Mrs De Keyser as the rapporteur and we are evaluating what the requirements are. I must make it quite clear that we do not want a second European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which is bureaucratic, slow, over-complex and unpolitical. We need a solution that is unbureaucratic, fast, simple and political. If you can bring this about, you will have our full support.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Mrs Ashton, one of the most moving moments of my life was in December 2007, when I was present at the symbolic opening of the border between Poland and Lithuania by President Kaczyński and President Adamkus, a ceremony held to mark the fact that Poland and Lithuania were joining the Schengen area. I would like to say that for us – people who grew up behind the Iron Curtain – freedom of travel and a Europe without borders are tangible examples of the success of European integration. I would like to make an appeal: under no circumstances should a return to borders in Europe become a political tool or an attempt at a populist response to what may perhaps even be real problems. The Schengen area is a great achievement and we should protect it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thank you, Mrs Ashton, for saying that our position on Hamas has not changed. The problem is, unfortunately, that the position of the Palestinians and of President Abbas on Hamas has changed. I would like to appeal to you, Mrs Ashton, to ensure that the huge amount of aid which is going to the Palestinian Authority is not used by Israel’s enemies for attacks on what is, at present, the only democracy in the region. I would like to remind everyone that Israel is the only country in the Middle East in which the Arab population can and does make use of the right to elect its representatives to parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to make this point to the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative: Europe’s foreign policy currently lacks leadership, boldness and Community method, and this at a time when the Union has more foreign policy instruments at its disposal than ever. You, as you often say yourself, are in listening mode: listening to national governments and waiting until they have pronounced themselves. Then you present the lowest common denominator, and often at times when events have already moved on</p>
      <p sl="en">On Syria, for example, what are you convinced of? Should Assad be included or not? What is your opinion? We would like to hear that. Do you want to threaten sanctions or not? You ask us, you did that in your reply, to put pressure on governments, so tell us which ones. Open the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sure, Member States often lack the political will to act in a unified and decisive way, and they do not want to see you strong, but believe me, Baroness Ashton, they will not support you and will not save your life as High Representative. They are not a guarantee for you to stay in your job, I promise you. And also this does not change the fact that the Lisbon Treaty envisaged a stronger role for you. You are the rotating Presidency. You are Vice-President of the Commission. You can take initiatives. You should set the agenda. You should set out in front your opinions, your decisions, and then let Member States react.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you do not take initiatives, at least do not kill those of others. For example, the review of the Göteborg Programme on Conflict Prevention: ten years ago, it was initiated by Anna Lindh. The Hungarian Presidency started a review and wanted you to take it over, but you stopped it. I do not understand why. I can only recommend you dare more, delegate more. Follow Margaret Mead, whom you cited. Be the agent of change that we need. I promise you: only this will save your position, and nothing else.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I think that you are right to feel wronged by the criticism levelled against you. How can you be to blame when you are bound by the decisions taken by the large states in the European Union. However, I have one more question: will those levelling criticism here against their governments do any different from what they are denouncing when they are in power in their countries? I also agree with what Mr Schulz said: that until recently, European states were selling arms to those whom we have now discovered to be dictators. However, policy means foresight, it means prompt diagnosis of problems; otherwise, we are simply conducting a post mortem.</p>
      <p sl="el">European states are bombing their recent partners; at the same time, however, they are bombing and destroying the arms they themselves sold. Obviously, you cannot sell new weapons without destroying the old ones. For us, if the European Union is to progress, it needs to develop a policy based on principles of peace, detached from military means and interventions, and to promote the demilitarisation of international relations. The Union needs to liberate itself from nuclear weapons and to help denuclearise the planet. That will be a moment of glory for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">A word about a neighbouring country in the Middle East: Turkey. Dozens of journalists are in gaol in Turkey and it still has 40 000 troops occupying half of Cyprus and violating the rights of Turkish and Greek Cypriots.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the attacks on Coptic churches in Egypt and the killing of Christians are signs that religious intolerance is worsening, betraying the spirit of unity shown in Tahrir Square, where Copts and Muslims demonstrated together against the regime.</p>
      <p sl="it">Coexistence and social stability are essential for an orderly transition to democracy, but they are made impossible by this lack of tolerance. The authorities in Cairo must therefore make a greater commitment to protect minorities and to oppose Salafi extremism, which is a negation of the principles of modern democracy to which the Egyptian people aspire. Economic development, with the resumption of foreign investment and, above all, tourism, is unthinkable without tolerance, order and stability.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is therefore in the interests of Egypt and the world that Europe should grant generous aid, but this aid must be conditional upon an effective policy to protect minorities, in line with the ‘more for more’ principle that you, Baroness Ashton, proposed together with Commissioner Füle.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, current events in Syria are once again making us aware of the dilemma that the European Union finds itself in with regard to the Middle East and what is happening in North Africa. For many years, we have given our support to despotic regimes and dictatorships in the Arab world. Now, when President Assad begins taking brutal measures against his own people, we are, of course, dutifully condemning his actions and imposing half-hearted sanctions. This is not what is meant by credibility, in my opinion. For the Arab world, democracy and human rights have obviously never been much more than empty words. It is clear that attempts are being made to conceal the fact that Brussels or, in other words, the European Union, has primarily been acting in the geopolitical interests of the Americans in this region.</p>
      <p sl="de">In particular, the helplessness of the European Union in the face of all the developments in the area of the southern Mediterranean gives cause for concern. We welcomed the coming of democracy when the revolts and uprisings began. What is happening now in Tunisia? At best, the situation can be described as chaotic, with the transitional government about to be overthrown again. Egypt has what seems to be a permanent or temporary military dictatorship which is persecuting the Coptic Christians. In Libya, there is a civil war in which the divided Europeans are intervening half-heartedly with half of their resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the Americans may find that Syria is a hard nut to crack. President Assad does not even need to worry that the army will turn against him under external pressure. There is also no protective power which could bring him down. Nevertheless, regime change in Damascus would definitely have far-reaching consequences for the entire region. The first Syrian refugees who are arriving in Turkey may be the vanguard of a major influx of people fleeing the conflict.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a result of the current situation in Syria and Libya, we in Europe and in Brussels urgently need to develop an autonomous policy which is not dependent on or influenced by Washington. Unlike the USA, Europe is directly affected by events in the region because of its geographical proximity. However, we must not allow ourselves to be dragged further into the Libyan civil war or we risk becoming a target for terrorism and extremism.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, with regard to the report on the EU as a global actor, developments on the international scene show there is an urgent need for the EU to act more swiftly. This means being ready to face global challenges. The Lisbon Treaty has created the framework and necessary instruments for such action.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should start by addressing global governance gaps. Examples such as the Copenhagen climate change summit, the United Nations General Assembly resolution on enhancement of participation rights – congratulations to Baroness Ashton – or EU participation in the International Monetary Fund show the necessity not only of addressing these issues, but also of finding a common strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report shows where the effort should be intensified. One of the most important fields is strengthening our role and coordination in the United Nations system. The same applies to the international financial institutions and multilateral security organisations. All this will not happen automatically. It will take time and consistent and coordinated actions on our side. What we urgently need is a long-term strategy clearly defining the steps and actions we need to take in order to consolidate our place on the global scene. I hope that such a strategy will be proposed soon by Baroness Ashton and that we will have an opportunity to discuss it here in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have one further remark, which has more to do with the Albertini report. This Sunday, there were local elections in Albania. I was the head of the EP ad hoc delegation which participated in observing the elections, and I have a message to share with you. The citizens of Albania – I am not speaking about the politicians but about the ordinary people – look at us – the EU – with trust and hope. They hope we will help them to find a solution to the very difficult political situation into which politicians have led their country. Compared to our global ambitions, what is needed here is a small step. How good can we be in our home field? However, it is a test that we have to pass successfully and with dignity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur, I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Albertini, for his very positive cooperation on this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this report and, of course, in this debate as well, we have rightly focused primarily on southern areas and on the Middle East. I do not want to repeat what Mr Schulz, Mrs De Keyser and others have said. I would just like to refer briefly to the situation in Palestine and Israel.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that the reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah and their readiness to found a state represent a major opportunity, because founding a state involves commitment and responsibility. We must definitely make that clear. We need the recognition of Israel, we need peace in the region and we need a renunciation of the use of violence.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">That is extremely important. However, Israel must also recognise an independent Palestinian state in just the same way as Hamas must recognise the state of Israel. Only when we have this two-state solution can we also bring about peace in the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="de">I want to look not only southwards but also eastwards, because, on the one hand, I headed a parliamentary delegation to Turkmenistan and, on the other, yesterday I was appointed as Parliament’s rapporteur for Russia. Despite the understandable focus on the problems in the south, we must not forget how important our eastern neighbours are. Turkey also plays a major role in this respect. We should not simply regard Turkey from the perspective of an accession candidate. Turkey must also be our partner, in particular, with regard to the situation in the Mediterranean. However, it is also important for us to strengthen our contacts with Turkey when it comes to the Black Sea region and to include Turkey in our common European foreign and security policy. This does not necessarily have anything to do with the question of accession.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, partnership with Russia is a very important factor. We want to establish a partnership with Russia, but we need to negotiate from a position of strength and self-confidence. This is something which we are sometimes lacking in. While Russia has too much, we have too little. Only when we are on an equal footing will we be able to reach an agreement. Although I am very much in favour of this partnership, which must be a strategic partnership, I am very surprised by the pressure that Russia is now exerting, in particular, in Ukraine. Previously, we would have described the members of the governments of Russia and of Ukraine as friends, but the way in which Russia is now behaving towards Ukraine is far from fair. The same goes for its behaviour towards some energy suppliers and we have also seen this in Turkmenistan. Therefore, we must make it clear to Russia that we want a partnership based on equality and on common interests. Our objective must definitely be to establish a genuine and active partnership.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of Central Asia, Baroness Ashton, we want to become involved, but we have no representations there. I know that there are financial problems, but we urgently need diplomatic representations in the area. We want to buy energy from these countries. We want them to move towards democracy and to respect human rights. However, we are not really becoming sufficiently involved. Mr Morel is an excellent man and he is doing a very good job, but it is not enough. We need to establish more representations in these countries in Central Asia which are our neighbours. Either these countries will look only to China or to Russia, or they will at least have a chance to look towards Europe. I believe that this is important.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to make it quite clear once again that we want to give you our full support. What you have said today is absolutely right. We in Parliament would perhaps like you to say it a little louder and more directly, even though that is not always your style, because then we would be able to give you even more support than we otherwise do.</p>

      <p sl="en">She may claim that the European Union has been engaged in some 25 missions with a CSDP label. Well, it is all about the label: few of these missions stand up to scrutiny. They are either missions better performed by NATO, straightforward civilian missions, or they are passive missions involving military personnel. They have usually come about because the European Union has begged somebody to invite it to do something. Currently, there are military operations being conducted by NATO in Libya. Having failed to get a mandate to enforce the maritime embargo, the EU has been desperately trying to get the UN to invite it to carry out a humanitarian assistance programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact is that neither NATO nor the UN wants the EU pretending to get involved militarily. Of course there is a great need for humanitarian assistance and the EU could play a useful role, but not in a way that merely seeks to promote a misplaced military ambition. The trouble is that the very existence of the CSDP and all its duplicative structures is divisive and encourages allies to think twice about robust commitment to NATO operations.</p>

As my colleague, Danny Cohn-Bendit, asked you, who is the one – or who are the ones – who blocked it in the Council? Is it Mr Westerwelle or who? Tell us, and you will find support from us if you are transparent and open with us. I think that will get support for you. Explore your mandate. You will have more support here from us if you tell us more about what is going on in the Council. Go ahead and tell us.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that is true for coherence as well, as you and so many others here have said. In the Albertini report that we will be voting on this week, we also call for the national policies to be supportive of the EU positions and of you, and I call on my colleagues here in the European Parliament, those of you who are from government parties in your own countries: tell your foreign ministers and your prime ministers to support the common European policy and not just look into your own domestic interests, including in foreign policy, otherwise we will never get a common European foreign policy for which we need you, Baroness Ashton, to lead, to be ambitious and to be bold in your commitments.</p>
      <p sl="en">61 years after the Schuman Declaration, which we celebrated two days ago, we need more Europe than ever. What we want is very concrete: conflict prevention and civilian crisis management, Lady Ashton. We demand that in the External Action Service, we have independent impact assessments as a standard procedure for the qualitative evaluation of the security, human rights, gender, social and economic effects of each CSDP mission and we need more civilian personnel in these missions as well.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, for a start, I pay tribute to my colleague who has just spoken for her tireless work on human rights. She talks about a common EU policy on foreign affairs, etc. But does she share my dismay at the hypocrisy of the European Union? As she and I both know, the EU is opposed to the death penalty, and yet the joint statement by President Barroso and President von Rompuy on the death of Bin Laden says that it ‘shows that such crimes do not remain unpunished’. Does that imply acceptance that the death penalty is a punishment?</p>

      <p sl="en">However, that is not meant to be a criticism of her.</p>
      <p sl="en">What she is saying that Mr Barroso stated was not hypocrisy. It was a statement that was made. I might be critical of it and, as I said, I would have been more in favour of having Osama Bin Laden tried in an international criminal court, for example, but that has not happened. However, I do not attach any hypocrisy to this because we need a common European position. On the death penalty, I think things are clear in this continent at least – although not in other parts of the world, unfortunately.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This Palestinian agreement is a key political event, and contrary to what has just been said here, Hamas has, for the first time, agreed to the PLO and the Palestinian Authority acting as its negotiating partners. It accepts the 1967 borders and the Quartet’s conditions, including the rejection of violence. A transitional government in charge of preparing for elections is due to be put in place. Therefore, conditions are ripe for the United Nations to recognise the Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital, next September.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Leaving aside what you said earlier, Baroness Ashton, what further steps will the European Union take to recognise the Palestinian State and champion this idea before the United Nations?</p>

Baroness Ashton has made it very clear that the second flotilla will be a completely unnecessary provocation which could harm this process.

Of course, the world is changing; the European Union is being called upon to face huge challenges and it needs to take serious action in order to do so. Threats from ongoing poverty, the social exclusion of large swathes of the population, spiralling unemployment, geopolitical changes in the Arab world, take particular note of that, natural disasters and immigration are the basic problems at present and presage tensions for the future.</p>
      <p sl="el">In particular, the question of immigration, which has become a sore point recently between Italy and France, has called the Schengen Agreement into question. In my opinion, we cannot ignore the immigration problem, but we must handle it cautiously and decisively. Yes to solidarity, but yes also to the maintenance of social structures. Any debate on the Schengen Agreement must, in my opinion, be accompanied by amendments to Dublin II.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I have words of sympathy and support for Baroness Ashton: I was watching a BBC programme recently on which you were being interviewed by Jeremy Paxman, who asked you some very pertinent questions and you felt very uncomfortable. He asked you from whom you actually take your orders and which of the 27 nations you can actually speak about – and I think those questions have resonated in the Chamber today.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is not one common policy, is there? We saw this with the UN resolution on the no-fly zone in Libya, when Germany voted against it. How can we have a common policy when one of the major EU countries actually votes in opposition to two other major EU countries? You have an impossible task.</p>
      <p sl="en">My words of support – and I was relieved to read in the Sunday papers that you denied you would be quitting your post – are these: as someone who is very critical of a common EU policy and of the EU taking sovereignty from my country, I wish you to stay in post for as long as possible because, while you are there, I do not think we are going to have much problem with loss of sovereignty. After all, when you were the leader of the UK House of Lords, and you pushed through the Lisbon Treaty, which created your GBP 313 000-a-year job, you actually said, over and over again, that this was just a tidying-up exercise and not a significant transfer of sovereignty. You said that repeatedly to the House of Lords. So there is no point asking you questions, because can we get an honest answer?</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the central factor in this overly broad debate should be the situation in North Africa and the Near East.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must approach this debate without extolling virtues – Baroness Ashton has rightly highlighted some positive elements; I would emphasise the good or, rather, the better provision of information between Parliament and the European External Action Service – yet also without concealing defects, and a voice as sensible as that of Giorgio Napolitano, our former fellow Member and President of the Italian Republic, has reminded us of this recently.</p>
      <p sl="es">Among the negative aspects, and despite the efforts of Baroness Ashton, is the different yardsticks against which the cases of Libya and Syria are measured in the United Nations Security Council and also in the Council of Ministers of the European Union. Also among the negative aspects, Baroness Ashton, is the situation of Camp Ashraf: you are aware of the positive, constructive and moderating role that my group is playing in the development of foreign policy, and believe me when I say that the importance and sensitivity of the Iranian dossier has not escaped me.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, in spite of the warnings about the humanitarian aspect made to your services, to your collaborators, to your cabinet and to your Director-General, and despite the fact that I submitted a draft statement to you myself, you did not speak out until there had been 32 deaths and more than 300 wounded. You can draw your own conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="es">You yourself said this morning that we have to act and we have to be coherent, particularly in relation to the defence of human rights; especially by taking risks, Baroness Ashton, when there are lives in danger.</p>
      <p sl="es">My question to you is this: with regard to the Cuban dissident, Juan Wilfredo Soto García, who was arrested, beaten and finally killed, are you willing to call for an investigation to shed light on these tragic events? If this investigation shows that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the beating received and his death, are you willing to condemn them?</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, Lady Ashton, I listened very attentively and with great satisfaction to your speech and I did not hear a single word with which I am not in agreement. Nevertheless, you will encounter, both in this Chamber and among the European Union’s citizens, harsh criticism of our ability to demonstrate a single approach and joint actions.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The Treaty of Lisbon created important conditions enabling the European Union to speak with one voice on the international stage. This voice, through you, speaks clearly. However, success can only be achieved if the other voices remain silent or are at least quieter. On the contrary, what we see is uproar. So far, we have a cacophony to offer the world, in which it is often difficult for us to hear the important message which the European Union wants to convey.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I think, Lady Ashton, that our institution – the European Parliament – is your natural ally in the battle involved in implementing the Treaty of Lisbon. Use us as much as you can because we are writing today the next report for the common foreign and security policy and because the exceptional dynamic activity going on in 2011 gives us a chance to put our own house in order.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I fully endorse the assessment that our support for the countries in North Africa, particularly for Tunisia and Egypt, must be provided in two stages. One long-term stage has already been largely outlined. However, Egypt and Tunisia need support now, this very year, and on a scale way beyond what is being discussed at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="bg">There are two aspects to the Arab revolutions. One was the lack of freedom and democracy, while the other was lack of social prospects and a sense of hopelessness. The revolutions will only be able to succeed if these two problems are resolved in tandem.</p>
      <p sl="bg">At a conference in Tunisia, organised by the Party of European Socialists, attended by representatives of parties and movements from the whole region, we asked the European Union for an emergency programme which will support the democratic processes now, immediately. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is also significantly increasing its commitment to the region. I am mentioning this to emphasise how important it is for us to make a commitment at every level.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Finally, I want to say that the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly was created last week. This is a clear signal that our Eastern partners want stronger political dialogue with the European Union. Let us not forget them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, words are tools, words are instruments and words can be weapons in foreign policy. Therefore, they should be used sparingly and prudently, but there are occasions when they must be used decisively.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say to the High Representative that I sorely missed her voice during the very first few days of the horrors perpetrated by the Syrian authorities. I believe that the courageous citizens who were – and still are – demonstrating in Syria at great personal risk have missed your voice even more. There are rare occasions when one needs to speak up immediately. This was one of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to the Middle East. I believe that withholding of taxes collected in Palestine by the Israeli Government is an ill-inspired action, and what is more, it is inconsistent first to demand that the authorities of the West Bank and Gaza should find an arrangement – an agreement – and when the agreement comes, to take this decision then. Moreover, this decision is extremely cynical as it is very likely that the European Union will have to make up for the financial shortfall in any case.</p>

Existing diplomatic offices have been given new names, but the Union has not strengthened its position as an actor on the global stage.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One might wonder if it is possible to operate a common policy for the 27 Member States of the Union at all. Conclusions like this flow directly from the Albertini report, which notes a lack of will on the part of Member States to conduct a common policy and the statements of some representatives of those Member States which have created the impression of disunity. Similar conclusions are found in the Gualtieri report, which draws attention to the widespread overlapping of defence programmes and the consequent wasting of limited economic resources. NATO, therefore, continues to be the only effective force, and the Left-wing voices in Parliament, expressed in writing in a minority opinion and demanding, among other things, the dissolution of NATO, are dangerous and frankly anarchistic.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the excellent report by Mr Gualtieri concerning the common security and defence policy includes an important stocktake of the situation. I would like to highlight four priorities for the security and defence policy which we should follow up over the course of the next year.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first is that we must carry out a realistic assessment of the joint missions and, in particular, an external evaluation. We must also incorporate them into our regional policy concepts. This applies, in particular, to the Horn of Africa.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we need to make progress in pooling and sharing military capacity. We must ensure that the separate route which the French and British are following is brought back into a common European solution. The European Defence Agency has ideas on this subject. You should put these ideas on the table and ensure that there is a public debate, so that we can make progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we need a public discussion about a new European security strategy. The paper produced by Mr Solana in 2003 was a positive contribution at the time. However, the world has moved on and we need a public debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, we urgently need to come to an agreement with the parliaments of the Member States about joint parliamentary supervision of the common security and defence policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we, by which I mean you, Baroness Ashton, and this Parliament, can succeed in making progress with the common security and defence policy in these four areas, in a year’s time, we will be very happy with what we have achieved.</p>

This is my first speech, and I would therefore like to greet all my fellow Members in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I wish to comment briefly on the creation of the EU’s common foreign policy. Having a common, stronger voice in our foreign policy is certainly a good thing, but it cannot diminish the importance of the foreign policy of the Member States themselves, or its flexibility or independence. We have to ask: who does the EU represent if it is not the Member States? Again, we have to ask: who do the representatives of the Member States represent, if the EU represents them?</p>
      <p sl="fi">It must be a basic principle that structures are not created twice over and that the Union’s structures do not swell needlessly.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon, with its excessively complicated changes, renders setting up institutions and defining duties difficult. Even the existing institutions are unable to perform their proper functions due to the many changes. Thus, chaos rules everywhere, and everyone is confused.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The question arises: what sense is there in creating and vesting with power the European External Action Service, which still has not commenced operations? Defence and security is an area everywhere in the world which requires rapid reaction and action. While the composition, locations and positions are being debated, the European Union is passing up the opportunity of being able to function meaningfully in this area. Once it has been established, it should work and be effective. For precisely this reason, we must do all we can in order to launch the service as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Regrettably, in the area of external relations, the country currently holding the Presidency cannot shape a programme for foreign affairs, common defence or security, and thus, my fellow Members, you have no other choice than to support Mrs Ashton’s work, which is starting with great difficulty.</p>

This applies, in particular, to the process of establishing the representations, where considerable improvement is needed as a result of the funds and the limited time available.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, it is a major problem that every European foreign minister currently feels the need to run once round Tahrir Square carrying his or her national flag. However, despite this behaviour, we must ensure that our common strategy is made clear. It is our job and also your job to achieve this. We must make use of the positions, in actual fact, there are three of them, which have been brought together in the Treaty of Lisbon and which you represent, not to find and then to implement the lowest common denominator among the Member States, but instead to take over political leadership, so that the common position is given a greater role and is so convincing that we can carry the other countries along with us. This is extremely important if we really want to make progress in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">Earlier, you agreed with Mr Gualtieri about pooling and sharing. I would like to thank him, Mrs Muñiz De Urquiza and Mr Albertini. However, we need a three-pronged approach involving leading, pooling and sharing. Those are the three things that we should have. There are many individual points which we could raise here and which require tasks to be shared. What progress is being made in Ukraine? Will war break out between Azerbaijan and Armenia at the end of the summer? There are signs that this will be the case. Of course, there are also the major questions relating to the Arab world, which many of my fellow Members have referred to. How should we react to events such as the flotilla, which, in my opinion, is a provocative act? How should we deal with President Assad? How can we ensure that the People’s Mujahedin in Iran does not receive any support, because I am opposed to supporting it, but, at the same time, guarantee that Camp Ashraf is not attacked again and its occupants killed? We need to take a sensible approach in order to identify a common position.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will help you to establish the European External Action Service (EEAS). However, we also expect the type of leadership which will allow for policy making at a higher level and which will convince the Member States, despite the complex requirement for unanimity. This will only be possible with convincing leadership. We will continue to wait for the results that follow from the development of the EEAS.</p>

It marks the ongoing replacement of European nation states with an EU supranational government, meaning above nation states. This is in contrast to intergovernmental, where nation states freely cooperate, but do not cede powers to a higher central authority.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Libyan no-fly zone illustrates the difference. The intergovernmental United Nations agreed a no-fly zone pioneered by nation states such as Britain, France and the United States, whilst nation states such as Germany and Russia abstained for their own valid reasons. The intergovernmental NATO is now conducting that operation through voluntary participation.</p>
      <p sl="en">In contrast, the supranational EU vigorously opposed David Cameron’s proposal for a no-fly zone.

Baroness Ashton, at the end of our joint debate, we shall vote on the report on the European Union’s role in multilateral organisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">Two years ago, at the hearing that preceded your taking office, I asked you what your position was on the European Union having a single seat in the United Nations.

What is yours today? Have you had time to think about it over the last two years?</p>
      <p sl="it">Baroness Ashton, 17 May is Europe-Iraq Day in Baghdad. The EU presence in Iraq consists of two officials and one ambassador. These three people operate in the British compound. You would rightly like to find the resources to resolve the situation. To help you, I would point out that there are seven EU officials in the Bahamas. What happens that is so infinitely more decisive for the fate of the European Union in the Bahamas compared with Baghdad? Would it not be better to have 17 officials in Baghdad, since we are close to signing the first EU-Iraq agreement in post-Saddam history? Might they perhaps even resolve the Camp Ashraf drama in situ, since I am sure that your personal intervention could easily lead to a positive solution to it?</p>
      <p sl="it">Baroness Ashton, you have already intervened on the subject of the Egyptian Copts; however, not only has the persecution continued, but today, it is a worrying element in the so-called ‘Arab Spring’. The communications from the European External Action Service still talk of it as being a conflict between extremists. However, only Christians are dying and only churches are burning in Egypt.

      <p sl="it">In view of the strategic repositioning of countries such as the United States, China and Russia, and growing shortages of raw materials and energy resources, Europe should develop a crucial, decisive role, but it is quite clearly showing itself to be unprepared for such challenges.</p>
      <p sl="it">For some time now, it has been moving too slowly towards coordination of the external and domestic policies of its Member States. There has been no substantial progress. Evidence of this is, on the one hand, the lacklustre action deriving from its external policy and, on the other, the obstinacy of certain countries that are nostalgic for a colonial period that can no longer return and insist on believing that they protect their interests better by doing things alone and not delegating anything to European authority. We need to turn over a new leaf. Baroness Ashton, you have an important role; please fulfil it to the utmost, in the knowledge that the time available is quickly running out.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Europe is today facing two problems. The first is the need for a new vision of the Neighbourhood Policy. I was in Tunisia recently, and I saw how much is being expected of the European Union. We are in permanent contact with Ukraine, and I know that there, too, they are hoping for more – more opportunities for the development of social cooperation and more contacts, and they are hoping that we do not retreat into our European selfishness.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I know it is difficult for you to carry out your work, Mrs Ashton, because you are on your own and it was not you who decided this – this is how the EEAS was set up – but the impression is being given that in the autumn, we thought Belarus was the most important issue, while today – a little like children who have become interested in something else – we are looking at North Africa. What is needed is a new vision of the Neighbourhood Policy, and that, today, is in your hands. In recent months, you have shown you are a strong person and that you are up to this task. Perhaps Europe should not, today, as in the days of ancient Rome, be defending itself along a Limes line, along the Rhine or some other place, but should be proposing a bold political vision, not just one concerning the problem of immigration, but a political vision. One might say that the fate of Europe, today, at this historic moment, is in your hands, Mrs Ashton, and we are very much counting on this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, atrocities are happening in Camp Ashraf – atrocities that we obviously condemn and about which we are profoundly concerned – but I would like to ask Lady Ashton what instruments we are using apart from words? Are we considering trade measures, aid measures, and other concrete and real measures, rather than persuasion, which is fruitless?</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding Neighbourhood Policy towards the countries on the doorstep of the Union, I think this is the most important part of your portfolio, Lady Ashton. It is the core of foreign policy, because if we fail there, we fail in overall foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The naked truth is that we are in retreat and in defensive mode in the southern neighbourhood and the eastern neighbourhood. We have been taken by surprise. Lady Ashton says there are storms in the neighbourhood. That is the word she used. Where is our meteorological road map? Time is a key factor in this policy and a scarce resource. In our Neighbourhood Policy, we are always lagging behind events. Even Lady Ashton’s and Commissioner Füle’s review of the European Neighbourhood Policy is delayed for the third time – and delayed in her office.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our sin is inaction. Foreign policy is about acts that change the course of events, not about words, series of meetings, fruitless persuasion and floods of statements. We should be using real and hard instruments to change things in Libya, Syria, Camp Ashraf and Belarus. Following Member States and waiting for permission from Foreign Ministers to go ahead has become Lady Ashton’s doctrine and she treats it as virtue. It is the wrong approach. It condemns our foreign policy to the lowest common denominator and to always being late. We want a High Representative to lead, not to follow.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our debate has two weaknesses. First, we very often content ourselves with condemnation and making ineffective visa bans, which are ridiculously weak instruments. We also call for more money, to clear our conscience, but there is a lot of Arab money which is not invested in Arab democracy and Arab prosperity.</p>

      <p sl="nl">What is our and your message to the General Assembly? How can you get a single common position from the Member States without falling back on the lowest common denominator? What specific action – Mr Daul asked the same thing – will we subsequently undertake in order to realise our message?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we are all facing mammoth challenges to which we need to find an answer. These challenges are not only to be found in Bahrain, Yemen, Iran and Armenia. They are also to be found in our immediate neighbourhood: Belarus, Syria, Egypt and Libya. These challenges are very real. There is suppression, war and violence against religious minorities, refugees are flooding towards us and too slow a start has been made in establishing the rule of law and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Baroness Ashton, you are our figurehead, the figurehead of the European Union. We cannot allow ourselves, the European Union, to be left behind in discord and indecision. You have a crucial role to play, both formally and informally, not just behind the scenes, but also in the meeting rooms and, in particular, beyond them. I am aware, I do realise, that you have to tread on eggshells, but you should know that we, the European Parliament, support you as you push on to convince the Member States that a joint European approach is worthwhile, push on to achieve an effective, coherent and common foreign policy and to be the face of that policy, push on in order to get the best people in the best positions in the External Action Service and push on in order to strengthen Europe’s position and that of its citizens, who are the important thing.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Lady Ashton, today, we are debating the key issues in the field of the Union’s foreign policy and three important European Parliament texts on the role of the European Union in the world. However, the question that we are all asking in today’s debate is if, in fact, there is a common foreign policy. With Europe delaying in finding its feet and appearing to be cowardly, weak and, for a long time, to have no voice in the historically important event of the last decade, by which I mean the uprisings in the Arab world, with the Member States failing to take a united stand on the critical UN Security Council Resolution 1973 on Libya, and with the Union hesitating on Syria, I wonder whether perhaps the question has already been answered in practice.</p>
      <p sl="el">We had high hopes following the Treaty of Lisbon. However, if the Council is not up to the job, when national selfishness and personal strategies prevail in decision making, then Europe and the European ideal have lost yet another battle.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I share the opinion of my fellow Members with regard to the unfortunate and inconsistent approach taken by individual governments to the challenges currently facing us. I also join with Baroness Ashton in calling for the debate to be extended to include the national governments. I would specifically like to ask what benefit government A or government B hopes to gain from pressing ahead unilaterally or from blocking a decision. What is the benefit? It must be greater than the impact that we can have by taking united action in the Union. I believe that some governments would find it difficult to explain their actions.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I am confident that we are in the painful process of learning from our mistakes. The financial crisis and the debt crisis have, to a certain extent, had a beneficial impact by creating a greater sense of cooperation, in particular, as far as the common foreign and security policy is concerned. Other speakers have referred to pooling and sharing. On 8 April, the EU Military Staff submitted 300 projects from the Member States in this area. I would like to know what you now plan to do with these projects. Are there plans to use this initiative to launch the permanent structured cooperation which has not yet been put into operation? Will you ensure that the European Defence Agency and the EU Military Staff have central responsibility for implementing this initiative?</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Bütikofer listed four priorities for the next year which I largely support. On several occasions, the European Parliament has called for a White Paper to be drawn up on the security and defence policy. What is your opinion on this?

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to start with two initial observations. I prefer individual debates to a joint debate. We are dealing with separate issues, which deserve independent and in-depth discussion. Meanwhile, I would like to echo the words of Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra about the death of the Cuban dissident, Mr Soto.</p>
      <p sl="es">Please allow me to make three additional comments.</p>
      <p sl="es">Unfortunately, when all of us were hoping we could focus on the European Union’s external role these years, the serious economic and financial crisis has been taking up all our efforts. However, a great number of external challenges, particularly in our Mediterranean neighbourhood, mean we cannot afford to wait. The European Union must have a political and economic presence in the processes of change taking place in the Arab world.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am also celebrating, Baroness Ashton, the fact that the European Union’s voice in the United Nations General Assembly was finally strengthened in New York last week as the result of a vote that received widespread support. I congratulate you on that, given that last year’s disaster raised worrying questions about the future role of the Union in the world and in international organisations.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the divergent European votes on Resolution 1973 of the United Nations Security Council highlight the enormous difficulties – I stress, enormous difficulties – involved in achieving an effective common security and defence policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">To summarise, Baroness Ashton, you and Mr Van Rompuy, who also has many responsibilities in foreign matters, have the huge task of convincing the Member States of the need for unified and coherent external action. The two of you will have to work hard to push, drag and lead, at a moment in history that we had intended to tackle with the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, let us stop moaning that we do not have a common European policy. In some areas, we do have a common policy, while in other areas, we do not. In fact, as far as the Neighbourhood Policy is concerned, a common policy is in operation. The new Member States are able to support the West in North Africa in a unique way because the West does not have the necessary credibility. That credibility is provided by those who carried out the revolutions in the countries of Eastern Europe. In the East, we all have interests in these matters – in the East just as in the West. However, the old Member States have the money, they have the means. We need that money to pursue a common Neighbourhood Policy in both the East and the South and to build our credibility.</p>
      <p sl="pl">While we are talking about policy in the area of defence – what kind of a defence policy is it in which Europe does not have an army? Sixty European aircraft are operating over Libya – 60 deaf and blind aircraft. There is no intelligence service, and these aircraft are not in a position to carry out their mission effectively. If the Americans had not joined the mission at the beginning, the mission would not have achieved anything. There would be no effect at all. So let us stop moaning that we do not have a common policy. As long as we do not have a common army, we will not have a common policy on security and defence.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the Libyan crisis has, unfortunately, once again illustrated the European Union’s difficulties in existing diplomatically and militarily. However, it would be most unfair to blame you solely for the lack of political will displayed by the Union, even if many of us believe that more decisive action could have been and should have been taken.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also true that the Member States bear a great deal of responsibility for this inability to come up with a coherent, effective and visible policy on this matter, while our US friends relied heavily on Europe to act. The Libyan crisis aside, however, we must be mindful of the major strategic developments that mean that we must not give up on the ambition of a common security and defence policy, as enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, and which you, Baroness Ashton, must continue to inspire, support and speak up for.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Taken together, the unprecedented fiscal constraints on defence budgets, the many international crises and the United States’ strategic redeployment are significant factors that leave us no choice but to take our destiny into our own hands. Faced with these many crises and threats, we cannot just hand over the keys to our US friends and allies or to NATO. Neither the United States nor NATO was able to end the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, for example, and nor can the United States or NATO observe the current ceasefire there. It is the European mission that has full legitimacy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can clearly see in Libya that the United States did not want to be in the front line and that NATO’s minimum undertaking is insufficient.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Baroness Ashton, the common security and defence policy is not just something achieved over 10 years or just an ambition enshrined in the Treaties. It is also a strategic requirement, and you must be at the forefront taking the necessary initiatives.</p>

      <p sl="bg">… (poor recording)</p>
      <p sl="bg">Mr President, it is becoming clear that administrations in some of the capitals in our Union now realise what the Treaty of Lisbon stands for and find it difficult to adopt a foreign policy initiative which does not come from them. This is precisely why we need strong European leadership, which will have courage if there is a need to bang on the table and demand Member States to adopt a common position. I appeal, of course, to Member States as well not to attempt to renationalise our foreign policy and to help you, Lady Ashton.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We need not only strong European diplomacy but also effective civilian and military capabilities so that we are not only, at the moment, the biggest, albeit a ‘toothless’ donor of development and humanitarian aid to the world, but also a serious player in global politics. I believe that the European Union’s own military capabilities will also provide assistance to our US and NATO allies, both in a political and military sense, especially with regard to our close neighbours. Any conflict confirms this.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I support the pooling and sharing of our defence resources and the integration of our security and defence policy. We need a common security and defence strategy. However, having an effective European foreign policy and our own defensive capabilities without having our own intelligence service and a facility for gathering information is like having a house without a roof. This issue must be put on the agenda again. Either Member States need to exchange information more efficiently with the external service and the European Union, or the European Union needs to have its own information and analysis channels.</p>

In general, there is a policy of double standards protecting the economic interests of European arms manufacturers, which have made millions by selling arms to dictators who have subsequently used them to massacre their own people and those of neighbouring states.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Consequently, some of the key questions arising from this debate are whether policies on the arms trade will finally be changed, and what exactly is going to be done to put an end to the expansionist and warmongering policies of Israel …</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, it is clear to us all that we cannot expect you to set up extensive security operations in crisis areas throughout the world in the short time that has elapsed since the creation of your office.</p>
      <p sl="sk">On the other hand, your office already provides you with extensive scope for negotiating in any place where the EU can play a useful role through its opinions and political influence. One of the problems directly affecting the EU and where there is a need to look for a solution through sensitive round-table negotiations is the occupation of EU territory by the Turkish army in Cyprus.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is self-evident that foreign and security policy is the defining role of a sovereign state. To make it the role of a supranational authority ignores or devalues the vital question of relations between Member States, or is, in fact, an admission that they are no longer sovereign states.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is nothing wrong with an EU policy of avoiding all European wars, but I would reject the supposition that a surrender of sovereignty is necessary to achieve that. It should also be the function of every European state to defend Europe’s great achievements from distraction or dilution. Aggressive wars in which European nations have no legitimate interest must be avoided at all costs. Equally, we must not engage in behind-the-scenes agitation in a hypocritical attempt to plant so-called ‘European values’ in inhospitable soil.</p>

      <p sl="it">For my part, I think this has been a useful and important debate, which shows how united Parliament is and how ready it is to offer its support for consistent and effective external action by Europe. We have not only heard recriminations for the obvious limitations shown by Europe in recent events, but we have also heard proposals offering a kind of strategic partnership between Parliament and the other institutions in order to make Europe a credible actor in security and defence matters. I believe this partnership would be not only an opportunity but a necessity as well because, if what we have been saying is true, which is that Europe’s integrated approach is its main potential, achieving that integrated approach will require the support of a body endowed with clear legislative and budgetary powers. For that reason as well, I think we should find a balanced solution to the matter of interparliamentary cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="it">It has become clear from the discussion how we must act. We must first of all assess the possibilities offered by the Treaty: by permanent structured cooperation and by Article 44, which makes it possible to delegate the task of carrying out a mission to particular Member States, but within an EU procedural framework, which is not the same thing as renationalisation. We need to make use of existing structures – starting with the European External Action Service – and set ourselves ambitious tasks in the field of capabilities. Of course, we also need to know how to offer leadership ability.</p>
      <p sl="it">We would like to thank Baroness Ashton for her commitment and for the important statements she has made. It is an attractive thought, as she said, that a small group can do great things, but Europe is a great civilised power which cannot shirk its responsibilities.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Member then asked Baroness Ashton, ‘Is there a foreign minister and a phone number he can call now?’ Her very British answer was: ‘Yes, I do that job, although I am called High Representative/Vice-President and not foreign minister. There is also a phone number, but it is answered by a machine saying to press 1 for the British position, 2 for the French, 3 for the German, and so on’.</p>

      <p sl="es">There is a democratic opposition in Iran, represented by the Green Movement, by various political groups within the Green Movement, and the condemnation of human rights violations should in no way be confused with political support for this group.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank honourable Members for what has been a full-ranging debate. Mr Albertini, I am happy to stand anywhere as long as it is actually in the room – I suspect there may be a few people who would prefer it if I was not – and I am very happy to speak from the podium; it is the obvious place between the two. I do appreciate very much the work that you, Mr Albertini, and the other rapporteurs have done in producing what I think are really useful and helpful reports in terms of addressing the breadth of European action.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I want to say, too, that there is greater coherence than perhaps anyone listening to this debate might imagine. We do have strong united foreign policy positions on a whole range of issues, from the breadth of our concerns on human rights to the specific work that we are doing on the Middle East, in our neighbourhood, on Serbia/Kosovo, on Bosnia, or in our approach in Africa, where we now look at the situation hopefully beginning to be resolved in Cote d’Ivoire but worrying today in Uganda.</p>
      <p sl="en">All of these positions are worked out with the 27 Foreign Affairs Council ministers and I have to pay tribute to them. I think that we are moving inexorably to a greater sense of coherence. There is a lot more to do – I do not dispute that – and there is a lot more that you would wish us to do; but do not let us underestimate what we have already managed to achieve and the journey that we are on to do that. So I want to pay tribute to them and the fact that they often speak on behalf of all of us too; we cannot be everywhere in the world all at once. Today, we have Foreign Ministers in different parts of the world carrying messages on behalf of myself, on behalf of the European Union. That is an important aspect of what we do as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I say, too, that we are almost always the first to produce statements, the first to come out and say what we think should happen. It was my office that produced the non-paper on sanctions on Syria; we are in the driving seat. Not always reported, may I say, not always put forward in the press across the European Union, but we are the first to actually put out our statements and we produce hundreds of them to make the point consistently of the importance of what we do; and consistency is a critical factor in what is being discussed today.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the course of our debate, we focused on certain parts of the world, but in the course of further speeches, honourable Members have raised a whole range of different issues which we still must continue to deal with.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Salafranca talked about what has been happening in Cuba over the weekend with Mr Soto and we are looking carefully at that. We have asked for more information on that case because clearly that is an area of enormous importance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some honourable Members have asked about Gaza, about making sure that the aid is getting through, that we continue to support the people of Gaza – which we do, but we are engaged in a dialogue to increase and improve that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then there are the events in Nagorno-Karabakh between Azerbaijan and Armenia, where we have been in discussion with both, and where we are looking to support what France is doing in terms of trying to drive forward the process there.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Albania, we have been in discussions with the Prime Minister and with the opposition to try to get the dialogue moving.</p>
      <p sl="en">And, of course, across Africa, I mentioned two countries, but we could talk about many more, not least as regards what is happening again today in Sudan and the importance of ensuring that South Sudan is created with the best possible chances of success</p>
      <p sl="en">And then there is Ukraine, an important neighbourhood country which was mentioned I think by Mr Saryusz-Wolski and others too.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a breadth of things to do and we must continue to do all of them. So, honourable Members, I would just say to you it is important to recognise that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just, in the final minutes I have got, kill off a few of the myths which have grown up. I am not looking for a Security Council seat. I looked for proper status for the EU on the UN General Assembly, and we got that with nobody opposed to it, and honourable Members will know that took a lot of work, and I pay tribute to all of those involved, but we now have that stronger voice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is important too that we look at what we are really doing on CSDP; let us not mess around with descriptions that are not true. In Libya alone, we managed to support through our aid 55 000 people being able to get home. I did not oppose a no-fly zone in the European Council and Prime Minister Cameron will back that up; that is not at all what I said. What I said was that for it to be effective and to be done quickly, it was important that those who could act quickly should do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">On our delegations, I support trying to strengthen what we have in our delegations opening in Benghazi, and what we do in Iraq. But let us not play this off against what happens in other countries like the Bahamas. The staff in the Bahamas are development staff from the Commission working on rural programmes, on agriculture, for some of the poorest people, and we should not, in my view, see this as being an ‘either/or’ situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, we have to do as much as we can to support countries across the world. So I end as I began by saying that we do not lack ambition, we need the resources to do the job properly, we need to be able to be consistent, we need to develop and strengthen what we do, and that is what we will do, but we will do it by taking the 27 Members of the European Union on that journey with us, leading sometimes, pushing sometimes, working alongside sometimes, and your support will be invaluable to that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Europe must not fail the Palestinian people yet again. Now, following the unexpected reconciliation agreement between Fatah and Hamas, which commits to establishing a technical, non-party interim government and early elections, Europe must grab this opportunity to play a positive role in the region. It can do so by working with the interim government which is to be formed in the next few days; by supporting early elections; and, most importantly, undertaking to fully respect the outcome of elections and working with the new administration that emerges from those elections. Europe cannot, on the one hand, work with democratic movements in Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Egypt, and refuse to work with a government democratically elected by the Palestinian people. Israel’s initial response to the reconciliation, withholding Palestinian Authority (P.A.) taxes, is illegal and potentially catastrophic for peace, putting at risk the state-building efforts of Prime Minister Salem Fayyad. The EU must step in to fully cover the loss of this income while making it clear that we will recover that money from Israel by freezing all money due to Israel from the EU to the same value, until it stops this further breach of international law.</p>

      <p sl="en">In 2010, I submitted a written question to Commissioner Malmström to see what action the Commission had taken to uncover the role of non-governmental organisations in financing terrorism. The fact that the organisers of last year’s flotilla are planning to repeat their action on the anniversary of the incident and MEPs from the GUE and Greens/EFA political groups organised a hearing at the EP on 10 May put the issue yet again in the spotlight. If we Europeans consider peace, democratisation in the Middle East, the eradication of extreme poverty and the development of living conditions in Gaza as our ultimate goal, the appropriate means for the facilitation of this noble cause is not the flotilla, as VP/HR Ashton pointed out earlier today. We cannot refer to something as humanitarian action that is not necessarily what it seems. Judge Bruguière, the respected and recognised counter-terrorism expert, proved that the organiser of the flotilla, IHH, had maintained contact with al-Qaeda. The umbrella organisation of IHH, Union of Good, supports the activity of extremist radicals through selling weapons to them. I ask fellow MEPs to refrain from exploiting the Middle East crisis for their own political goals, which do not have anything to do with the peace process and from a biased attitude which very much sounds like the language and mechanism of the Communist and Soviet attitude towards Israel.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The motion for a resolution shows clearly that there are still serious shortcomings over fulfilment of the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. It does not look good to Member States when the European Parliament (EP) ‘urgently requests’ the European Council to develop a ‘European foreign policy strategy’, or when it calls on the European Council ‘to go about this task on the basis of political dialogue with the EP’. If there was a European foreign policy strategy already today, the equilibrium of the EU in that regard would be much better, for example, concerning the movements in the Arab world and the double or even triple standards applied towards the countries from this region.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The positions taken by the EU towards the increasingly turbulent developments in the Balkans represent another problem. The EU has not yet found the ‘key’ to this region and lacks a systematic approach. The result of this, among other things, is that the prestige of the EU and the attractions of EU membership go into free fall in the Western Balkan countries. The ideas of Valentin Inzko, High Representative of the international community and EU Special Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, regarding the approach towards Serbia will not resolve the situation, but will rather do the opposite.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Last week, a particularly significant event took place. After lengthy negotiations, we finally managed to convince our partners from the United Nations to grant the EU a new status in the organisation. This is a definite success, especially in view of the General Assembly’s initial resistance. However, we must not fall into the trap of triumphalism and think that from now on, the EU will present a uniform standpoint in the forum of the United Nations. The fact that we will now be represented by the President of the European Council or the High Representative does not mean that Member States will present a common standpoint on particularly controversial topics. The example of Libya shows how deep the divisions between us are even in matters which would seem obvious, such as the protection of the civilian population. So we need to say clearly that without the political will from Member States, this decision will be meaningless. This is why I cannot agree with Mrs Ashton that the world will hear one, clear voice from the EU. Instead, I am afraid that for a long period of time, we will have to deal with many voices, as the uniform views of the EU will be weakened not only by the permanent members of the Security Council, but also by the Presidency, which is searching for its niche after the Treaty of Lisbon. How does Mrs Ashton intend to establish a uniform voice for the EU at the United Nations, and how does she intend to build a good image for the EU in this organisation?</p>

      <p sl="cs">The common foreign and security policy is always a major problem in the EU. On the one hand, the large states are traditionally used to relying on their own forces, with France and Great Britain in particular still feeling they are great powers. This can be seen in their approach to solving foreign policy problems. In recent times, this has been oriented rather towards a military solution to any sort of dispute, as they neglect peaceful solutions in favour of intervention. I think there is reason to believe that today’s world is heading towards multi-polarity, and it is a peaceful foreign policy that is in accordance with international law and the UN Charter. Instead of military ventures, the latest of which is unfolding before us in Libya, what today’s world needs is to put all of its efforts into fighting poverty and illiteracy, and into solving other serious problems. In order to do this, it is absolutely essential to have arms control and disarmament, including general agreements on the dismantling of nuclear weapons. Assistance in mitigating the consequences of disasters should be an important element in EU foreign policy. These operations should not be linked to military deployments. Police deployment is possible only in extreme cases, on the basis of a UN resolution, and in order to protect workers in the social, health and public service sectors, and to train the police. The common foreign and security policy must be rigorously separated from NATO. For these reasons, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left refuses to back this report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">A week ago, the UN General Assembly authorised the EU to speak with one voice at its meetings. From now on, high-level representatives will be able to convey the Union’s message in the highest international body. This provision is a significant step forward in the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, but it is not enough. The EU needs a real strategy so that it can actually apply the powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon. Be it in the Security Council, the Human Rights Council, NATO, the WTO or the G20, the EU should no longer have to hide in the shadows. What is more, we should take the lead in establishing a global parliamentary system. High-level diplomacy is obviously needed, but it must be carried out in consultation with the people. And how better to achieve that than to enable citizens from the world over to be represented at the UN? There is the European Parliament, but there are also regional parliaments, such as the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. What we need today is a world parliament. Baroness Ashton, the European Union must be ambitious. I hope that this proposal will appear in your White Paper.</p>

      <p sl="en">First of all, I would like express my sincerest gratitude to Baroness Ashton for the EU’s full support to Estonia in trying to resolve the hostage crisis in Lebanon. The kidnapped Estonians are, however, still at the mercy of their abductors. Therefore, we would be grateful for your further involvement and assistance in the resolution of the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Coming to the future of the common foreign and security policy, I would like to call for more coherence and consistency when dealing with non-democratic regimes. We have applied sanctions on Belarus, but we have not done so with regard to the Magnitski case in Russia, although this had been pointed out by the European Parliament in the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2009 and in the European Union’s policy on the matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are still committed to the one-China policy, while Beijing has recently become more suppressive and violent both in Tibet and the Uyghur region. Instead of flirting with Beijing, we also ought to pursue a free trade agreement with Taiwan, which is a prosperous democracy. The one-China policy is outdated and morally undermining to the image of the European Union. Let us align our policies with our values.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Lisbon Treaty provided us with a major opportunity to move forward in the field of defence and security. But, as evidence indicates, this is not enough. In spite of the relatively numerous operations, there is still an evident divorce between the instruments we are equipping us with – see the battle-groups, for instance – and the improvised collection of national means we actually employ, when the EU is required to intervene. Take Libya, for instance: because of the absence of political consensus and proper military assets, a ‘coalition of the willing’ – a concept we were so adamantly opposed when others have used it before – had to be formed and NATO had to be called in to take command! Practically, Libya completely sidelined our CSDP, exactly at a time it was needed and, therefore, had the chance to demonstrate itself in practice! In consequence, my opinion is that we have to look again at our CSDP, to see what it really needs to become a functional concept, both politically and militarily, so next time we would need to appeal to it, it will not let us down like this time.</p>

The Treaty of Lisbon has made it possible for the Union’s foreign relations to develop in a way which was formerly impossible. The progress so far, however, has been quite slow. Our common European values nevertheless allow us to build a European foreign policy that relies on sustainable development and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need a clear European external agenda in order for the EU to be able purposefully to promote a global policy based on multilateralism. Crucial elements in that policy would be support for the work of the UN and a clarification of the EU’s policy with regard to the UN.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The situation in Syria is deeply concerning. We do not have complete, reliable information as the foreign press has been refused access. However, the repressive measures carried out by the Assad regime are intensifying and have already resulted, based on the figures supplied by the NGOs, in the murder of 600-700 civilians and the arrest or disappearance of another 8 000 people. Syria’s citizens have been demonstrating for nearly two months and they must not be left on their own to fight for democracy. Brutal repression is unacceptable and must be stopped. The EU must take a leading role in the quest for a speedy solution. This is why I would like to welcome the restrictive measures adopted by the Council against the Syrian regime at the start of the week. However, we need to do more, in cooperation with the Union’s partners, to urge the Syrian authorities to halt the repression. Assad is isolated. Only the Gaddafi regime is condemning at the moment ‘the international conspiracy attacking Syria’s national security’, a statement which says a great deal about the situation in Syria. Finally, I would like to stress that, in the current circumstances, Syria’s application for a seat on the UN’s Human Rights Council is unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="en">The protracted violent actions against the Coptic Church in Egypt and largely against Christians in the Middle East require an immediate response from the European Union. An essential part of the Christian-European heritage is under threat. People are persecuted in their hundreds of thousands because of their religious beliefs. The new Egyptian authorities benefited from widespread sympathy and direct EU financial and political support. But now, after churches were burned and Christians killed in a renewed wave of attacks, the time has come for the EU to make it abundantly clear to the Egyptian authorities that they are responsible for the internal security of the country and for the protection of the rights and livelihood of all Egyptian citizens. Suspicions that the Egyptian authorities turned a blind eye to or even encouraged religious violence should be dispersed by a firm undertaking that the Christian community will be safe in Egypt. The EU should ask for explanations from the Egyptian authorities and make it clear that further violence will be followed by the cessation of European financial and humanitarian assistance. This unequivocal warning should condition all present agreements and should be included in all future agreements with Middle East governments.</p>

      <p sl="pl">During the January debate on the situation in Tunisia and Egypt and the freedom of religious expression, I mentioned the tragic situation of Christians in Arab countries, particularly the Egyptian Coptic Christians, who are being persecuted. I pointed out the radicalisation of Islam, which is directing its aggression against the followers of Christ. It can be seen, today, that my misgivings were justified. Clashes in the vicinity of the Church of St. Menas are only the tip of the iceberg with regard to the tragedy of Egyptian Christians and the silence from international organisations. In this context, it would be worth recalling the attacks on the St. Bishoy monastery in March of this year, which were ignored by Parliament and Mrs Ashton, when the Egyptian army fired at a monastery full of refugees from Cairo, and the actions of the Salafist Islamic community which holds extreme views. In April, they carried out a series of attacks on Christian buildings in Beni Ahmad, Bashtil and Kamadir. As we can see, the European Union still cannot work out a cohesive reactive strategy towards human rights violations in Asia and North Africa and how to prevent them in the future. We should put more pressure on the Egyptian authorities to defend the Coptic Christians. It is essential to strengthen the section for the prevention of religious intolerance of the Subcommittee on Political Affairs of the European External Action Service, with particular regard to persecuted Christians</p>

      <p sl="it">Yet Parliament achieved two significant results. Firstly, textile products comprising non-textile parts of animal origin – fur and leather – must show this information on the labels in order to allow consumers to make informed choices.

I am therefore also pleased that we agreed on a text that merely requires the Commission to analyse the need for origin labelling. Thus, the agreement will not lead to the introduction of mandatory origin labelling. I will be unable to vote in favour of a regulation that makes it mandatory for businesses to provide this country of origin label. I know that the Council is of the same opinion.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the proposal for a regulation on which we are being called to vote undoubtedly has the merit of bringing together in a single text all the existing legislation relating to textile products. This regulation will make it possible to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework on the development and use of new fibres, as well as supporting the development of innovative products and encouraging innovation in the textile and clothing sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">I welcomed the fact that Mr Manders considered other aspects too, such as the reduced administrative burden for Member States resulting from the transposition into national law of the technical adaptations required by the addition of the names of new textile fibres to the harmonised list. While I consider that we could have gone further by introducing a specific article regulating the indication of origin of textile products, I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, this regulation is vital for the European textile industry because it guarantees a free market in compliance with rules that prevent the irregularities and illegal practices of the past. We wish to favourably highlight the institutions’ decision to welcome the proposal and to explore the problem of the traceability and origin of products in order to ensure that European consumers are correctly informed, even though the timescales established are too lengthy. Ultimately, the objective is to safeguard consumers.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would point out that last October, Parliament, by a large majority, voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation on the indication of the country of origin of certain products – including textile products – imported from third countries, and that to date, the Council has not opened negotiations or discussions with Parliament, even on an informal level. I would like to thank the Hungarian Presidency for having included the issue among its priorities, but I would also ask for the debate to be accelerated, or else we run the risk, for example, of providing safeguards for European consumers with regard to foodstuffs but not with regard to manufacturing products.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the report on the labelling of textile products which we endorsed today marks an important step towards simplifying legislation for the benefit of consumers and all the European manufacturers working in the industry. With this regulation, we are laying down new rules on labelling in the textile industry; we are focusing increasingly on innovation in the sector and on speeding up the integration of European legislation, in order to benefit from innovative products safely.</p>
      <p sl="it">The text proposes, in fact, to combine the three directives on the labelling of textile composition into a single European regulation, simplifying the existing regulatory framework and improving the transparency of procedures. Therefore, we cannot help but applaud the positive result achieved today in safeguarding European production. At the same time, however, we cannot fail to mention the indication of the country of origin issue. We hope that a further step forward can be taken soon with the approval of legislation regulating indications of origin in this sector as well.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in my opinion, this report is attempting to solve two major problems. Firstly, the aim is to promote innovation. This means that the process of including new fibre names in the standard list of names must be made more transparent and must involve less red tape. Secondly, origin labelling must be improved. Here, we can honestly say that this point has not yet been finally and satisfactorily resolved. I would like to make it very clear that this is not the fault of the rapporteur. This was simply due to the widely differing opinions held by members of the Council which the Commission could not reconcile. I hope that we will continue to work on this issue, because origin labelling is becoming increasingly important. It is one of the rights of consumers. I would like to see a discussion on this point in the near future in the European Parliament and I would like the Commission to submit a proposal.</p>

Until today, Europe was the only market in the world without legislation on this issue, which put it at a disadvantage relative to its main trading partners.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, the European Parliament has made its voice heard, by adopting a regulation capable of safeguarding the excellence of the European textile industry. Our production and manufacturing needs protecting, particularly at a time of economic crisis such as the one we are currently experiencing. Until now, we have managed to achieve recognition through research and innovation, which guaranteed the production of innovative textile fibres.</p>
      <p sl="it">Consumers will no longer run the risk of buying textile products that are potentially harmful to their health perhaps because they have been treated with chemical agents.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today, we have voted on the addition of new textiles and fibres and labelling-related matters. From the outset of this textile report, I have been of the opinion that Parliament should keep to the scope of the proposal as it was originally designated and that the extension of this scope was not compatible with the aim of simplification for putting a new fibre on the market.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have concerns about the provision of a review clause which will ask the Commission to investigate the possible introduction of a number of labelling requirements which have little added value and would place unacceptable burdens on businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. This includes the harmonisation of size labelling, social economic labelling and, most worryingly, a radio frequency identification tag which would increase costs for business and prices for the consumer.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nonetheless, from this report, I feel that some of the provisions in this regulation will make a difference, will improve the application process for business and enhance consumer protection, especially on the labelling of animal-derived products.

I will very briefly say that, when we are trying to look into the future, it is quite impressive that the negotiators, and our rapporteur in particular, have succeeded in achieving such a broad majority in favour of the report that we voted on today.

For this reason, we should take particular care to ensure that this policy is developed in line with economic, social and cultural interests.

It is actually an indispensable part of the democratic process. Without lobbyism, politicians’ knowledge, facts and opinions with regard to all aspects of society would be far too limited. Therefore, all of us in this House and the press have a responsibility to ensure that, behind what we do, there is a critical, but also true, picture of what the issue is all about.</p>
      <p sl="da">Secondly, I would like to say that, as we know, the best is the greatest enemy of the good. The fully legitimate demand for transparency, as reflected in the debate and the vote today, must, of necessity, be balanced so that we do not, with the best of intentions, destroy a well-functioning system. The demand for total transparency, mandatory individual registration of everything under the sun, an ethical control committee and so on, are, in the best case, expressions of something naive and, in the worst case, part of a populist political agenda that will do more harm than good. In practice, this is about trust. If deemed necessary, control must be in line with what is feasible in practice in respect of the work process. I would also like to contest the vote on paragraph 9.

It is absolutely right that we should have as much transparency as possible. However, to demand that we all publish the names of everyone we hold meetings with is, of course, absolutely absurd. It is absolutely absurd because when is a meeting a meeting? This has to be defined. Does it include when we meet in the corridor or on the bus or somewhere else? Does it include telephone meetings and Internet meetings? When is it classed as a meeting? What about many of those people we are having meetings with today from rebel movements in North Africa? Are they to see their names in the newspapers? Surely not? In this regard, it should be logical for it always to be possible to guarantee that people can come to us in confidence.

      <p sl="it">Great progress has been made in the last few years. One need only think of the register of interest representatives adopted by the European Parliament in 1996, or of the Commission’s 2006 proposal to the European Parliament for a ‘one-stop shop’ register for lobbyists. The approval of the Stubb-Friedrich report by this House led to the creation of a joint working group. We can safely say that the results achieved by that group with regard to the objectives set by Parliament are more than satisfactory.</p>

You had a perfect example of that with the new restrictions and bans on herbal and alternative medicines which came in a couple of weeks ago. Such a ban would never have passed a national parliament, all of them being subjected as they were to real anger from their constituents. However, the big pharmaceutical corporations understood that they could push through in this system what they could never get through the national legislatures, precisely because this system is much more invulnerable to public opinion.

It is our tragedy to live at a time where, just as Asia has discovered the secrets of decentralisation, diffusion of power, enterprise and personal responsibility, we in this part of the world are going in the opposite direction, copying the old Asian empires – the Mings, the Moguls and the Ottomans – in regulating, uniformising, standardising and taxing.</p>

      <p sl="fi">It is hypocritical to claim that Europe is a pioneer in the area of social responsibility. In offering free trade benefits, the EU must insist that the problems are addressed, and must oversee the process.

I believe that free trade is the way forward, and it is also free trade that should show us the way forward with regard to India. The reason it has been so long coming, of course, is that there are problems with various details – major details we could say – namely, the question of generic medicines, which the previous speaker also mentioned. I would call on both parties in this matter, in other words, both the EU and India, to try to find a solution to this problem that both respects copyright, because that is absolutely essential, and, at the same time, ensures that practical means are provided to enable the many poor people in India to obtain cheap medicines.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As far as I am concerned, I do not think we should be dogmatic on this matter. Systematic free trade is not necessarily beneficial. It can be a good thing when there is a level playing field. That is pretty much the case in many areas with Japan, but I recognise Japan’s right, for instance, to protect its rice market, to protects its rice farmers, to pay its farmers higher prices than those on world markets and to say no to massive imports which would obliterate its peasant farmer population, in the same way that I recognise our economies’ rights to protect certain sectors of their activity.</p>

We in the Danish Liberal Party are therefore very pleased that today’s vote has ensured that the forests will receive more consistent and long-term protection while, at the same time, we have retained our ambitions with regard to ensuring the global competitiveness of European forest-based industries. However, we were a little surprised that the proposal for a 30-year ban on building on land where there has been a forest fire was successfully voted through.

This makes it all the more important for us to take into consideration the economic aspects of our forests.

Forests are necessary for conversion to a green economy, for example, through production of biofuels from forestry by-products.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Therefore, forestry must not be subjected to unnecessary, complicated regulations that make its products less competitive compared with fossil fuels. For example, it is very strange to propose binding sustainability criteria for a renewable resource like forests, but to not have similar criteria for fossil fuels like coal.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I will continue to oppose a European common forestry policy in future, too. I would instead like to put resources into research, education, information and innovation with regard to how to prevent the effects that climate change will have on our forests. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted against the report on the EU’s common foreign and security policy. I am in complete disagreement with the views and ideas it expresses about Europe’s current and future role in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">In a nutshell, this report stands for a militarised and imperialist Europe. It defends an aggressive raw materials strategy and asks for, and I quote, ‘a less rigid distinction between military and civilian crisis management operations’. This is disguised language for a further militarisation of foreign policy. It welcomes the trade agreement with Colombia, despite the fact that hundreds of trade unionists have been killed in recent years, guilty simply of being trade unionists.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report hypocritically names social unrest as one element of a new generation of security challenges and risks. What hypocrisy! The capitalist system has created poverty and misery across the world and is incapable of dealing with the consequences. It is the right of people to defend their legitimate interests and struggle for a better future without any interference from the mighty political, economic and military powers.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, first of all, I would like to say – and I hope this will not be deducted from my speaking time – that, on the subject of hypocrisy, there are very few of us who believe in certain things. We each take the floor to explain our vote after we have cast it. There are around five or six of us, and we listen to each other and are sometimes filmed for television. However, the whole thing is rather depressing.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, I would like to make a suggestion, and I will certainly do so at the next meeting of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). I suggest that from now on, the explanations of vote should precede the vote itself, so that perhaps by talking and listening to each another, we may even convince each other about which way to vote, rather than playing a sort of team game that has all been decided beforehand.</p>
      <p sl="it">Having said this, I stated in my explanation of vote that I voted in favour. I continue to believe in Europe, just as I continue to believe in the effectiveness of the presence of a High Commissioner. However, I continue to believe that the Member States believe in it much less than we ourselves do. Therefore perhaps it should be pointed out – as was reiterated to Baroness Ashton this morning and on other occasions, too – that, unless Europe stops being partly economic and becomes more political instead, our role probably cannot be carried out as well as it could be, either.</p>

That is why I welcome any action which contributes to the promotion of peace, stability and the rule of law in countries and regions in crisis. I support commitment to the transatlantic partnership as one of the main pillars of the EU’s foreign policy, aiming to create a free market with the United States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Eastern European politics are especially important from Poland’s point of view. The report acknowledges that there should be political and economic integration with the EU’s neighbours and also calls for a cohesive approach in negotiations on a new agreement with Russia, paying attention to the rule of law and protection of human rights there.

However, I would like to point out that the report not only evaluates the policy, but focuses principally on the future, on development. In my view, this requires not only the various justified and accurate assessments and clever words, of which there are many in the report; the common security and defence policy needs to be looked at seriously and from a different angle.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think that three things are needed. Firstly, the EU should define its common strategic interests, for example, concerning energy security and Neighbourhood Policy. Secondly, the EU should increase its own capability regarding the planning and coordination of civil and military operations and crisis management.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the increasingly significant interdependency of international organisations in the face of economic, environmental and energy problems requires constant adjustments to the foreign relations of individual states. Security issues form an element of policy requiring particular care by every country, and they need constant readjustment in a changing world. The report’s main theme is a call to protect the strategic autonomy of the EU in the field of security and defence. However, it does not take the EU’s lack of military experience into account, but, at the same time, calls for further efforts to expand the EU’s operational options. For countries such as Poland, the basis of its defence policy remains the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Tightening the strategic partnership between the EU and NATO and the proposal to strengthen mutual support for action could considerably slow down the procedures involved in taking operational decisions. In my view, the report seems too radical, and this is why I voted to reject it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the most significant document on the EU security strategy was delivered by Xavier Solana. It is entitled ‘A secure Europe in a better world’ and was adopted by the European Council on 12 December 2003.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since then, little progress has been made in this field. The Union still lacks an effective strategy for its foreign security and, on most relevant issues, still follows the lead of the United States. This report tries to introduce some positive changes on tactical topics like crisis management, the fragmentation of the EU defence technological industrial base, and the ineffectiveness of the 24 EU security and defence missions around the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of it, and I hope this Parliament will continue to make a contribution towards the goal of enhancing EU strategic autonomy in security affairs.

      <p sl="sk">However, so-called reproductive rights, which is just another name for the right to abortion, are a priority component of the European human rights agenda.

      <p sl="pt">This report relates to the proposal for a directive of Parliament and of the Council on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles, in a codified text. Simplifying the lives of Europeans is one of the EU’s concerns. Many legislative changes have been undertaken by the Commission and Parliament in order to achieve this objective. One of the areas that make the lives of the EU public difficult is the constant amendments to legislation. These sometimes arise due to a need to update them, but this hinders and diminishes the quality of life of the individual. In 1987, the Commission recommended that all acts that had up to 10 amendments be codified, so that Community legislation would be easier to understand. To address this issue, since 1994, there has been an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on an accelerated working method for the adoption of codified acts. I am pleased, therefore, that we can finally adopt a directive codifying Council Directive 70/157/EEC of 6 February 1970, which approximates the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles.</p>

Those technical prescriptions concern the approximation of the laws of the Member States to enable the EC type-approval procedure provided for in Directive 2007/46/EC to be applied in respect of each type of vehicle.

      <p sl="pt">The importance of the transport sector to the European economy is reflected in the employment that it directly provides for more than 10 million people and in the 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) that it represents. Its development is vital for the EU’s economic growth, and in order to bridge physical and psychological gaps. Moreover, as outlined in the White Paper entitled ‘Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area’, it is essential that the goal of a 60% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 be met.</p>

Simplifying the lives of Europeans is one of the EU’s concerns. One of the areas that make the lives of the EU public difficult is the constant amendments to legislation.

      <p sl="en">The Treaty aims to maintain an economic union with healthy competition and properties that are similar to those on the domestic market. As regards manufactured tobacco, the achievement of this aim presupposes that the application in the Member States of taxes affecting the consumption of products in this sector does not distort conditions of competition and does not impede their free movement within the European Union. As far as excise duties are concerned, the harmonisation of structures must, in particular, result in competition in the different categories of manufactured tobacco belonging to the same group not being distorted by the effects of charging the tax and, consequently, in the opening of the Member States’ national markets. The imperative needs of competition imply a system of freely formed prices for all groups of manufactured tobacco and implementation of this policy needs to guarantee a high level of human health.</p>

We, Members of the European Parliament, today adopted a joint declaration, which aims to protect European consumers from false or misleading claims on the origin of the products. I strongly believe that the resolution and declaration will give a major impetus towards the creation of a mechanism of providing accurate information to consumers, particularly with regard to the exact origin of the products purchased.

Extending compulsory labelling should not impose a disproportionate burden on enterprises without bringing real added-value for consumers, who may even be confused by an excess of information on the label of textile products. I believe that it would be useful for the Commission to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council regarding possible new labelling requirements to be introduced at Union level.

The aim of the proposal is to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products with a view to encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres. By transforming the three existing directives into a single regulation, the proposal facilitates the process to adapt legislation to technical progress whilst allowing fibre users to benefit more readily from innovative products on the market.</p>
      <p sl="it">I welcome this proposal, and I consider it particularly significant that the new regulation contains a specific reference to ‘Made in’ labelling. It is crucial, in fact, to continue along this path in order to furnish the European Union with the tools to compete with and face its main trade partners, such as the United States, Canada, China and Japan, on the globalised market.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore I wish to emphasise here what is, in my view, the most important aspect of the agreement reached with the Council, namely, the commitment by the European Commission to present, by 30 September 2013, after it has carried out a suitable impact assessment, a report accompanied by legislative proposals regarding indication of origin labelling, traceability and the use of new technologies.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because it aims to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products and thus encourage the development and uptake of new fibres and better consumer protection. As the final text is still being negotiated with the Council, the European Parliament’s report proposes to identify issues such as the origin marking of textile products imported to the EU, according to which it would be compulsory for the label to indicate not only the manufacturer of the end product, but the country of origin of the imported textile products used to manufacture it, as is already done in Canada, the US, China and Japan. In general, the report proposes that labels should show as much information as possible about the composition of the product and that we should call on the Commission to investigate whether imported products are damaging to human health due to their composition, in order to improve consumer protection. However, at the same time, the report proposes rejecting any unnecessary administrative burden for goods manufacturers. For example, it proposes replacing markings on labels with language-independent symbols to avoid translation of fibre names into several EU languages. It is also proposed that self-employed tailors should be exempt from this future regulation.</p>

Furthermore, the document we approved today also encourages the introduction of origin marking, which would facilitate consumer choice and contribute to reducing fraudulent or misleading claims of origin. In this regard, I support the amendment laying down the requirement for manufacturers to indicate the presence of non-textile parts of animal origin on the labelling.

Origin marking would facilitate consumer choice and contribute to reducing fraudulent, inaccurate or misleading claims of origin. This amendment introduces a requirement to indicate the presence of non-textile parts of animal origin in textile products. It should be highlighted that fur is often used as trimming in relatively inexpensive garments, which are often imported from Asia.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to eliminate potential obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market caused by diverging provisions or practices by Member States, and in order to keep pace with the development of electronic commerce and future challenges in the market for textile products, it is necessary to examine the harmonisation and standardisation of other aspects of textile labelling with a view to facilitating the free movement of textile products in the internal market and achieving a uniform and high level of consumer protection throughout the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The resolution on textile fibre names and related labelling and marking of textile products which has been adopted by the European Parliament is particularly important for the textile sector in the European Union. It will enable the more rapid introduction to the market of new fibres which will help innovative textile firms in particular in the practical application of their research and development. The resolution was the subject of a long debate between the European Parliament and the Council. Parliament called for new elements to extend the regulation, in particular: indication of the country of origin, indication of fibres of animal origin, and more rigorous requirements concerning the use of harmful substances in the production of textiles. Parliament managed to convince the Council that it was essential to clearly label fibres of animal origin.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This provision is very useful, in particular, for those consumers who have an allergy to leather goods, and to consumers who, for ideological reasons, do not want to buy textiles containing elements of animal origin.

      <p sl="fi">I am pleased that, at last, we in Parliament have reached a decision on an act relating to textile labelling involving some very substantial proposals for improvements, which the Council is also prepared to endorse and implement. Working on the regulation in committee sometimes involved some very ambitious notions, which, luckily, we abandoned. It is an obvious improvement that products must henceforth be clearly marked if they contain matter of animal origin, for reasons of public health, since fur, for example, is a health risk for many people who suffer from allergies. Although some of the manufacturers of products opposed this initiative, referring to existing laws on the requirements for labelling parts of animal origin, an improvement has now been made, and it is a very real indication of the EU’s consumer oriented thinking. However, the compulsory marking of the origin of products from third countries would have been ineffective and expensive in itself to accomplish. It is difficult to make an impromptu estimate of the added value to the consumer that such a requirement might bring, especially as, in the global world, products are rarely manufactured or originate in just one country.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For that reason, it is important that the Commission should now investigate the matter and that the practical aspects of going ahead should be weighed carefully. In the same connection, it is natural that the reform and harmonisation of product labelling should be assessed overall, as has now been agreed.</p>

The original Commission proposal envisaged a simplification of formalities in order to make it easier to introduce new textile fibres.

We do not support Parliament’s position in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Consumers benefit where labels contain information about materials that pose a health hazard or that cause allergic reactions. Stating the country of origin on the label is pointless European nitpicking.

Even if the so-called country of origin is specified, other parts of the production process can take place elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="nl">All the ‘made in x’ label does is create a false sense of clarity for the consumer, while in reality bringing about extra costs and bureaucracy.

European consumers have the right to know what they are buying. The use of any products of animal origin must be clearly shown on the label of the textile product. The new textile labelling rules should help stop consumers from unwittingly buying textile products made from real fur or leather.

These concern the preferential tariff quotas for baby beef, sugar and sugar products, certain wines, as well as for certain fishery products. The termination of the trade preferences would take from the beneficiaries an objective economic advantage in their trade with the EU.

These ‘exceptional trade measures’ with the partners in the Western Balkans, under the EU Stabilisation and Association process, are indeed preferential tariff measures which guarantee easier access to the EU market for the partner countries’ exports. They need to be notified to the World Trade Organisation. The programme ran out at the end of 2010, and what we have now is simply the extension to it. It has been blocked because of the delayed comitology decision. Early in January 2011, the International Trade Committee made a proposal to the Council to ensure that the procedure was speeded up, but received no answer. Thus, Parliament had to await the adoption of the Szájer report on comitology in March in order to proceed further. An informal trialogue resolved the issue to permit adoption at first reading. The delay has created hardship in some receiving countries, and particularly in Kosovo, and Parliament has been wrongly blamed for this.</p>

Neither the US nor China is larger, contrary to what is usually stated in discussions on what is and what will be the number one global economy. The difference is that the US and China have the bigger markets, as they offer better preconditions for competition, competitiveness, new services, products and innovations. The need for a single Internal Market is critical if Europe is to become a leading player in the global economy, with a focus on the service sector and the knowledge economy, but, at the same time, the Digital Agenda and the digital economy can serve as a spearhead for realising the Internal Market for all parts of our economy.

This is connected with the idea that securing a wireless broadband connection is essential in order for all citizens to have access to new and innovative services. I fully agree with the deadline proposed by the Commission as regards making the 800 MHz band available for electronic communications services by 1 January 2013. Any exemptions or exceptions should be granted only for technical reasons, but specific public safety and defence needs must be taken into account. The other bands should be released by 1 January 2012, as stipulated in the Commission proposal. In my opinion, we should push for the allocation of more frequencies to mobile services, with a minimum target of 1 200 MHz.

      <p sl="de">The modern information society and the scarcity of frequency bands make strategic planning and harmonisation of the use of the spectrum essential. Of course, this relates to mobile and wireless broadband communications, radio and television broadcasting and also radio communications at concerts or in theatres. In addition to the issue of the frequencies, this concerns cultural diversity and also involves taking into consideration which technical options are and are not available and affordable. Affordability is a concern, for example, for cultural organisations without a great deal of money which do not always have the funding to buy new equipment. The goals of introducing complete broadband coverage of the EU by 2013 and universal high-speed Internet access by 2020 are praiseworthy, but perhaps not entirely realistic.

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this document because Europe needs to set free more spectrum for wireless broadband. This can and must be done with respect for present broadcasting, ensuring the same opportunities for broadcasters as they have today, and compensating for eventual migration costs where necessary. Broadcasting and culture must be a natural part of the development of wireless services. Today, Europe is lagging behind, while the US and China are freeing up large parts of the spectrum in order to allow for the rapid development of new services and high speed mobile Internet. We must aim to do what is best for Europe: free up the spectrum for new services and increased mobile traffic, open up new opportunities for culture and content, broadcasters and public services in the framework of broadband and, at the same time, secure the same opportunities for broadcasters as they enjoy today. Wireless broadband is essential for ensuring that new and innovative services are available to all citizens. It seems obvious that this objective cannot be achieved through the use of optical fibre, the installation of which requires considerable investment, but through the use of a mix of wireless technologies available to extend the coverage of broadband (terrestrial radio, cable, fibre or satellite systems) to cover the whole territory of the Community, rural and peripheral areas included, enabling the market to choose the most efficient technology from the point of view of cost for operators and citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I was responsible for the opinion on the radio spectrum policy programme in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and I am very pleased with the text that has now been voted on. I have been strongly advocating a forward looking and ambitious spectrum policy that would promote new innovations and global competitiveness. This is essential while we are searching for new channels for economic growth in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Wireless Internet services, and the mobile sector in particular, desperately need new spectrum, because in recent years, there has been a dramatic growth in the sale and use of equipment using a wireless network for smart phones and other such devices. The lack of spectrum must not be allowed to hinder innovation while we are developing new technology and services. Radio spectrum is a scarce natural resource and a public good, of which we also have to try to make far more effective use. The main aims of the radio spectrum policy programme are broadband access for the entire EU by 2013 and fast Internet connections by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In addition to considerations about the ‘digital dividend’ to be shared among Internet services (that is to say, the 800 MHz band), we have to look to the future and survey the opportunities afforded by the next potential radio bands, such as the 700 MHz band. The best capacity and the fastest speed would offer the best basis for competition and innovation. The growing need in Asia and the United States of America has already been taken into account. It is therefore especially important that we in the EU understand the importance of setting sufficiently ambitious targets in order to remain competitive in this sector.</p>

      <p sl="fr">One of the strategy’s major lines of action aims to guarantee Internet access throughout Europe by 2013 and high-speed broadband coverage of at least 30 Mbps by 2020. Many relatively isolated rural and island areas depend on wireless connections from mobile Internet for access to high-speed broadband. If they are to enjoy uninterrupted connection, they must have radio frequencies dedicated entirely to them. Frequency allocation comes under national jurisdiction but the regulations governing the sharing of the spectrum between users and operators is under the control of the European Union. Universal access to high-speed access is largely dependent on this sharing of frequencies. I voted for the report on radio spectrum policy as it lays the foundations for universal coverage for mobile Internet. On 1 January 2013, the 800 MHz frequency will be used for mobile Internet, and will provide wireless users with high quality access and thus reduce the digital divide. This project goes even further still, by providing a new frequency band in the 1.5 to 2.3 GHz range by 2015.</p>

To date, more than 1 700 organisations have been accredited as interest groups in the European Parliament, and 3 900 in the Commission.

It has always been thus and will continue to be so in the future. Lobbies play a useful and essential role in legislative work, providing that there is transparency. In order to achieve this, the report adopted establishes new rules and creates a ‘transparency register’ which is common to both the Commission and Parliament. Citizens will find a comprehensive compilation of information about the different contact people in the EU institutions. This ‘one-stop shop’ system will make it easier to register representatives of special interests, whether from commercial or non-commercial organisations. Parliament also particularly wants all meetings between MEPs and interest groups on a particular issue to be mentioned at the end of the reports. I regret that registration is not mandatory, but as the saying goes: ‘Chi va piano va sano’.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Transparency is a right for citizens, and it helps to maintain the credibility of the European institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council. This report, which has been drawn up by Mr Casini, is on the need to amend Parliament’s Rules of Procedure following the establishment of a common transparency register between Parliament and the Commission. Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is a colegislator in almost all areas. Thus, in conjunction with the Commission, it has decided to establish a common register to list and monitor the individuals and organisations that have any kind of influence over the preparation and/or implementation of EU policy. Indeed, transparency is vital to the functioning of the European institutions and it has often been seen as lacking. The European public demands a high level of transparency from its representatives, not only in theory, but in practice, above all. The EU must set an example in terms of the transparency of its institutions, so I welcome the amendments proposed by the rapporteur to modify Parliament’s Rules of Procedure in line with the decision made by the Conference of Presidents at its 18 November 2010 meeting.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The amendment being proposed to Parliament’s Rules of Procedure is aimed at establishing and maintaining a common register for the registration and monitoring of organisations and individuals who participate in any way in the drafting and implementation of EU policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The existing system, on which the proposal is based, was created and launched by Parliament in 1996. At the time, it was the first EU institution to do this, with the Commission subsequently adopting one with similar objectives in 2008. It will be modified in a process that cannot be dissociated from recent problems involving alleged lobbying, which have affected Parliament. The arguments put forward this time are, however, different, focusing on the new powers of Parliament following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The transparency of the institutions, their functioning and the decisions made by their representatives should be an intrinsic part of democracy. Measures helping to increase this transparency are therefore welcome and necessary. It is not, however, clear that this will be the result of all the changes proposed here.

Following the European Parliament elections, a new working group was formed between the Parliament and the Commission which was able to adopt in November 2010 a draft agreement on the establishment of a transparency register. According to the new draft, registration is not obligatory, but currently, only the representatives of registered interest groups are allowed access to the premises of the European Parliament. The common register ensures the widest participation of all categories of operators and makes it easier for non-commercial organisations to carry out their work.

To date, more than 1 700 organisations have been accredited as interest groups in the European Parliament, and 3 900 in the Commission. If you want to be able to make valid comments on a subject of a technical nature, you normally seek information from those people who are most knowledgeable about these issues. It has always been thus and will continue to be so in the future. Lobbies play a useful and essential role in legislative work, providing that there is transparency. In order to achieve this, the report adopted establishes new rules and creates a ‘transparency register’ which is common to both the Commission and Parliament. Citizens will find a comprehensive compilation of information about the different contact people in the EU institutions. This ‘one-stop shop’ system will make it easier to register representatives of special interests, whether from commercial or non-commercial organisations. Parliament also particularly wants all meetings between MEPs and interest groups on a particular issue to be mentioned at the end of the reports. I regret that registration is not mandatory, but as the saying goes: ‘Chi va piano va sano’.</p>

In a resolution adopted in the plenary of 8 May 2008, Parliament welcomed the proposal and called for an interinstitutional agreement on the establishment of a common register between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.

      <p sl="pt">Transparency is the basis of democracy. The public has a right to it and it helps maintain the credibility of the European institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council. This report, drafted by Mr Casini, concerns the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Commission on a common transparency register. I would like to highlight that Parliament was the first institution to analyse the phenomenon of pressure groups, having launched the register for lobbyists in 1996. In 2006, the Commission proposed the creation of a ‘one-stop shop’ register for lobbyists in the Commission and the European Parliament, through the ‘European Transparency Initiative’. Indeed, transparency is essential to the functioning of the European institutions, which are often accused of a lack thereof. The European public demands a high level of transparency from its representatives, not only in theory, but most importantly in practice. As such, I welcome the adoption of the draft agreement on the creation of a ‘transparency register’, and I am certain that it will constitute a significant step forward in the European institutions’ transparency and will contribute to consolidating the European project among the public.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It is a well-known fact that there are more than 15 000 lobbyists active in Brussels trying to influence the legislative texts that are adopted there, and that they intervene at all stages of the legislative process. Despite the fact that this activity is viewed in very negative terms in France, it is not entirely illegitimate for interest groups, whether commercial, social, trade unions, etc. to make their points of view and expertise known, especially to the less knowledgeable civil servants and elected representatives. It therefore makes sense for these lobbies and their representatives to be listed in a register, and that their principal sources of funding should also be mentioned in this register, particularly if they come from the European budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Registration should be mandatory not only for these organisations, but also for all groups outside Parliament, including those which are meant to fulfil a role provided for by the Treaties (trade unions, churches, philosophical organisations, local authorities, etc.), including groups composed, in part or in whole, of Members of Parliament, such as the European Friends of Israel, because in that instance, they are acting as interest groups and not as parliamentarians.

      <p sl="fr">Following recent events which have highlighted the potential abuses of lobbying, it has appeared all the more necessary to increase transparency regarding the work of interest groups at the European institutions. The merging of the lists of lobbyists registered at the Parliament and the Commission represents a first step towards compiling an exhaustive register of the lobbies active in Brussels and, subsequently, towards greater citizen access to democratic checks and balances in the decision-making process. I have, however, fought to prevent the offices representing local authorities at the European institutions from being affected by this measure. Indeed, I consider these structures to be the direct product of democratically-elected bodies (town, departmental, regional councils, etc.). They represent the general interest, and should therefore be distinguished from lobbyists who defend individual interests. Furthermore, I hope that this register will develop to become mandatory one day, and include all lobbyists who are active at the European institutions. The notion of transparency is crucial to European Union policy and it must be extended to cover all interest groups that participate in its operation.</p>

This agreement was awaiting validation and was put to the vote in the European legislative assembly.

      <p sl="pl">Parliament has kept a register of interest groups since 1996 and should be an example for other institutions in this regard.

The decision taken in the European Parliament will combine the registers of lobbyists and interest groups currently kept separately by the two abovementioned institutions. The process will lead to greater transparency and will, above all, simplify access to information, which will be kept in one place. Creating a common register is useful for lobbyists too, as they only need to register once. The decision also excludes social partners, churches, political parties and local and regional governments from the transparency register. In addition, interest groups will be recorded in the explanatory memorandum to the report or recommendation if they have obtained a meeting with a Member about a legislative dossier.

We also called for information to be provided on the particular issues that the lobbyists were concerned with. The register should contain financial information, including the expenditure for their lobbying activities and who finances these activities. A code of conduct for lobbying activities is necessary. Lobbyists who behave unethically must be publicly exposed and it must be possible for them to be barred. We must have double counting of gifts, travel and lunches for officials and politicians; in other words, both the giver and the recipient must declare the gifts. Officials within the EU must not be able to go directly into a lobbyist job with links to their previous work for a period of two years.

No regulation should therefore restrict one of the basic rights of citizens. However, the reasons for which an elected representative decides to prefer one interest ahead of another must be based on his convictions, and not on personal gain. The transparency of an MEP’s work in contact with people who are promoting their own interests is the instrument that will perhaps best prevent corruption in the making of laws.

We therefore successfully prevented the European Parliament adopting a position geared too much towards mandatory regulations on corporate governance. It is of paramount importance that our group promotes a balanced approach to resolving the global financial crisis. This is why we must avoid introducing barriers in financial institutions. The final report attaches greater importance and gives more power to the role of the European Supervisory Authorities. The most important compromise involves putting the ‘comply or explain’ principle and the mandatory regulations on an equal footing. I think that regulations should be introduced only when the codes of good practice fail. The approach based on the ‘comply or explain’ principle is proportionate and can be applied to a large number of financial institutions. At the same time, however, this must be supplemented by regular external evaluation and appropriate regulatory supervision.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted for this report because it represents Parliament’s contribution to the discussions on means of ensuring more effective governance in financial institutions in Europe. This discussion is particularly important for finding ways of avoiding a repeat of the financial and, ultimately, economic crisis that hit the whole world in 2008. The collapse of a series of financial institutions cost and is still costing taxpayers dear. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the cause of the problems that arose. In response to the Green Paper on improving the governance of financial institutions published by the Commission, the European Parliament’s report devotes significant attention to the need to regulate more strictly the procedures for appointing managers, to laying down the competences of board members and aptitude test criteria, and to ways of guaranteeing their independence. The report calls for the establishment of mandatory risk committees at board level, for financial institutions to be required to disclose recovery planning and supervisory reports, for an annual report to be drafted on the adequacy and effectiveness of their internal control systems, and for a similar assessment to be included in the annual report drawn up by external auditors.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The global financial crisis triggered by the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers bank in 2008 and ‘subprime credit’ – the inappropriate securitisation of mortgage debt – sparked very serious doubts concerning the strength of financial institutions. This forced the governments of both the Member States and the United States to inject public funds amounting to roughly 25% of gross domestic product (GDP) into the financial sector. This situation led the Commission, through its Communication of 4 March 2009, to introduce a genuine programme of reforms of the financial markets’ regulatory frameworks and supervisory regimes. Bearing in mind the economic and financial crisis we are currently experiencing, it is never too much to redouble one’s efforts with regard to the financial sector, beginning with corporate governance which, most of the time, does not take customers into account, whether they are savers, depositors, etc. I therefore welcome the Commission’s Green Paper, and welcome its proposals, which can and should accompany and complement the regulations adopted to strengthen the financial system in the context of the new European supervisory system. I am therefore voting in favour of the report on corporate governance in financial institutions, and I hope that this will contribute decisively to their strength.</p>

      <p sl="pt">However, having made these statements, the report does not draw out all the consequences of the facts presented, simply making a few inconsequential observations. According to the rapporteur, everything, or almost everything, boils down to tired arguments about creating an effective and adequate governance system in terms of risk management, enforcement of rules, ethics in the behaviour of some of those involved in the financial markets and institutions, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are aware of the contribution that some of these guidelines may make towards appreciably and temporarily improving the workings of the financial system. Nonetheless, it is obvious that they cannot alter the system’s most essential aspect: its unsustainability, predatory nature and emphasis on speculation, with the principal aim of increasing profits.</p>

It even claims that some financial institutions and authorities did not understand the nature, amplitude and complexity of the risks they incurred.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the report does not then make the correct inferences, limiting itself to questions of ethics in the behaviour of some people involved in the financial institutions and markets, as well as to creating a governance system which is effective and adequate in terms of risk management, compliance with regulations, and so on.</p>

To use the word crusade is perhaps to overstate the case. It might be better to say that some pious hopes are expressed that finally, the interests of customers and workers should be taken into account. There is some pitiful bleating about social, cultural and ‘gender’ diversity on boards of directors (quotas for the Roma, no doubt?). There are some proposals, which have already largely been adopted at European level, on the indecent remunerations in the sector, where we could do considerably better. There are some risk controls here and there. In short, the point that escapes you is the fact that companies are merely playing by the rules that you set.</p>

Various EU governments have used taxpayers’ money to bail out some banks that had managed their affairs in an irresponsible way. Were it not for the support of taxpayers, such banks would have collapsed with disastrous effect on different sectors of the economy in various Member States. Now that the worst phase of this financial crisis is over, banks are still not acting, or conducting their business, in the best interest of consumers. Instances of mis-selling of financial services products, and lack of sufficient support by banks for personal customers and small businesses that find themselves facing temporary liquidity problems, show that more tangible action should be taken by regulators to ensure that operators in the financial services industry support their clients and generally offer better protection to consumers.

Effective risk governance is one of the most important factors for preventing future crises. Therefore, an effective governance system needs to be established in all financial institutions, with adequate risk management, compliance, internal audit functions (and, in the case of insurers, actuarial functions), strategies, policies, processes and procedures.

Labour Euro MPs backed this report which, thanks to amendments adopted at the committee stage, calls for Commission action to raise financial firms’ corporate governance standards. These demands include stronger oversight of risks that a firm takes on, high standards of independence and diversity for members of firms’ boards, including better gender balance and, crucially, transparency around pay, so shareholders and the public can hold banks to account.

Far too little was done during the process of rescuing the banks to respond to this predictable development. At the same time, many small and medium-sized businesses, which the EU always praises on paper as being the engine of the economy, were dealt a fatal blow, because, on the basis of the Basel agreements, the banks preferred to hold onto their money, rather than lending it to companies.

The report does not accept that the financial crisis of 2007-2008 was systemic in nature: in other words, that it stemmed from the way the financial system is organised. This would mean acknowledging that the way the system is organised strongly influences the decisions of the financial companies’ directors, whatever the levels of transparency required of them. For example, the report fails to recognise that the commercial banks’ ability to make money from speculative financial investments was a very important factor in the crisis. The report does not touch on this organisational issue, and no amount of risk boards or competence criteria for directors can avoid the harmful consequences of speculating on families’ savings for profit.

India is an important EU trading partner: in 2000, India was the European Union’s 17th most important trading partner, and by 2010 its eighth. Furthermore, India is the largest beneficiary in the generalised system of preferences (GSP), and European Union imports from India by means of preferential tariffs or a zero rate of duty were valued at EUR 19.9 billion and constituted 83% of all EU imports from India. Both parties expect to reap significant benefits from the removal of tariffs, and the liberalisation of trade in services and company start-ups, but I share the disappointment expressed in the resolution as regards the slow rate of progress of negotiations on the free trade agreement (FTA). Both parties must make every effort to ensure that a comprehensive, ambitious and coordinated FTA has been concluded by 2011, because this agreement would be the basis for establishing opportunities to increase EU and Indian trade and investment, and develop business, and the FTA would increase overall exports and imports for both the European Union and India.

It has become unsustainable for many fishing boats, and especially for small-scale fleets, to see their outgoings constantly increasing because of the rise in oil prices, to the extent that they often make no profit from any of the fishing seasons. By calling for a rise in de minimis aid from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 for the next three years, we want to send out a strong signal to the sector, which, in recent years, particularly because of the entry into force of the common fisheries policy and new restrictive measures, has seen some small- and medium-scale modes of fishing cut back, if not killed off completely. It should also be noted that measures have already been adopted in other sectors, such as agriculture, to help them cope with this price rise. Therefore, this aid – which we should remember is granted at national, not European, level, and is therefore dependent on each individual Member State’s economic resources – could be seen by many people as causing an imbalance in competition, but in reality, it would provide a little relief to a sector that is increasingly on its knees.</p>

The Commission must respond as soon as possible to the request submitted by Parliament to define clearly the period of investment so that the provisions on investment protection do not undermine the parties’ ability to issue compulsory licences. Furthermore, the binding state-to-state dispute settlement mechanism only serves to empower foreign investors to initiate legal proceedings at an international level against the governments of the EU and India, while domestic investors only have recourse to national courts.

We also deplore the fact that the right-wing in Parliament rejected the amendment designed to ensure equal treatment of European and Indian workers. This is not only harmful to Indian workers; it is also very dangerous for European workers. We must not accept the liberalisation of services and social dumping aimed at bringing down European wages. Moreover, the European Union must not forget its founding principles. The Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that trade policy must contribute to sustainable development, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights.</p>

Trade relations between the EU and India are significant, since the EU is India’s principal trade partner and its biggest foreign investor. For its part, the EU is the principal recipient of Indian foreign investment and, as such, it must continue to prioritise a multilateral trade system which favours developing countries. Indeed, India is the largest beneficiary of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). If we take into account the importance of strategic relations between the EU and India, as well as the safeguarding of matters relating to agriculture, respect for human rights and the issue of child labour in particular, environmental preservation and compliance with the International Labour Organisation’s recommendations on social and copyright issues, all the conditions for voting in favour of this motion for a resolution are in place.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This free trade agreement (FTA) is the widest-ranging negotiated by the EU to date. Beyond its specific content, it also provokes a wider discussion on free trade, its role, its objectives and its consequences.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Free trade is one of the pillars of neoliberalism which emerged in the 1970s under the so-called Washington Consensus, as one of the key elements of the capitalist system’s response to the structural crisis that was making itself known at that time, just like today. It represented a way for world powers with imperialist ambitions to expand their control of the markets and force new and more intensive ways of exploiting workers, playing work forces from different countries and regions off against each other. This entailed a levelling-down of working and living conditions. Its aim was to achieve new conditions for continuing the process of capitalist accumulation. That remains the case.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The consequences are plain to see: on top of the pressure on workers and their rights, the competition between productive systems with very different levels of development tends to accentuate differences, strengthening the strong and weakening the weak.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It will be no different with this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The liberalisation and deregulation of world trade has greatly weakened the productive sectors of the weakest EU economies, such as Portugal, which have been run according to the interests of big business in the European powers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Faced with the disastrous consequences of this path, instead of retracing its steps, the EU continues to show signs of wanting to rush blindly ahead.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is in this context that we must analyse this agreement, which is the widest-ranging negotiated by the European Union to date.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What is needed are urgent and profound changes to current trade policy in order to take into account the specificities of each EU Member State, with international trade aiming for complementarity rather than competition. This is necessary for the establishment of fair and equitable economic relationships that are mutually beneficial, are at the service of the development of peoples and countries, and are not solely beneficial for a small number of financial institutions and companies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The multifaceted crisis that we are facing requires a new economic, social, energy and environmental rationale, as well as the defence of each country’s right to produce sustainably: free trade, one of the pillars of neoliberalism, clearly makes this unviable.</p>

Both parties expect to secure significant benefits from the elimination of tariffs and the liberalisation of trade in services and company formation, and reaffirm their commitment to tariff reductions and further liberalisation of company formation and trade in services. Market access is being hampered by non-tariff barriers to trade, such as health and safety requirements or technical barriers, quantitative restrictions, conformity procedures, trade defence mechanisms, customs procedures, internal taxation, and a failure to adopt international norms and standards. The EU and India must pledge to speed up FTA talks and to make substantive and efficient progress towards the early conclusion of an ambitious and balanced, broad-based trade and investment agreement. Both parties must make every effort to conclude a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced FTA by the end of 2011. The agreement should respect sensitivities linked to agricultural trade, but this should not prevent market opening in areas of complementarity. The Commission must take due account of any negative impact on European agriculture, particularly in the areas of the opening up of markets, GMOs, milk, beef, intellectual property protection and origin labelling. The Commission should also negotiate effective and transparent procurement systems and India should apply transparent and fair procedures when awarding public contracts and grant European businesses access to public procurement systems.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU is India’s largest trade partner, with trade in goods and services worth approximately EUR 84 billion in 2009-2010. The EU accounts for 20.15% of India’s total exports and 13.32% of India’s total imports. Conversely, India accounts for 2.6% of the EU’s total exports and 2.2% of the EU’s total imports. In view of this, we cannot fail to take into consideration the fact that the objectives of the common commercial policy must be fully coordinated with the overall objectives of the European Union. According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the common commercial policy must be conducted ‘in the context of the principles and objectives of the Union’s external action’ and must contribute ‘inter alia, to sustainable development, the eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights’. As such, it is very important that the following not be forgotten in these negotiations: the use of child labour, and the failure to comply with international social and environmental standards, which constitutes a form of dumping, detrimental to European companies and workers.

This agreement is of particular importance; in fact, if the cooperation between the EU and India currently being negotiated is based on a system of shared universal values, it may serve as a model for cooperation with other countries.

For example, when India received a complaint from the World Trade Organisation about the 500% tariffs that it was applying to European wines, it got round it unfairly by having the individual Indian states impose the same tariffs. We must also bear in mind the negative economic impact that further liberalisation of trade with India would have, since the EU exports 1.9% of its services to India, whereas India exports 11.6% of its services to us.

This document highlights the fact that the European Union and Japan are very important to each other as trade partners.

      <p sl="pl">The resolution also emphasises that the EU is very much in favour of the conclusion of a free trade agreement with Japan, but that in order for this to happen, Japan must abolish non-tariff barriers and remove all obstacles to the development of cooperation. It also emphasises – and this is something that I regard as a very important feature of EU-Japan cooperation – that attention should be paid to environmental protection during the trading process, and that measures to counteract climate change and uphold environmental and social standards should be promoted. Furthermore, attention is drawn to the recent nuclear disaster, which is still not fully under control. As a result, it is not yet possible to estimate fully the extent of the crisis that has hit Japan, and there is no justification for accelerating negotiations on a free trade agreement. At present, Japan needs real aid.</p>

I voted in favour of this resolution on trade relations between the EU and Japan as I am convinced that the EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has the potential to benefit both economies. Indeed, the existence of open and fair trade is a powerful tool for generating more growth and social welfare, building on the comparative advantages of each respective economy and potential synergies flowing from greater economic integration and new inputs to a knowledge-driven economy This means boosting the EU-Japan market, which, together, already represents more than a quarter of world gross domestic product (GDP) and more than 20% of world trade.</p>

The fact that in 2010, the total amount of bilateral trade between the EU and Japan was EUR 120 billion demonstrates that both sides are extremely important to each other as partners. Japan is the EU's sixth biggest trade partner, and the EU is Japan’s third biggest. Both sides are also significant investors in each other’s economy, with a combined volume of Foreign Direct Investment worth EUR 200 billion in 2009. It is also worth highlighting the fact that the rapid economic growth of developing countries (BRIC), the economic slow-down resulting from the global financial crisis, and the pressing need to gain access to raw materials and renewable sources of energy, are absolutely key challenges which are common to both parties, making negotiations an even more urgent necessity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In documents relating to the subject of the resolution, both the Council and the Commission have stated that a precondition for launching negotiations is that Japan should remove regulatory barriers to trade, in particular, non-tariff barriers, which place a significant restriction on access to the Japanese market for European entrepreneurs.

These are the figures that we must bear in mind in order to understand the importance of a European strategy for sustainable forestry management and in order to protect this significant European heritage more effectively. We must remember the important role that forests play in terms of socio-economic services as well as their crucial role in the fight against climate change. It is therefore urgent that we improve our ability to prevent forest fires, as these continue to destroy more than 400 000 hectares of forest every year. In order to do this, it is important to improve the collection of information about forests, increase research, and especially to encourage Member States to exchange knowledge and experience, starting from a cross-border perspective. At this point, I would like to underline the importance of the work carried out by the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) and, in particular, the importance of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme which allows the necessary charting and surveillance of forests.</p>

The fact that we now have requested within this report legally binding sustainability criteria on energy-creating biomass is an important initiative. The EU biofuel legislation, along with legislation for renewables, has driven our forest use in an unsustainable direction. If we consider forests solely as a source of renewable energy, we totally have missed the point of combining sustainable industry and environment protection. Forests are an important source of livelihood and well-being within our borders. Therefore, this valuable natural source should be used for production rather than short-sighted energy.

The report calls for excessive sustainability criteria to be applied to forest management within the EU, without taking into consideration regional factors and the powers of the individual countries. The main points which exceed the authority of national forestry policy and weaken the forests in economic terms are the provisions concerning timber supplies within Europe. Also, the concept of ‘sustainability’ has still not been defined. Another point which I am opposed to is the implication that woody biomass is not sustainable. I believe that we should highlight the variety of protective and useful functions provided by the forests and not take a one-sided approach.

I therefore urge the continuation of the work already under way to form a united front which will improve relations between Europe and other world powers, promote a more effective response in situations of international crisis, and improve Europe’s standing on the world stage.</p>

Such an agreement, which is intended to promote free trade, should be entered into with great caution so as not to destabilise agriculture in the Community still further. Mercosur products are not required to meet the same environmental and social standards as their European counterparts – conditions under which there is a real risk of unfair competition.

We must remember the track record of these institutions and their tragic consequences: Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans and Libya, and other countries that are also on the list.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Development cooperation and aid policy, which, in the current international context, should constitute one of the principal pillars, if not the principal pillar, of a foreign and security policy, is relegated to an extremely secondary role.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In 2009, the really crucial common foreign and security policy (CFSP) decision was the appointment of the High Representative. One has to admit that it was not the best decision. It is quite clear that Lady Ashton is more gifted at issuing moralising press releases and playing Lady Bountiful than she is cut out for dealing with the diplomatic issues that you want her to tackle on behalf of the 27 Member States. Thanks to the Baroness, the European Union was absent, out of synch or swimming against the tide for all key events. However, as usually happens in times of crisis, a handful of States took the initiative – for better or for worse – got organised and took action. The remainder either tagged along or complained when they were forced to give an opinion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In reality, the Union’s foreign policy essentially involves distributing funding and engaging in trade, often in ways that are at variance with its professed political principles. This is only logical: diplomacy is a matter of State sovereignty. It is the product of each State’s history, resources and economic or geopolitical interests. The Union’s interests are neither an amalgamation nor an extension of those of the Member States. They are specific to the Union and often at odds with national interests. It is wholly unreasonable that these interests should take precedence over national interests.</p>

Effective multilateralism should be the overriding strategic concern of the Union and, in this context, the EU should take a leading role in international cooperation, support international institutions, facilitate international consensus and advance global action. There is an urgent need to address global issues of common concern for EU citizens, such as fighting terrorism, organised crime, pandemics and climate change, cyber security, ensuring the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the eradication of poverty, ensuring energy security, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, peaceful conflict resolution and disarmament, migration management and the promotion of human rights and civil liberties, and attention is drawn to the need for improved monitoring of EU funds in line with the European Court of Auditors Special Report No 15/2009.

Turkey is fortunate in being located at the meeting of two worlds: it has one foot in the European West and one in Asia. Jacques Chirac said that the European Union and Turkey have a ‘shared destiny’. Turkey’s accession would prove that constructive, conciliatory, innovative and creative dialogue is possible between East and West. After all, Europe is already home to between 15 and 20 million Muslims. Turkey is a founding member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and of the Western European Union (WEU). It has just been elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. Finally, the fact that it is part of the G20 goes to show how significant the country is and the geostrategic role that it could play in the alliance of nations. We need to rebuild trust between our governments and put flesh on the bones of the hopes expressed by the population and young people.

      <p sl="it">Defence policy is one of the areas most jealously guarded by the Member States. The impression one gets from this report, or indeed from others on the same subject or on foreign policy, is that the intention is to push the European Union into ensuring that it gradually gains the upper hand over the Member States in drawing up foreign and defence policy. Apart from the objections that can be made to this approach on principle, I cannot understand how anyone can think that the EU can ever speak with one voice on such sensitive subjects, in which the interests of the individual Member States are very often different, if not quite openly conflicting. One need only look at what has happened in the case of Libya and humanitarian intervention.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is virtually impossible for the Member States to reach agreement and put forward a single, agreed position on events of this magnitude.

The new provisions of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon provide a clearer legal framework for reinforcing the implementation of foreign and security policy, drawing upon all the instruments available to the EU and its Member States, to prevent and manage crises and conflicts, and to build lasting peace. When conducting foreign and security policy, the EU must ensure consistency and coherence between the different areas of its external action and between external and internal policies.

      <p sl="cs">I am concerned that, more than a year after the Treaty of Lisbon entered into effect, there are still no clear signs of a comprehensive EU approach to foreign and security policy, within the framework of which it would be possible to overcome the traditional procedural and institutional barriers restricting the EU’s ability to act. I am concerned about the unwillingness of EU Member States to define a common position on the crisis in Libya, or on UN Security Council Resolution 1973 and how to implement it. Ideas about creating ad hoc coalitions of countries as possible substitutes for a common security and defence policy are dangerous, in my opinion, as no European state in the 21st century has a real chance of being a significant player in the area of security and defence. I would like to point out in this context that the Treaty of Lisbon provides the possibility of entrusting the implementation of crisis-resolution operations to a group of Member States, although only within the framework of a Council decision defining the objectives, scope and terms of their implementation. A common response to the developments in Libya is essential to the creation of a new and credible approach to the Neighbourhood Policy with southern countries. It is similarly necessary to emphasise the development and deepening of the Eastern Partnership, within the framework of which a parliamentary assembly made up of MEPs and members of the parliaments of participating states has recently begun operating. In this context, we should insist on a tough and principled position towards the regime of President Lukashenko in Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="de">For a variety of reasons, I have voted in favour of the Gualtieri report. The rapporteur has worked very well together with my group. Many of our amendments have been turned into compromise texts. Out of 29 amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, 21 have been included in the report. Finally, many of the positions which we have supported and called for form part of the report. I am very critical of the call for the incorporation of arms research into the common strategic framework for research and innovation. The proposal for the use of so-called Battlegroups in the case of natural disasters is also inappropriate. The extensive reference to the US Department for Homeland Security as an example of a suitable anti-terrorism policy is at best irritating.</p>

This week, we are celebrating Europe Day, when we remember the Schuman Declaration, which spoke of a Europe which ‘will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity’. At the moment, it is this solidarity that is missing, especially in the expression of a strong shared political will by all the Member States, which would not only give greater protection to our borders, but also make our economy more credible. The Gualtieri report clearly underlines the fact that the European armed forces are not adequate to build a common European defence system or to reach the targets for the Union’s internal and external security set out in the Treaty of Lisbon. Without a credible military capacity, the common European security and defence policy will remain on paper and in the words of those who do not have the necessary tools to effectively implement it.</p>

The development of the CSDP is even more relevant given the current economic/financial crisis, which makes it advisable to share resources between Member States in order to effectively ensure public safety, crisis/conflict management and the establishment of lasting peace. It is more of an asset because of the observation of the legal structure presented, looking to clarify the institutional barriers verified in the post-Treaty of Lisbon period and trying to specify legislative solutions for any problems that are identified: ‘Lisbon’ requires a CSDP.

It is a report based on the new institutional framework created by the Treaty of Lisbon, according to which the European Union must speak with a single voice and, based on its restructuring, present common foreign and security policy in a more transparent way. However, it is necessary to recognise that the EU has still not achieved a comprehensive post-Lisbon approach, able to overcome traditional procedural and institutional obstacles. As such, a realistic foreign policy assessment becomes crucial, including more muscular intervention by EU forces, rather than leaving military intervention solely in the hands of France and the United Kingdom. Whilst I recognise the need for public debate on foreign and defence policy towards setting out Parliament’s future policies on this matter, I welcome the drafting of this report and hope that the EU continues to develop an effective multilateralism, which is one of the hallmarks of its geostrategic concerns.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Some of the contents of this report are, from certain perspectives, worrying. In essence, it confirms many of the warnings and alerts that we made as the Treaty of Lisbon was being debated and then brought into force: an irrefutable course of EU militarisation is under way, and it is now being accelerated and intensified. The militarisation of the EU does not serve peace or the interests of the people. The transformation of the EU into a European pillar of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), as advocated by the Treaty of Lisbon, entails involvement in conflict zones at international level. This is within a framework of collaboration with the United States, which assumes leadership in the process of affirming an imperial hegemony and guaranteeing the control of markets and resources, some of which are becoming increasingly scarce.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As affirmed by the proposed amendments made by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, the military interventions, supposedly undertaken in order to stabilise certain countries or regions, are on the wrong track. Instead of stabilising these countries and regions, they destabilise them. Instead of resolving problems, they exacerbate them. The situation in Libya is another example of this, to add to those of Afghanistan and Iraq. The development of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) serves the interests of the EU’s industrial-military complex, but not the interests of the people or of peace.</p>

Instead of resolving problems, this worsens them, as we can see in the cases of Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The militarisation of the EU is not in the interest of any of its peoples. The transformation, already under way, of the EU into a European pillar of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is part of a process of dividing up the international sphere into spheres of influence, under the leadership of the United States. This serves to ensure greater exploitation of labour forces and control over ever scarcer natural resources, particularly hydrocarbons, as well as control of the markets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The development of the common security and defence policy is a threat to peace. It is an element which deepens political intervention, contributes to the arms race, including nuclear weapons, and promotes vast profits for the EU’s industrial-military complex.</p>

In a turbulent global context, and at a time of economic and financial crisis, the EU is being called upon to enhance its strategic autonomy to uphold its values, pursue its interests and protect its citizens by developing a shared vision of the main challenges and threats and by aligning its capabilities and resources to adequately respond to them, thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and global security, also by pursuing effective multilateralism. Enhancing strategic autonomy in security affairs entails, for the EU, the capacity to agree upon common political objectives and strategic guidelines, to establish strategic partnerships with relevant international organisations, including NATO, and with other countries, to collect adequate information and generate joint analyses and assessments, to harness and, where necessary, pool financial, civilian and military resources, to plan and run effective crisis management operations across the extended range of the Petersburg-type missions, and to frame and implement a common defence policy, laying the first tangible foundations on which to build common defence.

      <p sl="lv">I supported the report on the development of the common security and defence policy following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Nevertheless, I consider that we still have a long way to go before we arrive at a comprehensive common security and defence policy. It is not permissible that individual Member States should enter into transactions that threaten the security of another Member State. France has entered into a transaction with Russia involving warships; a Russia that, in the recent past, occupied Georgian territories in the course of hostilities. In the same way, Russia has conducted provocative military manoeuvres in the proximity of the Baltic States, which expressed their concern over the transaction to which I referred. Although the Baltic nations have repeatedly expressed their concerns, European Union officials and institutions have not responded in any way to prevent French involvement in a military transaction with Russia.</p>
      <p sl="lv">French politicians’ concerns over their economy and jobs in their shipyards are understandable. However, within the European Union, the growth of one nation’s economy must not be achieved at the cost of another nation’s security. This kind of action is contrary to the existing solidarity principle within the European Union. This principle should brook no exception, and it is applicable to both large and small nations.

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of the Gualtieri report. However, I underline once again the need for enhanced cooperation between the EU and NATO. My original amendment to paragraph 87 aimed to confirm, rather than merely recognise, NATO’s role as the bedrock for collective defence – a role which is not just ‘still continuing’ but should be seen as the only option for the foreseeable future. In addition, NATO’s role cannot be deemed to concern only its Member States, as the Gualtieri report states: it creates security for the EU’s non-NATO members too.</p>
      <p sl="en">NATO has been, and is going to be, the foundation of collective defence, so that has to be stated in strong, affirmative language. This morning, the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton, declared that the EU and NATO are, for the first time, sharing information and data on Libya.

      <p sl="pl">Recent events in North Africa and Asia show that the European Union needs to strengthen its foreign policy and the alliances in which it participates. The threat of terrorist attacks, which is still very real, points to the need to strengthen European security standards. However, some of the proposals set out in the Gualtieri report are unacceptable. They run counter to the strategy which has been pursued up until now, aimed at building international alliances based, for the most part, on the assumption that the North Atlantic Alliance will play a leading role. The proposed strengthening of the European Defence Agency would not mean a genuine increase in the level of security in the EU, but merely the creation of another bureaucratic monster, incapable of performing the tasks assigned to it. Who would take the decision to mobilise European armed forces? Whose interests would their units be acting in? How much of a say would the new Member States have? Would the EDA’s headquarters be relocated? Fears have also been voiced regarding institutional matters, such as whether growth of the EDA would not result in a reduction in the size of certain Member States’ armies, and whether there would be a clash with the remit and objectives of the European External Action Service. As can be seen from previous reports, in spite of substantial financial investment and very good logistics and management, European forces could not cope with simple police missions in Kosovo and Bosnia. We should perhaps give some thought to how to improve their operations before encouraging them to extend their duties to include military actions.</p>

For example, it hopes for greater integration and common management in crisis situations: recent events in Libya have shown that Europe acts dispersedly, with some Member States directly engaged, others that have wriggled out, and practically only one country – Italy – to manage the direct consequences of the Libyan crisis and the North African crises in general, in other words, a flood of migrants.

This report helps confirm the EU as a player contributing to global stability and is a necessary step in developing a genuine pan-European approach in foreign and defence policy. I believe that better harmonisation of already existing instruments and reaching consensus on the strategic aims of the common security and defence policy in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon are of paramount importance. While relying on existing financial, civilian and military resources, Europe can take even more decisive actions in the event of natural and man-made disasters and be even more involved in averting and managing crises and conflicts, and in establishing a lasting peace in third countries. In addition to this, the European common security and defence policy and the European development cooperation policy are two sides of the same coin. I strongly support the report, which calls for better coordination of them. The organisation of regular meetings of a crisis management board, which will cooperate with the EEAS, is of crucial importance to this.

Credible and reliable military systems and capabilities are an essential condition for the development of an independent security and defence policy.

Up to now, our common foreign and security policy is a collection of disagreements and misguided initiatives. The recent Euro-row over action in Libya and the subsequent German opt-out made it clear to the rest of the world that the EU is still not able to project a real common foreign and security policy. Moreover, the French initiative aiming at consolidating the financing of the southern neighbourhood at the expense of the eastern neighbourhood sent a disastrous message to our eastern partners. This is even more sensitive at a time when other quintessential European projects are in doubt, if not in crisis. The euro is under constant pressure and the problem is, in part, generated by the same lack of European ambition and coherence. The Schengen Area is rolled back on a daily basis and national barriers re-emerge as the European spirit and legislation are ignored or broken by fellow Member States. A non-existent common foreign and security policy assisted by a huge External Action Service would seriously undermine European credibility in the world.</p>

It is entirely fair for the EU to have more effective representation in international organisations and for this representation to be valued, inasmuch as the EU is the organisation that contributes the most to development aid. The EU’s principles and values, which promote more effective and preventive multilateral action, make it an important international player in the emerging interpolar world order. In particular, the EU must initiate efforts to stop being a mere observer in United Nations programmes and conferences. It must also reinforce its position in international bodies in the area of economics and monetary stability, in accordance with its role as one of the principal economic powers at international level.

Finally, in the EP, we welcomed the recommendation by the UNHRC and subsequent decision by the UN General Assembly to suspend Libya’s membership of the UNHRC. Following efforts and actions made by some Member States in the HRC, today Syria has stated that it is withdrawing its candidacy to become a member of the UNHRC.

Global challenges, such as financial markets, energy security, combating poverty, climate change and human rights violations require joint and coordinated action. The Treaty of Lisbon, by introducing the Union’s legal personality, enhanced the EU’s capacity to join various international organisations and provided the opportunity to assume a stronger and more influential position globally. Hitherto, the representation of the EU and its Member States in international organisations has been fragmented, which has prevented the EU from speaking with a single voice in the international arena.

The Treaty of Lisbon has enhanced the foreign policy instruments, especially within the UN. In this regard, I would like to highlight point 12 of the report – the first step towards coordinated, effective action from Member States in the Security Council.

As a result, the national governments would be unable to adequately assert their own interests in international forums.</p>

In addition, there is a need to involve non-state actors more in multilateral policy making and to promote and facilitate improved consultation with civil society organisations and social partners in the future governance structures of international organisations. The European Union should play an active and leading role in global governance reform, by enhancing cooperation, improving institutions and engaging all stakeholders, This would make international institutions and organisations more legitimate, effective and conducive to shared responsibility.

This report examines the role of the EU as a global player in international bodies. In this respect, like the rapporteur, I believe that there is still a long way to go on the path to credible, consistent and visible EU external action, as there is no European strategy for every organisation of which the Member States or the EU are part. The increasing complexity that characterises the international system makes it necessary to objectively coordinate the relationships between the Member States, and between the Member States and the EU on the various stages where we interact. That is why we adopted the Treaty of Lisbon. Moreover, there is already an example of good practice: our presence in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). There is, therefore, an urgent need for the EU to be represented with a single voice in the various international bodies. I think that drawing up a White Paper on this subject, as is proposed in the report, could be a good ‘beginning of the end’ for this bizarre situation.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I endorsed the report because the added value of EU membership in multilateral organisations lies in the fields where it has exclusive or shared competences: economic and trade matters, environmental policy, development aid, and security and defence policy. The Treaty of Lisbon, by introducing the Union’s legal personality, enhances the EU’s capacity to join various international organisations, entrusts it with a wider range of competences in its external action, provides, notably by the creation of the post of a Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP/HR) and the European External Action Service (EEAS), the Union with an opportunity for a clearer and stronger single voice in the world, as well as encouraging all types of mutually beneficial cooperation with relevant international and regional organisations and groups of states, and enables the Union to organise itself in such a way as to be able to become an effective global player. I believe that hitherto, the representation of the EU and its Member States in multilateral organisations, informal summits and international regimes has been fragmented, often ineffective, and still varies considerably. I also take the view that EU Member States should increasingly consider and rely on the EU as a multiplier of power in achieving the objectives they cannot achieve independently, and that speaking with one EU voice not only increases the chances of success but also improves the legitimacy and credibility of the EU as an important international actor in the emerging interpolar world, without it losing its identity of course.</p>

Unfortunately, recent, and also current, political and humanitarian crises in the world, have called for prompt, decisive action by the EU.

      <p sl="fr">Nations are powerless to act alone in the face of the major challenges of our times. Multilateral action is the only way that States can get to grips with the challenges facing our world. The economic, financial and food crises, climate change and conflicts have made us realise that we urgently need to create a form of global governance, or what Jacques Attali calls a ‘world State’. Naturally, Europe has a role to play in this new global political arena as a soft world power based on standards, rules and leading by example. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Europe has the foundation it requires in order to assert itself politically as well as economically.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the role that the European Union should play in multilateral organisations. As a general principle, the strengthening of the EU’s role in multilateral frameworks has been approved. Thanks to the agreement which has been reached and the joint measures taken, the European Union is becoming a model for the functioning of a world order based on international law.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is why emphasis has been placed on the need for the EU to cooperate with leading regions, and to participate actively in creating an international community. Other requirements include cooperation between the Member States and the drafting of a common position, inter alia, on the issue of savings and budgetary cuts. The EU and the Member States need to take steps to increase the EU’s role and strengthen its position within the UN (changes to support for the UN, in particular, with regard to humanitarian policies and aid and the issue of conflict resolution).</p>
      <p sl="pl">Within the framework of cooperation with international financial institutions, the EU must find a solution to the problem of external economic and financial representation, which limits the EU’s influence. As far as the EU’s role in multilateral security organisations is concerned, it has been said that the regulations which make it possible for the European Union to benefit from NATO funding should be streamlined. Thought should be given to whether the EU should take on greater responsibility and play a more effective role in achieving joint objectives (engaging in joint dialogue, deciding on and coordinating joint measures, etc.) under the agreement between the EU and the OSCE.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report on ‘The EU as a global actor: its role in multilateral organisations’ presents an overview of the role of the EU. I voted in favour of this report as I agree with its vision and ambition for an EU that has a strong presence on the international stage. Apart from the value of each Member State per se, the EU, as an organisation, can contribute its organisational experience to the international community. Indeed, the EU’s mechanisms for building consensus and taking concerted action make it a model for a rules-based international order. In view of this, cooperation with the leading regional powers should be encouraged, so that the EU can actively participate in the building and improvement of an international environment that enables the EU to promote its values and interests, as required by the Treaty. With regard to the EU’s aspiration to be a global player, it is therefore essential to strengthen internal coordination in order to speak with one voice. This is the only way to achieve multilateral cooperation and address international challenges, namely those arising from the responsibility to protect, and the need to enhance human security as a means of achieving global security.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In the current context, it is very important that the EU be able to establish itself as a global player, capable of responding effectively to the demanding challenges that are posed at global level.

It therefore stresses the need for the EU to cooperate with leading regional powers and actively participate in the building and improvement of an international environment that enables the EU to promote, as required by the Treaty, its values and interests. In particular in those fields where it has exclusive or shared competences, it considers essential, with regard to the EU’s aspiration and need to be an effective global actor and to safeguard its position, a strengthening of the internal coordination necessary to speak with one voice, the ability to shape multilateral cooperation and lead collective action in addressing international challenges, namely those arising from the responsibility to protect, and the need to enhance human security, as a means of achieving global security.</p>

      <p sl="it">The final text of this report emphasises the strategic role that the European Union must play in international organisations. To achieve this, there is a need, above all, to promote active, concrete participation so as to strengthen both internal and external cooperation. That must be the primary way to increase the legitimacy of the decisions made and also to ensure that responsibilities are fully shared. Lastly, the Member States must coordinate their positions in the United Nations Human Rights Council so as to establish clear and strict membership criteria, especially for countries where human rights violations are commonplace.</p>

Its role in international, multilateral organisations is visibly growing, and has been showing itself to be increasingly important. The European Union should therefore play a more active and leading role in the reform of global governance. I am talking, in particular, about the need to reform the United Nations (UN) system to assign the Union a place and, in particular, about its representation on the UN Security Council.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That involves a demanding degree of coordination of the Member States’ positions, but it would result in the increased coherence, visibility and credibility of EU actions at international level. The European Union should take inspiration from the model followed in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). For more consistent and better-integrated cooperation, it should have observer status in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), be more closely coordinated with the Council of Europe, and participate fully in the activities of the G7/G8 and G20.</p>

I welcome the adoption of this report, which calls for better representation for the Community institutions in international organisations. The Europe of 27 is stronger now. The new Member States have increased the Union’s economic and demographic strength. However, the balance and coordination between Member States has been thrown out of kilter by enlargement. The European message has changed: it has become richer and more complex. As I see it, if we are to improve the European Union’s representation in multilateral organisations, we must first find a consensus. I am pleased to see that the Union has supported the United Nations’ strategy, particularly in the case of humanitarian policy and conflict resolution. Europe and the UN have a wealth of objectives and interests in common, which, in my view, justifies even closer cooperation and resource synergies. I would therefore like to see Europe accorded a stronger position within the UN, particularly at the annual General Assembly.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The international situation has recently been changing ever more rapidly. The rising economic importance of Asia, the revolutionary movements in Africa, the increased terrorist threat, the need to establish joint and sustainable European raw materials strategies and ever more frequent violations of human rights are just a few of the problems with which EU diplomacy has to contend today. Experience has taught us that it is powerless in many cases. The European Union’s foreign policy appears to be poorly thought-out and poorly coordinated. Furthermore, the idea of joint and sustainable European policies has lost out on more than one occasion to the interests of the largest countries of the ‘old’ EU. A perfect example of this is the lack of a rule ensuring geographical balance when filling posts in the European External Action Service. This system needs to be changed, and it was for this reason that I did not support the Muñiz De Urquiza report. I believe that it identifies key conditions which the EU and the Member States should meet in order to be able to perform better the tasks enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon. However, we should not endeavour to replace NATO with a new EU army, but instead concentrate on the appropriate division of tasks during international crises. The EU’s role could lie in the provision of humanitarian aid, while the North Atlantic Alliance would coordinate military aid. This distribution of tasks could also make it possible to strengthen cooperation with the EU's most important trade and military partner, namely the United States.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are disappointed that it has not been possible to reach agreement on the Novel Foods Regulation and that therefore, it is not possible to guarantee adequate information for consumers on the foods that we eat or to ensure that Europe has clear, strict rules on foods from cloned animals.</p>
      <p sl="it">What I have said is not meant to be controversial: it is not Parliament’s fault. If we have been unable to regulate cloning – one of the main sticking points in these negotiations – it is because the governments have not shown enough willingness. However – and I address this point to the governments and the Commission – food safety and information on the products that reach our tables are basic principles of the European Union. Everybody says so, but then we have to act accordingly, or else it becomes a slogan that consumers do not believe.</p>
      <p sl="it">When these issues are being discussed, Parliament is not prepared to look the other way and content itself with the kind of general reassurances that the Council provided during the negotiations. On such a sensitive and serious food safety issue, it is not acceptable just to dab on a touch of face powder to look good to the consumers. Parliament was calling for a credible solution: the labelling of all foodstuffs derived from cloned animals and their offspring. That really would have been a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to make another remark on a more general level: the governments continue to think that it is their prerogative to make all decisions. It is still not clear to them that there is an institution – the European Parliament – which codecides. We are directly elected by the citizens and we are determined to enforce our rights. I invite the governments to read the Treaty of Lisbon carefully, because I am sure they have not paid attention to all parts of it.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like now to appeal to the Commission and to Commissioner Dalli, whose conduct during the negotiations was admirable, although perhaps the Commission did not explain his role in conciliating the positions. Commissioner, I invite you to table a proposal on cloning as soon as possible in order to regulate the sector effectively once and for all. That is what the people of Europe are calling for and what Parliament is calling for as well.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would also like to acknowledge the Hungarian Presidency – which inherited this thorny problem only in the final stage of the procedure – for having made every possible effort to make up for lost time. I thank all the Hungarian Presidency representatives for that. I know they do not deserve any blame at all, which is due instead to the stalemate that occurred within the Council between the different national government positions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, who was magnificent: highly passionate, enthusiastic and competent. She has followed this dossier with a love that really does credit to her, and I believe all of us owe her a huge vote of thanks, as we also do to the whole delegation from Parliament, all our fellow Members, the chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and everyone else.</p>
      <p sl="it">We all worked together day and night to achieve a goal. We were not successful, but the questions have been raised and I am sure that, if Commissioner Dalli is true to his word, we will be able to find a way again to provide ourselves with good regulations on cloning and novel foods.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, today’s debate is a good occasion for me to present the Presidency’s observations on the recently held conciliation on the proposal for a regulation on novel foods. It is also an excellent opportunity for the Presidency to learn Parliament’s opinion on this important issue.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Our European institutions have suffered a major collective failure. There is no other course but to learn from this experience in a constructive manner based on professional criteria. It is in this spirit that I turn to you today. I have come not only to speak but also to listen to you.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to begin by emphasising that the Presidency genuinely regrets that your institution and ours, the Council, were unable to reach agreement. This is all the more true because both the Presidency and the Council attributed great importance to this proposal. This was an unrivalled opportunity for us to update the European Union regulation in an area which directly affects us all: food. There was a real chance for the European Union to show how it contributes in a tangible manner to making the lives of European citizens better. The proposed regulation would have been a particularly good means of answering disputed questions on food from cloned animals by tightening the provisions of the 1997 regulation. The 1997 regulation provides that such food products can only be marketed after an authorisation procedure. In contrast, as a result of the recent conciliation procedure, a clear, albeit temporary, agreement was reached. All parties agreed that the marketing of food from cloned animals must be completely prohibited. Furthermore, this ban would have come into effect immediately after the regulation entered into force. If the conciliation had been successful, we could now be jointly welcoming an imminent ban on the marketing of food from cloned animals. This prohibition could have entered into force as early as the end of this month. Unfortunately, this was not to be. In the light of the failed negotiations, we may be apt to blame each other. At the same time, it is our common interest and duty not to give in to this inclination but to seek a solution together. Although the conciliation procedure has come to an end, the needs and expectations of European consumers have not altered at all, and therefore I am pleased to note that we have another chance to make progress. It is up to us to restart this process as soon and as effectively as possible. We must do our utmost especially to ensure that what we have agreed in the negotiations to date is not lost.</p>
      <p sl="hu">At third reading, we have reached the point where, in principle, we have agreed on an immediate ban on food from cloned animals. We must not allow this agreement in principle to be lost. Likewise, we must protect the major advance made in relation to engineered nanomaterials and traditional food from third countries as well as similar, important issues. I believe that what we eat is important to all of us, and the kind of nourishment our children and grandchildren grow up on is even more important. I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the Commissioner and his organisational units for the hard work they have done over the last few months. I also welcome the fact that the Commission – as it has unofficially informed us – is working on drafting a new proposal at an accelerated pace, striving to preserve as many elements of the provisional agreement reached during the recent negotiations as possible in the new legislative proposal. The Presidency guarantees its support to both the Commission and Parliament, and hopes that an opportunity to adopt this new proposal will arise as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Madam President, honourable Members, we are aware that the Commission has little room for manoeuvre. After all, it is the task of the Council and Parliament as the two colegislators to find a solution which satisfies the needs and expectations of European citizens through joint efforts. In the light of all this, I look forward to your views with truly great interest.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as I have already had the opportunity to state to both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I cannot but express my disappointment at the failure of conciliation, notwithstanding our best efforts to find an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">This situation is unfortunate, since we had made a lot of progress over recent months on the issues in the novel foods proposals. Let me recall some of the elements on which there was clear agreement and which, if adopted, would bring many improvements to the legislation currently in place: a centralised procedure for approval of novel foods which streamlines the authorisation process while maintaining food safety; a definition of ‘nanomaterials’ and the obligation for pre-market approval, and a labelling requirement for all food ingredients containing nanomaterials; a simplified procedure applicable to traditional foods from third countries, to facilitate EU market access for these products; and the need for food business operators to share scientific data, where tests on animals are involved, in order to limit animal testing where possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">These improvements will contribute to Europe’s innovation drive by facilitating the marketing of novel foods without any compromise on safety. This dossier requires our concerted attention in order to put these improvements in place without further delay. They will bring huge benefits in terms of both consumer protection and innovation in the food sector. It is therefore my hope that we can capture the momentum of negotiations by making a proposal on this issue very shortly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The failure to conclude this dossier came despite a number of positive steps achieved on the issue of cloning during the last months and hours of negotiations. The Commission remains committed to following up the report of October 2010 which, I recall, proposed the following: a temporary suspension for five years of the use of the cloning technique in the EU, of the import and use of clones for food production, and of food from clones, which would be combined with the introduction of traceability systems for imports of semen and embryos from clones. Furthermore, the Commission recognises the progress made during conciliation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also clear to me that, on the issue of cloning in all its facets, we need to find an agreement that can be implemented and one that is justified and proportionate. The Commission is ready to come up with a comprehensive proposal after the necessary impact assessment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the conciliatory tone adopted by Mr Pittella and by the Presidency. We need collectively to reflect further on the next steps, and I am ready to discuss with you, and with the Council, possible scenarios to deal with these two important issues and to agree on a process that will guarantee a positive outcome. Such a collective reflection should seek to set a course for success on both dossiers so that consumers can reap the benefits.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Liotard, the Hungarian Presidency and Commissioner Dalli and his team for their efforts. Unfortunately, however, this regulation, which is so important and so necessary, has not reached a satisfactory conclusion because of a labelling requirement that went beyond what was possible in practice. This is a subject that inspires passion and attracts media attention, factors that run counter to logic and pragmatism.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have to say that we have missed the chance to take a step forward, have condemned the agri-food industry to living with obsolete legislation and have put the brakes on European technological advancement, of which we are so supportive in theory.</p>
      <p sl="es">We cannot demand something that involves a level of cost and bureaucracy that cannot be assumed by the food-producing sector, nor can we demand something that we are not capable of imposing upon third parties. We cannot legislate on something that later we will not be able to implement because we would be deceiving consumers.</p>
      <p sl="es">I repeat, it is a pity that we have not reached agreement because this regulation dealt not only with cloning and with how many generations and which products must be labelled, but also with many other points on which agreement has been reached, such as nanotechnology and foodstuffs coming from third countries, which were very important for consumers and for the agri-food industry, not only from the point of view of the internal market, but also from a health perspective and in terms of innovation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Since cloning is too complex a matter to relegate to a few paragraphs in another proposal, I urge the Commission once again to prepare a report and present a separate legislative proposal that regulates every aspect of cloning, based on food security and all scientific data.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I have been involved in many negotiation processes here in Parliament, but the 12 hours of this conciliation procedure, which lasted from 19:00 to 07:00 the next morning, will remain in my memory for a long time. This was a very special event.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, the two sides came from different planets. Parliament’s approach was clear, which was to focus on the interests of consumers and of the citizens of the EU. Others were considering the interests of the meat and agriculture industries. Because of these divergent approaches, we were not able to reach an agreement. This is a pity, because we now have a gap in the EU food legislation which we need to close very quickly. We were all relatively clear about this, including Mr Pittella, who acted as chair, and the rapporteur. The entire team was pulling together.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now we need to take the next step. We must fill this gap. Mr Dalli, you must present two proposals: one on novel foods, because we have almost reached a consensus on this with regard to nanomaterials, the centralised approval process and imports from third countries. The other proposal concerns cloning. You have listened to everything that we have to say on this subject. We do not want these products on the European market. At the very least, we want them to be labelled, because consumers should have freedom of choice. That is your job and Parliament is ready to support you. I hope you will be able to submit a proposal very soon.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would first like to thank Mrs Liotard, Mr Pittella, Mr Leinen, and the entire negotiating team. Thanks to them, we have maintained an extremely cohesive position throughout this very lengthy trialogue and I think that the only positive aspect of the dossier is that the European Parliament has been united in defending public health and the interests of consumers. That is what we have been elected for and not for anything else.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While I recognise the need to move forward and not to assign blame, there is no getting away from the facts, and when it came to conducting negotiations in which Parliament had already abandoned a great deal, well, that was too much. As if we should even be asking ourselves whether or not to label products sold on the European market when the consumer’s freedom of choice is fundamental in European law!</p>
      <p sl="fr">What has happened is totally unacceptable and we have been fobbed off with spurious pretexts. We have been presented with legal excuses. We were not entering into a commercial war; the rules of the WTO were not being violated. In legal terms, this was all untrue. Not being able to label is an excuse. It is technically incorrect. It is perfectly possible to label and trace. Simply, it was something we were unwilling to do because, as Mr Leinen pointed out just now, we put interests other than those of consumers first.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, now, we need to move forward, and we need to move forward quickly. The issue of cloning is increasingly being used by all who want to call the European institutions into question. It is an argument put forward by those who mistrust our institutions. It is an argument put forward by those who mistrust the foods placed on the European market. For pity’s sake, we urgently need to adopt a clear position on cloning to prevent cloned meat and the offspring of cloned animals being placed on the European market, which is what European consumers and European citizens want!</p>

Conciliation proceedings are most certainly a useful mechanism in the legislative process, but they become futile and pointless if participants are not prepared to negotiate and to compromise. If the Parliament had not been so inflexible, then we would have a much needed update of the rules. Now we have to fall back on the 1997 Novel Foods Regulation, which is completely outdated.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the European Parliament is trying to show that it is a powerful, responsible legislative body which is proud to have achieved the Lisbon Treaty, I think it flunked its first test. The Commission now has to move forward and prepare separate legislation to cover cloning. I only hope that MEPs will learn from their mistakes and realise that it is the people of Europe who suffer if we cannot agree on these key issues.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I think that Mr Leinen put his finger on it. This is a dossier that is finely balanced between the interests of the meat processing industry and the agricultural industry and those of the consumer. I think that is the crux of the problem. I think that we, as Parliament, have done important work here, along with the rapporteur, who I would like to congratulate for all her efforts. We have worked hard and we have also shown ourselves to be flexible. We were prepared, at any given point, to make a number of concessions, but it was never enough.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I do have reservations about the insufficiently flexible approach taken by the Commission to these concessions, but I am also not particularly satisfied with the Commission’s stance – not with your position, directly, Mr Dalli, but at one point, one of your fellow Commissioners, the Belgian Commissioner, Mr De Gucht, went behind the backs of the conciliation committee to appear before this Parliament’s Committee on International Trade, where he proceeded to present a whole series of sophisms. The grounds cited were connected with the WTO, and we all know – Mrs Lepage was quite right to say this – that such grounds are out of the question here. I think that the rapporteur will be coming back to this issue shortly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What needs to happen now? Certainly, we have lost some time. I believe that we do now have to ask the Commission to bring forward a new proposal in respect of novel foods quickly – we know that that may be possible, as something approaching an agreement was reached. A proposal also needs to be brought forward about how we are going to deal with cloned food, meat from cloned animals and their offspring, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have a warning to give, Commissioner: I want to see this happen on schedule. I do not want to see this dossier kicked into the long grass and for us to then have it put before us at the end of our term or for it to be held over into the next parliamentary term. This is the Parliament that debated this dossier at first and second reading and in conciliation. It must therefore also be this Parliament that concludes it.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks to my fellow Members in this House and in the delegation for the universal support I received in the negotiations, right until the end. I am also full of admiration for the Hungarian ambassador, who really did all she could, as did Mr Dalli, in fact.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is a real pity that we were unable to reach agreement in relation to clones. Consumers can still find cloned products on their dinner tables, unsolicited and unlabelled, even though 77% of European citizens are opposed to this. I would say to the Council that banning clones alone is the politics of symbolism. The real key here is the banning of offspring. The clones themselves are so expensive that you would not make a hamburger out of them. We were thus unable to reach a compromise on this issue. The Council and the Commission both kept reiterating that a ban on offspring would be in contravention of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Mr De Gucht then went further by coming to Parliament and saying that it would lead to a trade war. You can imagine, then, how surprised I was to read, clearly set out in a secret internal Council document that I got hold of – it is a document from the Legal Service of the Council of Ministers – that a ban on cloning offspring is actually perfectly justifiable under WTO rules. The document clearly stated that</p>
      <p sl="nl">‘The bans [on] food from cloned animals and [ …] food from offspring of clones could be justified on the basis of the consumers’ ethical considerations’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like the Council to tell me whether all the Member States knew about this document. If so, why the constant use of the argument about global trade wars so that no compromise could be reached with Parliament? I am now really curious to know what the real underlying reasons were. If the Member States’ negotiators were not aware of this document, that is a scandal as far as I am concerned. If they were aware of it, then disingenuous arguments were used.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Dalli, the citizens await your next move. In my view, regulation must be brought forward very quickly now. You know that I am still prepared to collaborate and I am certain that we can find a solution. I will hand over the document to the Council.</p>

It should be remembered that the persons who represent Europe’s citizens are the ones democratically elected by them. Therefore, if Parliament has continually insisted in committee and in this Chamber that cloned meat is not acceptable to our people, the Council ought to have taken notice. Responsibility for this decision, which is very bad for business, lies wholly with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="it">Except for the part dealing with cloned meat and a few other foodstuffs, the text would have been adopted by a very large majority. The Council did not want it. It is the same Council that, on the one hand, declares itself in favour of the liberalisation of everything and, on the other, forces the removal of the ‘Made in’ wording on textiles because it does not want to give consumers the correct information, and is giving us a hard time over labelling because it does not want labels to indicate the place of origin or provenance of the food on our people’s tables. That is the Council’s position.</p>

In my opinion, the Commissioner and the Minister who are present are not responsible either. On the contrary, it was other representatives of the Council and the Commission who rushed to do their duty and identify problems in third countries which were not fully discussed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr De Gucht and representatives of the finance ministries, for example, from Germany, which is my home country, painted horrific pictures of trade wars on a larger scale than the banana war and a number of other issues. I do not believe that any of this had a basis in fact.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yesterday, I had the great pleasure of meeting with representatives of the American embassy from my country, who had come especially to Strasbourg and even spoke German with me, to discuss issues relating to food policy. The arguments of the American diplomats were not sufficiently convincing to prevent us from being able to find a solution. I asked them what their opinion on the subject was and I did not get the impression that it would have been impossible for us to come to an agreement with the Americans if we had wanted to. What particularly surprised me was that the Americans gave me this document describing origin labelling in the USA. For example, minced meat must be labelled in the USA. It must be clearly stated on a pack of hamburgers where the meat comes from.</p>
      <p sl="de">How can we talk about a trade war if, at the same time, we want to label cloned meat and the meat from descendants of cloned animals? We should have made more effort in this area and not said immediately, as soon as the Americans expressed their doubts, that we could not do this. I am calling on the Commission to see this as an argument for producing a new proposal. We must be more self-confident if we want to implement this in the face of opposition from third countries.</p>

Unfortunately, it all ended, as we know, in disagreements about food from cloned animals. I come from a country where food from cloned animals is prohibited. However, cloning is nevertheless coming in through the back door. The subject is often brought up in guarded secrecy outside the debate. I find it strange that we want total transparency in everything from socks and television to medicines and banks, but when it comes to food, the situation is completely different.</p>
      <p sl="da">Colourants, gases to increase shelf life, growth hormones, antibiotics, GMOs and much more besides are used – preferably without consumers being able to read about it on the packaging.

Their interests are the desire to do business by cloning animals, at the cost of animal suffering. Parliament, meanwhile, listened to European consumers, the overwhelming majority of whom do not want the use of cloning in meat or milk production, the overwhelming majority of whom want to reduce animal suffering, not increase it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Parliament has not actually been inflexible. It made huge concessions, and was ready to withdraw the ban on labelling.

      <p sl="fr">When we talk of consumers’ lack of confidence in the institutions, I believe that is not the issue. It is often individuals who create such mistrust and who derive a personal interest from doing so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will now get back to the substance. It is true that, at the end of a long night of negotiations, which lasted from 19:00 to 07:00, there was huge disappointment. It is true that the European Commission now has a huge task ahead of it, because it must submit new proposals and because developments in technology now make the revision of this legislation essential. When we think, for example, of nanomaterials, that appears very urgent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is completely unacceptable that there is no control over cloning techniques or over the food resulting from these techniques, which could be intended for human consumption. There are clear principles and I believe that all of us in this Parliament are entirely in agreement. Consumers must be informed of the origin of food derived from cloned animals and their offspring.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must demand two things: traceability and labelling. I am in no doubt about the will of Commissioner Dalli to clarify this matter and to find the right solutions to the countless issues that remain unresolved. Traceability is essential. European consumers must be able to make an informed choice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As European legislators, we cannot afford to say to the public: ‘Europe is doing nothing because we have not succeeded in reaching an agreement’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, I know that you are endeavouring to overcome the institutional stalemates we are witnessing in order to give a firmer guarantee not only to consumers but also to food business operators. There is no time to spare and we must act quickly to find a way forward.</p>

It seems that by including cloned animals in this legislation, we have fallen into a trap. I must say that the way we have debated this issue has not been dignified. The discussions went on all night with each side going to and fro and neither wanting to give in. Then, in the end, the negotiations failed, which is very unfortunate.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make one point. We are talking here about a number of subjects and about legislation. We used the same strategy for genetic engineering. We did not want genetic engineering and we significantly raised the limits and the requirements. What was the end result? The technology developed to such an extent that it was even able to meet these high standards. We are currently discussing the fact that we do not want cloned animals because the animal welfare requirements are not being fulfilled, which gives rise to risks. I have spoken to the scientists and I predict that the technology will develop to such an extent that it will no longer be possible to apply a general ban on cloning animals. However, I believe that these scientific developments are highly questionable.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must look more closely at the basic principles that we need to lay down in order to put in place proper regulations. We should not attempt to slow down or even prevent certain developments by means of legislation.</p>

Although whole months, and even years of work have been spent on this, the outcome is disappointing, especially at a time when agreement was possible on many items in this dossier. However, the rapporteur deserves all our appreciation for her efforts.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the issue of food from cloned animals and their offspring, Parliament was right when it maintained its point of view based on principle. We are aware that we are representing the will of European citizens when we oppose the presence of cloned animals and their offspring in the food chain. During the negotiations, the Council ignored these legitimate concerns, which is extremely regrettable. If we had accepted the Council’s final proposal, we could not have claimed that we defended the wishes of ordinary citizens not to have cloned meat on their table. We were not prepared to approve laws which would have allowed food from the offspring of cloned animals to enter the market without it being labelled as such.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As for the future, I would like to remind the Commission of the commitments which it made in October 2010, mainly, to ban cloning techniques for producing food in the European Union. Another commitment was to set up traceability systems for reproductive material originating from cloned animals outside the EU. These commitments were made on several occasions and must feature in the new proposals. I am confident that Member States will focus greater attention on the legitimate concerns of the European Union’s citizens.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, I agree with everything that the Members who have spoken before me have said. I, too, was a member of the delegation to the Conciliation Committee. As the negotiations went on, there were feelings of hope, disappointment and even rage, if I may say so, because we were there representing over 500 million people, the vast majority of whom – according to all the surveys and research – keep crying out that they do not want food from cloned animals or their offspring on their tables.</p>
      <p sl="it">Labelling and traceability were really the minimum on which we had taken a stand. Had we accepted the compromise, we would have found it empty. Mr Pittella is right: a dab of powder, a touch of rouge, perhaps a little wool pulled over the eyes, but nothing more than an empty shell. Let us not fool ourselves: nobody pays EUR 100 000 for a bull only to put it through the mincer and sell it as hamburgers. For all the rest, there was no regulation; we would have been accepting deregulation, and we cannot do that.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, however, we are still here defending certain decisions and maintaining that it was a collective failure. It was not a collective failure, though, because there was agreement on practically everything, even though it failed miserably giving people the impression that big business and trade rules prevail over the European citizenry, whom we are here to represent and defend.</p>

We are still considering and, hopefully, will adopt new rules on the provision of general information on foods to consumers, as well as different issues, such as fruit juice and derived products.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Unfortunately, it was not possible to reach a compromise with the Council on novel foods and we have taken a step backwards. The majority of consumers do not want food products from cloned animals, but the reality is that they exist. It is therefore essential to ensure that the public is made aware. However, arguing that it could cause difficulties for business and producers, representatives of the Member States did not endorse the requirement for labelling or traceability, in other words, the minimum requirements for being able to ensure consumer awareness. Thus, consumers still have no way of knowing, whether, for example, the milk they are drinking comes from cloned animals.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, this is just one side of the coin. Now we have prevented new technologies, research and the use of results in the food industry.

There is a need for action. We are calling on you not to wait for months, but to come to grips with this issue straight away. The ban on cloning is simply one step in the process.

Cloning is a worse tyranny for animals than small cages or being transported in lorries without water.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore right that the regulation on new foodstuffs includes a ban on the sale of cloned animals and their offspring.

How will the movement of these foods between European countries be regulated? How will the scientific tests needed to test the safety of these novel foods be carried out?

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, on behalf of the Presidency and the Council, thank you for the debate. I would like to express my special thanks for the speeches which acknowledged the efforts of the Hungarian Presidency and which recognised these efforts.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We also welcome the fact that the arguments put forward during the conciliation procedure have been presented here. At the same time, we wish to repudiate statements or suggestions alleging that either the Council or the Hungarian Presidency acted dishonestly or in bad faith, or was under the influence of interest groups.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The best aspect of the Treaty of Lisbon is that it increased our joint responsibility. We have tried and are trying to act in this spirit. We have been unable to agree, so now in this respect, any product may be served at our tables without restriction. This is worse than the Council’s last offer would have been. Precisely what was that? It was a ban on cloned animals and products derived from them, and the monitoring and labelling of first progeny, naturally within reasonable limits. One only has to think, for example, of the very many ingredients salami has. Reasonableness and pricing will set the limit.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We wish to say specifically to Mrs Liotard that, as regards the internal Council document you quoted, the Member States were aware of it and naturally the Council was aware of it, and even discussed it. It helped in establishing our position. You cited a sentence taken in isolation from this document while failing to mention that the document states in its conclusions precisely that there are risks from the aspect of WTO compatibility, as well as that these conclusions also mention that the most acceptable solution is labelling, which, I repeat, was included in the Council’s last offer.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, I agree with you all that we should move on as soon as possible. We hope that before long, we will know more about aspects of food safety due to scientific research and progress. I am pleased that Commissioner Dalli promised that there will be a new, separate draft on cloning and the subject of cloned products soon.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, all the speeches made by the Members who have spoken before me – whom I thank, starting with the rapporteur – as well as the documentation presented by the rapporteur herself, which underlines the fact that our proposals, had they been accepted, would not have unleashed a trade war, have shown that there was no collective failure, and I repeat this to the Hungarian Presidency without wishing to be polemical. There certainly was a failure, but it was in an area for which the governments were clearly responsible.</p>
      <p sl="it">Let nobody tell me that merely labelling beef from cloned animals or their offspring could be considered an honourable and satisfactory agreement for Parliament, because this was little more than no agreement at all. Let us now draw a veil over all that and look to the future. It is, first of all, the Council’s job to get the governments to agree once they know what Parliament’s positions are, which are the positions of the people of Europe. Labelling of products from cloned animals and their offspring is the minimum we will settle for. Work is needed within and between governments to accept this minimum.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore call on Commissioner Dalli – who I know is very willing – to table a Commission proposal incorporating our positions as soon as possible, so as to allow this House to approve the regulation on cloning. We must also go ahead on nanomaterials, and now that the cloning part has been removed, we can move quickly on these.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have one final comment: you have all noticed how united Parliament is. This is substantial, 360 degree unity. You may perhaps have made a mistake during the negotiations, thinking that there was no cohesion in the European Parliament. Please do not make that mistake again, because on sensitive issues relating to people’s health, we are and will remain united.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, this is actually a point of order. Several times in the debate, the position of Commissioner De Gucht has been mentioned. Mrs Lepage asked Commissioner Dalli whether he was aware of the Council’s legal advice. I heard Mr Dalli give many answers to our questions, but I did not hear an answer to that question, even though it is a crucial one. Is this perhaps a matter of a lack of consensus within the Commission, as Mr Dalli is in the Commission as the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy, while Mr De Gucht, by all accounts, came out with false arguments that were invalidated by a Council document. I would like to hear from the Commissioner what his view on this is.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the economic crisis has had an effect on Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, there are the new Basel rules that are now to be implemented in the forthcoming Capital Requirements Directive. This will probably make it even more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to obtain capital for the growth that Europe needs. In this resolution, the European Parliament is sending a clear signal to the Commission that it is now that the necessary decisions need to be taken to benefit our small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="da">Now it is true that politicians should not be running businesses, but they should be involved in creating the fertile soil in which Europe’s businesses can grow. I am pleased that we will now have a revision of the Small Business Act. We must take relevant action instead of merely toasting our European enterprises. There is an urgent need for better access to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. There is also a need for enhanced market access, including the modernisation of the standardisation system within the EU, and for better access for small and medium-sized enterprises to public procurement opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, I would like to mention that we need to reduce our enterprises’ administrative burden, in connection with reporting, for example. Why should small business owners have to submit a report more than once? Once should be enough. The public authorities should deal with the further distribution of the information themselves. We must consider the fact that, when we produce new legislation in the EU and get it implemented in the Member States, we often impose even more burdens on our small and medium-sized enterprises. It is therefore not enough simply to reduce the number. We must also ensure, every time we produce legislation, that we do not create additional burdens for small and medium-sized enterprises. Overall, we need to make it easier for businesses to operate in Europe and we need to act now.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, I beg your pardon. I glanced up at the public gallery for an instant as I have the good fortune that a visiting group from Hungary also happens to be present right now.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Small Business Act has become incorporated into European thinking in recent times. Based on the practical experience of the last two years, now is the time to review, update and strengthen the Small Business Act. We, the posers of the question, have summarised the most important issues in 34 points in the proposal for a decision. I would like to mention a few of these.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Implementation is very important. The Member States have done their work with different degrees of efficiency and commitment with consequent success. We would like a single database and results table to measure success and excesses.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Commissioner, in our view, the aim is not to infringe employees’ rights in any way but to create jobs. Reducing administration is not the same as infringing upon employees’ rights, but rather the opportunity must be created for micro and small enterprises to cooperate.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As regards access to financial resources, it is very important that the use of funds available at European Union level be more efficient. We have achieved 75% efficiency until now and roughly 50 000 SMEs have received funds in this way. At the same time, approximately 300 000 SMEs have managed to access funding under the competitiveness and innovation programme. We must definitely strengthen and preserve this.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is very important that the institutional network helps small and medium-sized enterprises. For this reason, the European Enterprise Network must be strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We would very much like to find a solution that allows the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs to continue. We would like all the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises to be able to hire at least one more employee. In this way, we could make a significant contribution to improving the labour market situation. However, it is highly important that the labour force working for small and medium-sized enterprises be better qualified than at present. It is especially important that they can take part in the implementation of the Green Economy programme and obtain digital skills. The most important thing for us is that young entrepreneurs with small and medium-sized businesses should not regard different forms of enterprise as losers but as winners.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Small Business Act was given a warm welcome by SMEs, but that was two years ago. It is really important that we now show small businesses that this was not just a piece of paper.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of administrative burden, the target should not be a once-off which we reach and then abandon. It is something we have to keep working on. I am particularly concerned about the situation that micro-businesses find themselves in. It is all right – or it is relatively all right – for a small business of 249 employees that has specialist administrative staff but, for a micro-business with one or two staff, over-regulation can actually make trading impossible. We should not forget that micro-businesses of less than 10 employees actually make up over 90% of all EU businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">Micro-businesses really need to be treated like family units and, in particular, the EU and its Member States need to work together to look at how small businesses can be given upfront support for energy efficiency improvements. Indeed, the broader question of finance for SMEs is vital.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just before Easter, a number of MEPs from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy went to California to see how investment works in Silicon Valley. What we discovered was that venture capital was much more available than in Europe, and that those who provided it were much more risk-taking in their approach. Californian venture capitalists expect nine out of ten investments to fail. The one in ten which succeeds pays for all the rest, but the motto is ‘fail fast’. There is much we can learn about how we could better support our own innovative small businesses in Europe. Perhaps not least, we should not stigmatise failure but rather use it as a step to success.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is a fundamental paradox in EU policy on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). On the one hand, there is almost unanimous support for their importance to the economy, to employment, wealth creation, innovation and flexibility, and their overall sheer size within the economy. If positive rhetoric could be converted into orders and cash in the bank, then the Union’s SMEs would be in great shape. However, the big challenge – which is addressed in this resolution – is how to convert warm words into useful deeds without just throwing money at SMEs – money that is not available in today’s economy. On the other hand, the EU combines this positive sentiment with plenty of legislation on employment protection and environmental requirements: legislation which is well-intentioned but all of which bears most heavily on SMEs, increasing the administrative burden on small business when we should be reducing it.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many constructive suggestions in this resolution. I particularly like the proposal for combating the practice known in my country as ‘gold plating’, whereby national authorities add layers of regulation to European measures. My personal view, as one who worked in a small business for 25 years, is that actually, while it would be nice to reduce this burden of administration, the best we can do for small businesses is to improve access to information and to finance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it does not happen every day in Parliament that Members of six different political groups table a joint question which leads to a debate. Today, we have a case of this kind and it is no coincidence that it concerns the role of small and medium-sized businesses. This is a commonly held and broad-based concern.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of the questions we are asking is: What is the Commission doing to further strengthen the particularly successful financial instruments in future for small and medium-sized companies? One of these successful instruments is the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP). What will happen to CIP when the common strategic framework for research and innovation is developed? What opportunities will there be for small and medium-sized enterprises in this context?</p>
      <p sl="de">It will definitely not be possible to make the concept of innovation so broad and far-reaching that it covers all the relevant activities and all small and medium-sized businesses. However, we must not make the mistake of only promoting the competitiveness of those small and medium-sized firms which have been identified as being particularly innovative. Therefore, I believe that it is very important for the right decisions to be made in the common strategic framework.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to mention specifically that this also concerns the issue of the criteria on which simplification and the reduction of red tape are based. CIP is already much less bureaucratic than the Seventh Framework Programme. It would not be sensible to apply the standards of the Seventh Framework Programme in the case of small and medium-sized companies. We need to find a practical way of continuing the measures which have been good for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, in programmes such as CIP, so that these activities do not fall by the wayside during the course of a reorganisation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleagues on their contribution to this very useful resolution and to state that I agree with all that has been said so far. Nevertheless, I have made some amendments on a couple of issues which I feel could be constructive and useful contributions to the final text.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, there is no mention in the text of the effects of illegal trade on small businesses. Unfortunately, in this day and age, illegal trade is a reality and a phenomenon which is growing in all Member States. To put it simply, illegal trade is one of the biggest obstacles to the emergence and growth of Europe’s small businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second comment concerns the Commission’s ‘second chance’ initiative for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In these times of economic difficulty especially, it is important to support SMEs and help them to develop.</p>
      <p sl="en">This leads me to my last point. I think it is regrettable that few of our innovative SMEs grow into larger companies and that there are fewer young, R&amp;D-intensive, innovative firms in the EU than in the USA. Significant shortages in innovation-related skills prevent SMEs from adopting innovative smart business models and new technologies. This is an issue we must address, and we must cultivate in Europe the risk-taking spirit that exists in the USA among the young generation of Americans.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I am grateful to Parliament for the interest shown in the Small Business Act and the opportunity afforded by this especially to discuss what action we should take with regard to the different initiatives mentioned in relation to the review of the Small Business Act.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Small Business Act is a very important tool which helps us create a more favourable business environment for small and medium-sized enterprises. Small and medium-sized enterprises make a major contribution to the European economy as the vast majority of companies belong to this category and they provide jobs for over 90 million people throughout Europe. For this reason, the full implementation of the policy for small and medium-sized enterprises and, in particular, the Small Business Act, is a high priority task for the Hungarian Presidency. The success of our competitiveness strategy depends on how our policy initiatives affect small and medium-sized enterprises. One of the keys to future growth is that highly competitive and innovative small and medium-sized enterprises should operate in Europe. Accordingly, the Council welcomes with great pleasure the Commission’s communication on the review of the Small Business Act, which was published on 23 February 2011. In the communication, the Commission suggests various new initiatives in several priority areas for further action to be taken. These initiatives were created as the result of wide-ranging consultations with associations of small and medium-sized enterprises and the relevant authorities. Thus, they duly bear in mind the interests of both the enterprises themselves and other stakeholders.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Commission’s communication was discussed at the informal meeting of competitiveness ministers in Gödöllő in Hungary on 13 April 2011. At these talks, the ministers fully supported the Presidency’s opinion that the four main issues to be handled as priorities are smart regulation, financing, internationalisation and governance. More work is needed to enable us to make progress in these issues. At the same time, it is the Presidency’s firm intention to maintain the impetus of the process at the meeting of the Competitiveness Council to be held on 31 May 2011, which will also consider the mid-term review of the Small Business Act. At the aforementioned meeting, the Presidency would like the Council to adopt conclusions in which the ‘think small first’ principle is applied in particular, that is to say, the principle which the Commission’s communication is based on.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As regards the status of the European private company, the European Commission first made a recommendation on the subject in a Council draft regulation in 2008. The idea behind the proposal was to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to do business in the single market, and this must result in reducing costs and increased economic growth. Some concerns arose in the Council about certain aspects and parts of the proposal. Despite the commendable efforts of the Swedish and Belgian presidencies, the Member States have not managed to reach agreement to this day. I can assure the honourable Members that the Hungarian Presidency is striving to find the way to progress with regard to the particularly problematic issues of this proposal and will continue to do all it can to bring the matter to a successful conclusion.</p>

    <intervention id="3-530-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, many thanks to the honourable Members for this important oral question and your debate. I will respond to the question on behalf of my colleague, Vice-President Antonio Tajani.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, small and medium-sized enterprises account for 99% of all European enterprises and generate most of the value-added of the real economy and create two-thirds of the jobs in the private sector. The EU is relying on SMEs and is creating the conditions under which they can develop and grow in order to create jobs in competitive markets. SMEs need less red tape, easier access to finance green markets and skills that match the needs of the real economy. These are the principles behind our SME policy as presented in the review of the Small Business Act for Europe. I will outline five avenues of work in the frame of your five questions in the oral question in my response on behalf of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the review, the Commission invites the Member States to systematically assess the impact of the legislation on SMEs by using the SME test. The European Parliament and the Commission are working together on a study of the application of the SME test in the Member States and at European level. The Commission will use this test as a basis for planning additional measures to support implementation and the exchange of best practice. We are also currently completing a study on the problems associated with licensing and official authorisation, company transfer and bankruptcy procedures in the Member States. The study will enable the Commission and, in particular, the Member States, to plan appropriate measures for applying the ‘think small first’ principle to administrative services. This will be made possible in particular by expanding online administration and the one-stop shop in line with the recommendations made in the review.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, a new system of governance will be introduced. The Commission has invited the Member States to appoint a SME representative – ‘Ms or Mr SME’ – to monitor the implementation of the SBA at national level. The national representatives will be members of a consultative group for the SBA which will help to assess and disseminate information concerning the measures taken to support SMEs. They will meet for the first time at the SBA Conference in Budapest on 24 and 25 May this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, SMEs are intended to be the main beneficiaries of the European programme to reduce the administrative burden. The Commission has submitted to the Council and the EP proposals for reducing administrative costs very substantially – by up to over 30% when they are implemented – while the proposals already adopted will reduce administrative costs by 22%.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is relying on the Parliament to ensure that our proposals are adopted as soon as possible. Certain proposals, such as the review of the Fourth Accounting Directive, will benefit SMEs in particular. When it has been adopted by the Council and Parliament, the review of the Fourth Accounting Directive will enable Member States to exempt very small enterprises from certain accounting obligations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, the SBA has also created a framework to enable SMEs to take up the challenge of energy efficiency by improving their energy management and seizing the opportunities presented by the environmental market. The action plan to encourage eco-innovation will also be implemented, paying particular attention to SMEs by promoting networking, low carbon technologies and efficient management of the use of resources. We will also continue developing action specifically devoted to environment and energy experts within the Enterprise Europe network.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, as part of the flagship initiative on the Agenda for new skills and jobs, the Commission will assess future skills needs in micro- and craft-type enterprises. An initial study on identification of future skills requirements in micro- and craft-type enterprises up to 2020 has just been published. It identifies the actions which need to be taken to meet future skills requirements, promote them more effectively and include them more systematically in training programmes for both micro-enterprises and craft-type enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, today, we find ourselves discussing in this House a joint proposal for a resolution on the revision of the Small Business Act, which the Commission submitted in February.</p>
      <p sl="es">The relationship between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the economy can be defined in many ways, but in a sense, they are the axis around which any economic system revolves, in this case, the European economies. If they are strong, the economy will do well; if they are weak, the economy will do badly. SMEs generate jobs, growth and, accordingly, prosperity for society.</p>
      <p sl="es">I shall refer to three factors that seem to me to be fundamental to achieving a strong network of enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="es">First, the adoption of information and communication technology and the development of technologies such as online administration or cloud computing, which save money, reduce costs and effort and, therefore, improve the competitiveness of SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="es">Second, innovation, which is equally fundamental in this sector. Accordingly, up-and-coming enterprises in the small and medium-sized business sector must be strongly incentivised.</p>
      <p sl="es">Third, SMEs must be able to participate fully in the internal market, both in terms of cross-border public tendering and as regards all other features of the internal market, which are capable of providing extraordinary benefits to SMEs in terms of their competitiveness but are currently failing to do so.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, after all this comes the value of entrepreneurship, a social value which must be strong since, if it is not, the whole network will be weak. In this area, both governments and the European Union have much to do, principally through education.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, certainly, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have the advantage of being flexible and agile and close to the customer, which enables them to make decisions much more quickly. These are very important characteristics in times of crisis, when the ability to respond quickly is vital.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, as we well know, they make up more than 90% of the fabric of our business sector and they are a valuable model that we must maintain, because the effects of a large business failing or relocating are much more devastating, above all, in employment terms.</p>
      <p sl="es">For that reason, we, and governments in particular, cannot afford to throw a spanner in the works of these businesses. For that reason, we approved the Small Business Act and, for that reason also, exercises such as this one are vital to the continuing progress of Member States in applying the political and legislative measures that we have agreed.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, European SMEs urgently need the firm political will to improve their access to public tenders that is contained in the Small Business Act to be converted into real, tangible, operative measures.</p>
      <p sl="es">We applaud the measures that some Member States have taken, such as dividing tenders into lots and improving electronic access to information from centralised websites and interactive web pages, but we do not think that this is sufficient.</p>
      <p sl="es">From this House, we must insist that those responsible for public procurement within the various administrative bodies incorporate terms into their tender specifications that facilitate positive discrimination in favour of SMEs and remove contractual provisions that hinder their participation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Rehn, the joint question on the review of the Small Business Act shows that there is still a great deal to be done to ensure that medium-sized companies in Europe have freedom to act, particularly on a national level. However, I am pleased that in recent years, we have succeeded in implementing almost all the provisions of the Small Business Act in the European Union. Most recently, a new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions came into force in March, which will make an important contribution to improving payment practice in Europe. Now the Member States have two years to implement the new directive. I would like to call for this timeframe to be shortened, in particular, in the Member States where this would not present a significant problem. Instead of delaying implementation for two years, it could be completed, where possible, within one year.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Member States have not yet been able to agree on the statute for a European private company. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Hungarian Presidency is following up this issue and making it one of the focal points of its work. This form of company in particular could enable small and medium-sized enterprises to save a great deal of money. I am thinking, in particular, of accounting, establishing a company and ongoing legal advice. Therefore, I would like to say again how pleased I am that the Hungarian Presidency is focusing on this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">The issue just mentioned by Mrs Riera Madurell is also important, and that is public procurement. Here, we can still achieve a great deal for small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many bureaucratic regulations in this area and it is often particularly difficult for small and medium-sized businesses to take part in the public procurement process. We need greater transparency and we must also try to make the most of the opportunities presented by the modern media and, in particular, the Internet.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Small Business Act is precisely what we, as politicians and legislators, should be focusing on as we look for ways of fostering new growth and re-energising our economies.</p>
      <p sl="en">SMEs make up more than 98% of the businesses in my rural constituency of Wales. As public sector jobs in the UK as a whole are becoming less certain, and more of my constituents are, I hope, going to be either setting up or working for small businesses, I fully support and endorse the ambitious targets for reducing the administrative burden on SMEs, and goals such as the SME test for all legislation. Coupled with the ‘one in, one out’ policy for regulation that my own government is operating, these measures should begin to achieve our objective.</p>
      <p sl="en">But now is the time to be bold, to be more ambitious and to achieve more. I have seen so much creativity in Wales, as it develops into a hub of activity for new businesses in the highly profitable global gaming world and a centre for cultural excellence with regard to film and programme production, yet I find myself asking questions about how to foster and encourage this development. Big projects like the European patent and the Digital Agenda need to deliver for these small businesses, providing jobs and a future for people in Wales and the whole of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this review’s 10 principles include helping SMEs to benefit from opportunities of the single market, but the eurozone is collapsing, so how can it provide more opportunities? It also wants SMEs to benefit from the growth in markets. What growth? In September 2009, I asked Commissioner Andor what specific measures he would introduce to assist SMEs, following my similar request of him when he spoke to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on taking up the portfolio. I got no answers then, but now it seems I have some.</p>
      <p sl="en">The review’s five guidelines to reduce pressure on SMEs include simplifying the rules on VAT and reducing the rates, and a directive on late payments, but that is just tinkering with existing rules and regulations. The first principle of the review – creating a right environment – should not mean proposing new rules such as European private companies and state aids. It should mean ripping rules out by the hundred. After all, Commission President Barroso said in this House in July last year: ‘red tape is strangling SMEs’.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, legislation which is too complex or unintelligible, which is too strict, or which does not keep up with the latest changes, is obviously not conducive to development or progress. As coordinator of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I would therefore like to draw particular attention to the importance, during the legislative procedure, of observing the principle of including small and medium-sized enterprises in ex ante and post ante impact assessments. This would make it possible, as early as during the law making process, to identify and eliminate obstacles which may be posed by new regulations for a sector which, after all, is the flywheel of the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Similarly, complying with the principles of ‘think small first’ and ‘only once’, and limiting the excessively strict transposition of the requirements of EU directives into national regulations, by bodies in the Member States naturally, will result in a noticeable reduction in the administrative burden on the SME sector. Both the Stoiber working group and the review of the Small Business Act presented by the European Commission have confirmed that administrative obstacles and excessive burdens relating to control measures often cause delays, and sometimes even prevent the further expansion of small companies which have the potential to generate new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore also regard it as legitimate to ask whether the analysis promised by the European Commission, concerning a reduction of the administrative burden to 25% of its current level, is available yet. I also agree with the proposals to the effect that both the EU institutions and the Member States should be guided by these principles when creating new legislation or revising existing legislation. It is alarming to learn that implementation of the Small Business Act is coming up against many obstacles in the Member States, although the examples of several countries show that following these principles yields good results.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I should also like to draw your attention to the significance of the ongoing work on European contract law, and the work on the establishment of a European patent protection system which has begun in the Committee on Legal Affairs. There can be no doubt that good regulations in this area will give a direct boost to the development of innovation, particularly as regards the activities and growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, at the end of March 2011, the European Union had an unemployment rate of 9.5%, with a rate of 9.9% in the euro area. What is of even greater concern is that the youth unemployment rate is almost double the unemployment rate for the whole population. Improving the business environment and access to funding, as well as facilitating SMEs’ access to the Structural Funds, will foster the development of an entrepreneurial spirit. SMEs need legislative and fiscal stability. Repeated amendments to tax legislation or changes to the conditions for accessing the various types of funds make it difficult for them to do business. Another issue, especially during times of crisis, is that SMEs are affected by the delay from public institutions in settling their invoices. All these factors affect SMEs’ forecasts for achieving their business plans, as well as their business and, most of all, their innovative capacity.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Between 2006 and 2008, SMEs managed to win just 33% of the total value of public procurement contracts. Given that public procurement contracts account for 17% of the European Union’s GDP, we think that SMEs need to increase their involvement in the public procurement market. This is why we call on the Commission and Member States to take the necessary measures by 2015 to ensure that at least 50% of public procurement transactions are carried out electronically, in keeping with the commitment made by Member State governments in Manchester in 2005.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should point out that the single market is not in operation yet in the services sector, which is having an adverse impact on SMEs’ business activities in the European Union. In 2008, the Commission presented, as part of the European Economic Recovery Plan, the programme which involved the European Investment Bank offering a global package of EUR 30 billion in loans earmarked for SMEs. The EIB intended to supplement the loans for medium-sized businesses with EUR 1 billion a year. I would like to ask the Commission at what stage of implementation this programme is at, whether it intends to top up the funding, and whether these funds are distributed equally to all Member States.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, three million jobs have been lost in comparison with several million euro invested in support policies. That is the disastrous outcome, in terms of impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), first of the triumphal Lisbon project, and then of the ‘photocopy’ Europe 2020 strategy, on which we are even deciding to focus resources from the next multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore cannot but stress what thousands of European citizens and taxpayers are wondering: what use is Europe if it cannot solve the economic problems of the continent, if it cannot speak with a single voice on matters of foreign policy, and if it squanders money? I hope that what Commissioner Tajani has said on several occasions comes true. I hope that the review of the SME code really is able to simplify red tape, ensure access to and recovery of credit, and facilitate internalisation.</p>
      <p sl="it">With the Late Payments Directive, we have reached a real, concrete goal, but as a result of political will and not Europropaganda. If the costs of the umpteenth strategy will still only finance talk, I call on the European institutions to make amends to the dozens of small entrepreneurs in my region, Veneto, who have taken their lives rather than see their small businesses fail.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, Commissioner, parents very often pay attention to the child that cries the loudest, although in truth, attention ought to be paid to another child entirely. Similarly, politicians and the press pay attention most often to large companies, which have a lot of money, which have a big voice, although attention ought rather to be paid to others, that is to say, small enterprises. For us in Europe, large enterprises are like large trees, but these large trees do not make up the whole enterprise wood. A few figures. Over 90% of enterprises in the whole of Europe are small and medium-sized, not large. Approximately three quarters of all those in employment work in small and medium-sized enterprises, which produce the same proportion of Europe’s gross domestic product. The time has come for us to switch our attention from large enterprises, which are loud, I should not like to say – like children – but they are loud, and pay attention to the quieter ones, most of whom work after all with the small ones. In this context, then, Commissioner, I call upon you to pay greater attention to your own Commission’s commitment to reduce the administrative burden for small and medium-sized enterprises. You can do this by evaluating your legislation, and not by introducing regulations that make the administrative burden more costly. By supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, we shall be acting more swiftly to encourage economic growth throughout the European Union. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, the Small Business Act adopted in 2008 was supposed to give impetus to the development of small business and the improvement of business conditions in Europe. A lot has been done to improve the business environment and simplify administrative requirements, such as the E-Invoicing Directive and the Late Payments Directive. However, this is not enough. Today, we can see that the outcomes are not what small business expected.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The main priorities, such as financing and simplifying regulatory systems for improving the business environment, have not been implemented in a systematic or consistent manner. Meanwhile, the business environment varies greatly across the Member States. The different legal regimes covering the protection of consumer rights, which still remain, reduce consumer confidence in the single market and do not encourage companies to expand their business in other Member States. Essentially, this prevents the creation of an internal market in the European Union that is more geared towards and favourable to small business.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is precisely small business that has been worst hit by the economic and financial crisis. We see companies going bankrupt or with a huge debt burden. We did provide for measures to help them, but sadly, they have not always been successful. The European Progress Microfinance Facility set up by the Commission really was a very appropriate step for providing small business with opportunities to obtain financing during the crisis. However, as various studies have shown, instead of providing business with loans, the national banks in some Member States have tightened lending conditions even more.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The European Investment Bank, which administered these loans for two years, generally did not have information on the implementation of these instruments. This gives rise to the question: why do we need such an intermediary at all? The clear conclusion is that in future, the Commission must take responsibility for overseeing the implementation of such important initiatives in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Hopefully, the revision of the Small Business Act will help us to understand and evaluate where we should increase our efforts so that we can establish an environment that works better for small business.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the work currently being carried out on the review of the Small Business Act should concentrate, in particular, on establishing a European Private Company Statute, thus facilitating the cross-border operations of economic entities in the EU market. Although the time taken to set up a company has dropped in recent months, an analysis carried out by the European Commission has showed that over half of Member States still do not meet the requirement for it to be possible to do so in three days. Furthermore, the majority of Member States are still not carrying out assessments of the impact of future legislative and administrative initiatives on SMEs, and the ‘only once’ principle is also not being applied in full.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Over the past two years, the list of countries in which it has been possible to close down a business entirely within a year has remained the same. I would therefore suggest that the European Commission should become even more involved in efforts to ensure that the Member States implement these provisions. In addition, I believe that further measures under the Small Business Act should also cover improved availability of funding, access to risk capital markets and the development of points of single contact in the Member States to facilitate administrative procedures.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is worth pointing out that in order to achieve our objective of an employment level of 75%, as enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy, it is imperative to support SMEs. As a result of the economic crisis, these SMEs are feeling the strain of a series of additional expenses, instead of generating jobs.</p>

This means that the measures presented need to be implemented quickly, in their entirety, especially the ‘think small first’ principle. I think that particular attention must be focused on supporting large-scale funding for innovative companies. According to the Commission’s assessment, Romania is a model of good practice in applying the principle of ‘promoting entrepreneurship through the Start business programme’. The programme has a budget of EUR 21.2 million and is aimed at developing management skills among young people.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I want to start by welcoming the European Commission’s proposals for reviewing the Small Business Act for Europe. In practical terms, the European Commission notes in its communication of 23 February 2011 the quite significant progress which has been made since the Small Business Act was adopted in June 2008, but warns about the challenges remaining. Therefore, SMEs still have problems in expanding their activities, improving their innovative capacity, accessing markets and obtaining funding, and face excessive red tape. In most cases, when it comes to transposing the directives into national legislation, the bureaucratic requirements laid down by the European Union are actually exceeded. In order to ensure greater transparency, each Member State should produce tables comparing national bureaucratic measures with those required by EU directives. An assessment also needs to be made of the impact which the new EU legislative proposals could have on SMEs.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, more than two years have passed since the adoption of the Small Business Act initiative, and it is therefore right and proper that in February, the Commission issued a notification of the review of this initiative. It seems that our efforts to promote a more favourable legislative environment for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have so far failed to make a sufficient impression in the business sector itself. On the basis of discussions with representatives of organisations representing SMEs, the Commission has therefore prepared further measures through which we can help to improve their situation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, we must, above all, focus more on implementing the new rules in national legislation. The experience from my own country shows me that national bureaucracies are unbelievably obstructive, and stubbornly resist all changes that would limit their ability to victimise small businesses. I therefore believe we must persevere with the simplification of rules for SMEs patiently and rigorously, and trust that our efforts will somehow bring the expected result.</p>

      <p sl="de">However, some bureaucratic obstacles remain in place, for example, as far as cash flow is concerned. We need to evaluate to what extent the Basel criteria could cause a serious credit crunch for small and medium-sized enterprises. As far as the cross-border area is concerned, we should finally get the European private company under way. From the perspective of the cost-benefit factor, this form of company could, in future, be more important than the European company. I am thinking in this respect of subsidiaries and transfers of registered offices throughout Europe.</p>

I believe it is important for the European Union to have a better overview of how the governments of the Member States implement the Small Business Act. The mid-term review is also important because the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises – the difficulties of obtaining funding, the size of administrative burdens, overregulation and market access problems – appear to be becoming permanent.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I think it is a good idea as well to enable small enterprises to register themselves as European private companies, thereby reducing the administrative burdens and, at the same time, realising smart regulation is an extremely timely issue. A high priority in this is spreading the ‘only once’ principle across Europe and examining whether the regulatory framework of certain policy areas is as it should be and, if it is not, what changes are required.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am pleased to say that our new government yesterday announced measures to help SMEs which were broadly welcomed by the business community today – measures relating to VAT, PRSI, travel tax and internships. At European level, it is essential that we tackle fraud in particular. The black market economy is thriving and needs to be tackled on a European-wide basis.

In the economic fabric of Italy, small and medium-sized enterprises represent a major and essential part of the production market.</p>
      <p sl="it">They are even more important in southern Italy, where I come from, because the whole productive fabric is organised around small and medium-sized enterprises. In the past, entire industrial areas were teeming with small businesses that guaranteed thousands of jobs. Today, many of those businesses have gone bankrupt or closed, not least because of unfair competition, as the students from Barletta who are here today are well aware.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ‘Action here and now!’ Mr Bendtsen said, and I strongly agree with his standpoint. We have heard that small and medium-sized enterprises are also major employers in the European Union and, after the economic crisis, examining and reviewing how we may be able to help them recover is especially important. The Hungarian Presidency believes in a work-based economy and society, and regards small and medium-sized enterprises to be among its key partners in this. The economic environment has changed dramatically since 2008; hence, a review really is needed. For our part, too, we welcome the six-party agreement which Mr Bütikofer mentioned, and we are also grateful that several speakers acknowledged the Hungarian Presidency’s endeavours and that the Hungarian Presidency is handling this issue truly as a priority.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Allow me to draw your attention to a few specific matters. After listening attentively to the Members, we are pleased to say that there is indeed complete agreement on the principles. The small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of European economic growth and employment. Therefore, improving the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises is a priority for the Council as well. To this end, and to reflect this, the Competitiveness Council is preparing to adopt the Council’s conclusions at its previously mentioned meeting on 30-31 May 2011, about which the Presidency is submitting a draft to the Council. The main elements of this intend to give answers to the problems identified as the result of the review of the Small Business Act. What are these? These are better access to loans and market access, both in European and global terms, as well as enhancing the conditions of market access and alleviating administrative burdens.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Council believes that the transposition as soon as possible of the Late Payments Directive – which, as you are aware, has been adopted – is important, and this we note with pleasure. The Council is striving to achieve this and is encouraging Member States to do so because it would be a great weight off the shoulders of small and medium-sized enterprises and would greatly improve their liquidity. It is also a pleasure for me to announce that the Council is close to reaching an agreement on the Commission’s aims to reduce the costs of establishing a business. The essence of this is to be able to start up an enterprise in at most three days, for the cost of at most EUR 100, and for licences to be obtainable in under a month.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There are two other specific matters I wish to mention. One is the issue of the European patent. 23 Member States have already joined the enhanced cooperation and the Council is discussing the basic regulation now. We regard this as a major breakthrough from the aspect of EU competitiveness and, in particular, the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises. Mr Creutzmann wished to know about the matter of the European private limited company and asked it to be handled as a priority. We have made significant progress. Now only a very small group of Member States have not joined the consensus. The adoption of this would truly be a turning point for small and medium-sized enterprises, thus we are working on it very hard and also trust that Members will be able to exercise some sort of political pressure and motivate through their own channels in order to generate the necessary majority. We have talked about this to the eminent representatives of the Committee on Legal Affairs as allies on several occasions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Lastly, allow me to mention the connection with the Europe 2020 strategy. Here, we believe that it is important to convert the objectives stated in the strategy into laws, actions and measures which improve the position of small and medium-sized enterprises, but, of course, the Member States must also do their own homework. The European framework in itself is not enough; thus, for example, we believe that tax systems need to be simplified and to be made friendlier for small and medium-sized enterprises. Several Member States are acting in this spirit. Among them is Hungary, currently holding the Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Single Market Act has placed a strong emphasis on supporting SMEs. A large number of the measures proposed, such as the review of the accounting directives, cutting red tape, improving access to the capital and public procurement markets, etc. feature in this communication.</p>

Commissioner Rehn reported this evening that it has succeeded in reducing the cost of doing business by 22% in some areas and will continue to concentrate on this initiative.

      <p sl="ro">SMEs encounter difficulties in obtaining access to funding and the market. The future MFF must provide measures for overcoming these difficulties. Increased support is needed for financial programmes and instruments which are already operating successfully, but have turned out to be inadequate, such as the competitiveness and innovation programme. Access to financial support must be improved for new innovative businesses in the form of start-up funds. Setting up a European capital risk fund and expanding the permanent risk-sharing products offered by the European Investment Bank through the Risk Sharing Financial Facility will also benefit SMEs. On the issue of SMEs having access to the market, I call on the Commission to propose a plan for introducing and selling innovative products on the market. Furthermore, a set of measures is required to support SMEs in implementing the new energy efficiency plan.</p>

      <p sl="el">I welcome this initiative by Parliament because the broad consent between the political groups to initiate a debate on small and medium-sized enterprises illustrates their crucial role as a driving force for growth in the EU. The recession is making it even more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to raise capital. Their access to the markets, to financing and to information urgently needs to be improved. We need to limit the administrative burden by simplifying the regulatory environment. At European level, it is important to combat the black market economy and to give small and medium-sized enterprises incentives. The Commission recently announced 12 actions for 2012 to stimulate the single market, including measures for funding for SMEs and worker mobility, measures which I believe are a move in the right direction By making integrated use of the single market and exploiting the advantages which it offers, we can strengthen growth and prosperity at European level and give new momentum to enterprise. Measures such as a European patent and the European professional identity card must be strengthened and applied widely in order to strengthen competitiveness and employment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the lifeblood of our economic activity. Their development, their modernisation, and their competitiveness must be at the heart of our economic strategy. I therefore welcome the review of the Small Business Act proposed by the Commission, which seeks to unblock the growth potential of SMEs. A great deal still needs to be done to simplify the regulatory environment and bureaucratic procedures, which place heavy constraints on the activity and dynamism of our enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, I support the creation of a European Private Company Statute, which would help our SMEs to take full advantage of the single European market by enabling them to carry on their cross-border activities without having to fulfil often onerous and discouraging obligations. I therefore call on the Council to take a swift decision on this initiative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we must support innovative SMEs by giving them better access to diversified financing, involving, in particular, a substantial simplification of the use of European appropriations, which still lack flexibility. These appropriations are already available and they must, in my opinion, be mobilised to provide more effective support to the development of the real economy, innovation and employment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I fully understand the significant interest in this Parliament in the actions being undertaken within the Union and beyond to tackle the challenges which some Member States are facing in relation to their public finances.</p>
      <p sl="en">The global financial crisis has had a significant impact on both revenues and expenditure in all our countries, even if the extent and nature of that impact is not the same in all cases and the capacity of individual Member States to handle the consequences is also very different.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first thing I would like to stress is that it is the Member States themselves which are, first and foremost, responsible for ensuring that their public finances are sustainable and on a sound footing. Similarly, it is for each one of them to ensure that their economies are competitive, flexible and resilient. Of course, that does not mean that public finances and economic performance are not also a matter of collective interest.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are part of a Union, and our economies are interlinked in a number of ways: through the single market and, in many cases, through the sharing of the common currency and the deeper economic integration which that implies. More generally, we all have a commitment of solidarity towards each other, based on a desire to protect and promote the wider European interest. What that means is that we all want to see a stable and strong economy across the EU as a whole and, within it, of the euro area in particular. Where necessary, this has to involve taking steps to ensure the stability of individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a number of tools at our disposal to do this. We have the coordination mechanism that seeks to ensure that appropriate economic and budgetary policies are pursued by each and every Member State. These are being updated and reinforced, and I am pleased that negotiations between the Council and Parliament are advancing well. We also have access to the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which can offer support at EU level to any Member State, whether inside or outside the eurozone.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, and for the eurozone countries specifically, further instruments have been set up and are continuing to be developed. Greece has received a package of coordinated bilateral loans from Member States as well as a loan from the IMF. Ireland has received a package consisting of bilateral loans, a loan from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and also a loan from the IMF. The support package for Portugal, which will also draw on both European and IMF support, is also being prepared.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ministers of the eurozone Member States are also finalising the technical details of the European Stability Mechanism, which is due to take effect from 2013 as a permanent financial support mechanism to replace the European Financial Stability Facility. Non-eurozone Member States are also participating in this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would now like to turn briefly to the situation in the three eurozone countries to which I have already referred. I should, however, mention that, from the outset, many of the issues in relation to these Member States are discussed outside the regular Ecofin format, reflecting their specific characteristics as members of the eurozone. The chair of the Euro Group would be better able than I to give you further details on many of these points.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, Ireland. Following the agreement last December of an overall EUR 85 billion assistance programme for Ireland, the Irish authorities have undertaken a great deal of work to implement the adjustment programme to which the financial support was attached. This programme has been kept under constant review by the new government. The Ecofin Council will review compliance with the programme for the first quarter at its meeting on 17 May, next Tuesday. I cannot say much in advance about that discussion, but the overall assessment is likely to be that Ireland’s performance is in line with expectations.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, some specific challenges remain. Ireland will, in particular, need to stick to the powerful fiscal adjustment as well as ensure that its financial sector is on a stable footing for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, Greece. Greece has come a long way since the very difficult situation last year, and its efforts should be commended. It has been faced with a daunting challenge and has demonstrated unwavering commitment and clarity of purpose. The adjustment programme is broadly on track. The latest implementation report, drafted jointly by the Commission, the IMF and the ECB in March, concluded that the programme has made further progress towards its objectives. Some of the reforms needed to deliver the programme’s medium-term objectives are being put in place. The report also identifies further areas where reforms are required in order to build the critical mass necessary to ensure fiscal sustainability and economic recovery. The Commission, the ECB and the IMF continue to monitor progress on the implementation of the adjustment programme closely. The next review is scheduled for this month.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Member States participating in the bilateral loan agreed in March to reduce the interest rate by 1% and to extent the maturity of the loan. This is also a positive development. The technical details of the implementation of this agreement are currently under discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Portugal. On 6 April, the Portuguese caretaker government announced its intention to seek financial assistance from the European Union. This followed a period of intense pressure from the financial markets. However, Portugal was also going through a period of political uncertainty which, as we know, led to the resignation of the government on 24 March. The Portuguese Parliament had previously rejected the new fiscal conciliation package proposed by the government. Negotiations between the Troika and the Portuguese authorities have now been finalised and the memorandum of understanding on the policy conditions attached to the financial assistance is being agreed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The financial envelope will be around EUR 78 billion covering a three-year period. In line with recommendations by the Ecofin Ministers at the informal Ecofin in Budapest in April, the programme covers reform in a number of areas, including public finance, labour and product markets and the financial sector. We consider that such measures are essential for growth potential and increased economic stability. Endorsement of the final financial package is also expected at next week’s Ecofin Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is only a brief overview of the measures being taken to address the impact of the global financial crisis on the EU and on three Member States in particular. As I said at the outset, the Hungarian Presidency is not directly involved in all of the detailed negotiations, some of which were more specifically within the remit of the Euro Group.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Presidency is, however, committed to doing its part to assist in ensuring that all necessary measures are in place in order to address the current problems. We consider that this is essential if we are to boost Europe’s competitiveness in the longer term and, in so doing, deliver the strong role which Europe as a whole needs.</p>

    <intervention id="3-560-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, Europe’s economic outlook today is quite dualistic. On the one hand, the recovery in the real economy has taken hold and is becoming more solid and self-sustaining. On the other hand, it is uneven and we still face turbulence in the financial markets, especially in the sovereign debt markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thus, the key task of the EU’s economic policy now is to contain the sovereign debt crisis and thus protect the ongoing recovery in the real economy of Europe. Now, with the EU-IMF programme of Portugal waiting for its adoption next Monday in the Eurogroup Ecofin meeting, we are beginning another chapter in this necessary endeavour.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week, the Portuguese Government presented an economic reform programme following our productive negotiations with the government, the opposition, civil society, social partners and the academic world. These talks are reflected in the programme. It is a Portuguese programme that deserves the support of the European Union and of the International Monetary Fund. Our joint assistance of EUR 78 billion shows the strong commitment to help Portugal and safeguard the financial stability of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a demanding but fair and necessary programme of adjustment. It will require major efforts on the part of the Portuguese people. Great attention has been paid in its preparation to social fairness and protecting the vulnerable. Europe stands by Portugal for the sake of the country and for the sake of economic stability in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Considering recent developments, it would be wrong to say that the debt crisis is no longer a burden for the European economy, yet it would be equally wrong to claim that the EU has not responded to the crisis. Consider this: only a year ago, the euro area Member States agreed on a conditional loan package to Greece in order to prevent a meltdown of our financial system. Within this one year, from last May until today, we have created effective stability mechanisms which were at first temporary and which will then become permanent as of 2013. We are implementing a very systematic programme of fiscal consolidation in all Member States, and they are committed to bold structural reforms to boost growth and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are, with your active support, addressing the systemic weaknesses in EU economic governance in order to prepare for a profound change in the policy making landscape of the European Union. We are, again with your support, addressing the shortcomings of our integrated financial market by toughening financial regulation and implementing the new supervisory architecture.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the present juncture, financial stability is being safeguarded by the EU-IMF stability mechanisms and especially by the actions that the Member States – especially the vulnerable Member States – are themselves taking. Still some people argue that the crisis management strategy, especially with regard to Greece, is failing. I disagree with this view. The first – and the primary – objective of our strategy has been to prevent another cardiac arrest of the kind that followed the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and subsequently led to the financial crisis and economic recession worldwide. We have done that and thus protected the ongoing recovery in the real economy in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we have been able largely to contain the distress in the sovereign debt markets to the three countries in the programme. As seen in the bond spreads, Spain is decoupling from these countries thanks to its determined action on the fiscal, financial and structural fronts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the programmes in both Greece and Ireland are still in the relatively early stages. The Greek programme has been running for one year and its counterpart in Ireland for about five months of the three years of the programme. Both countries are pursuing very ambitious programmes of fiscal consolidation, structural reform and financial repair. Our review mission is currently in Athens with the ECB and the IMF to assess the implementation of the programme and to prepare an updated analysis of the debt sustainability of Greece. The work will be concluded in the coming weeks, which will facilitate well-informed decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In any event, while the fiscal effort of the past year is unprecedented – over 7% of GDP, or EUR 20 billion – it is clear that Greece has to seriously reinforce the implementation of the economic reforms, achieve a breakthrough in the privatisation programme, and then ensure its full implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is absolutely necessary and urgent that the domestic disputes are put aside and cross-party support achieved for the recovery of Greece. It is an illusion to think that there were any real alternatives to the economic reform programme. This is, therefore, a real test of the credibility of the Greek political forces, both government and opposition, and ultimately, of the will of the Greek people.</p>
      <p sl="en">The present stage of the crisis is a closely intertwined combination of sovereign debt crisis and banking sector fragilities. We cannot solve one without solving the other; we must resolve both in parallel. Therefore, the banking sector repair must be completed to safeguard the provision of credit to the real economy, to enterprises, households, individual citizens. A new round of bank stress tests is being conducted. The results will guide the necessary restructuring and recapitalisation of the banking sector. Ahead of the publication of the results, the Member States will need to release their strategies for possible restructuring or recapitalisation of their vulnerable institutions. Such plans should be ready as soon as possible and should include a detailed timeline.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, the fundamental reforms of financial regulation and economic governance in the European Union are profoundly changing the economic and financial architecture of Europe. In the near future, a whole new set of rules will provide the basis for stable, sustainable growth and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, we must continue our work to safeguard financial stability and thus protect economic recovery in Europe, which is the key for sustainable growth and improving employment. This continues to call for very difficult decisions at European and national levels. I trust we all have the wisdom and courage to take such decisions.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to thank the minister, Mr Kármán, and Commissioner Rehn for their explanation, given what we have seen over recent weeks. If confidence in the market is weak, every trace of doubt has direct consequences for those countries that already find themselves in difficult circumstances and thus, for the euro as a whole. Unfortunately, that became apparent last weekend and then it was denied in the press that any secret meeting was taking place, which then has a double whammy effect on the already fragile confidence. I hope that the parties in question learn very quickly from this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, easy choices and pain-free solutions have been out of the question for quite some time. The support measures for Greece, Ireland and Portugal need to be robust in order to restore financial and economic stability. The package must pave the way for sustainable public finances and economic growth. I therefore want to call on the Council and the Commission to look deeper than the funding needs of these countries over the coming year in order to avoid us facing the same problems in a year’s time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is important that decisions be taken in June on an ambitious package of legislation aimed at strengthening economic governance in Europe in order to win back the confidence of the markets and also in order to ensure growth and jobs on behalf of all our citizens and to increase the cohesion of our economies. I therefore want to call on the Council to give its backing to Parliament’s ambition to provide greater accountability and more public debate in this House, greater involvement of the national parliaments, and to put an end to horse-trading in the Council when the Commission’s view is not to its liking. This package must include a strong monetary arm alongside a strong economic arm, including the Europe 2020 strategy to secure the tenability of our social market economy for all 27 Member States. I am thus calling on you to show resolve in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) next week.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, given that it will shortly be one year since the Greek reform programme was agreed, and the fact that the programme for Portugal was announced just yesterday, I think that it is important for us to evaluate where we stand today, what has been done correctly, and where we made mistakes and missed the mark. One year on, therefore, in addition to Greece, another two countries in the euro area, Ireland and Portugal, have taken recourse to the support mechanism, as they are unable to secure the necessary financing on the markets. The peculiarities and different problems of each country are reflected, without doubt, in the different reform programmes which, nonetheless, are underpinned by a basic philosophy: the absolute emphasis on rapid budgetary reform.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, in the case of Greece, Commissioner, despite what has been achieved, as you have repeatedly emphasised, with the 7-point reduction in the primary deficit and a 5% reduction in the overall deficit, the fact that the recession was deeper than forecast in 2010 has resulted in less revenue for the State. So this is a first data point for evaluation, provided that we agree that the target of the programmes is to overcome the budgetary and economic crisis and not to create a culture of punishment leading to euro-scepticism in Europe. The second data point for evaluation is that, despite the efforts being made, the markets are not responding. However, the decisions by the European Union have not only failed to convince the markets; in some cases, they have exacerbated the situation, such as the famous Deauville decision on the involvement of private individuals in the permanent support mechanism to be created in 2013. The conclusion is that any success the budgetary reform programmes may have risks being wiped out by the fear which the markets and rating agencies are still stirring up, even today. We have reached the point over the past few days, with scenarios about restructuring and even bankruptcy and/or the exit of a country from the euro area still doing the rounds, that we are debating things which we would have considered inconceivable until just recently.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner, knowing your attachment to Europe, I believe that you will agree with me that the solutions we are debating today, the way in which we shall manage this crisis, will no doubt be a major chapter in European history. Today, we are creating the conditions in which the epilogue will be written. I believe and hope that we all feel that these are historic times and that the epilogue will not be written in black colours for the future of the European Union and EMU, but will mark a brave and decisive step which will make Europe more cohesive, more united and even stronger.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, my fellow Member just said that a year is a good time to look back over and I can bring news from Finland where it will hopefully be announced this evening that the Finnish Parliament will support the financial rescue package for Portugal. This will hopefully be the case, but we should not start applauding yet. We can hope that it will be the case, and my party certainly supports this move.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I will briefly look at why we in Finland are hesitating right now with regard to whether or not we should support Portugal. One of the reasons is – and I turn here to the Council, and even though I know that the Hungarian Presidency is perhaps not the one to blame, you will have to be the messenger – that difficult decisions are constantly being taken in the form of small partial decisions because we cannot manage to resolve this problem all in one go. It is perhaps not so easy to do this either, and I understand that there is no simple and absolute solution, but the fact that we are constantly forced to take small and difficult partial decisions means that the political patience and the political will in Finland’s Parliament, for example, is beginning to wear thin. Unfortunately, this seems to be the case in other national parliaments, too. This is worrying in view of the fact that we probably have several difficult decisions ahead of us, including with regard to the situation in Greece, and there is a risk that at some stage, we will find ourselves up against a wall. Therefore, the Council probably needs to consider a more ambitious strategy than this partial strategy that you are currently applying. If you do not do so, we will not get ourselves out of this situation. You need a new strategy because the current strategy is not working. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the sovereign debt crisis will not be solved until the banks are sorted out, and you cannot sort out the banks if regulators’ stress tests refuse to admit that the sovereign debt crisis exists. There is also a public confidence crisis. Some countries bailed out their own banks at huge cost to the taxpayers, without any handouts from the EU. I understand why the same public is now asking why they should fund bail-outs in other countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week’s proposals for reform in Portugal had some positive recommendations for improving competitiveness, but the situation in Greece seems dire.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Rehn, first of all, I would like to say that the situation is indeed getting worse, as you have described. In the euro area, the divide between the countries which are showing signs of recovery and those which are in a more precarious position is widening. Also, the cost of supporting the weaker countries is constantly rising.</p>
      <p sl="de">Given this situation, I have some questions for you in your role as Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs. Liabilities between the central banks amounting to more than EUR 400 billion have accumulated in the TARGET2 accounts of the European Central Bank system. This is due to the fact that the banks are still not being adequately financed by the capital market. What is your view of these unplanned liabilities within the euro system?</p>
      <p sl="de">The major problem which is preventing us from making progress with debt restructuring is that the banking system, as Mrs Ford has also said, has not been properly reformed. The proposal for a European restructuring system has been delayed. When will the Commission submit this proposal? As Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, what is your view of this delay? What are you doing to speed things up?</p>
      <p sl="de">It has also become clear, as we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been predicting for a long time, that the measures put in place to support Greece and Portugal will not take effect until the macro-economic conditions in the euro area improve. These countries are still subject to a growing burden of interest. The export and outflow of capital in some of these countries is increasing. There is still a lack of demand among some of the European partners of these countries and among the strong countries in the euro area in particular. Resource and food prices are also rising, at least if you disregard the most recent ups and downs.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition to the bail-out of these countries, and in addition to the financial aid, I would like to know which measures are being taken to relieve the burden of taxes, external demand and interest on these countries from a macro-economic perspective. How is this being achieved? I would therefore like to encourage you to put forward a strong package which will improve the macro-economic conditions in these countries in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, the measures, which, in my view, run contrary to the spirit of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, have hit the weakest countries, including Greece, Portugal and Spain, while the stronger, wealthier countries have not yet taken on their share of the burden. Which measures will you be taking to encourage the wealthy countries to contribute to the costs of this crisis?</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I should like to express my deep indignation here and give voice to the protests being heard in Portugal against the policies that have led us to the crisis we are experiencing, in particular, the veritable submission and aggression pact imposed on the Portuguese people by what are known as the ‘troika’: the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission. These bodies have been charged with implementing a shameful act of outside intervention that does not even respect the rights and exclusive competences of the Portuguese Parliament, or take into account that we are in the run-up to parliamentary elections.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These are antisocial, regressive policies that abandon development and condemn the Portuguese workers and people to unemployment, poverty, underdevelopment and extreme dependence, turning Portugal into a mere protectorate or colony of the powers of the European Union. All this is happening, moreover, when it is already known that such measures do not solve the problem, as demonstrated by the Greek example.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Even if the real responsibilities of EU policy – and we are talking about the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, of the policy of the strong euro, and of the ECB guidelines and statutes, which do not respect the particularities of the weaker economies – in relation to the current situation are covered up, nothing justifies applying a package to Portugal that punishes the Portuguese people in return for a loan which needs to be paid back at interest rates higher than those normally charged by the ECB. Contrary to all the proclamations of solidarity at election propaganda time, what we have is a policy of social regression and of prolonged economic recession.</p>
      <p sl="pt">They are intending to do all of this just to favour the international banks, along with a handful of big companies and financial institutions in Portugal, and a few of their lackeys.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am a baby boomer. I was born just after the war. From that time, we have probably had the longest period of peace and prosperity globally. I have put a little bit of modest money away so that I can hand something down to my family when I pass on – largely because I have never spent more money than I have earned. I have been prudent and I have worked moderately hard.</p>
      <p sl="en">It always seems to me to come as a complete surprise to politicians how countries get in debt. Let me explain, because I do not think you really understand. It is because politicians consistently spend more money than they raise in taxation – more money than they can possibly raise in taxation –, most of which, in point of fact, they actually waste. The reason we are talking about countries which are broke – and they are broke – is because their ridiculous, ineffective, ignorant politicians consistently spend more money than they can raise. Then they borrow, and they borrow, and – worse – they then print money, because politicians and their central banks have a machine which prints money. If you do that as a private citizen, it is a criminal offence. You would go to prison for that, yet politicians and their central banks do it all the time.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me explain to you that these countries are broke. They are broke because of their own stupid leadership and politicians. It is immoral – immoral! – to ask ordinary taxpayers of any country to pick up the tab for failed politicians and failed banks. They have defaulted. They are broke. For God’s sake, let us all admit it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, on 9 May 2010, the EU-ECB-IMF troika triumphantly announced that it had saved Greece from total bankruptcy by lending it EUR 110 billion. A year later, Greece plunged into recession. Public debt soared to 150% of GDP and two-year interest rates have reached more than 25% per annum.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If, today, Greece is out of breath, it is because the method used to save it is not the right one. While the Greek economy now needs a weak currency to get out of the depression, the troika is going to impose a new, even more drastic, fiscal austerity package.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This remedy will be no more effective tomorrow than it was yesterday. The currently punitive interest rates to which Greece is subject are, in fact, preventing its private economy from undertaking any investments, whether it be in the production process or in real estate. Greece is becoming a third-world country, ruining all hopes of reimbursement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The new draft rescue package of EUR 60 billion envisaged last Friday demonstrates that the EUR 110 billion loan already granted a year ago must be considered a gift. For how long and to what extent will European taxpayers be pouring money into the Danaides’ cistern? Pursuing this path is suicidal and will lead to the fragmentation of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are two possible solutions: Greek debt restructuring accompanied by the restructuring of the public debt of failing States leading, ultimately, to the collapse of our banking system, or a concerted, rational and pragmatic exit from the euro area enabling Greece to catch its breath.</p>

That is why the series of proposals on economic governance currently being debated in the European Parliament are particularly important.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Parliament has been helping to ensure that positive steps towards intelligent debt management are taken. It has been advocating a reasonable transition period; arguing that the necessary reduction in debt should not be made year on year but using a three-year average; advocating the need for budgetary discipline; arguing for the need for growth and increased transparency in European policy through debates in the European Parliament; and advocating the necessary solidarity. This solidarity is what has just happened with Portugal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should like to say something to you as a Portuguese. Portugal has a 900-year history. Portugal is capable. Portugal is capable of putting its public accounts in order with discipline. Portugal is capable of reforming its banking system; it is capable of reforming its labour market; it is capable of making its tax system more competitive; and it is capable of using innovative measures to reform its health and justice systems. Portugal is capable of having a civil service that is more efficient and controlled. Portugal is capable of having a liberalised economy that is successful and more competitive.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fundamentally, however, Portugal is capable of participating in the European project; of participating and of helping to resolve whatever challenges there will be in the future. For this very reason, we are very happy in the Union and want to help it become progressively stronger.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in the face of crazy rumours and speculative attacks against a number of Member States, let me remind you of a few facts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The euro is a strong currency. In 10 years, the euro has established itself as the second most widely used currency in the world. Thirty per cent of international monetary reserves are denominated in euro. More than a third of international private borrowing is carried out in euro. The euro has a purchasing power 40% higher than that of the dollar, which means that euro area Member States pay less for their raw materials, particularly oil.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The euro is here for the long haul in all euro area Member States. With all due respect to Mrs Le Pen, leaving the euro is simply not an option. Any Member State leaving the euro – which is what Mrs Le Pen wants for France – would see its new currency dramatically devalued.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the wake of the crisis in Iceland, the value of the Icelandic currency has been halved. This 50% devaluation of the Icelandic currency has caused the rate of inflation in Iceland to leap from 5% to 14%. The only way to restore calm in the markets is to allow Greece, Ireland, Portugal and others to restructure their debt through the issue of Eurobonds guaranteed by the Union at reasonable rates. I am talking here about the Tremonti-Juncker initiative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In fact, Eurobonds already exist. The European Investment Bank (EIB) borrows under the guarantee of the 27 Member States. Last year, the EIB raised EUR 80 billion at average rates of between 3% and 3.5%. It is rates like those that would enable Member States under pressure to overcome the crisis and to return to the path of financial stability.</p>

Instead of lengthening the pain and piling even more burdens on the Greek economy, it would be far better to accept the inevitable and the judgment of the markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no way to avoid default. An orderly default has at least five advantages. It would share the loss more fairly between Greek taxpayers and external creditors; stop the replacement of private debt by an ever-growing proportion of official debt coming from other countries; offer Greece more growth opportunities by alleviating debt service; make it much easier for Mrs Merkel to ‘sell’ the default to the Bundestag, because it would mean supporting German banks rather than Greece; and, finally, isolate the debt crisis from the competitiveness crisis and save the eurozone from contagion.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Bokros, since you have raised the issue, I am going to continue. I believe, Mr Rehn, that we should listen to what is being said. I believe that, when the figures are placed alongside each other, the only conclusion is that debt restructuring in Greece, and probably in Ireland, is inevitable. I think that everyone realises that. It seems so obvious that one might well ask how it is possible that the European Central Bank, the Commission and the Council cannot see it. Unless you refuse to see it?</p>
      <p sl="fr">In other words, the first option is that you decide, for ideological reasons, to say that default is out of the question, in which case that would be to deny reality. On the other hand, you could perhaps say that it would be better to play for time, in which case I would really appeal to you because the more that time goes by, the more painful and the more costly restructuring will be. It will, in particular, be more costly for taxpayers because the more that time goes by, the more of a burden the Greek public debt will become on public or quasi-public entities – I am thinking of the European Central Bank, I am thinking of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) – and it is increasingly the taxpayer who is going to be asked to pay up.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You know, Mr Rehn, there has been a great deal of talk about stress tests and resistance tests in recent days. They are mentioned in relation to nuclear power stations; they are mentioned in relation to banks. Yet those whose resistance is being severely tested every day are our citizens, especially the most disadvantaged among them, who perhaps bear a disproportionately high share of the burden of the response to this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Clearly, one cannot therefore say that the crisis is simply the responsibility of the banks, of enterprises, or of politicians, as some would simplistically have us believe. I believe that this is a collective responsibility and that it would therefore be healthy if everyone contributed their fair share towards tackling the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to end by stressing that, even though I might often disagree with you, we should honour the work you have been doing lately.

Mr Rehn, can you give me a guarantee now that the scenario whereby Greece first refinances its debts to the maximum degree with Dutch taxpayers’ money and then leaves the euro and cancels its debts is a scenario that will not occur? We cannot trust these Greeks, the Greek politicians who, together with the European Commission, swindled their way into the euro with inaccurate figures and who now seem to be primarily occupied with increasing their own salaries.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, our duty is to look for the best solutions to cope with the crisis, to which end the learning process is of great value. My feeling is that we have learned why things went wrong and how we got ourselves into the difficult situation we are in today, but my feeling is also that now we are less open to drawing lessons from the evolving reality. In this context, I would like to raise two issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, we can see great similarities between Member States with regard to public debts and deficit ratios, while, at the same time, for the same Member States, there are substantial differences between the risk premiums paid on their sovereign debt. In my view, this is clear proof that factors other than sovereign debt enter into the picture and influence markets. Among other things, it is foreign debt or excessive external imbalances on which markets have focused, and this clearly means that in responding to the situation, we must go beyond fiscal adjustment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second issue is related to the fact that those economies that are the most strongly affected by the crisis have to cope with a combination of high risk premiums and severe austerity measures. This double challenge makes achieving debt sustainability practically impossible. If we reject debt restructuring, then we need a better balance between punishment and assistance and the design of response packages which would make it possible to avoid pushing countries further into a debt trap.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Europe is mired in an unprecedented crisis that could threaten the euro area and the European project. It is a crisis of the euro area, of which Greece, Ireland and Portugal are the first victims. The attacks on these countries’ sovereign debt aim to weaken the single currency. Those thinking that this is a problem for the Greeks, the Irish and the Portuguese are fooling themselves: it is not. If there is not a robust response from the European Union that calms the markets, this pressure will spread to other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Portugal does not have a problem regarding the sustainability of its public accounts or the insolvency of its national banks. Portugal needs to continue with the structural reforms already started, to increase productivity, and to promote economic growth. As in the past, the Portuguese people will overcome this challenge, too, and make the necessary sacrifices, but not more than the necessary sacrifices.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We cannot understand why the European Union is going to charge Portugal higher interest rates than the International Monetary Fund. Portugal will pay the European Union around EUR 3 billion in interest per year. There is no need for the Mr Blooms and Mr Madleners in this Chamber, and outside it, to worry: the taxpayer will not suffer. What is at issue is a loan, not a gift. This is a loan that will be paid back in full, and at interest rates similar to the market rates Portugal was paying around a month ago.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In a globalised world, no country can solve all its problems on its own. The financial crisis has already shown that something that happens on the other side of the world can hit all of us at home with devastating force. That is why we need more and better Europe: a more united and ambitious Europe. We are all in the same boat: if the boat sinks, no one will be saved.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am not taking the same attitude as others here who believe that countries like Greece, Ireland and Portugal did everything right: that they made no mistakes and did not go too far; that they did everything right and it was only the international crisis that caused problems. No, our governments made mistakes and had the wrong policies, but that does not mean there is not now an opportunity, in the context of the Union, to get back on track and head in the right direction again.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is therefore important to remember that it is, in fact, necessary to say to those bodies of public opinion against supporting countries in difficulties that they are not giving money to those countries: they are lending money to those countries. Moreover, they are lending it at very high interest rates, so they are actually doing a deal that is positive for their budgets and their people. However, I would also say here that it is perhaps time to have a general European response by accepting Eurobonds and accepting the possibility of selling them on the primary market, to respond to the international markets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Perhaps it is time for the Commission itself, the European Financial Stability Facility and the International Monetary Fund to review the interest rates so that they can make it possible for there to be sustained growth in these countries that are currently in difficulties, by lowering these rates.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly, I would like to say to that I feel ashamed by the amount of nationalism and short-sightedness which has been expressed in this debate.

Would lowering these interest rates help your country?</p>

I think that it will be extremely difficult to achieve the goals without lower interest rates, as we are seeing at the moment in the Greek case, in fact. However, whatever the case, I think that there is a possibility and a door open here.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If Portugal is able to comply rigorously with the results of the agreement in the first few months, I think that it will be in a position to go to the European Financial Stability Facility and the International Monetary Fund and ask for a review of the rates within six to nine months.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, this debate has been useful. This is a very serious situation for those countries in crisis, but it is just as serious for Germany, Austria and Finland, because taxpayers in these countries have suffered budget cuts and been through serious crises.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The questions have been justified, and that is why it is very important that the Portuguese issue should be made a model example of how a crisis can be held in check, dealt with, and prevented from spreading. I think that Portugal must now first ensure that it repays the loans by selling its assets, as has been said. It must also negotiate with its individual lenders to establish concrete proposals and ideas about how this crisis can be beaten.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Portugal is another country in need of financial assistance from the Eurobond, but us be honest and admit that the labelling of this crisis as a ‘debt’ crisis or a ‘euro’ crisis is highly misleading.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It gives the impression that the euro is in crisis because certain Member States are incapable of running their affairs sensibly and have taken on too much debt. Ireland and Portugal, however, ran their affairs in a disciplined way, and got into a crisis that was not of their own making. It is the poorly regulated banks that were irresponsible. It was the cost of protecting these banks that got some euro area states into financial problems. The actual crisis is therefore rather a crisis of the European banking sector.</p>
      <p sl="sk">If we are honest, the Eurobond, or rather the new form it will take after 2013, will surely not be enough. The cost of protecting the euro must be reduced in such a way that we force the commercial banks to acknowledge their losses. The next step should then be effective regulation of the financial sector.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the current approach to the debt crisis exacerbates the problems. Yes, Greece, Portugal and Ireland are being offered a debt settlement, but their debts are being increased, not reduced. This approach is a disaster – it is solving a debt problem by taking on more debt. Mr President, Europe needs to move on from its taboo on writing off debt. We can move forward by restructuring public debt with a partial writing off of debts in combination with enforcing the requirements of a tightened-up Stability and Growth Pact, including automatic penalties. Obviously, this is a tough approach designed to bring about a ‘shake-out’ amongst the banks, some pensions institutions and bondholders, but we need to get through this. It is a question of no pain, no gain. Writing off public debts in combination with enforcing strict requirements paves the way for a new future. If we do not do that, there is only one future, which is weak countries leaving the euro area.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, last month, the President of the Portuguese Republic asked the Commission to be ‘imaginative’, and your reply to the President of my country, with the arrogance of a colonial governor, was ‘we have been imaginative with Portugal’. That is why I want to reply to you now. The European Commission has been imaginative in imposing a three-year government programme and a preferred government on a country three weeks before an election. The European Commission has been imaginative in demanding an interest rate of 6% from that same country, and in plunging Portugal into recession for the next two years.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The only place the European Commission has not been imaginative is where it needed to be, because we all need to restructure the debt, to renegotiate the debt, and to involve creditors in the solution.

      <p sl="de">Among the many clever analyses and responses, there is one question which has not been asked. That is the question of what the citizens of the net contributors would say. Tax rates of 50% with a high standard of living and high levels of social services are not a coincidence. This means that the citizens are working hard and earning a great deal.</p>
      <p sl="de">Solidarity, which has often been referred to today, also involves solidarity with the citizens in our own home countries. The case of Sweden has been mentioned. The EU did not intervene here with financial aid. Instead, restructuring has taken place, cuts have been made in social services and public services have been reduced. In other words, a strict fiscal policy has been introduced. We must explain this to the countries which are obviously the subject of today’s debate. Without a strict fiscal policy and major efforts on their own part, this will not work.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will focus on one issue only because I need my five minutes for that.</p>
      <p sl="en">In recent weeks, and today in this House, many voices have spoken in favour of debt restructuring in Greece. It sounds very easy and neat. However, I must say that the proponents of sovereign debt restructuring seem to ignore the potentially devastating implications for financial stability in the country itself and in the euro area as a whole, and the consequences and ramifications for economic growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us think about what the consequences of debt restructuring could be. Of course, we are talking about a counterfactual situation, as are the proponents of debt restructuring, but we have enough understanding of the channels of impact on financial stability and economic activity to make a likely and most possible scenario. This is how it could very likely turn out.</p>
      <p sl="en">Bondholders would take a big hit – i.e. households through their savings instruments like pension savings, as well as institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies. Banks would also bear the cost. From last year’s bank stress test exercise, we know that the Greek banks hold EUR 48 billion of government securities, Greek Government bonds. What would happen? A restructuring of sovereign securities would seriously erode their capital base. For instance, even a 30% haircut would mean that a large part of the banking system would end up under-capitalised, while a 50% haircut, which many have advocated, would imply that a large part of the Greek banking system would simply become insolvent.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thus, a debt restructuring in Greece would have major consequences on the soundness of the banking sector in Greece, as well as on any banks having exposure to Greek securities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, I do not love banks, nor do I do my job in the first place in order to save them, but it is a fact that such a major banking crisis would lead to a massive credit crunch. It is not a kind of theoretical virtuality. It is a very likely result. A massive credit crunch. Moreover, through rating actions, the collateral pool at the disposal of the Greek banks would most likely be wiped out. It would melt down. A massive credit crunch, possible bank runs, a deposit freeze and/or capital controls could well be part of the consequences. What is absolutely sure is that the contraction of the economy would be unprecedented in Greece.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me recall that Argentinian GDP collapsed by almost half over five years. Would that help Greece or Europe? I doubt it. Even such a severe haircut as 50% would not reduce the debt ratio below 100% of GDP, assuming that the international creditors, like the euro area Member States or the IMF, were excluded from this haircut.</p>
      <p sl="en">Greece still has a large fiscal deficit which it has to finance. Who would be ready to lend to Greece the morning after it wiped out 70% or 50% or 30% of previous investors’ financial wealth? Who would be ready to lend to Greece the morning after?</p>
      <p sl="en">Debt restructuring would cut Greece’s access to financial markets for a very long time, and the goal of the EU/IMF programme is indeed a relatively rapid return to the markets to finance the Greek sovereign debt so that European taxpayers do not have to guarantee loans to do that. That is the goal of this exercise.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us recall that in the final analysis, fiscal solvency requires stabilising and then reducing the government debt ratio – i.e. achieving a primary structural surplus and achieving a debt-stabilising level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Greece is still living beyond its means, and the key is that Greece has to start earning more than it consumes and also be able to pay the interest rates on its debt burden.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is the primary structural surplus that Greece needs, and debt restructuring would not solve this very fundamental fact. Therefore, at the end of the day, the main determinants over the solvency of Greece are of a political and social nature – the consistent rigour to keep the primary surplus stable at a high level of around 5% of GDP for a long period of time.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have examples of this. Belgium successfully did so in the 1990s for almost a decade. Moreover, six EU Member States have been able to maintain a primary surplus of over 4% for at least four years, so it is not impossible. It is certainly very challenging, but it has been done before and it is doable also for Greece if there is the political will and unity in the country. This is the only way for Greece to avoid much worse alternatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">We really are at a critical juncture concerning the future of Europe. This debate is about the sovereign debt crisis. It has implications for the euro, for the future of Europe. You know this very well. I must say that I am extremely concerned about the divergence in the national political debates we have heard recently, which have also been reflected in this House. There is political fatigue in central and northern Europe about supporting the countries in trouble; there is reform fatigue in southern Europe about carrying out the necessary reforms. We need to find the energy together to beat this fatigue. We need to build bridges over these divergences in order to save Europe, and we need to make the necessary decisions to avoid another, even worse crisis, and to enable the whole of Europe to recover from this extremely serious financial crisis that we have experienced in the last years.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to reflect briefly on two trains of thought. Although, undoubtedly, the crisis of the banking system contributed considerably to our current economic problems, it would be a mistake to conceal that most of the problems arose prior to the crisis from a lack of fiscal discipline in numerous countries, from economic policy that did not strengthen competitiveness, and from the absence of coordination in European economic policy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is therefore clear that a comprehensive European answer is needed and two important elements of this, which are also top priorities for the Hungarian Presidency, are the European semester and implementing the reform of economic governance.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Implementing both priorities has reached an important, critical stage. As regards the European semester, we are committed to successfully concluding this on time. The Member States’ stability and convergence programmes, as well as the national reform programmes, are planned to be discussed at the Ecofin meeting in June, and I hope that at last, these programmes will mean a real breakthrough in each Member State’s fiscal and economic policy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Intensive work on the package of six proposals is going on in the trialogue. In connection with this, the Hungarian Presidency will announce the most important points of Parliament’s proposals at next week’s meeting of finance ministers, and at this discussion we will ask for a mandate from the Council to reach a successful and speediest possible agreement still in June regarding the six legislative proposals.</p>
      <p sl="hu">A responsible and flexible attitude is required of both the Council and Parliament, and I firmly believe that in today’s situation, the agreement would send a remarkably positive message to the markets as well. Furthermore, it would reflect the ability of the European institutions to cooperate responsibly and without delay when Europe is in huge need of this.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Concerning the Portuguese programme and the three adjustment programmes in general, first, I would like to welcome the parliamentary agreement on financial policy. We all know that this is extremely important from the aspect of the functioning of the European Financial Stability Facility. At the same time, I wish to point out that it is also clear in the economic policy programme compiled by the Troika in relation to Portugal that the programmes devised for Greece, Ireland and Portugal alike adapt to the characteristics of each country and are not formulaic in any way.</p>
      <p sl="hu">For Greece, the stress is on putting the budget in order. For Ireland, the consolidation of the banking system can be regarded as the key element. Now for Portugal, the most crucial parts are perhaps structural reforms, and labour market and commodity market reforms. As we are all aware, in the case of Portugal, it is extremely important to put the economy on a higher growth path in the medium term and to strengthen competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I believe that, although implementing economic policy programmes related to credit agreements means serious efforts for the Member States, at the same time, this is also an opportunity to face up to long-standing structural problems and to find solutions and answers to these within a short period, which, in the medium term, could lead to sustainable and higher growth in these countries.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The euro is experiencing depreciation at a time when there is talk about Greece needing to receive a second loan from the European Union. We must ask ourselves whether the situation in Greece and in other European states in difficulty is not a result of the actions taken by financial speculators, based on the tactics of ‘divide and conquer’. Just recently, Portugal became the third state which needed to ask the European Union for loans. The financial speculators have forgotten the problem of the banks which were difficult to save and are focusing their attention on European states in difficulty. The low public debt credit rating has made it impossible, therefore, to obtain loans to pay back the debt. I think that a European credit rating agency is required, which will move away from financial speculation. On the other hand, it is imperative that Eurobonds are issued to demonstrate the willingness to save the euro.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Owing to its scale and the associated constraints, the debt issue is more than just a real problem for countries like Portugal: it constitutes a central element of the violent social, economic, political and ideological offensive under way, the true causes of which are obscured. The most recent expression of this offensive is the unlawful intervention in Portugal by the ‘troika’ of the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank. This is an intolerable extortion of national resources from the Portuguese workers and people into the pockets of financial capital. The EU – thereby revealing its nature and true objectives – mediates this extortion process, whilst creating the institutional conditions for it to be implemented and deepened. The process of foreign intervention under way is very revealing of this. It incorporates the fundamentals of the antisocial measures implemented in other countries, like Greece and Ireland, as well as those included in the ‘Euro Plus Pact’ imposed by the European powers. When it comes into effect, it will exacerbate the national situation, worsening the economic recession, unemployment, poverty, social inequality and national dependence. When it is implemented, this veritable submission programme will, as demonstrated by the situation in other countries, exacerbate the conditions that supposedly motivated this intervention: in other words, the difficulties in tackling the unbearable and growing costs of the public debt.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The cause of the sovereign debt crisis is speculation on the indebtedness of Member States that have come to the rescue of the banking sector, which is directly responsible for the profound crisis we are experiencing. The banking sector has shirked all its responsibilities, especially its financial responsibilities, and is making record profits, while European taxpayers and workers are being asked to tighten their belts. As for the sacrosanct markets, they are now setting the tone. Commission and governments have just one obsession: to reassure them. The whole of last weekend was filled with misinformation on debt restructuring and Greece’s exit from the euro: rumours spread by those who have wagered billions on a default they are trying to create in the first place. Debt restructuring would, it appear, be a catastrophe – for private investors. At the same time, it was announced that the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), for example, would lose much less than the EUR 6 billion in profits expected this year and that, without the exorbitant rates of interest, Greece’s deficit would be 1.5% of GDP and not 8%. The speculators are stuffing themselves on taxpayers’ money and are clearly set to bleed them dry. It is time we stopped this unhealthy circus.</p>

It goes without saying that the EU must respond to the crisis. I have a few thoughts on the stress tests which were carried out on the banks. A total of 91 major European banks were tested and 7 failed. I have one major criticism in this area, which is that the consequences of a country going bankrupt were not evaluated and this remains a possibility when we look at Greece, Ireland and Portugal. The most recent stress tests focused on the hard capital ratios, but the liquidity criteria should also have been included. It is obvious that these results must be published in order to achieve the required level of transparency.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to thank this House for putting the issue of European agencies on the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission attaches great importance to the European Union agencies’ efficient functioning. Part of this is related to the governance arrangements which apply to all of them. As you are aware, the agencies’ functioning and governance are currently being discussed within the interinstitutional working group involving the Commission, Parliament and the Council, on the basis, inter alia, of a multi-agency evaluation carried out for the Commission in 2009. Indeed, the time has come to shape a new overall approach to EU agencies, improving their overall coherence, effectiveness, accountability and transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ultimate aim of the interinstitutional working group is, through a step-by-step approach, to develop a general agreement between the three EU institutions on the various issues at hand. We hope this can be achieved by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. Cooperation with Parliament has been very positive so far, and we trust that we can count on Parliament’s support for the next steps.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, EU agencies are legally autonomous bodies whose governance rules are laid down in the funding regulations. In general, agencies are overseen by a governing board whose membership may vary according to the nature of the agency. Three of the agencies in the field of employment and education for example – Eurofund, OSHA and Cedefop – have tripartite governing bodies with representatives of both sides of industry, the Member States and also the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish to reassure you that this House has access to a lot of information, either because this information is in the public domain or because Parliament, as part of the budgetary authority, holds hearings with the directors of agencies, on the annual work programmes and on budgetary discharge, in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">Each of the agencies – Eurofund, OSHA, the European Training Foundation and Cedefop – has a specific role to play. For example, the European Training Foundation and Cedefop, although both working on vocational education and training, have different geographical scope. The former works outside the EU, the latter inside the EU, and they have different objectives. The European Training Foundation assists essentially the neighbourhood countries with reforms of education and training systems, while Cedefop promotes information gathering and research on the vocational training policies of the Member States. The Commission is keen to ensure synergies between the two agencies, notably through exchanges of information, joint work programmes, the joint organisation of conferences and seminars, and joint projects.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the members of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) group from the Wesel district assembly who are in the gallery. I would like to say to Mr Andor that we are pleased to hear him thanking us for our cooperation on the issue of agencies. However, it is both sad and regrettable that the Council representative has once again left the Chamber, because the fact that we have made so little progress in the interinstitutional working group on agencies is primarily the fault of the Council, which is holding back from working with us to introduce improvements in this area. Therefore, the Commission should be aware that we are on its side.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must exert greater pressure with regard to the agencies. We are currently looking at four agencies which reflect the fundamental problems of all the agencies, in other words, the overlap of responsibilities, for example, between the European Agency for Safety and Health (OSHA) and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) and between OSHA and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), the European Railway Agency (ERA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). There is also a significant overlap between the European Training Foundation (ETF) and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop). Given Europe’s financial problems, why is it that we cannot bring ourselves to take some fundamental measures in this area and to combine those agencies whose responsibilities are very similar, such as the agency responsible for vocational training within Europe and the agency for vocational training outside Europe?</p>
      <p sl="de">There are a number of good arguments for doing so. We have problems with the size of the agencies and, therefore, with their efficiency. We have supervisory bodies with more members than the agencies have employees. These are all things which damage the reputation of the European Union every day, because everyone who looks at the situation puts their head in their hands and says: ‘You cannot seriously mean this’. Most importantly, some agencies have not reached the critical mass to enable them to work efficiently. Also, this House has provided too much money and too many staff members. In some agencies, such as OSHA, we have seen a budget increase of 105% and a staff increase of 69% over 10 years. Eurofound had a budget increase of 39% and a staff increase of 46%. This is why I am calling urgently on my fellow Members to introduce changes during the next budget debate.</p>

At the same time, we benefit from enormous transparency, and there is no doubt that they are working closely with Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, I am surprised that shadows of doubt have been cast about their existence and about their work and I am shocked that, as always, some of its members, instead of having a political vision, have a vision that is accounts and nothing but accounts. It is true that accounts are very important: it is very important to know what the costs are, but we also need to know the benefits, the cost of preventing accidents at work, but also the costs of failure to prevent accidents at work. We need to know the costs of training, but also the costs of failing to train or failing to anticipate the changes that our workers and industries need to make.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, I believe that rather than problems with the agencies, some of your Members have problems with Europe. You, like Ulysses returning to Ithaca, must not listen to the songs of the sirens, because they want to lure the ship on to the rocks and for the ship of Europe to sink.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we in the ECR Group want to see more effective control of the EU budget. On behalf of taxpayers, we demand real added value for money spent at EU level. Especially in these times of economic stringency, we want a tougher attitude towards spending in general: not more spending, but better spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">Applying this logic in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am questioning the efficiency of the four agencies which we have been discussing: Eurofund, ETF, OSHA and the improbably named Cedefop. I recently myself visited ETF in Turin and also heard a presentation from Cedefop while I was there. There is indeed, as earlier speakers have said, considerable overlap between their programmes, and I believe that their management and administration, at least, could usefully be merged.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am therefore asking the following questions. Does the Commission apply efficiency and performance criteria to these agencies? If so, may we see the criteria? Secondly, how do the agencies perform against the criteria? Can the Commission show Parliament an analysis of the agencies’ performance? Thirdly, given the considerable functional overlap, has the Commission considered merging them? We have heard about synergies; we want to see them. Who sets the objectives and strategy of the agencies? May we see them? More generally, there seems to be considerable overlap between reports on employment matters produced on these agencies by the Commission and by the Policy Department of the European Parliament. We ask: is this duplication worthwhile?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the EU has four agencies in the field of employment, working conditions and vocational training; namely, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), the European Training Foundation (ETF), the European Agency for Safety and Health (OSHA) and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop), with an annual budget of around EUR 15 million to EUR 20 million. I have looked at the websites of these four agencies. The focus is on activities such as a photo competition on the subject of risk prevention, a competition for practical solutions, whatever they might be, and the joint organisation of the European Day of Solidarity between Generations. These are all earthshaking activities, none of which seem to have any concrete output.</p>
      <p sl="de">The areas covered by the agencies overlap. There are overlaps between the agencies and also with the Directorates-General of the Commission, with departments in Parliament and with national bodies. Obviously, this situation cannot continue. We must prevent duplication of effort by merging the agencies. Inefficient agencies must be closed, because the taxpayers will definitely not understand why millions of euro are being wasted on photo competitions within this proliferation of agencies.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the synergies existing between these four agencies require us to take a closer look at their objectives. While their objectives have been established on paper, the discharge procedure leaves us less satisfied as to their effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The external auditor has pointed the finger at weak budgetary planning, the lack of a clear link between objectives and budgetary resources, as well as carry-overs and cancellations of significant appropriations. To take the example of Eurofound, the Court of Auditors notes in its 2009 report that the Foundation has not established in its budget a specific heading for the different programmes financed by assigned revenue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For me, the problem is that we are no longer sure how EU contributions are used before the agency’s balance sheet is examined two years later. These weaknesses in budgetary planning do not therefore give us the guarantee of specific value for these four agencies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In response to this situation, we can think about coordinating their work better. For example, why not form a single governing board for these four agencies? The interinstitutional working group has been working on these problems for a number of years. What response can it give us?</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the question pleases me, because I like evaluation, I like control. I also like studies that provide data which can help us do our job more efficiently in the European institutions for the benefit of European citizens. Why, when the European institutions call for an impact assessment before saying hello, do we have a problem with these two organisations that have been working since 1975, carrying out research and studies into work, education and training? A good question. Except that its purpose is not economic or financial, it is political. It is a question that comes back time and again in different ways and for different reasons, and the fact that it has come back now, when Europe is in crisis, when the workers are suffering, when education is suffering, shows that it has a different purpose. We have found out how to smack and we are slapping everyone we can. Is Greece suffering? Let us attack the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, because it is in Thessaloniki, even if it was founded in 1975. What I am trying to say is this: overlaps between competences are one thing and cooperation is another thing, especially the cooperation needed to get things right in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I know these four agencies very well and I have been following their work for many years. I think that we should be very open in the way that we approach this issue. It is not simply a question of overlapping tasks; there would clearly be synergies and the opportunity to produce better quality work if we allowed them to work more closely together. My fellow Member from Greece, Mrs Rapti, mentioned that there were political undertones behind the desire to amalgamate agencies, and she said that we must not interfere with agencies in Greece. However, the fact that our agencies are spread out geographically and located in different places in Europe must not be a barrier to us having an efficient system. What is most important is that the agencies deliver, that the tasks we need them to do are accomplished and that they are accomplished as cheaply and as efficiently as possible. That is what you should work to achieve, Mr Andor. Therefore, be open in your thinking on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, agencies dealing with employment issues play a particularly important role in view of the economic crisis currently affecting Europe. It is therefore worth examining in more detail the effectiveness of the measures they carry out. There is no doubt that these agencies should help Europeans to acquire skills that they will be able to use on a rapidly changing and ever more competitive labour market. We should therefore implement measures which will, firstly, result in greater flexibility in the European labour market, for example, mutual recognition of workers’ qualifications by Member States. Secondly, the agencies should play an active role in creating programmes which take into account the economic and social challenges facing the European Union, including the demographic challenge and the overburdening of the pensions system. Finally, we should carry out research to identify the real problems in the European labour market. To sum up, the measures taken by the agencies dealing with employment issues should be targeted, above all, at helping EU citizens in the face of not only the economic, but also the demographic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is very significant that the Member who asked the question has left the room during the discussion. The arguments and questions put by some of the previous speakers once again demonstrate a highly revealing populist mindset. We are in the midst of a crisis and, as usual, savings are being made in areas which affect the workers. I think that this is a very one-sided approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to look briefly at the European Training Foundation (ETF). It is important because of its cooperation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in the EU’s partner countries. It enables the European social model to be exported to acceding countries and provides help with developing education, vocational training and further education programmes and with creating secure jobs. Two weeks ago, I was in Belgrade and, in meetings with education and training providers, I was once again assured of the importance of the agency. The same thing happened in meetings in Turkey. The ETF plays a very important role in helping the acceding countries to enter the EU labour market.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we take a more far-sighted approach, the Arab spring is also very important. We do not want large numbers of refugees to come to Europe, so we must offer people support in their home countries. We must provide education and help the countries to develop training programmes and facilities.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for the report on cooperation in the field of vocational education and training, I have followed the activities of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training with particular interest. Matching vocational training to the needs of citizens and the labour market is one of the key factors in increasing employment levels and the competitiveness of the European Union. We cannot therefore underestimate the role played by Cedefop.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report for 2010 confirmed my beliefs regarding Cedefop’s effectiveness. Evidence of this can be seen, inter alia, in the steady rise in the number of people using its publications and the Europass portal. However, I believe that it is vital to increase Cedefop’s involvement in structural measures aimed at vocational training, including the introduction of a system for assessing the effectiveness of training. I also believe that the agency has superb potential to draft an attractive proposal in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I am not seeking to call into question the work and efforts of the workers, experts and specialists of the four existing European agencies responsible for employment, working conditions and training. Nevertheless, greater coordination and synergy in the work carried out is certainly necessary and possible to make its benefits clearer.</p>
      <p sl="pt">They carry out some important studies giving us greater insight into problems regarding working conditions, training, the actual quality of jobs, and even the lack of democracy in workplaces.

Firstly, in order to ask if a study has been carried out into the money we would save if these four organisations were closed down. The question is not, of course, addressed to the Commission; it is addressed to the absent member who asked the question, who is no longer here, who would appear not to want an answer. The second is that the International Labour Organisation (ILO) uses the data provided by these organisations to saturation point and the third and final issue is to remind the House that discharge for all four organisations was approved just yesterday. However, no discharge was approved for the Police College based in Britain.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Now as it appears, Ms Rapti, the fact that I made this exception made other Members of the House want to take the floor as well. We are already over time. If you really want the floor, I will now have to give it to you but please do not just ask for the floor just to express some kind of disagreement with the process. Ms Gräßle, you want the floor for one minute? If you want to speak to make a point of substance, go ahead.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, if you had explained when Mrs Rapti took the floor what the consequences would be, we could have made more progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Rapti, this approach has brought about exactly the situation that we now find ourselves in and the problem of the agencies working inefficiently, which we urgently need to resolve. If we want to retain the agencies, we need to change them. I can only ask you to join us in our efforts. We cannot simply leave things as they are because the agencies are so inefficient and because they are wasting money rather than making money every day.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to mention once again that the funding for the four agencies we are talking about amounts to EUR 90 million. That is a lot of money. I am not sure whether the services that the agencies provide are really worth EUR 90 million. That is the point I would like to emphasise. We owe this to our citizens and our taxpayers. I have to justify myself every day to German taxpayers and explain that we are getting value for money. I believe that there is plenty of room for improvement.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, when we look at the development of agencies in Europe, it gradually becomes clear that we are suffering from ‘agencyitis’. There are no other areas where four agencies are working in parallel. Elsewhere, the job is done by one agency. When we consider the situation as a whole, it seems as if each country essentially wants its own agency. If you will pardon me for saying so, we cannot allow this to happen.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should not only be discussing whether a merger should take place. We should also be considering which tasks the Commission itself can take responsibility for and whether an agency is needed at all. This means that we should gradually move to thinking about which agencies we can close down. I would like to ask the previous speaker, who took the floor twice: Where are the specific efficiency measurements? How many jobs have the agencies actually created? Where is the turnover which justifies ongoing funding of EUR 90 million per year?</p>
      <p sl="de">When I have the answers to these questions, I will be able to support the continuing existence of these agencies. Otherwise, I would like to see them closed.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I believe that it is extremely important for us to have agencies carrying out effective measures relating to the labour market and employment and, of course, agencies need to be held accountable for their results.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let us not forget that every third European Union citizen has no professional qualifications. Matters relating to monitoring of the employment sector, labour market potential and vocational training generate an enormous amount of data, which it is no longer possible for any one Member State to evaluate on its own. We should therefore hold agencies accountable for the effectiveness of their work, but we should remember that the results of this work may now have an incredible impact on the labour market, by linking all vocational training to jobs and professions which are already showing signs of being in short supply in the future European Union. Today, we have to import a large number of workers from other countries for jobs which require a narrow specialisation, such as doctors and nurses. These are the problems the European Union is facing, and we should therefore appreciate how effective these agencies’ measures are.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I believe that we need to discuss all issues like this without any taboos. If we find weaknesses or waste, we have to address them.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is also very important that we do not misrepresent reality and we do not overstate the weaknesses we find just so as to make a strong point.</p>
      <p sl="en">I regret that some of the colleagues who spoke have actually left, but I would like to answer them very specifically. For example, I very strongly reject the notion that some of these agencies just do PR and work of a very superficial nature. They actually do very concrete analytical and policy work, including the exchange of experience, and help deliver European policies, in these particular instances, in the area of employment and social issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think these agencies are instrumental in delivering the Europe 2020 strategy and progress towards the headline targets we have agreed. I very much agree that developing skills and vocational training is one of the key challenges we are facing, as was stressed in the discussion. This is one of the key structural causes of unemployment in the European Union, and we need the contribution of these agencies more than ever.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true, however, that we have to see whether the costs are justified or not, and we need to approach this on a very concrete basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">In principle, the efficiency and performance criteria of an agency are set out in its annual work programme, together with an indication of the ways in which such criteria are to be addressed. An agency’s annual work programme has to be approved by its governing board, and is presented to the relevant European Parliament committee. The Commission representatives on the governing boards of agencies take the need for quantitative and qualitative performance criteria very seriously and make every effort to ensure that they are applied.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the question of how the agencies perform against the criteria that are set, I have to say that it is the role of the governing board of each agency to assess its performance against those criteria. As a rule, agencies carry out external evaluations of their work programmes at regular intervals, and these take such performance indicators into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">Agencies usually report on the results of external evaluations in the director’s annual activity report, which is submitted to the budgetary authority. As part of the budgetary authority, Parliament may also request agencies to justify their performance. Agencies are also subject to evaluation by the Court of Auditors in connection with the annual discharge procedure, the results of which are discussed in the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commission representatives on the governing boards of agencies make every effort to ensure that the recommendations stemming from external evaluations, and those from the Court of Auditors and the Commission’s internal audit service, are followed up appropriately.</p>
      <p sl="en">I addressed the question of the functional overlap between two agencies – the ETF and Cedefop – in my introductory speech, but I would like to stress again that the contribution of these agencies can be crucial, especially in the context of increasing employment in line with the 2020 objectives. The ETF, particularly in the light of the recent changes in the Mediterranean area, can play a very strong role in bringing prosperity to the regions neighbouring the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have one more point to make concerning Parliament’s capacity to see the development of strategies. The objectives of the agencies are defined in the Financial Regulation which, as you know, is published in the Official Journal. An agency’s strategy is usually set by the director in agreement with the governing board, and these strategies are presented to Parliament each year and are reflected in the annual work programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The four agencies concerned presented their annual work programmes to Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at the end of January this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to say that I also believe it would be useful to involve the Council Presidency in such discussions. I can assure you I will follow this up with them, and I am sure I will find a common language with the Presidency on this issue as well.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Merkies, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on Innovation Union: transforming Europe for a post-crisis world (2010/2245(INI)) (A7-0162/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-641-000" speaker_id="96910" name="Judith A. Merkies" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, you are an innovator, I am an innovator, we are innovators, we can all be innovators. How can we be? The answer is as researchers, scientists, policy makers, workers on the shop floor, consumers and citizens. It is the citizens who are key to innovation – they make or break it. Yet what can we, as policy makers, as politicians, do to accelerate that innovation? Innovation is the only way out of the financial and economic crisis, as innovation will provide the solution to the problems that affect us all – such as the ageing of the population, climate change and the scarcity of raw materials – and will also put an immediate end to the financial and economic crisis. Through innovation, we hope to be able to link all these things together, give the economy a vigorous boost and, at the same time, move towards a sustainable society. This will not happen on its own, of course. A change of mindset is required – a changing of the concept of society and of how we need to get to work in politics and in business and industry.</p>
      <p sl="nl">So, what are the specific measures that we could take? We need more focus and less fragmentation. We need to do away with our narrow-mindedness when it comes to innovation and in policy. What do we want to achieve? Innovation is not just a question of one building, one ministry, one programme. Innovation needs to be something that runs through every area of policy. That therefore has to be the political mindset, too. Preferably, we need a holistic approach. Why do we have so many programmes already? Bring these together wherever possible and actually start to simplify things, for once. That is the mission for us, as politicians. Cut the red tape. As politicians, we have a constant tendency, if we want to achieve something, to throw a new layer on top, additional regulation, an additional programme, an additional funding option. Maybe the solution is not the ‘additional’ in this case; maybe it is just ‘less’ or ‘instead’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We thus need less control-freakery in funding applications and – something that is very important – to offer service to those who come to us for funding and promotion, to provide a one-stop shop for applicants, new business founders, SME operators and, where appropriate, for regions and research bodies. This means not merely checking funding applications but, where appropriate, also seeking out suitable partners or networks for collaboration.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There needs to be a great deal more venture capital and, in that regard, instead of EUR 1 billion in the next funding period, we really need to aim for EUR 5 billion, as that will provide the banks with just the little bit of support they need in order to grant loans to SMEs. We need a cheap and simple patent and workable rules to protect intellectual property. We need a true European internal market where innovations are better able to succeed through access to a market of 500 million citizens. At the moment, that market is much too compartmentalised. Up to now, innovation has predominantly been seen as a high-tech product. That is not necessarily the case – it can also relate to social innovation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe has been struggling for years against an innovation brain drain – creative people who would rather head to the United States because they believe that it is easier there. If we are honest, the truth is that that is sometimes the case. Inflexible personal liability rules, the lack of financial support and high thresholds in order to enter the European market are all barriers that ensure that innovation has not, hitherto, seen great success in Europe. The EU must dare to reward – not punish – courage, entrepreneurship, curiosity and creativity. We need European versions of Steve Jobs. Let us merge where we are strong; let us in Europe bring together the spirit of research, Einstein and Steve Jobs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Merkies, for this excellent report. I want to thank the shadow rapporteurs on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), as well as the members of the seven committees that delivered their opinions to ITRE. Their support for all the various aspects of Innovation Union will be crucial to its success.</p>
      <p sl="en">Innovation has been placed at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. I would like to take this opportunity to illustrate in concrete terms what Innovation Union will mean for different people.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will encourage and support better collaboration between business and academia through the creation of knowledge alliances to develop new curricula that address innovation skills gaps. For Europe’s researchers, we will take measures to boost cross-border cooperation and remove obstacles to research and mobility, completing the European Research Area by 2014. Ultimately, as Ms Merkies put it, we have to merge Albert Einstein and Steve Jobs and keep him or her in Europe: we must be seen to be attractive and dynamic, and unfettered by unnecessary red tape.</p>
      <p sl="en">For our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs, Innovation Union is working to create conditions on intellectual property rights (IPR), standard setting and access to finance that will be much more conducive to innovation. On 13 April 2011, we presented two legislative proposals on IPR, under enhanced cooperation, which will reduce the cost of patents by up to 80%. A single European patent will be valid in 25 Member States and, if you want to build a start-up or you need access to finance, the Commission will ensure by 2012 that venture capital funds established in any Member State can function and invest freely elsewhere in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Innovation Union will also champion the best examples of public sector innovation, and the private and public sectors can learn from each other’s best practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Public procurement represents 17% of the EU’s GDP, an enormous potential market for innovation. So we encourage Member States and regions to set aside budgets for public procurement of innovative products and services.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, what about the average taxpayer? Well, Innovation Union will make the best use of public money. This means prioritising smart fiscal consolidation, despite severe budget constraints. Investment in education, research and innovation has the potential to create more wealth and jobs than it costs, and investment in innovation will help us tackle the great challenges that society faces.</p>
      <p sl="en">That brings me to the partnerships which will provide a framework for aligning instruments and resources, bringing all the key actors together. They aim to cover the whole innovation chain, from supporting excellent R&amp;D to making sure that we have the conditions in place to bring the results of that R&amp;D to the market successfully. We are delighted that Parliament gave such strong support on 11 November 2010 to the concept of the innovation partnerships. Parliament’s President has been invited to nominate four members to the steering board, and we look forward to that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, Ms Merkies mentioned social innovation, which has been discussed by ITRE. The Commission is committed to launching a European social innovation pilot that will provide expertise and a networked virtual hub for social entrepreneurs and for the public and third sectors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me stop there, because I think tonight is all about hearing what the Members of Parliament have to say, so that after the debate, when we go away with the report, we will be able to respond to those comments.</p>

    <intervention id="3-643-000" speaker_id="28617" name="Inese Vaidere" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade">
      <p sl="lv">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis has particularly emphasised the necessity of innovation in the economy of the European Union and therefore, the Commission’s proposals for the ‘Innovation Union’ are particularly welcome. A successful innovation policy must rest on three pillars: political support, finance and orderly legislation. As we emphasise in the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, the overarching objective of the ‘Innovation Union’ must be long-term development and competitiveness based on technology, knowledge and the development of education. In increasing investment in research and development to 3% of gross domestic product, we must carry out structural reforms to secure its effective application and accessibility for small and medium-sized enterprises. An important aspect is entrepreneurs’ understanding of innovations. These do not only include high technology and discoveries, but also social, business, management, marketing and other innovations, which demand ever more effective application of knowledge, and more active collaboration with universities and research centres. It is important to identify the strong aspects of research, while avoiding excessive prioritisation, where everyone is researching one and the same thing. European patents currently cost 15 times more than US patents, hence the reason why we must develop the European patent more quickly and reduce its cost. Valuable inventions are being made in many of the new Member States but due to lack of funding, the researchers are forced to sell them to other countries and companies for a few thousands, whereas their real worth can be measured in millions. As regards patents obtained with public funds, it is important that universities and private persons be able to share in intellectual property created in this way. The European Union must reinforce protection of intellectual property in order to safeguard our technology and know-how from piracy and fraud, especially by concluding agreements with third countries. For their part, governments must draw up programmes for developing innovation. We may not be able to overtake China and India in the quantity of research, but we can definitely offer quality and better conditions for implementing ideas. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have argued that innovations are absolutely crucial to economic development and improved employment, now that Europe is looking for a way out of the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fi">R&amp;D investment tends to drop in periods of economic crisis, even though it has been proved that those companies and Member States that invest the most during those periods are the ones that gain the greatest comparative market advantage. They are also the ones to recover fastest from recession. That is why it is extremely important for the Member States to meet the Europe 2020 target and invest at least 3% of GDP into research and development.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Committee on Employment stresses the importance of innovation policy being viewed broadly, not merely in the form of technical innovation, but also – more than has previously been the case – in the form of social and service-related innovation that helps resolve challenges facing society, such as ageing, healthcare, and changes in the environment, climate and energy efficiency. A good example of this is the pilot project known as the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Information and communications technology (ICT) is important in all innovative activity. ICT skills depend on improvements in the quality of training, support for lifelong learning, and the opportunity for those already in employment to update their own knowledge and skills continuously.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Most of the initiatives that will make innovation possible come from the business sector, and so closer cooperation with universities and research centres is essential. On the other hand, the commercial exploitation in the EU of research findings in universities is inadequate or too slow. That is why we need business incubators linking the business world and universities, whose task it would be to promote the commercial exploitation of research findings.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Committee on Employment considers it absolutely essential that a European research area be created, with obstacles to the mobility of researchers being eliminated, and advanced European research infrastructure being created. We should therefore prevent the brain drain from Europe to other places – if anything, Europe should be an area that attracts researchers from elsewhere.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, the possibility of strongly stimulating the economic and social development that is so necessary in our times is, in fact, integral to innovation. We can go even further and say that innovation constitutes a necessary means of helping respond to many of the problems and challenges facing humankind today.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I sought to uphold this idea by drawing attention to some of the main challenges we are facing in the following areas, to cite but a few examples: the scarcity and efficient use of resources, waste recovery and treatment, food quality and security, demographic change, new epidemics, and conservation of nature and biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I sought to uphold the fact that innovation should be guided, above all, by the criteria of defending the public interest, improving people’s quality of life, promoting social welfare, and preserving the environment and the balance of nature. It should be a key element of public policy in such areas as the environment, water, energy, transport, telecommunications, health and education.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I drew attention to the fact, acknowledged by the 2009 European Innovation Panel, that the economic and financial crisis is having a disproportionate impact on a number of countries and regions, thereby undermining the objective of convergence. The constraints currently imposed on the Member States could result in increased restrictions on investment in science, technology and innovation, particularly in the most vulnerable countries. Instead of the announced ‘Innovation Union’, the result could be a veritable innovation divide between the countries and regions that innovate most and the rest.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Unfortunately, the first draft opinion that I tabled ended up being diluted by amendments adopted in committee. Where there was – and should be – public interest, development, cohesion, progress and social welfare, what has ended up predominating are so-called business opportunities, competition, and the harnessing of innovation for business purposes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">While that is also the dominant vision in the Commission communication, it is not our vision. This is not the vision of the future that we need.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the key point, in the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, is the creation of an Innovation Union with an enhanced social profile predicated on job creation. Innovative goods and services need to be adopted, which will target both the private and the public sector, so as to facilitate the implementation of administrative procedures, strengthen the public administration and reduce bureaucracy and the inflexibility of the public sector. Furthermore, the adoption of innovative solutions is closely bound up with pre-commercial procurement, which resolves issues which the market cannot cover or where the solutions proposed are uneconomic.</p>
      <p sl="el">In the private sector, we must encourage small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as micro-enterprises, which are having particular difficulty adapting to the market, to increase the use of innovative products, on the one hand, and create innovative solutions, on the other. Special mention also needs to be made of micro-enterprises in regional and rural areas, which are struggling to survive due to the lack of funding, so that we can find ways of encouraging the use of innovative solutions, thereby improving their viability. At the same time, environmental innovation programmes need to be encouraged, so as to plug the gaps which exist in efforts to deal with climate change and promote environmentally-friendly solutions.</p>
      <p sl="el">In addition to strengthening innovation, we need to look at how it can directly benefit the citizens of the European Union. The use of innovative solutions should result in lower costs for enterprises and should enable consumers to enjoy cheaper and better products.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would say to the Commissioner that, in recent years, innovation has become a symbol of a policy instrument that can fix all our problems. This means that there are huge expectations and that we must deliver.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, for a successful implementation of ideas, governance matters very strongly and a governance framework for innovation must be based today on pragmatism and must be delivered with a sense of urgency, and also must be at the service of the policy content.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe, we all agree, has to innovate or it will lose out to competitors. Every link in the European innovation chain must be strengthened and innovation policy must be focused towards challenges. That is what I understand the Innovation Union is offering.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, we run the risk that, not only companies, but also governments might decrease investment in innovation. That is the logic of the crisis and the logic of national budget cuts. EU policy responses and EU budgetary instruments must move firmly against that logic.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Europe, innovation is not just a concept that can be limited to specific innovation centres. It needs to be applied across the entire European territory. Europe is simply too small to afford an innovation deficit anywhere on its territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">Research and innovation are clearly not the same thing and we agree with you very clearly. Governance for innovation should therefore do more than just support research and development policy. Promoting innovation-led growth is not about increasing excellence in R&amp;D infrastructure. Important as they are, it is, first and foremost, about mobilising talents and mobilising new ideas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Governance for innovation must mean establishing new partnerships enabling efficient innovation systems that mobilise intellectual and entrepreneurial capacities, detecting also sleeping innovators – of which we have many in Europe – through a business environment that is conducive to innovation, and particularly for SMEs, covering all sectors of the economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, let me say that we do not yet have a fully-fledged European model for innovation, but what is clear is that it must be rooted in a well-orchestrated, concrete, strong and joint public/private effort. I trust that the Innovation Union will take us all the way forward towards such a model.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the report by Mrs Merkies – whom I thank for the work she has done – is Parliament’s first important contribution to the Commission proposal on the Innovation Union initiative. In recent years, major countries around the world have tenaciously pursued the objective of concentrating their competition policies on certain key sectors, which have generated growth and development by aiming at innovation. The high-tech sector is a good example.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe, too, recognises the need to pursue projects aiming at economic and industrial growth, by focusing resources and investment on innovative policies, without abandoning the path it has followed in recent decades of playing a leading and guiding role in economic and social development. The main thrust of this report shows the need for a cross-cutting approach, promoting innovation in all areas of business, the economy and society in general.</p>
      <p sl="it">Small and medium-sized enterprises – the mainstay of Europe’s economic performance even in difficult crisis situations – are picked out as places where innovation occurs every day. Today, these abilities should be recognised, rewarded and put at the service of the growth and development of the whole continent. It is also made clear that innovation and research are two sides of the same coin. Innovation may derive from research, but it can also be a wide-ranging ability to change things for the better in all areas of daily life. Succeeding in this will be a challenge for Europe. We may not manage to create a Silicon Valley straight away, but perhaps we can establish a Stanford University.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Merkies, on her excellent work, because she has unpicked the content of the report and concentrated on the more relevant aspects for our group, such as social innovation – understood as innovation by workers and the public – the incentive provided by the public procurement of innovative and green products and services, and the need to improve the access to finance on the part of SMEs. This allows me to concentrate and comment on a specific aspect of the report: the need to develop indicators.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, if we understand innovation simply in terms of new products, processes and services that result in an increase in economic activity, it is essential that we equip ourselves with the instruments to measure our innovation capacity precisely in economic terms and that we do so on the basis of parameters, such as private investment and R&amp;D, employment or the number of innovative companies. We have to establish indicators that reflect the capacity of innovation to generate growth, employment and an increase in GDP, and which allow us to compare our situation, in terms of intensity, with the economies of our competitor countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to end with a few words as a member of a delegation that opposed the launch of enhanced cooperation on the unitary Community patent and to say that we opposed it, because we believe that the enhanced cooperation instrument may directly affect the internal market, territorial cohesion and the right of citizens of all Member States to have maximum legal security.</p>

Such a development would put our prosperity, economic progress and social status under serious pressure. Put in simpler terms, Europe is under threat of turning into a mediocre actor on the global scientific and economic stage. Europe urgently needs innovation now.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I congratulate Mrs Merkies on her fine report. I am also delighted with the excellent ideas from Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn. This guarantees success because the Innovation Union is primarily a strategy for the European Union’s economic development. We require the following for us to succeed in this. Firstly, we need to have better access to credit and financial support; we need more investment in scientific research and development; clear rules offering long-term prospects in terms of innovation; simplified procedures for accessing European and national support programmes; and cheap, simple European patents.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, today, we are discussing innovation strategy in plenary for the second time. In many of our debates on the standing of European countries on world markets, we regularly remark on the importance of boosting the competitiveness of the European economy. The EU’s position on world markets will, in future, be greatly influenced by the success of innovations and the speed of innovation cycles. European states clearly operate at a very high level in research projects. The long-term problem, however, is the slow implementation of this knowledge in practice, due to complex bureaucracy.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The fund for science and research is one of the largest EU funds. It must therefore be our aim to simplify the bureaucracy involved in the transfer of research results as much as possible, and thus to provide maximum assistance to innovation, thereby strengthening the competitiveness of the EU. We must think how to deal with the commercial exploitation of the results of research projects within the framework of innovation measures. If we complicate the implementation of European research in the commercial sphere, we will find it hard to speed up the innovation cycle.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, research and innovation policy is one of the three main pillars of the polices of the European Union. I would also say that it will increasingly become a strategic tool that is absolutely essential for our future. Why? Because we have the good fortune, or the challenge, of living at the dawn of a change of civilisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Think about this. We need to ensure the conditions of a decent existence for all, not only here and now, but elsewhere, too, and for future generations. This, in itself, is already a major challenge. On top of this, however, for the first time in the history of mankind, we need to do this within the physical limits of the planet. This, of course, radically transforms the context.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our conviction is that Europe can be a world leader in this profound transformation, not only of our infrastructure and organisations, but also, and more importantly, of our way of producing, consuming and living. For us, it is by being right up there among the leaders that we will best ensure the competitiveness of the European Union. This gives me the opportunity to say that competitiveness is not an objective in itself. Our objective is to be in a position to meet the challenges which, let us not forget, threaten the very existence of mankind on this planet. If we are among the best, our competitiveness will, however, be assured.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A great many things have been said with which we agree. There are just two points I would like to raise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, we need to maximise the impact of each euro spent. This requires better alignment between the different EU policies and between what is done at the level of the European Union and what is done at the level of the Member States. This means that we need to progress from a logic where the general rule is subsidy and exemption, lending and risk sharing, to a logic where catalysing private investment by using public funds is a major objective. The best way of doing that is not always by contributing non-repayable money.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we must have the courage to put an end to a number of huge white elephants, such as the ITER project which, in fact, gobbles up a substantial amount of European research money – EUR 7 billion out of EUR 60 billion – just imagine! We need to put an end to that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Merkies for all her efforts and her coordination during the period in which this report was being negotiated among the political groups. I believe that she has done a very good job. I have three points to make.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am happy to see that the rapporteur has taken on board the role of broadband. The digital world and information and communication technologies are engines of innovation, and high-speed broadband should be an essential precondition for all European innovation partnerships.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, in the run-up to the FP8, we should further strengthen the monitoring and ex-post evaluation of results of EU-funded research and innovation activities. Thus, we see that Ms Merkies has quite correctly included in her report a paragraph calling on the Commission to develop an integrated indicator system that would allow better monitoring and assessment of progress and the measurable impact of innovation policies and programmes in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, a few days ago, the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, stated that Europeans are not innovative because they are depressed. That is, indeed, an innovative assumption, but I think it is a matter of character. We need to encourage a culture of learning, curiosity and risk-taking.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we are facing major societal challenges: the economic crisis, the ageing population, the scarcity of resources and the need to maintain our international competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="de">This makes it all the more important for us to promote innovation, which can counteract these problems by providing creative ideas and solutions. This is not just about introducing technical innovations, but also socio-political innovations. For example, in order to deal with the problem of the ageing population, we need so-called classic innovations, on the one hand, such as new drugs, and, on the other, we should be thinking about innovative models for society, pensions and healthcare systems. We need to create an environment today which promotes the innovations of tomorrow, including investment in research and development, protection for intellectual property, in particular, using patent legislation, and the encouragement of creative skills, starting in school classrooms.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to mention a particular problem relating to the use of resources. Innovations should ultimately ensure that products last longer. This will be of benefit to consumers and the environment. Unfortunately, there are also innovations which have the opposite effect. Products are developed with deliberate weak points which shorten their useful life and increase consumption, such as laptops and smart phones. The Innovation Union must help to combat this.</p>

      <p sl="de">We are largely in agreement on this issue. Over the years, we have adopted a large number of programmes and papers here, from the Lisbon strategy to Europe 2020, and many more. We have constantly said that the future of Europe will depend on whether we succeed in resolving the question of innovation. We all agree that this involves all aspects of education, training and research, and that the entrepreneurial side is also important. Nevertheless, it is true, as a previous speaker has just said, that other regions of the world are obviously able to mobilise talent and ideas more effectively than we can.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, we need to stop for at least a second or two to think about the reasons for this. Is it because we are providing too little funding or because we cannot find the right way of exploiting the potential that is there? This is what Mrs Merkies referred to in her speech.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to mention briefly one other issue. I was part of a delegation to California and one evening, we met with young entrepreneurs and people who wanted to start new companies. I will never forget that evening. Those young people’s eyes were shining, they were full of enthusiasm and they and others believed that they were capable of achieving something. They only asked for one thing. They wanted help for everyone who aimed to start up a business, so that they were given a chance, had the freedom to act, and did not spend all their time grappling with red tape.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will not forget this, because it was a very, very important signal for me. How can we increase the effectiveness of our investments in research? I believe that the contributions made by the European Research Council (ERC) and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) in the area of research are interesting and exciting and could produce good results. The questions concerning venture capital and people can probably best be answered if we as politicians do not attempt to evaluate all the questions, to come to a decision and to draw up guidelines. Perhaps only a few regulations are needed. As Mrs Merkies has said, less is often more.</p>

In the 2020 strategy, we acknowledged the fact that, if we are to maintain our level of prosperity in Europe, we need to increase our productivity. We therefore need to focus on innovation. However, it is important that we do not restrict innovation to research and technology. If we take innovation seriously, we must, first and foremost, invest in the human element. Innovation involves creative processes that can be taught and that should be included in the teaching methods used in the Member States, because we need workers with good suggestions for improvements to the job and solution models to tackle the new tasks. However, this means that we need to educate and provide further training for our workforce. We are also faced with the huge task of teaching businesses how they can best utilise the innovation potential of their workers. Worker-driven innovation is not only good for businesses, it is also good for job satisfaction, and it can help to reduce stress.

      <p sl="pt">Europe needs a sustainable and competitive economic model that responds to the major social challenges of today, and that ensures more and better jobs. The ‘Innovation Union’ initiative introduces a strategic European innovation policy that is integrated and oriented towards companies and people. The concept of innovation must go further than technological innovation: it must be associated with products, but also with processes, services, movements, systems and organisational structures.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In particular, social innovation aims to find new and effective solutions for pressing social needs. In addition, young people are the engine of innovation: we therefore need to implement policies that promote young people’s access to the labour market. It is also essential to create proper support mechanisms for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The success of innovation policy depends on the existence of a simple, efficient, unbureaucratic system for science and higher education. The proper financing of these two areas is a necessary condition for developing innovation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, given the target of 3% of gross domestic product for technological research and development, I call on the Commission to consider the possibility of establishing an effective EU-wide system for governing this target, in the light of what is happening with economic governance.</p>

The US is ahead of us, Japan is ahead of us, and Brazil, India and China are hot on our heels. I see the Innovation Union programme as a programme coming at one minute to midnight. In all likelihood, this is the last opportunity we will have to get a grip in the area of innovation, and to prevent those countries from catching up with us. Any failure in this area by Europe as a continent will have fatal consequences – as all the other Members have said – for the competitiveness of Europe, for the quality of life of its inhabitants and, ultimately, also for the values which Europe represents for the world.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am therefore pleased that the European Parliament has managed to initiate specific legislative measures, such as greater cooperation over the introduction of a European patent. I also consider the area of standardisation very important in relation to the introduction of innovations into practice, as well as their application by small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in the speech I made here in Strasbourg last November, I highlighted the significant differences that exist between the old and the new European Union Member States when it comes to financial support for the research and development sector. In the long term, this will result in substantial imbalances in the development of the individual European Union Member States, and in the phenomenon given the ugly name of ‘brain drain’ by journalists, which is mistakenly referred to as intellectual mobility in the report. In order to guarantee sustainable development in Europe – and I would emphasise the word sustainable – the EU must earmark more funding for the development of innovation and research projects in the new EU Member States, under the heading of sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is also worth encouraging the individual governments to increase the sums allocated from the budget each year to research, and also to set a minimum percentage of the budget which must be used for projects of this kind. A further key issue is the funding of innovation in the SME sector, upon which we should place much more emphasis.</p>

    <intervention id="3-666-000" speaker_id="28165" name="Lambert van Nistelrooij" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, the main challenge is to do things differently – in a much less fragmented way, to have much less parallel activity from the Member States and the European Union – and also to invest in a better-targeted way. I believe that businesses and the citizens are watching on. The report, and your proposal for the Innovation Union, generate expectations. Indeed, we should also expect a lot from it, but I still want to highlight a couple of points on the instrumental side, in particular, including those of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, we need to ensure that funding is made easier and there need to be more subsidies and incentives for venture capital. Secondly, we already have the funds, but they are ring-fenced and separately governed: the regional funds, the agricultural funds and so on. We need to move to a multi-fund approach. Will you agree with this in the forthcoming regulations? What kinds of proposals will this be covered by?</p>
      <p sl="nl">My next point is that we have just seen that investment in research and development largely ends up in the twelve ‘old’ Member States, so further distribution is required. A re-balancing is needed. How can you support businesses and citizens in the ‘new’ Member States in this regard?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I wanted to say that this is a process that we would like to help you consider. How will you now conduct the dialogue? It says in your communication that, at the end of 2011, you will hold a convention and take some other action. I have already had the opportunity to speak with you a couple of times, including in the form of a dialogue, at the knowledge for innovation summits in this House. How will you organise that from here on in? We want to see more of you. In fact, I have a lot of faith in that. You currently coordinate such things in the Commission and that did not happen in the past. Along with Mrs Merkies, we will keep a close eye on you.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Merkies for the excellently drafted report. To ensure that the Innovation Union initiative contributes to sustainable development, the education system needs to be modernised, the rules on accessing existing funds need to be simplified and converged, forecasts need to be made about the skills required, partnerships between universities and businesses need to be encouraged, along with standardisation, and intellectual property needs to be protected. However, broadband access is an absolute prerequisite for Innovation Union, given that it improves the level of citizens’ involvement.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We call for more funds for innovation, but I think that, for consistency’s sake, as we have also done in other cases, we must avoid prejudicing through this report the future of the cohesion policy, the common agricultural policy and the multiannual financial framework. I hope that this amendment will receive majority support tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, we call on the Commission to transpose the Union’s innovation policy into an action plan with specific objectives and measurable targets.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Merkies on her excellent work. I believe we have to invest more in innovation, research and knowledge, and we have to do so more boldly. Innovation must not be swallowed up by research. Innovation and research are not the same thing, and I welcome the fact that the report points out this strategic distinction.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report sets some important objectives: it targets ordinary people and workers through social innovation; it introduces measures to facilitate access to credit and finance for small and medium-sized enterprises; and, above all, it establishes an increasingly close and direct relationship linking together businesses, research centres and our universities.</p>
      <p sl="it">Facilitating and simplifying life for small and medium-sized enterprises through a one-stop shop and focusing on talent, creativity and innovative ideas are essential conditions for growth and development. Europe must take innovation policies seriously if we want to find a way out of the crisis and build a better future for our younger generations.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, at the moment, research and innovation are the privilege of the most developed Member States, which is detrimental to the European Union. The European Union must take this factor into account and foster the balance of potential innovative capabilities throughout the whole EU. Support must be given to new Member States to develop their research infrastructure by allocating additional resources, as Commissioner Quinn promised not so long ago. This is the only way we can be sure of preventing the gap between the east and west of the European Union from widening in terms of research and innovation, thereby enabling us to achieve our aim of creating a proper Innovation Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">An idea is being promoted for structural or agricultural funds for financing innovation and research. I think that this notion is neither feasible nor fair. A realistic solution is to create specific instruments which will be earmarked only for research and innovation.</p>

It is essential to the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises. Jobs are being created more actively today. It is essential to universities and laboratories, whose survival depends, in part, on their relationship with productive sectors. It is essential to the financial system, which will find a new market in innovation as the classic manufacturing model becomes exhausted.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Innovation is top of the European agenda and, as it is a pillar of the Europe 2020 strategy, it will have to be served by new financial instruments so that it does not succumb to budgetary constraints in the current situation.</p>

The European Union is at a difficult crossroads. On the one hand, we urgently need to address problems caused by the crisis while, on the other, we need to adopt measures now, so that we can find an adequate response and implement the long-term commitments we have made to counter challenges like climate change, energy security, food security, our ageing society, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In today’s global context, innovation policy has a huge impact on all areas of life and, in future, it will become the main pillar of economic, cultural and social development in the European Union. Hitherto, this policy has been fragmented and more oriented towards academic and scientific research, rather than transforming innovative ideas into real or adapted products or services that would stimulate growth and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I support the comprehensive approach to innovation policy and believe that together, we must establish a strategic and integrated European Union innovation policy that is geared to practical adaptation.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, innovation is one of the main driving forces of European competitiveness, without which it would be impossible to achieve our set strategic objectives. For example, there is a pressing need for innovation in the areas of public health and environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Union and the Member States must therefore provide financial or tax incentives to businesses and individuals, in order to focus on scientific and technical research and development in areas that are less lucrative but highly beneficial to the public. In my opinion, we are still allocating relatively small amounts of the budget to research and I would therefore also like to emphasise the need for financing instruments in this area in future EU budgets.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The area of European research would also be supported by the introduction of a single European patent which, besides protecting the intellectual property of innovators, would also have the potential to reduce lengthy and costly bureaucratic processes, and avoid repeat applications from one entity in all Member States.</p>

      <p sl="ro">To achieve this, however, we will need 1 million additional researchers at a time when many of them are attracted at the moment by non-European countries where there are mechanisms to remove the bottlenecks preventing ideas from reaching the market. The fragmentation of research systems and markets, the underuse of public procurement to stimulate innovation, the precarious nature of funding and the slow standardisation process are the problems which European Union countries are still faced with. However, we hope that they will be taken seriously if we want the Innovation Union programme to be one of the successes of the Europe 2020 strategy.

This means that globalisation and research are key factors in external competitiveness and economic growth. Additional factors include active commitment from SMEs and the involvement of European citizens.</p>

Therefore, I feel it is beneficial to initiate specific vocational training programmes, with a focus on innovation and encouraging creativity, aspects which can be nurtured, taught and enhanced at different stages of the training process. The European Commission must encourage and support Member States so that they include, to a larger extent, as part of the components making up national education systems, elements such as innovation and creativity, and encourage improvement in cooperation between education systems and the business world by developing new curricula and doctoral programmes, including at cross-border level.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, it is incumbent on us to sell the message to third-level educational institutions, research organisations and, indeed, private sector companies concerning the opportunities that are available under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for Research and Development. We must, at all times, highlight the benefits that can accrue to small and medium-sized companies under what is the largest publicly funded research programme in the world.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Support for research and innovation is vital for peripheral regions within the Union if they are to stay competitive in an increasingly globalised world. From an Irish perspective, the FP7 is helping to develop research that is, in turn, creating jobs and delivering new goods and services for our people. EUR 270 million has already been drawn down by Irish organisations in the agriculture, food, fisheries, health, energy, transport and ICT sectors.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In conclusion, I say that this is vitally important, particularly during these very difficult economic times, both in Ireland and throughout the Union.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, at a time of serious economic and social crisis, like that currently being experienced in a number of European Union Member States, a debate on innovation in all fields of knowledge and in all economic and social areas is welcome. However, it is necessary for this innovation to be guided by criteria of defending the public interest, improving people’s quality of life, promoting social welfare, and preserving the environment and the balance of nature.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this context, it is essential not to forget unemployment, which already affects around a quarter of young people, many of whom have been through higher education; not to forget that jobs are increasingly insecure, especially for women and young people; and not to forget the growth of poverty and social exclusion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, a recent GE survey established that 85% of key people believe that innovation is the way to future prosperity for the European Union. It is one thing to establish it, but another thing to make it a reality. That is the challenge facing us.</p>
      <p sl="en">I had the privilege of drawing up the draft opinion for the Committee on Culture and Education on the Innovation Union and I emphasised a number of points. One was the need to avoid duplication. This was prompted by an answer given by the Commissioner in her hearing, when she pointed out that one particular strain of salmonella was being researched by 40 different institutes – a clear case of a lack of joined-up thinking, and a waste of money. We also need productive cooperation between the various stakeholders. I saw a very good example of that at Santiago de Compostela University, which tracked research all the way until a new company was founded. Thirdly, we need to develop the European patent.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank all the Members who took part in the debate. I think everybody here agrees that we need to improve the conditions for innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most of the speakers talked about jobs. That is what Innovation Union is all about. It is about taking the very basic blue-sky research that we do so well in the European Union, and translating it all the way to the marketplace so that we provide the jobs here, and they are not provided abroad.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of speakers raised the role of the regions. This is really important and we need to develop synergies between research and innovation funding, on the one hand, and structural funds, on the other. Indeed, Ms Merkies underlines that point in her report. All the regions of Europe should play to their strengths. I will go in a couple of weeks’ time to Debrecen, in Hungary, to the ‘Week of innovative regions of Europe’ conference, where all the regions will come together to talk about the concept of smart specialisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of the less advanced regions can obviously gain from the networking and know-how that is fostered by research and innovation programmes while, of course, using structural funds to build up the research infrastructure facilities that they require.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr van Nistelrooij raised the matter of the Innovation Convention, and I would like to say that this is well advanced. As part of the preparation, we have invited Mr Reul, the Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, to talk about the committee’s representation at the heart of the Innovation Convention. Obviously, we have also invited representatives of the Member State governments, business leaders, stakeholders of all kinds, policy makers and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">We think this is very important because one of the things I consider essential in relation to innovation is that we should have a ‘living document’: in other words, that we will have the opportunity on a regular basis – in Parliament, internationally at the Innovation Convention, and also at Heads of State or Government level – to monitor progress and to insist, where the progress is slow, on speeding it up. That is very important if this initiative is going to be successful, to create the kind of jobs we want and to deliver what we expect it to deliver at the end of the day.</p>

We are in unison here: we want to boost economic growth and move towards a different, sustainable social model. We want to stimulate SMEs and start-ups; we want to update our skills in lifelong learning; we want social innovation. We want the money actually to be spent on research and development, not to be kept in the pocket.</p>
      <p sl="en">We agree that research is not a synonym for innovation; innovation stands on its own, though it might derive from research. Both are extremely important, but innovation needs to get an extra push. To clear up the issue of funding coming from the agricultural funds or the structural funds: the intention is not that we move funding from the CAP or the structural funds to the innovation funds, but that we pay attention to the horizontal aspect of innovation. We need innovation in agriculture and in regional policy too: we need it everywhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">So where do we go from here? Let us not end with this one report. We cannot let it end here. Let us take this onwards, together with the Member States. Let us really try to get a different mindset. Let us spend the money, but let us change the policy. Let us change our economic model, move towards a sustainable model and create jobs.</p>

In the Committee on Budgets, we are working on firmly implanting the Europe 2020 flagship in the European Union’s strategy through an independent financial framework. The Innovation Union is able to play a role in transforming the crisis-laden economy of Europe, which will be guided by sustainable job creation. If 3% of the EU’s GDP can really be earmarked for research and development by 2020, 3.7 million new jobs will be created, which would increase annual GDP by some EUR 800 million by 2025.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We must treat it as a fact that the key to and, at the same time, the only effective tool for the European Union’s economic recovery is research and innovation. This is why we must unanimously support Member States devoting 1% of their gross domestic product to research and technological development. Willingness to take risks is a prerequisite for successful innovation, but this does not mean a risky investment for Member States now. The return is guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In order to maintain European competitiveness, a change of approach is needed, the key drivers of which are enhancing innovation potential and encouraging more people in Europe to become entrepreneurs. This is why we revised the Small Business Act, making it consistent with the Single Market Act, which is able to show synergy with the Innovation Union as well. Our measures must be harmonised, because this way, efficiency is also increased many fold.</p>

I would stress the role played by education, vocational training and social research (into the fight against poverty and social exclusion) within the framework of this initiative. It is important to simplify the administrative procedures involved in submitting applications for EU programmes in the field of scientific research and innovation in such a way as to make it possible for more enterprises and scientific institutions to take part in them. Simplified procedures will also ensure that public funds are used more effectively and efficiently, and that the administrative burden is reduced.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Innovation policy should go hand-in-hand with policy in the field of vocational training and the labour market. New products and services are intended to help increase employment levels and promote the forecasting of future trends and the qualifications needed on the labour market. In view of the fact that women account for only 30% of European researchers and only 13% of directors of European research institutions, I would highlight the need for the ‘Innovation Union’ initiative to take account of future guidelines as regards a more balanced representation of women and men in scientific disciplines. I would also call for such guidelines to be implemented effectively by the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I am delighted that, in advance of the next General Assembly of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), we can debate this welcome initiative of the ILO proposing to the Member States of this organisation a convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, on behalf of the entire Parliament, I would like to thank you for agreeing to conduct this debate in the run-up to this conference. We believe this is best practice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As we know, domestic work officially accounts for between 5 and 9% of all employment in the European Union. Looking at what we have collectively endorsed with the Europe 2020 strategy, it is clear that what are termed local jobs, namely, those that enable us to take care of our elderly citizens and those that enable women with young children to get back into work, correspond to situations that enable this domestic work to develop.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that, within the European Union, it is essential that we support this welcome initiative of the ILO, since the development of our societies is fraught with tendencies – we know what they are. Global demand for domestic services will go on increasing, but we cannot, on the one hand, welcome the adoption of a decent work agenda by the ILO and, on the other, leave an entire section of the labour market totally unregulated and unprotected by any legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union must set an example. I know that, at times, we have a tendency to think that the conventions of the ILO are perhaps not for us. No. We, too, must lead the way on this point. In the area of domestic work, I believe that the ILO offers us an excellent opportunity for shedding light on the operation of some of our labour markets, since domestic work is too often precarious work, undervalued and undeclared. I will tell you quite simply. I understand that some of you have expressed concern about the recognition or regularisation of illegal migrants, but I am also concerned with the battle we have to fight in each Member State against undeclared work. In the area of domestic work, we know how these practices have, unfortunately, developed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We hope that, next June, on the basis of a tripartite negotiation, the 100th session of the International Labour conference will set this convention and this recommendation in motion. We believe that they are essential for transforming what is too often a relationship of exploitation into a legal relationship. We hope that the legal recognition of domestic work can be achieved. Those who work with our elderly citizens and children must enjoy the freedom to associate and rest time and must not be victims of harassment and arbitrariness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must also ensure that this tool, which we are proposing to the ILO, will enable us to define, in this area, what we mean by the notion of decent work, whether with regard to the question of working hours, the question of paid leave, or the question of housing conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to know how the European Commission intends to approach these negotiations and this draft convention, and on the basis of what mandate it will act on behalf of all of us, so that tomorrow, in the area of domestic work, the European Union can set an example and that we, too, can give expression to the values of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I welcome today’s discussion on a new ILO instrument for domestic workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is an important contribution to the second round of discussions on the new international standards which will probably be adopted in a few weeks’ time at the 100th session of the International Labour conference.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the European Commission is a firm supporter of the ILO’s decent work agenda. The Commission closely monitors and facilitates coordination among the Member States and has worked for the speedy ratification of a number of important instruments adopted in the last decade.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many reasons for developing new standards in the area of domestic work. For instance, there are a large number of domestic workers across the world, many of them belonging to vulnerable groups. Their precarious status and the fact that they often fall within the informal sector are also very important issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the European Union, employment in this sector is very likely to expand, given population change and higher female participation in the labour market. That is why it is crucial to raise domestic workers’ professional profile and improve their image.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now look at the practical issues raised by the question and first explain the Commission’s role in the ILO negotiations on a new convention and recommendation on decent work.</p>
      <p sl="en">The institutional context needs to be borne in mind. The new instrument will be an international agreement. The Commission will therefore fulfil the role conferred on it by the Treaty with due regard for the special features of the ILO, where the European Union has observer status only – unlike the Member States which are members. That is why the Union cannot ratify ILO conventions itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission followed the discussions actively and facilitated coordination among the experts of the Member States during the first round of discussions at the ILO in 2010. It has analysed the instruments as they developed during the negotiations in the light of EU legislation. The Commission was attentive, in particular, to any sections of the draft convention that could affect freedom of movement for workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the new ILO Convention will comprise matters of EU competence, the Member States need to comply with the EU acquis.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the next and final round of discussions in June, the Commission will continue to play an active coordination and facilitation role by working with Member State experts. My departments have been in contact with the social partners and a number of NGOs that have approached the Commission, and have had exchanges with the rapporteur for the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the professionalisation of domestic work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, there is the question of the role of Europe 2020 in ensuring that precarious domestic jobs are transformed into decent sustainable jobs. We need to bear in mind the sector’s potential in terms of job creation and reconciling work and family responsibilities, and thus its role in meeting the objectives of the employment strategy. However, we must not forget the need to ensure that domestic jobs – not all of which should be regarded as precarious and undervalued or underpaid – are indeed decent jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is more, the fight against undeclared work, which is widespread in the domestic work sector, is an integral part of the Europe 2020 strategy as the first annual growth survey has confirmed. Ways of moving from informal or undeclared work to regular employment will be covered by the guiding principles on enabling conditions for job creation which the Commission announced in the communication on the Europe 2020 flagship initiative, ‘An agenda for new skills and jobs’. We will be putting forward those guiding principles next year. A number of Member States have useful experience in working to reduce the informal sector and precarious employment, for example, by introducing service voucher systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, there is the question of amending the current framework legislation on health and safety at work – Directive 89/391/EEC – and on combating discrimination – Directive 2000/78/EC.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is worth pointing out that the definition of domestic workers in the draft ILO Convention is very wide. It not only covers persons working in private households, but also for them, as well as persons employed by employment agencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Domestic servants are excluded from the definition of workers in the framework directive on health and safety at work. However, the EU legislator seems to have intended that the concept of domestic servants be interpreted narrowly, so not all domestic servants under the Convention are excluded from the scope of the EU health and safety at work acquis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, EU occupational and safety and health legislation provides minimum requirements and does not, therefore, prevent any Member State from introducing more stringent measures at national level. Consequently, the Member States are free to include domestic servants within the scope of their national legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the time being, the Commission has no plans to amend the framework directive on occupational safety and health. Nevertheless, the Commission considers that the current ILO initiative is a good opportunity to reflect on the situation of domestic servants in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would add that Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation does not exclude domestic workers, so no amendment is needed for the ratification of the ILO Convention. The Commission issued a report on the application of the directive in 2008 and will continue to follow its implementation in the Member States closely.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fourth point concerns ways of informing domestic workers of, and strengthening, their rights. Although not all domestic workers are low-skilled and do not all work in precarious conditions, they are a vulnerable category and the Commission encourages the Member States to ensure they are properly protected by developing and enforcing their labour rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission expects the problem of undeclared work by non-EU nationals to be dealt with in part by the Employers’ Sanctions Directive 2009/52/EC, which the Member States have to transpose into national legislation by 20 July this year. The directive will help to end the exploitation of illegally staying third-country nationals by some employers who pay them inadequate salaries and impose unsatisfactory working conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">One step forward would be agreement on the proposal for a directive on a single permit which provides for a common set of rights for third country workers residing legally in a Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now turn to the fifth and last point regarding the Commission’s role in promoting exchanges of best practice involving policy on domestic workers. In this connection, I want to mention a private project which the Commission is currently implementing at the request of this House, and which seeks to encourage the conversion of precarious work into work associated with rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following a call for proposals issued under the pilot project in 2010, the Commission is co-funding a project that focuses on the consequences of the economic and financial crisis for precarious domestic, migrant and young workers, and on Member State measures to improve their rights. The project encourages exchanges of best practice, in particular, involving precarious workers’ collective representation. A second call for proposals, to be issued this year, will relate more specifically to action to improve the rights of the poorest workers, including domestic workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The pilot project will also involve a study to gain a better understanding of precarious work in 12 Member States, and to promote its conversion into employment relationships carrying more social rights, in particular, by looking at what the Member States can do in practical terms to encourage this transformation and identify a core of basic social rights. A case study of the situation of migrant domestic workers in Italy was carried out recently in connection with a project on decent work and industrial relations cofinanced by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the Senior Labour Inspectors Committee have called for sector-wide information and awareness-raising campaigns on the protection of workers’ health and safety.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the European People’s Party is very pleased by today’s debate. I believe thanks are due to Mrs Berès for initiating it, enabling us to join the ILO initiative, on the one hand, and, on the other, making us think about all that needs to be done for a category of workers whose conditions we often do not know about and, when we do know something, it tends to be depressing.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We also believe that the draft decision which has been published deserves support, and we think that those elements are particularly good which underscore and highlight that the aim here is to create decent working conditions and regulated employment in a field where, indeed, mainly migrant workers are concerned, particularly in certain countries, in a totally unregulated and uncontrolled manner, and very often in the form of a kind of modern slavery.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We have already mentioned that there are black holes in labour law regulation. This was discussed in connection with atypical contracts. Obviously, this could be a subsequent step towards being able to guarantee minimum working conditions and other rights linked to employment, and I agree with the Commissioner that of course, we ought to put our own house in order first. While welcoming the ILO initiative, what we ourselves can do is to call on the Member States of the European Union to do all they possibly can in their own labour law regulations in order to expose this black hole and regulate it accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, the first thing that I wish to say is that all the socialist delegates subscribe to the words uttered by Pervenche Berès, Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and we are very pleased about the position just taken by the Commissioner on this initiative of the International Labour Organisation (ILO).</p>
      <p sl="es">The socialist delegates appreciate enormously the work that the ILO has been doing since it started. We believe that it has made an invaluable contribution to the history of humanity and also of Europe. There is, too, no doubt that this new initiative on domestic work is very important, because there is a very large number of people who do this type of work and because it also very much affects women and immigrants.</p>
      <p sl="es">We, the socialist delegates, believe that it would be very good if, at the next meeting in June, this draft convention and recommendation were to be approved and if Parliament, the Commission and the Council were to be active – not just passive but active – so that Europe measures up to what it says and its actions reflect its words.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we do this, we will be helping – at least – to extend the Decent Work programme. We will be helping the world and many people, but primarily we will also be helping ourselves to be decent and to respect each other as an institution and as Europeans, but also so that our continent maintains its social model, which is impossible to maintain if we are an island of protection and rights within a world of misery and lack of protection.</p>
      <p sl="es">Perhaps, Commissioner, it is also time for the Commission, the Council and for all of us to reflect on Europe because not everything is resolved here, either. In Europe, there are contractual forms that affect immigrants and women in this area of domestic service which are very precarious and contain major loopholes.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would be pleased if, in the heat of this debate and deliberation, we were to understand that there are certain loopholes that must be closed in legislation in the EU and also in many Member States. We have problems regarding the health and safety of these workers. We have problems in many countries regarding the legal forms according to which the work is developing. Furthermore, we also have a major problem in the fight against abuse and discrimination against immigrants, many of whom work in European families.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have many initiatives in hand at the moment. Commissioner, now would be the time to enhance our ethical commitment to assist the ILO, to help ourselves, and to perform work which is worthy for the future of humanity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I think it is important for us to have this discussion in the light of the upcoming adoption of an ILO Convention on Domestic Workers. I believe that we in this House should commend the ILO for its excellent work.</p>
      <p sl="de">Domestic work – family caring, for example – takes place exclusively in the family home. Traditionally, of course, in the EU, it was women’s work, although that is changing. Migrants and people from more marginalised communities are also more likely to work in a domestic situation. The value of domestic work is not included in our GDP calculations and, for that reason among others, domestic work is very often invisible and is certainly undervalued. Without any doubt, this leaves domestic workers in a precarious position, and very often they have to rely on the goodwill of employers. This is simply not acceptable. As we say in the resolution, it leaves domestic workers more likely to face discrimination and, indeed, multiple forms of discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="de">The importance of this ILO Convention is that it will provide legal recognition of domestic work as work. Following on from that, domestic workers should be in a stronger position to exercise their rights. I think it is crucial that domestic workers have a right to core labour standards. That, of course, includes access to social security, health and safety protection and maternity protection, as well as provisions on working and rest time.</p>
      <p sl="de">Because domestic work takes place largely within the family home, there can be issues of privacy involved. We need to find innovative and workable solutions to ensuring the health and safety of domestic workers and, in the overall context, to ensure that their rights are fully respected. One solution might be the use of model contracts. In the canton of Geneva, for example, there is a model contract which is automatically entered into by all employers and employees: it deals, inter alia, with issues such as the minimum wage, family allowances and holidays. I believe that contracts of a similar type operate in Belgium. They give greater security to domestic workers, simplify matters for employers and eliminate grey areas and ambiguities.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also want to say that I am very happy to support the amendments from the Green Group where they talk about the inclusion of au pairs and undeclared work, but come forward with practical suggestions to ensure we are proactive in ensuring access to the open labour market for domestic workers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I want to support the author of the resolution, Ms Berès, when she says that the European Union should lead the way on improving conditions for domestic workers. Commissioner, I was interested in your words on occupational health and safety and, even though you do not foresee extending the directive, I think your comments leave some scope for flexibility in ensuring better health and safety conditions for domestic workers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate Ms Berès for taking the initiative on this oral question and resolution. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his answer. It is all too rare that we get a very specific response from Commissioners to questions in an oral question.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group very much welcomes the proposal from the ILO for the Convention and the recommendation on domestic workers. We are aware that at least 20 of our own Member States have already commented on the draft and been actively involved in this. We look forward to early ratification by those Member States and, indeed, some interesting implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">People have talked very much about how this group of workers is particularly vulnerable. A lot of the work is done behind closed doors; it is invisible. Often, the workers themselves are isolated, and access to trade unions is often very difficult in this situation. Quite often, if you are taken on as a live-in employee, you can be seen as being on call 24/7. We know in this House that on-call working is a very controversial issue and something that we do not particularly welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">As has been said, domestic work is often undervalued, or seen as traditional women’s work that ‘anybody can do’, but we have also made the point that a lot of it is actually quite skilled. It can quite often involve nursing care and various aspects of child development. Domestic workers often occupy a real position of trust. While many employers value that, there are only too many who do not. For example, in the UK we have seen a recent case of somebody actually ending up with a prison sentence on a charge of trafficking for domestic servitude. The young woman involved lost four years of her life to her employer, who received a nine-month sentence. So we need to look at how we identify that form of trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="en">Migrant female workers are very vulnerable indeed. We have come across cases, for example, of workers entering the country with diplomats and having their passport taken away; people in that situation have virtually no freedom, have no access to assistance and do not know about their rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to raise one issue concerning Article 17 in the proposed Convention, which is about the role of agencies. I think this is something that we really should be looking at at European level because, increasingly, it is being seen as a weak link in many of the issues that we are facing.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I understand from what you have said, Mr Andor, that the European Commission is obviously taking notice of this subject. I also conclude that it is being handled with too much restraint.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not the case, as Mr Őry emphasised previously in this discussion, that we know too little about what domestic workers in Europe do. On the contrary, we know so much that there is an urgent need for regulation. Between 5% and 9% of all employees work in private households. This is the worst paid group of employees in Europe, with the fewest rights and the largest proportion of illegal workers. Action is urgently needed in this area and this includes the European Commission. The situation we currently find ourselves in will not be improved by the free movement of workers. For this reason, the initiative in this International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention is very welcome and deserves our support.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to comment on four points. Firstly, there are gaps in the definitions in the ILO Convention. If domestic workers cannot work occasionally, sporadically or not on an occupational basis in this sector, then the opportunities for circumventing the legislation are already in place. Secondly, there is an urgent need for mandatory employment contracts in this area. Thirdly, we must have not only sensible, generally binding minimum wage regulations, but also equal employment rights. Fourthly, these workers must be covered by a statutory social security obligation, in particular, given that this is a minimum wage sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am pleased that Mrs Berès has called in her statement for a campaign to introduce standard working conditions. This is a good thing. We must ensure in future that work which does not pay a living wage is outlawed by society and is no longer tolerated.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, according to a report from the International Labour Organisation, domestic work represents around 5% of the total number of jobs. It is a kind of invisible form of employment, which is not carried out in factories, shops or offices, but in the homes of private individuals. Women account for 90% of the workers, and do not work in a collective, but alone, in houses. The aim of their work is not to produce added value, but to provide care or services similar to the tasks which women usually carry out free of charge in their own homes.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The work is therefore financially undervalued and is often not considered to be normal employment under labour law, as a result of which workers are exposed to unauthorised and unfair treatment. The work is very often undeclared, and workers who come from rural areas or from abroad have low qualifications, do not know their rights, and become vulnerable individuals. Undeclared work deprives workers of social protection and deprives society of social security contributions. If we do not want domestic work to remain undeclared, we should turn this work into a proper profession and overcome the usual stereotypes, which often present such work to us as valueless.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We should therefore professionalise it. For that, however, we need to introduce new measures into the employment systems of individual Member States, including specific regulations in the area of tax, social security, and employment and civil rights which take into account the specific nature of work performed in this way. There are generally financial reasons behind the current tendency to provide and perform undeclared domestic work, because undeclared work is more advantageous to both parties than officially registered work which, besides tax and deductions, burdens both parties with extensive bureaucratic demands.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The aim of Member State measures should therefore be to amend or even eliminate the advantages of undeclared work, so that domestic work becomes a specific form of dignified employment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would first of all like to thank Mrs Berès, Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for allowing us to have this debate in the run-up to the conference of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and Commissioner Andor for agreeing to conduct this debate between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would first like to highlight an initial point. Many have discussed our knowledge, or our lack of knowledge, of this world of domestic work. Simply, when we say, with some hesitation, that domestic workers account for between 5% and 9% of all workers, that means that we do not know the world of domestic work. The ratio is 1:2. I therefore call for our provisions to enable us, at European level, to gain a better understanding of the world of domestic work so that we can guarantee it better.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point I would like to make is that, while we have established the Europe 2020 strategy and we know that, in this Europe 2020, low-level jobs will be particularly under threat, we have to do everything here, in this world of domestic work, to ensure that specialisations are absolutely recognised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Lambert said just now that a lot of domestic work is quite skilled, and we must identify such work and promote it and promote the skills involved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third point is that Europe cannot be founded on values of human rights and social rights and develop the relevant EU acquis without also developing the protection of wages, the protection of working hours, the protection of health, knowledge of the demands of domestic work, and without providing domestic workers with a certain number of guarantees. I wish to sound a word of warning, which is that this should not lead to the integration of workers that are in a totally illegal situation. We also need to know how to prevent the values we defend from being hijacked.</p>

I should like to congratulate the Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Berès, on this initiative which enables us to debate a very important subject. I would also thank you for your involvement, Commissioner, and for the sensitivity you have demonstrated.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Domestic work is economically and socially important, but it is work that is poorly paid, routine and undervalued by society. It has already been said that domestic work is mainly carried out by women, who are subjected to all kinds of discrimination. In fact, on the subject of discrimination, I should like to mention that, in my report on the revision of the Maternity Leave Directive, I advocate the inclusion of domestic workers within the scope of the directive.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Domestic workers are currently excluded from the Maternity Leave Directive and from any European legislation guaranteeing the right to maternity protection, and they are not even covered by the Health and Safety Framework Directive. This is unacceptable discrimination that must be put right.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This International Labour Organisation Convention is therefore welcome and should be supported, in order to dignify domestic work and give these women the rights that other women have.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, a series of studies being carried out by the Member States illustrates that domestic workers face various problems, including low wages, discrimination, a heavy workload, conduct unbecoming on the part of employers and even sexual harassment. These problems are compounded by the fact that they are not treated as employees and therefore have no protection under international conventions or EU case-law. The term ‘domestic worker’ therefore urgently needs to be changed to ‘domestic employee’ and the question of contracts and terms of employment urgently needs to be regulated.</p>
      <p sl="el">Approval of an ILO Convention on domestic workers would be a first step in plugging the existing gap, by safeguarding rights in connection with their employment, pay rises, the adoption of criteria for employers or even by clarifying that domestic employees need not necessarily stay in the employer’s home. As part of this endeavour, the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States, should seek to amend existing legislation, so as to cover domestic employees and, most importantly, to encourage cooperation between the Member States and exchanges of best practices.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, in Germany, domestic workers are not covered by employment protection legislation. They are also not included in the European framework directive. The reason for this is that the state is not allowed to monitor compliance with regulations in private residences. There are similar obstacles in other Member States. A total of 15 of them have not included domestic workers in their employment protection laws.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, these workers do deserve special protection. I am therefore in favour of adopting the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention, but I do not think it would be sensible to incorporate large parts of the convention into EU law. This would prevent the national parliaments from making independent decisions on the ratification of individual ILO conventions. Nevertheless, I would like to thank the ILO working groups for their excellent work.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are still a few problems, for example, in the definitions. Article 1 should cover not only domestic work, but also household services. The article concerning rest periods is also problematic. Every employee must be given one rest day per week, but this does not have to be in the same week. The Member States must come to individual agreements on the time periods, because a certain amount of flexibility is needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">The ban on payments in kind which are directly related to work, such as uniforms, tools or protective equipment, seems to me to be incomprehensible. I suspect that what is meant is that they must not be deducted from pay. In other words, we need a ban on deducting payments in kind from wages.</p>
      <p sl="de">Once these inconsistencies have been resolved, I believe that we should sign the ILO Convention on domestic workers. Thank you very much, Mrs Berès, for your initiative, and thanks to all of those who have said that they want to attempt to make progress on behalf of people who, as we all know, deserve protection.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I welcome the initiative to adopt a supplement to the International Labour Organisation Convention through the recommendation on domestic workers. I should mention that they account for 9% of the total workforce, but do not enjoy the same social guarantees. Failure to declare these activities is detrimental to both the workers and the state, which cannot levy taxes on them. I think that this category of worker is particularly vulnerable to abuse from employers. In many cases, domestic workers are immigrants without papers, which prevents them from contacting the authorities whenever they are exploited. I call on the Commission to adopt as urgently as possible a package of measures intended to protect and provide them with information. Close cooperation is required between national authorities and European institutions, with the aim of improving working conditions for this category of worker.</p>

As a result of the economic crisis, the unemployment rate has risen to roughly 10%, with the youth unemployment rate even reaching 20%. In many Member States, economic recovery programmes have entailed a reduction in health budgets, which has also lead to many employees being made redundant in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Failure to declare domestic care or cleaning services deprives these workers of the chance of a decent living and, especially, a decent pension. Given that the workers in these sectors are mainly women who are generally responsible for their own family, both in terms of raising children and looking after elderly relatives, I would like to ask the Commission whether any statistics are available on domestic workers at EU level and the level of each Member State.

It is, therefore, of the greatest importance to tackle this problem.</p>

      <p sl="de">Posted workers immediately come to mind. One example of this is Berlin, where the unions have set up an advisory centre for posted workers. The largest group of workers who contact this centre, not only from Berlin but from throughout Germany, are nurses who are employed as domestic workers, sometimes in appalling and highly precarious working conditions. This is one way of circumventing minimum working conditions. Some of these people even have bogus self-employed status. This is why we have tabled this amendment. The majority of these people are workers from other EU Member States and from third countries.

      <p sl="en">But the discussion also showed that many of the employment and social policies we are dealing with apply to domestic workers, although they are regarded as constituting a separate group.</p>
      <p sl="en">Skills development, health and safety, decent wages and social security, the development of contractual arrangements – and I could continue this list, of course – are all aspects which have to be covered in the context of domestic work, and indeed the European Union must be a leader globally as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to work very closely with Member States, because many possibilities for action can be found at Member State level, and we continue with the exchange of best practices in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I mentioned in my introductory statement, we are currently implementing a pilot project, at the request of Parliament, to convert precarious work into decent employment, and two calls for proposals have been launched already. The second, issued earlier this year, is specifically a call for action to strengthen the rights of poorest workers, and there will be a study to better understand the phenomenon of precarious work as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the question on health and safety legislation and how it applies to domestic workers, the Commission at this moment does not plan to extend the scope of the Health and Safety Directive but we now have an opportunity to think about new rules on domestic workers as a group. It is important to note that Member States can, of course, introduce more stringent national rules. They can, for example, include domestic workers in national rules and go beyond the minimum requirements.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we have an important chance to tackle the growing problem of antibiotic resistance in animals responsibly and with commitment. This is a strategic issue for the agriculture sector and, in particular, for the future of the European animal husbandry system.</p>
      <p sl="it">The data show that around 50% of the antibiotics in Europe are prescribed for animal use. If used properly, antibiotics are a useful tool that helps farmers keep their livestock healthy and productive and safeguard its welfare. Therefore, we are not here to demonise antibiotic use in animal husbandry, but we want to ask the Commission to provide a concrete response for the more efficient and effective use of antibiotics, in order to reduce resistance in animals.</p>
      <p sl="it">In our resolution of 5 May 2010 on the EU Action Plan for Animal Welfare, this House underlined the link between animal welfare, animal health and public health, and urged the Commission and the Member States to address the difficult problem of antibiotic resistance in animals in a responsible manner. In particular, we called on the Commission to collect and analyse data on the use of all animal health products, including antibiotics, with a view to ensuring the effective use of such products. A year later, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour to chair, is here to ask the Commission to implement all relevant initiatives to resolve this long-standing problem, which can also have consequences for human health.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is needed, Madam President and Commissioner, is a tangible commitment from the Commission that it will use the data collected to put the results obtained into practice, not only encouraging research and monitoring activities, but also ensuring more effective use of antibiotics as an important tool for fighting animal diseases.</p>
      <p sl="it">On that front, I would point out that some studies show that low-energy animal feed could lead to a higher incidence of diseases and, hence, more antibiotic use. It would therefore be desirable to review the ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, in line with the opinion of the European Scientific Veterinary Committee. These are the requests made in the resolution adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 12 April this year and which will be put to the vote in this Chamber tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="it">It has been hard work for the last few months, and for that reason I would like to personally thank Mrs Paulsen, the shadow rapporteurs and all the parliamentary groups for their invaluable contributions to establishing a common text on this issue. The future competitiveness of European animal husbandry may depend on how this problem is managed, and its cross-cutting nature calls for commitment and responsibility, through a coordinated approach and a shared political will.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first, I would like to emphasise that the Commission is fully aware of, and correspondingly concerned by, the threat to public health posed by antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</p>
      <p sl="en">In reply to the first question, in 2009, the Commission asked the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to take a lead in collecting comparable data on the use of antimicrobials in animals. The project, the European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption (ESVAC), started in the third quarter of 2009. The EMA has worked together with the Member States, EU agencies and relevant stakeholders to develop the system. Findings from the data available from 10 Member States will be published as soon as possible. Twelve additional Member States are voluntarily starting to collect these data. The aim is to broaden the system to cover all EU Member States. A further aim is to have data on a more detailed level – at animal species level, for example.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why do we need these data? We need them in order to adopt a science-based approach: only on the basis of this type of data can scientists properly assess the true risk of AMR attributed to the use of antimicrobials in animals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the second question, I can assure the honourable Members that the Commission is aware that the control of AMR requires a multi-disciplinary approach. Therefore, the Commission consults its own services, Member States’ relevant agencies and other stakeholders on an ongoing basis, for example, through meetings and public consultations. The Commission is working on AMR in close collaboration with its relevant agencies, in particular, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the European Food Safety Authority, the EMA and the European Union Reference Laboratory for AMR.</p>
      <p sl="en">In reply to the third and last question, I would like to announce that the Commission is developing a five-year strategy on AMR. This strategy will adopt a holistic approach and will contain concrete proposals for further action to address the issue of AMR in relation to public and animal health. The strategy will be based on the Council conclusions and recommendations on AMR and on the outcome of the consultations I have already mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Work on the revision of EU rules on veterinary medicinal products and medicated feeding stuffs is ongoing. New tools and instruments to tackle AMR are being considered, for example, as options in the impact assessment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Based on the evidence gathered, the Commission will decide the details of its legal proposal. Our objective is to present this Commission strategy on 18 November 2011, which will be European Antibiotic Awareness Day.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Andor, firstly, I would like to thank the chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr De Castro, for his initiative and for the question to the Commission on this important issue. Mr Andor, after listening to your speech, I would first of all like to ask you to move from theory to practice, because we need to take concrete action.</p>
      <p sl="de">Antibiotic resistance is a subject which we must take seriously and which, hitherto, has had too little attention paid to it in the context of animal husbandry. Antimicrobial agents are undoubtedly very useful when properly used. They help farmers to keep their animals healthy and productive and also ensure high levels of animal welfare. In order to make sure that antibiotics remain effective in combating disease in animals and in humans, we must take a coordinated approach at an EU level.</p>
      <p sl="de">In recent weeks, we have held intensive discussions on this subject in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and we have considered it in detail. The joint resolution was adopted by the committee on 12 April with a large majority: 34 votes in favour and 2 against. The excellent cooperation with all the shadow rapporteurs from the different groups has resulted in a very balanced and well thought-out text, which we must adhere to, and I would ask you to do so, during the vote in plenary tomorrow. The report is balanced because it focuses on animal welfare, the problems of antibiotic resistance and cost-effectiveness as far as the farms are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I would once again like to thank everyone involved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and also Mrs Paulsen for the fruitful cooperation. I would now like to see the Commission take action.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the consequences of using antibiotics to treat animal diseases are well known and increasingly worrying. It is an area that is already subject to fairly demanding standards, to which the European Parliament has also been dedicating attention, and on which many positive initiatives are being realised, such as the network for collecting data on antibiotic resistance. However, these initiatives are still not enough.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore call on the Commission not just to improve the monitoring mechanisms, but also to adopt the measures necessary for wider-ranging data collection, and for the series of incentives encouraging best practices in this area to be included in the common agricultural policy legislative package that is being drawn up.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The text of the resolution tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, whose most important recommendations received broad support, as my colleague, Mrs Jeggle, has just confirmed, deserves detailed analysis by the Commission. Above all, the recommendations need to be translated into concrete measures to better defend public health and the image of the quality of European products of animal origin.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we have done a fantastic job in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. It is rare for a politically mixed gathering to be as much in agreement as we were this time.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Antibiotic resistance is, in fact, the biggest threat to both animal and human health that we face. At one time, infectious diseases were the most common cause of death in children, young people and young animals. In this regard, do not forget that both animals and people are mammals. We have the same immune defences and we have the same sensitivity to stress, which means that if we do not feel well, our immune defences are impaired and we need antibiotics because we will be more susceptible to serious infections.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We considered this with regard to human medicine. We took measures, we tried to tighten up our use of antibiotics and to understand what could happen. Do not forget that if we lose antibiotics as a weapon, we will be back to the time of our great grandmothers when what we currently think of as trivial infectious diseases, such as a small child’s ear inflammation, could once again become fatal diseases. This is not something that is particularly easy to deal with in this respect and we should be taking it seriously. As I said, I am extremely pleased.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There are, of course, some details of this resolution that I would have liked to have more of or that I would have liked to be different, but the main thing is not that all of the commas are in place; what is important is our collective will to start the process. That is what I hope the Commission will take on board, because I believe that we will get an almost unanimous ‘yes’ tomorrow. I hope so, and I hope that this will be a strong signal that makes you sit up and listen. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for bringing this issue up.</p>
      <p sl="en">I share his concerns at the level of antibiotic resistance being found in bacterial infections of livestock. I agree with him that there should be growing concern that there is evidence of overspill to the human population, where we are finding that the efficacy of many once-reliable antibiotics has declined significantly, thereby putting human health at risk. So I support the intent of the debate. I also agree that the important first step must be to work closely with the various agencies and the pharmaceutical industry in order to monitor and assess the problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to state, however, that, contrary to popular opinion, this is not exclusively a problem brought about by intensive agriculture. The random use of antibiotics in agriculture is – or has been – common to all farming, be it large or small. Indeed, I would go further and say that large-scale producers today are usually vertically integrated under contractual terms with the processing sector, and that the prophylactic use of antibiotics is usually prohibited or restricted under quality assurance schemes.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is clear that there must be some measure of control, and I look forward to hearing details of the Commissioner’s strategy in due course. There are three points that I want to make. Firstly, any measures taken must be based on sound scientific evidence; secondly, they must be proportionate; and, thirdly, they should not place a further burden of regulation, and thereby cost, on the agricultural and veterinary industries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very serious issue. It is of great importance not only for animal husbandry in future, but also primarily for human health. We must not forget this. This is ultimately not a problem for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. However, as has once again become clear, we do not have enough data. Only 10 Member States have provided information and that is too few. We need to deal with this subject rather more quickly and we need accurate controls.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are paying too little attention to one factor in this context and that is intensive farming, both in large-scale buildings and in certain regions. We need to look at this and we can do something to prevent it. By restructuring our agricultural policy, we can make sure that the focus is on good animal welfare, that animals live in conditions suitable for their species, and that the animals are strong and robust, on the principle that prevention is better than cure.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we also need, and this is a job for the Commission, is a long-term plan to reduce the use of antibiotics in agriculture. The main impact of antibiotic resistance is on workers in the agriculture industry, in other words, farmers and their employees. These people already have huge problems in this area. Another cause for concern is the suspicion that antibiotic resistance is being transferred directly via foodstuffs. We need to look carefully at this in the interests of the health of the European population. There is an urgent need for action here.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important to make it clear that 50% of all antibiotics are used in animal husbandry, which is far too much. Therefore, we must ensure that this figure is reduced in the long-term interests of agriculture and of public health.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, World Health Day, celebrated on 7 April, had as its theme this year antibiotic resistance, regarded as a global threat to public health. Every year, 25 000 people die across Europe from causes associated with antimicrobial resistance. Animals and food of animal origin could play a role in the development of antimicrobial resistance in people. This is why the resolution being debated today is an important document.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The most important word in any discussion on this subject is ‘caution’. It is not antibiotics which are bad, but their uncalculated and immoderate use is dangerous. Antibiotics must not be demonised, but used with caution in both people and animals. The measures proposed by this resolution on providing more information to vets and farmers must therefore be implemented as vigorously as possible. With regard to imposing a ban on the use of antibiotics as additives in animal feed, this must be subject without fail to international agreement.</p>
      <p sl="ro">A recent study highlights that in the United States, almost half of the samples of meat tested in stores contained Staphylococcus aureus, half of which were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics. This demonstrates the widespread use of antibiotics in animal husbandry, and I must say that European farmers have had enough of being the only ones to adopt and comply with the rules at the risk of a drop in their incomes.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, we must do everything we can to counteract the spread of antibiotic resistance. We are in complete agreement on this. This involves the responsible use of antibiotics in human medicine and in animal husbandry. The European Union must take determined action. We must not allow 25 000 people to go on dying from infections caused by resistant bacteria every year in the European Union alone. Antibiotics must not be used routinely or preventively. We must ensure that antibiotics are used responsibly in all the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is of the utmost importance that every possible effort is made to keep livestock healthy from the rearing stage onwards, until they are fully grown. Ensuring that animals are healthy is the best means of avoiding infection and the use of antibiotics. The way the animals are fed is decisive in this respect, but the husbandry is also important.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should also be open to the use of alternative methods, such as homeopathy and phytotherapy, in livestock husbandry. We need more research and more information in Europe about these alternative approaches.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my home country, the Netherlands, is champion of the world. Not at football, alas – we just missed out on that last year – but in the use of antibiotics in cattle breeding. No other country in the world uses as many antibiotics in cattle breeding as the Netherlands. There are very serious consequences to this, and they are not limited to this usage in the Netherlands; 25 000 people die as a result of bacterial infections in Europe every year, as other Members have said. They reach people via meat. 90% of the chicken meat in the Netherlands contains resistant ESBL bacteria, and last month, it even came to light that resistant bacteria had been found in vegetables after being passed on via manure and the soil. Madam President, this really has to change. A country like Denmark has shown that things can change and that, with sound, strict measures, you can maintain a strong and healthy cattle-breeding sector whilst using far fewer antibiotics.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Commission has stated previously, and again this evening, that it will put forward more far-reaching measures in November. They will then be fleshed out in 2012. I want to urge the Commission to really give this a high priority and not allow it to depend on the Member States, which are too slow to put the right measures in place.</p>

We need that information.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to see a league table of Member States’ usage of drugs per head of animal population, so that we can actually look at countries which adopt best practice and benchmark them against others that are not. I do not mean to point the finger, but rather to allow those Member States who might be overusing antibiotics to improve their animal husbandry practices.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also right to say that farmers do not use antibiotics willy-nilly; they use them when animals are sick. Antibiotics are costly and therefore, farmers do not just use them as they would give an animal a drink of water.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I am very grateful to the author of the question, the chair of our committee, for putting this subject on the agenda. The use of antibiotics in animals involves closely linked advantages and disadvantages. The medicines which help animals to remain healthy can, if used improperly, represent a major risk for people. Therefore, we need to take a coordinated, integrated and, above all, scientific approach, because we will have to continue using antibiotics to treat animals in future. At the same time, we must also reduce the risks for people.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report meets precisely these requirements. I hope that the Commission will take up Parliament’s suggestions, wishes and demands.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would like to point out one fact which links veterinary medicine to human medicine. All other European congresses of microbiologists, when they spoke of resistance to antibiotics in humans, spoke of the so-called methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. This is a scourge for which those of us in human medicine no longer have an effective antibiotic: we do not know how to cure it. Up to 25 000 people die from it every year.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Do you know how it came into being? Simply through the irresponsible use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine. Tonnes of antibiotics are literally stuffed into animals. In the case of animals that are dosed preventively, it is added to their food, and it thus also weakens man and his ability to combat the infections he gets, despite being in hospital, through hospital strains.</p>

The human organism thus becomes the natural victim of the efforts of food producers to produce as much food as possible, as cheaply and as efficiently as possible.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must therefore start to monitor the use of modern chemicals and pharmaceuticals in agriculture very closely and, in the interests of protecting the health of our citizens, also assess very purposefully, systematically and permanently the consequences of using these substances. Only the high quality permanent monitoring of food products will enable us to recognise early on the risks or threats which new technologies pose to the current population.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Antibiotic resistance in livestock and domestic animals has become a problem in recent years. In order to tackle this growing problem, I call for increased research and better controls on its effects in the food chain. If used correctly, antibiotics are an effective tool, but I call on the Commission to introduce concrete measures to make their use more efficient so as to reduce animals’ resistance to antibiotics, as this is a problem that impacts on the entire food chain. It particularly affects levels of antibiotic resistance and so has human health repercussions. To achieve this, the budget for the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) must include the funds required to increase field work and to effectively monitor this problem. Finally, given the importance of this problem, I call on the Commission to draw up a plan for tackling it at EU level that takes into account the full extent of this problem of combating antibiotic resistance, above all, the link between animal health and antibiotic use, and the link between animal and human health.</p>

      <p sl="de">We are absorbing antibiotics in our food, which is resulting in increased resistance. This is one area of medical progress which is gradually being ruined and we have known about this for a long time. Mr De Castro referred to the measures that have already been taken. I support the proposals made in the resolution. There are two aspects of this which I would like to focus on.</p>
      <p sl="de">Regulations alone are not enough. In the dioxin scandal, we have seen how easily they can be undermined, if individual ‘black sheep’ behave in a very negligent way. Of course, we must have regulations and we need to introduce monitoring systems, but that is not the entire solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the medium and long term, the solution is to make the use of antibiotics largely superfluous. We can achieve this firstly by investing in research and networking expert knowledge, secondly, by passing this knowledge on to farmers and vets and thirdly, by providing information to consumers.</p>

      <p sl="cs">According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, there are 400 000 patients in Europe infected with multi-resistant strains of bacteria. I therefore welcome the resolution of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in which I support, above all, the demand for the proper collection and analysis of comparable data on the sale of preparations for veterinary use, and the subsequent use of these preparations on animals. The collection of this data should be mandatory for all EU Member States. If the EU adopts strict measures on the use of antibiotics with agricultural animals, we can also expect changes to legislation in third countries, particularly because of the financial losses that would be caused by a restriction on meat exports to Europe. For example, 74% of all antibiotics used in the US are applied in animal husbandry, for preventing diseases or boosting the growth of healthy animals. Half of all meat products inspected in shops in the US contain dangerous bacteria (MRSA). This problem has been known in the US since 2008, and there has been no fundamental solution to date. Non-pathogenic multi-resistant strains of bacteria also represent a risk in view of the possibility of transgenic transfers and, according to the latest research, shared resistance. The emergence of new, multi-resistant strains of bacteria may deprive future generations of the possibility of making effective use of antibiotics. A scenario such as this could have catastrophic consequences for human health. Resistance to antibiotics represents an enormously serious problem which must be resolved immediately and effectively.</p>
