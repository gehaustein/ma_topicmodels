      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Paul Rübig, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on roaming on public mobile networks within the Community and amending Directive 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (COM(2006)0382 C6-0244/2006 2006/0133(COD)) (A6-0155/2007).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my sincere thanks to Parliament, because Parliament was among the first to focus attention on the problem of international roaming charges, which are one of the last remaining barriers to the single market. This political pressure pointed at the failure of the market and this has helped us to come up with a solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now it is up to you, the parliamentarians, to complete the job by supporting this proposal today. The proposal on which you will vote is a product of intense discussions, even at times heated debates, among the institutions and with the stakeholders. The result is a solid, well-balanced proposal that will deliver tangible results for European citizens, putting an end to the long-running saga of excessive roaming charges as from this summer. The citizens are waiting for this action, for this Europe of results, and it is now in your hands not to disappoint them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has completed its part of the job. In December 2004 I urged the operators to solve the problems by themselves. In October 2005 the Commission published a website for the purpose of bringing transparency to international roaming tariffs. At the same time I warned once again that should those prices not go down sensibly, the Commission would have to regulate. To my regret, the market did not respond and that is why on 12 July 2006 the Commission brought forward the proposal for the roaming regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">You have worked on this proposal, together with the Council of Ministers, under the leadership of the Finnish and German Presidencies. I would like to underline the excellent work of your rapporteurs, Mr Rübig, Mr Muscat, Mr Mavrommatis and Mr Losco. The result of this work is on the table today.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission can very well accept the compromise text because the core elements, which the Commission always believed necessary, have been preserved. Those are: retail regulation, wholesale regulation, clear benefits for all consumers and transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">At retail level, each operator will have to offer a Eurotariff with maximum prices of EUR 0.94 for outgoing calls, to be reduced to 0.46 after 12 months and 0.43 after 24 months, and of 0.24 for incoming calls, to be reduced to 0.22 and 0.19 after 24 months. These caps represent a substantial reduction of up to 70% of the standard charges in today’s market.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question now is: when will the customer benefit from those reductions? The answer is as soon as possible, this summer. To help ensure effective implementation, I have sent a letter to both Parliament and the Council, which sets out in detail how the retail provisions should apply in practice under the supervision of the national regulatory authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the Council has to publish the regulation in the Official Journal. This should be done very swiftly after the meeting of the Council of Telecom Ministers on 7 June 2007. Then, the roaming customers’ operators must send an offer of a compliant Eurotariff to the customer within one month. The customer will be entitled to this Eurotariff one month after responding to the offer. This means that a proactive customer can benefit from the Eurotariff at the latest two months after the commencement of the regulation or even less than two months if his operator has taken a positive approach. Saying it clearly, this means August. Any customer that does not respond will be placed automatically on a Eurotariff three months after the commencement of the regulation. This means September.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will immediately start working with the national regulatory authorities to ensure that customers are treated properly. The regulation will protect the vast majority of ordinary customers who up to now have been heavily overcharged when travelling abroad.</p>
      <p sl="en">The regulation also will protect the smaller operators by introducing ceilings at wholesale level. These ceilings are high enough to allow all operators, big or small, a reasonable margin. At the same time, they are sufficiently low to allow for competitive conditions for smaller operators, new market entrants and operators from smaller Member States. I hope and I expect that they will use this margin to come forward with innovative offerings at once.</p>
      <p sl="en">The final plank of the regulation concerns the all-important element of transparency, which up to now has been sadly lacking. The main requirements are a push system, with basic price information, as well as a pull system, allowing consumers to get more detailed information, which will include prices for SMS and data.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to say one word about the high roaming prices for mobile data. In cooperation with the national regulatory authorities, we will need to watch this market very closely. The operators should know this, heed these warning signals very carefully and bring the prices down to normal by themselves in order to avoid further regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I should like to point out that this regulation will automatically cease to apply after three years, unless Parliament and the Council decide otherwise. I very much hope that this will not be necessary. However, what will be necessary is now the reform of the telecom markets, going from 27 separate markets to one single truly European market, taking advantage of the power of nearly 500 million consumers. This is the next task which is waiting for us.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, today let us look at what has been achieved in the roaming dossier. It is very rare, if not to say unusual, to bring about an agreement on a legislative action in only 10 months. I am proud of the European institutions, which have shown that they are capable of listening to the consumers and to act swiftly in order to solve very specific problems. I count on a large majority in this House, which represents the European citizens, in order to complete the task now and to prove by such a majority that the Europe of practical results is a reality.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Reding, rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen. Today, Parliament and the Council can be proud that we took seriously the Commission’s request for us to produce the Regulation on roaming by the end of summer. We all went into the talks assuming that this would go through the normal procedure with a second and third reading, given the extremely conflictual subject matter and the great disparity between the conflicting interests on the European market.</p>
      <p sl="de">We had developed healthy competition on the national markets; but competition between the various Member States did not really exist. Now, millions of consumers are looking at their mobile phones – mobiles, as we call them – and waiting for the first offer to arrive, an offer that depends on when this Regulation is published in the Official Journal of the European Union. Then we will hopefully be able to make calls on holiday or business trips, safe in the knowledge that the end of the month will not see a bill higher than the cost of the room or flight, but one within reasonable bounds. Roaming has to be like going into a restaurant and being handed a menu with the prices on. In future, when customers cross the border into a European country, they will receive a text message displaying their personalised tariff and a freephone mobile number on which they can call their home provider and ask the cost of a text message, MMS or data transfer. This transparency alone will achieve a great deal, and I am proud that it can be introduced for all services, not only voice telephony.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have also mentioned the flat rate, of course – an all-inclusive flat rate that can be offered within a certain period, whereby customers know at the end of the month exactly what they will have to pay. This is the challenge, namely in comparison with land lines, broadband, Voice over IP and many other new technologies. This Regulation opens up a considerable market opportunity for UMTS and GSM, including in the future. It has been a pleasure for me, therefore, to hold intensive discussions with Mr Paasilinna on such customer-friendliness issues in the field of roaming. Our first discussion with Mr Muscat is still fresh in my memory, when we asked whether there would be an ‘opt-in’ or an ‘opt-out’ solution. We agreed that there did have to be a solution. That was the crux of the matter – that we realised: there is a real need for action, it has to happen quickly, it has to be efficient, and then we can stage it accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="de">We worked on the outermost regions very intensively with Mr Mavrommatis. I hail from the Alpine country of Austria – where transmitter costs are different from those in lowland countries. In the next few months, the Commission will be examining in detail the future possibilities in this regard. This Regulation is also of interest to regulators, since for Member States’ regulators, too, it opens up brand new possibilities for active involvement in the field of roaming and for seeking out what is ideal for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Also new is the approach of better lawmaking. We have managed, at long last, to draw up a Regulation that automatically expires after three years, and we would ask the Commission to ensure that competition is really under way after these three years. I would also ask the Council and its representatives to press for the Regulation to be published in the Official Journal as soon as possible, as millions of European consumers are waiting to finally see a Regulation on this from which they, too, can benefit. I should like to express my particular thanks to this House. Our services did an excellent job: four days after the agreement with Coreper, all translations were present. This was excellent work in this House, and I am proud of the staff who made it possible for us to work so efficiently.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Rübig, ladies and gentlemen, it is a double pleasure for me to speak here. On the one hand, it is apparent that one of the main dossiers of the German Presidency can potentially be brought to a successful conclusion; and, on the other hand, it is a personal pleasure for me to return to this familiar hemicycle, where I still feel at home.</p>
      <p sl="de">Agreement between the Council and Parliament was extremely difficult to achieve. There were tough negotiations; but it was a fair fight. We should like to extend the warmest of thanks to the rapporteur for his constructive conduct of the negotiations, and to the chairmen of the committees for acting as mediators while at the same time standing in solidarity with Parliament. We should like to thank our colleagues in the Council, who endorsed this compromise with great difficulty. The compromise reached is necessary in terms of consumer policy, economically justifiable, and welcome from the European angle. It is necessary in terms of consumer policy because, basically, there was no way of escaping the conclusion that we were looking at market failure. There was no market in this field. Consumers had no choice as regards their tariff, and, basically, the fact of their crossing borders within the European Union was being used to charge high prices. That was unacceptable to us. Now consumers are being relieved of a huge burden, a fact I warmly welcome on behalf of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">The compromise is also economically justifiable. The EU unanimously backs the internal market. The market in mobile phones, in particular, is very dynamic, and it works at domestic level, as everyone can see. For this reason, we set store by not introducing a uniform tariff for all roaming contracts in the EU, but instead imposing a ceiling to rule out abuse. The Council considered it very important that the ceilings did not fall below a certain level, to enable a suitably dynamic market to develop beneath these limits. We hope that enterprises and also consumers engage in sensible market operation beneath this Eurotariff, that this results in a greater variety of offers, and also that consumer behaviour orients itself accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union has shown its capacity for action. The Council Secretariat, too, will make every effort to enable the Regulation to be published in the Official Journal as soon as possible – although a certain amount of time is required for this. A decision has to be taken by the Committee of Permanent Representatives and a formal decision by the Council. We hope we shall succeed in having it published in the Official Journal on 29 June, so that it can take effect accordingly in the summer recess.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would be pleased if a broad consensus in favour of our compromise could be achieved in plenary today. As President-in-Office of the Council, I promise to do my utmost to ensure that the same happens in the Council, so that we have a Europe of results to show ahead of the important European summit.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today is a great day for the citizens of the European Union: thanks to the compromise reached on the proposal for a regulation on roaming, around 500 million European citizens will be directly affected by the decisions we take. Firstly, this will include tourists, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises, which will at last be able to benefit from the reductions of the new Eurotariffs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Less than a year ago it was difficult to imagine such a compromise, and I am delighted to support it as draftsman for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which was the first to become immediately aware of the importance of speeding up the process.</p>
      <p sl="it">From the outset we identified mandatory principles to work from, a European tariff to protect consumers and greater transparency for retail prices. As a liberal democrat I would have preferred to achieve the goal of cutting prices for a product or service by means of healthy competition among market operators, rather than via a dirigiste measure regulating prices directly; however, the fact remains that the normal rules of competition have thus far failed to work in this particular sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to express my full support for this one-off measure, introduced for a limited period as a response to a one-off situation. I would also like to congratulate Mrs Reding on her excellent work, and all those who have contributed over the last few months towards this significant and tangible result. This represents another milestone on the road to completing the internal market, which will eliminate the unfairly high international roaming charges once and for all, and will also topple one of the final remaining barriers among the peoples of the European Union. The decision taken by Parliament today will speak directly to around 500 million European citizens.</p>

    <intervention id="3-013" speaker_id="28121" name="Joseph Muscat" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection">
      <p sl="mt">Thank you, Mr President. Today we are sending out a strong and clear message stating that where there is a distortion of market laws and if the consumer is not being treated fairly, then the European Union, and this Parliament in particular, is prepared to act. We have all heard about the cuts in roaming charges, which are going down by more than half. Personally, I believe, as does my group, that the charges could have been reduced further. However, we are prepared to take the good with the bad and to compromise, because if we waste any more time, consumers will be the ones to suffer. This is a significant victory for consumers. We have armed them with the best weapons – information and transparency. Now, upon their arrival in another European country consumers will automatically receive a message informing them of how much they will be charged when using their mobile phones. Moreover, operators are now obliged to provide a helpline free of charge in order to supply their clients with any help or information they require on the subject. In addition, specific help will be provided for the visually impaired. We want to see these regulations cause an increase rather than decrease in competition. We are aware that there are small and independent operators that are concerned that they will find themselves at a disadvantage. This is why we required the Commission to examine, and issue reports on, the situation of these operators. I will now move on to what is considered to be the most crucial point. It is well known that I was among those who were most insistent that these European tariffs ought to apply to all consumers. However, the Council insisted - in my opinion with equal force - that, in order for this tariff to apply, the consumer would have to request it from the operator. I will not delve into another argument on which this proposal favours the consumer more, because I believe that the facts are obvious. However, we accepted this compromise, firstly because, if we had not done so, we would not have had a regulation, and secondly because the Commission issued a statement during the negotiations saying that it was positive that around 80% of European consumers would automatically benefit from this European tariff. In addition, most of the other 20% are already paying a price that is comparable to the European tariff, and these mostly include businesses and persons with specific contracts. This means, therefore, that the most vulnerable consumers will be protected. To conclude, it is worth noting that the letter sent by Commissioner Reding explains that national regulators, together with the Commission, will monitor the process that will determine which consumers are going to benefit automatically from this European tariff. This is an extremely important process and, through it, we are proving that this Parliament is indeed in a position to respond.</p>

      <p sl="el">Commissioner, after a process lasting approximately six months, one of the most important reports concerning the proposal for a regulation on roaming on mobile networks has come before plenary in the European Parliament to be voted on.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to congratulate Mr Paul Rübig on his excellent work and on his special cooperation with the Commission and the Council, which has brought us today’s very positive results, especially for 150 million consumers.</p>
      <p sl="el">On the same level, I must congratulate Commissioner Reding both on her decision to propose the regulation on roaming and her robust stand in the face of reactions from exogenous players and for going along with the rapporteurs and the members of Parliament’s committees. Congratulations also to the honourable Members involved in consultations with the Council and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="el">Allow me to highlight in particular the point relating to mobile telephone companies and the European Parliament. This is not trench warfare between the two sides. It is, however, part of the right of citizens to seek protection from their parliamentary representatives when they see that their interests are becoming the subject of exploitation by the monopoly tendencies of large companies.</p>
      <p sl="el">As draftsman for the Committee on Culture and Education, I have tried, in harmonious cooperation with my honourable friends in all the political groups, to find a common line which satisfies everyone. The amendments adopted by our committee gave the rapporteur the opportunity to approach the question of roaming from a different angle because, apart from the commercial and financial factor, culture, education and the media are an important part of every day life in our society.</p>
      <p sl="el">Businesses, journalists, people of the arts and letters travel every day. Large families take holidays throughout the year. They spend money. Mobile telephones are necessary and useful, but they must not become an excuse for exploitation by the companies. Need does not mean weakness.</p>
      <p sl="el">The regulation on roaming, as amended, is the regulation we are being called on to adopt today in the European Parliament. A vote in favour of the report will be a victory for Parliament for the benefit of consumer protection. It will be a big step which breathes new life into the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today we have good news for European citizens: the cost of using mobile phones in Europe is going down.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament has been calling for transparency in the tariff jungle for many years. Prices have been exorbitant and also the opposite of transparent. We all know the scenario: you check your mobile bill after your holiday in another European country, to discover that the few phone calls you have made or received have incurred horrendous charges. This is definitively a thing of the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">In future, everyone will enjoy a reasonable tariff – which I particularly welcome. This really represents a great triumph for our Parliament. The President-in-Office has already mentioned our weeks of tough negotiations with the Council. We can be really proud of the result we shall have achieved – the cost of a roaming call within Europe will be EUR 0.49 per minute at first, EUR 0.46 the next year, and EUR 0.43 the year after that.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to say a few words to enterprise and industry. I believe we all knew that market regulation, and regulation of retail tariffs in particular, is a very sharp instrument. Since the market had not developed in the way we had envisaged over the years, we all agreed that political intervention was needed. However, this is a special case, of course, a one-off situation. It is important to emphasise that Parliament does not now mean to strive for price regulation in other fields, too; instead, this is a precedent that will hopefully not need to be repeated. Even developments over the last few months, since the Regulation has been on the table, have shown the amount of new-found movement on this market. These developments show that we were right, that our political impetus was appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to close by giving my sincere thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Rübig, who has conducted many months of negotiations on this. I am also obliged to my fellow Members in the negotiating team – it was not easy to assert our position against the Council – and to the Commissioner for her courage in presenting this Regulation. Finally, my sincere thanks to the secretariat of the committee and to the translators, who have managed to present this Regulation in 23 languages in just a few days. This is sensational, and shows that Europe works well and is committed to implementing its objectives.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner and everyone for their excellent levels of cooperation. My group supports the compromise which has now been reached and will be voting in favour of it shortly.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This law will have a direct impact on the lives of tens, if not millions, of people, and make their lives easier. We have been speaking here for years about network charges. The telecommunications package was discussed five years ago with Mrs Niebler. A paragraph on this matter was added to it. At the time, of course, she was rapporteur for the framework law. Now, however, prices are tumbling, which is good news for the consumer. We get advertisements for mobile phones, but no information about charges, and something definitely needs to be done about this. It is quite incredible that some operators call it competition when the purchaser does not receive any information on the prices of products and prices are kept at cartel-like levels. As a result, only a few travellers use their phone abroad. That, on the other hand, harms the principle of free movement and makes it hard to achieve the Lisbon objective of becoming a leading knowledge-based economy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Mobile communications are a way of internationalising everyday life. Furthermore, phones will then be used more, and more business will be generated; so it is of benefit to companies also. It is vital to have an internal market which is viable, and that must also apply to mobile communications. The interests of the consumer have now been safeguarded and fairness has won through. I would like to ask the Commission how and when it intends to put forward a proposal on data communications. Naturally this would have to be considered carefully first.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, colleagues, today we have to vote on an item of legislation, the positive results of which will very quickly be felt by all European consumers and businesses, and, to state it plainly, by us ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The approximate annual volume of the European Union's international cross-network communications market is about EUR 8.5 billion. That accounts for almost 6% of the general mobile communication industry's revenue, which amounts to about EUR 150 billion per year.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Cross-network prices affect at least 147 million European Union citizens, of which 110 million are users from the business sector.</p>
      <p sl="lt">At the moment, about 70% of Europeans going abroad turn off their mobile telephones because of the prohibitive cost of using them abroad. The problem is complicated by the fact that there is no transparency in retail prices, because there is no competition in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Naturally, when we are able to talk more cheaply we will talk more. Therefore, telephone service providers will not really lose income, and at the same time consumers will benefit and Europe's business competitiveness will feel a positive influence.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In a Eurobarometer survey the vast majority of almost 25 000 respondents were in favour of a compulsory reduction in prices of cross-network communication in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, I would like to re-emphasise an opinion that I share with many colleagues; namely, that any interference in the market is not something to be welcomed, and this regulation is just a temporary compulsory measure to regulate the market.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I think that three years is the maximum amount of time needed not only to lower prices, but more importantly, that will be the time limit for closed national markets to coalesce into a united European market in this sector. That is the final goal of this regulation.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I congratulate European Parliament rapporteur Paul Rübig, the shadow rapporteurs, the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy,Angelika Niebler, Commission Member Viviane Reding, Commission and Council representatives, and all consumers and service providers on finding this excellently coordinated solution.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Discussion of the cross-network communication regulation did not proceed easily. Each statement was explored in depth, and there was discussion about each tariff and the conditions for applying it. Here Parliament showed unexpected rationality and cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I am counting on a unified positive vote in Parliament today, a positive response from the Council on 7 June, and a prompt proclamation (not, as we were told, on 29 June) in the official journal, with the regulation coming into effect during the forthcoming summer holidays.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a regulation on roaming charges is a subject in which citizens take a keen interest, and therefore requires us to ensure the best possible protection without ignoring the needs of industry. We can however note with satisfaction that we have witnessed all the political groups taking responsibility for this, which will certainly not have been what European users were expecting. This is a regulation that will bring Europe still closer to its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">Following long negotiations, particularly with the Council and the Commission, to enable us to reach an agreement at first reading, the compromise solution formally reached only on Monday evening can please everyone, even if more could clearly be done. It would clearly have been possible to reach an agreement on figures closer to consumers’ expectations, as confirmed, moreover, by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, if only the Member States had not opted initially for much higher charges more favourable to operators. The compromise is valid, however, setting maximum charges for the retail market of 49 cents for outgoing calls and 24 cents for incoming calls; in other words representing a cut of around 50% compared to the standard charges.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe we have found a successful solution in providing for the protective charges or ‘Eurotariff’ to be applied automatically to all users three months after the entry into force of the regulation, leaving users free to choose tariffs that they may think are better for them. In the future this will prevent users travelling abroad on business or on holiday from becoming victims of unfair charges, as is unfortunately the case today.</p>
      <p sl="it">The compromise will still leave a profit margin for operators, who may nonetheless benefit from increased mobile telephone use in the future. In the interests of greater transparency, I consider the requirement for operators to inform users by providing personalised information on their tariff plans to be an achievement. I am somewhat less convinced by the gradual reduction of tariffs spread over three years, although this is understandable in a spirit of compromise. Perhaps a more diligent market would have cut prices further than this regulation can do over three years. It is equally true, however, that where the market has failed through a lack of transparency about excessive prices and a presumed abuse of power, regulation of both wholesale and retail is not only desirable but absolutely necessary.</p>

      <p sl="es">Commissioner, thank you for your courageous work. Thank you, Mr Rübig, we have reached a good conclusion, we have a compromise and we have set an historic precedent.</p>
      <p sl="es">We in the European Parliament have acted with unusual unity in order to break a taboo. The taboo of regulating the market at European level in such an important area as telecommunications. Yes, in this process we have given the European citizens a practical example of what the European Union is for.</p>
      <p sl="es">We support the compromise despite the fact that it falls short for consumers in certain respects. Because the European Parliament has spoken out against the outrageous robbing of users, who pay scandalous tariffs and are not even told what they pay. We have stood up for consumers. We have reached a fairish compromise, but it is not entirely fair for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="es">There will be lower prices for the majority, but they could have been considerably lower. There will be much more transparency and information. It could just have been a bit better for existing customers, but during the negotiations and during the trialogue we have seen some of the more positive aspects of the European institutions and some of the more negative ones.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have seen two opposing positions in this debate. On the one hand, Parliament has generally defended the interests of its voters, the consumers, and on the other, the Council – the Member States – have vigorously defended the commercial interests of the big operators, of the national champions, of the ‘telecoms’ and the ‘telefónicas’.</p>
      <p sl="es">Why have the MEPs, who represent the same majorities as their governments in the Council, in the Member States, defended such entirely different positions?</p>
      <p sl="es">There is no question that the same transparency — the same complete openness — is needed in the Council as we have here in this House, because there – in the Council — the asphyxiating pressure of the industrial lobbies has had a great influence on this issue and has restricted our ability to reach an even better agreement.</p>
      <p sl="es">We support this agreement insofar as it is a step forward. It is a step forward that sets the precedent of being able to regulate a market which has not been able to regulate itself in a fair manner. This Parliament is showing the way. We also have to learn from this experience in order to create European institutions that are increasingly transparent, open and accessible to the interests of the majority of the citizens.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s result – that is, the compromise we have reached – represents a recognition of the failure of the market in that ability to increase competition while cutting prices which it is always claimed to have. It seems difficult to argue that the current charges in a naturally cross-border sector such as mobile telephones should be able to maintain those tariff systems that took no account of the European common market.</p>
      <p sl="it">Consumer protection has therefore been entrusted to politics, and the Commissioner has done well to bring this issue to the fore. It should be pointed out that Parliament has responded with energy and great unity. Within this debate, however, our group’s concern has been to guarantee a fair price for all, that is the choice normally described as ‘opting out’, in contrast to the position of the Council, which has for the most part accepted the arguments put forward by the major telecommunication groups, to apply the charge only to those customers who request it.</p>
      <p sl="it">The decision to apply the Eurotariff to everyone is a core aspect of the Commission’s proposal and represents a step towards transparency and safeguarding consumer interests. The margins left for the telecommunications companies are still too high, but I believe that the principle of capping tariffs sets a significant precedent and may contribute towards cutting charges, as it has indeed already done. We accepted the compromise because of the urgency of intervening in a situation of oligopoly among companies at the expense of consumers.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission and Parliament have sent out a strong message; it is now crucial that we insist on transparency in its implementation through the national regulatory authorities, and on a review in three years’ time. This is an ideal way of showing citizens that the European institutions can provide practical answers to issues that no State can resolve on its own.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is not often I find myself in this position, but this morning I have to acknowledge what the European Union is doing. In fact I have come along to say thank you: thank you on behalf of international business. You know the kind – the companies that employ thousands of people who are travelling around Europe the whole time – the ones that make billions in profits. They are going to be big beneficiaries of this. And I want to say thank you on behalf of the super-rich in Europe – not the people that just go to Benidorm for a fortnight, but those that travel regularly. They too will be beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="de">But above all, I want to thank you personally. I use this piece of kit an enormous amount. Your proposals are going to make me personally better off by EUR 3000 a year. In fact, I wish to declare an interest. I will not be voting on the Rübig report, as I am personally affected by it, and I would recommend that other MEPs abstain from the vote. We should not be voting on issues which will help to line our own pockets.</p>
      <p sl="de">The truth is that this is just a giant publicity stunt, is it not? You want to be loved. You want the EU to be loved, so you are telling people they are going to be better off. Frankly, it smacks of Communist central planning when bureaucrats and politicians think they know what the right market price is. They are always wrong. This will lead to higher costs for domestic consumers. It will lead to less competition and innovation in the market place. It is yet another giant EU folly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, moving on from the sour grapes you have just heard, I would like to say this measure represents a win-win situation for the EU because we are actually doing something practical for our consumers. It has been a long time getting here but now we are here I hope very much that we can implement this measure quickly and that the operators will take the hint and change their tariffs quickly. I hope that they will see the benefit of cutting their prices through getting additional business – even from my colleague sitting way over there.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are addressing a market failure. A specific market failure but a short-term one I hope, and it is significant that we have the sunset clause to show that we expect this situation to be rectified and competition to assert itself in this part of the market. We owe it to innocent tourists and consumers to save them from suffering that nasty shock when they come back from travelling on holiday – or even business – of being charged for receiving a call and having a huge bill. We owe it to them to fix it. We may hope for something like 60% savings on the average charge for a roaming call, and this is of material benefit to our consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very glad that my amendment requiring the operators to give information, the ‘icon’ amendment, has been incorporated into the text. I am grateful for that. And I would like to pay tribute to the consensus across Parliament between the groups, along with the Commission, the Council, consumer groups, and the regulators, in supporting this measure.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must limit the excessive prices charged to the 200 million Europeans who use their freedom of movement within the Union. As the real cost for operators is between 6 and 15 cents per minute, the cumulative price for one minute of active or passive roaming that is provided for by the regulation leaves operators substantial margins.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The advocates of the unbridled free market ought, moreover, to reflect on the failure of their theory faced with the harsh reality of the telephony market. The liberalisation of this sector was helped by a technological revolution that made an increase in supply possible. The enthusiasm of the general public for mobile telephones, SMSs, etc., has not led to genuinely attractive prices. Economies of scale, productivity gains and the huge expansion of the communications market have not resulted in more favourable tariffs. Consumers have merely been confronted with non-transparent offers tying them to a particular operator. Vodafone, Télécom and other operators in the Telefónica Group swear allegiance to the internal market provided that they can maintain the internal borders for tariff purposes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The political power had a duty to intervene in the market, which is usually so sacred. This is a first in the Union, a welcome precedent. The Commission was still raging about prices, but the roaming dossier proves that the market at times needs the visible hand of the public powers, especially in the case of such a failing market as the telecommunications market.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to make a point of welcoming two former MEPs, Mr Wuermeling and Mrs Reding, who have returned to their former inferior abode, and thank them for their contribution to this proposal, which is bound to benefit the European consumer.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It may strike you as unusual that, whilst I, as a Liberal, am vehemently opposed to interference in consumer rates, certainly in the free market, where the Commission and Parliament claim that conditional competition leads to a better price and more innovation, I will be voting in favour of this in order that we may be able to do something about consumer prices.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You may well wonder why; I am doing this because the Commissioner – and I hope that this has dawned on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – has spelled out that three years from now, we will boast a European market, rather than 27 individual markets scraped together within their own national borders, because that – as I see it – is where the problem lies and that is where telephone providers take advantage.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is interesting to know that most consumers who pay high roaming rates and who do not get these reimbursed by their employers or via other schemes, are holidaymakers. They tend to phone each other up from one ski lift or deck chair to the next, and while they may be lounging in a Spanish deck chair five metres away from their friends, the call is directed to the home country before it comes back.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This has to stop. I think it is good that we should give the industry an incentive and that we can look forward to a properly functioning internal market for mobile phone calls in three years’ time, when we will be able to leave roaming behind, and consumers will be able to choose where they conclude their contracts.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is something else I should like to share with you. I was surprised to hear that the rate is exclusive of VAT. Everyone talks about EUR 0.49 maximum. Since this is exclusive of VAT, the consumer is, in some sense, being offered a carrot, because this means that another 20% is added anyway.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I also hope that the basic contracts, not the calling per minute therefore, the basic contracts, for which no specific arrangements are in place, will not end up being misused, for we will have to intervene again if they are. I hope –Commissioner and Mr Wuermeling – that the system will work, and that we can ensure that the consumer is happy about Europe, but, above all, that the internal market will start to function properly.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to join those congratulating and thanking Mr Rübig for his report, and have no doubt that today will be a very important day for the European Parliament and several hundred million citizens of the European Union. We now have the chance to prove to our electorates that the European Parliament is a necessary institution and one that deals with issues that concern them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The issue of excessive roaming charges imposed on consumers by international telecoms giants is something that has upset Europeans for many years. Telecommunications companies failed to compete on price, which is what should happen in a proper market, preferring, as numerous experts believe, to collude and fix roaming charges. Over the years, millions of tourists and small and medium-sized enterprises have suffered from this practice. We can now put an end to this unjust exploitation – which, although it may sound like a socialist slogan, is what it is, as the speeches of my colleagues from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in this House attest.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Like many others, this regulation would not be necessary if the market were governed by healthy and transparent principles of competition. Our position is to stand up for the citizens of the European Union, who have clearly been subjected to a conspiracy that undermines the market. Thanks to the decisive stance of this House, including my group, we have successfully shown our partners in the Council and the Commission that we will not allow regulations to be watered down, or allow consumers’ interests to continue to be flouted.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Already this summer, EU citizens will be able to speak with their families, as well as with companies abroad, at much lower rates. Call charges will be substantially reduced to a maximum of 49 cents per minute for outgoing calls and 24 cents per minute for incoming calls, and these prices will fall even further in the coming years. I share the view expressed by others in this House and hope that these prices will fall more rapidly than in the compromise proposal.</p>

There will be an end to the substantially inflated prices in the field of mobile telecommunications, and the competition so often discussed will actually take place, to the benefit of consumers. It is good news that Europe is prepared to enforce common rules against monopolistic interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, there is a drop of bitterness in all this. Parliament’s proposals have been watered down thanks to the individual interests of service providers and the monopolies these hold in a number of Member States. In addition, the compromise reached on end prices for consumers is considerably higher than the Commission proposal – which cannot, on the whole, be considered anti-industry. This is bad news for Community law, but a proper and vital first step towards improving the situation for consumers. For this reason, I, too, should like to thank everyone who has contributed to this and ensured that consumers of mobile-telecommunications services will enjoy greater transparency and freedom of choice in future.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I should like to make five remarks to explain why I support this compromise, which has proved so difficult to achieve. Firstly, if critics say that this is not a solution that conforms to the market, they should remember that the main problem arose over whether the market itself conforms to the market. If not, then market correction must take place, as has happened here. As the Commissioner said very clearly, attempts at rectifying the situation have been made before. Secondly, I wish to say that this area will at last fall into line with the principles on which our Union is based.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Thirdly, it is very important that there is, to some extent at least, equal access to information on the market. A certain level of equal access to information is, as Joseph Stiglitz, winner of the Nobel prize for economics once said, one of the preconditions for the smooth functioning of the market. Fourthly, even though equal access to information has been significantly strengthened in this area, freedom of choice has been safeguarded. It is very important to us that competition can take place.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Fifth and lastly, this is not, as some would have it, a nil-nil result but rather a win-win situation for all, as Mr Chichester pointed out. Furthermore I am delighted to discover that in Mr Farage we have a specialist in the functioning of the former national planning committees. It is interesting that Parliament too is faced with historic questions.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Over the last 15 years, we in Europe have seen radical developments, with reduced prices for mobile phone calls. There are few areas in which prices have fallen as much as within this particular area. This has been the case, above all, with national calls, but also with international ones – a state of affairs that is worth remembering on a day like today. The problem has been that, as the Commissioner pointed out, we have 27 different markets instead of one. I would therefore congratulate both the Commissioner and the rapporteur, Mr Rübig, on the fact that we are today obtaining a decision that will mean increased transparency and also on the fact that we shall obtain regulation of competition between mobile operators and retailers. This will solve the crucial problem that has led to unduly high roaming fees. In this way, conditions more favourable to competition are being created.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This, I believe, is where we should have stopped, and I therefore regret the fact that we now also have a proposal on the regulation of prices at consumer level. All experience shows that the desired goal is not achieved through price regulation. We are in danger of fixing price development irrevocably around the regulated level. We are in danger of reducing the pressure for increased competition between different operators to lower the prices of both national calls and roaming. We are in danger of not getting to see the kind of rapid price reductions we have seen in the past. Without exaggerating these dangers, I wish to say that it would have been better if we had been satisfied with regulating the area in which we have a problem, namely that of the price differential where retailers and operators are concerned. I say this because the task of the European Union is not, and should not be, to regulate prices at consumer level. The EU should do what the Commissioner indicated earlier today that we should do, namely ensure that we move from having 27 different markets to having just the one. That is where a dynamic is to be found, and that is what we should concentrate on: not on regulating consumer prices but on regulating in such a way that we obtain all-round and constructive competition between operators.</p>

There has indeed been a failure of the market, which, although some deny it, does sometimes happen, and in this instance it was absolutely vital that we intervene by capping prices.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are thinking above all of the consumers, although we have no desire to harm the industry – far from it. We are calling on the industry and businesses to do as much as they possibly can to win themselves new consumers and, by means of new, good, and advantageous packages, to make up for the losses that they may sustain from time to time. What is vitally important is that this regulation should, albeit after a short time lag, be of real benefit to consumers and that no tax on ignorance be payable by those who are less well informed.</p>
      <p sl="de">I really would ask you, Commissioner, to do everything possible to make this regulation known to our consumers and thereby to show them what the Commission and this House are doing for Europe, for that can do more than many abstract debates about the European Constitution to persuade Europeans that the EU really is necessary.</p>

      <p sl="sv">It is a fundamental principle that it is not the European Union’s task to regulate prices everywhere in the market. However, the basic treaty gives us the ability, as well as the responsibility, to protect consumers and to ensure that the market operates and that we have fair and open competition. In this case, we have, for many years, received very clear signals from despairing parents with children studying abroad, from older people who have not read the small print in their telephone agreements and also from parts of the industry, complaining that this market does not operate. It is neither transparent nor fair.</p>
      <p sl="sv">That is why we have been working on the roaming issue since we were elected to the European Parliament three years ago. The problem was addressed as long ago as during our first discussion with Commissioner Reding. For a period of three years, we – the Commissioner, the Council and Parliament – have together tried, through price comparisons and open recommended prices – to ensure that the market voluntarily corrects the shortcomings that exist. It has not done so. The major distortions have remained unchanged. This legislative proposal therefore comes as no surprise, and I welcome it because it is our task to ensure that we have proper competition in the internal market. Our task is to take strategic and systematic decisions that prepare the way for an open market function, and I hope that, in the course of the next three years, the industry will ensure that it changes its business methods and reports on, and clarifies, the price situation for its customers. I hope too that it does so in such a way that this three-year legislation is a one-off phenomenon and that we might subsequently be able to refrain from this kind of intervention in the market.</p>

      <p sl="lv">First of all I would like to express my gratitude to the Commissioner, the rapporteur and the Council for the compromise reached on this issue, which is of such importance for Europeans. Certainly, from the viewpoint of economic theory, intervention in any segment of the market by setting a retail price ceiling may be considered to be an inappropriate regulation of the economics of the market. Remembering, however, the European Commission’s unsuccessful attempts to influence the roaming market through other methods, this is the legislators’ final instrument and, significantly, it will also be in force for a limited period. In reality, however, this regulation also has a political significance. It shows that Europe’s internal market is really a market on a European scale, and not just the sum of the markets of the individual Member States. The fact that there is an impression that perfect competition holds sway on the local market does not mean that the same holds true at European Union level. Such protection of the Member States’ markets from a truly single European Union internal market persists in a great number of spheres. To mention a few: transport, the provision of services, movement of the labour force, and others. This does not mean that the legislator will always have to carry out administrative measures like these in the European Union to influence the market and even to regulate prices. If, however, it turns out that the retail price ceilings are no longer necessary even before three years are up, this will prove that, at least in the field of mobile communications, we can create a true internal market on the European scale. Thank you.</p>

What we have now done is to fashion a support that will bring a result in the short term, but what is needed at a fundamental level is the improvement of the underlying conditions of competition.</p>
      <p sl="de">I take it as read that the dominant telephone companies are not going to put a stop to their racket, whose victims will now no longer be the tourist and the perpetually on-the-move businessman, but rather the most vulnerable participants in the market, in many instances young people and children. Take a look at the aggressive advertising of ringtones and the great problems posed by the content available – for violent or pornographic films are available on mobiles – and you will realise that the next thing the Commission has to do, following the consultations that are going on in this area until 7 June, will be to summon up the political courage to bring in pre-emptive legislative measures that will enable us to get a better grip on the problem presented by use of mobile phones by children and young people.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, roaming costs are coming down, but Europe is coming to this issue late, and it will continue to be consumers who pay the consequences. For years, the European Commission has taken no measures to protect its citizens and has left the telephone companies to come to agreements between themselves, creating cartels that for consumers translate into throwing money down the drain.</p>
      <p sl="it">Independent studies, such as that by the Association of European Consumers, have shown that mobile telephone operators bill their customers EUR 3.52 billion too much every year. The actual cost of a minute’s roaming is between 10 and 14 cents, roughly; operators resell it for an average of EUR 1.06, meaning that the gap between prices and costs is over 600%.</p>
      <p sl="it">Faced with such high margins, we were expecting a more serious proposal with regard to consumers, instead of what has been put before this Chamber: a deduction of 49 cents, which means succumbing to the demands of the Council and telephony operators. Yes, the proposal is necessary, and represents a small step forward, but just lowering prices does not do enough to protect consumers, does not compensate them for the exploitation they have suffered and instead continues to penalise them further.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for having the courage to tackle a problem that affects the consumers. The Commissioner has demonstrated her enormous concern for consumers and, furthermore, she has immersed herself in a field that is always subject to much criticism; direct intervention in the prices that are set for the market. She has decided to take on that challenge, and we shall see how it works.</p>
      <p sl="es">Before laying out my position, I would like briefly to thank the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job, and the Council, who, after a relatively short space of time, have very efficiently ensured that this document is ready for voting on in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">The problem we are facing is essentially as follows: history shows us that intervening in the level of market prices almost always has unwanted consequences and creates other additional problems. Either prices do not fall, or the costs resulting from reductions or from earnings that disappear in that sector are passed on to other sectors in the same field.</p>
      <p sl="es">For example, there is a degree of concern at the moment: to what extent will there be a transfer of costs to internal national calls? In other words, to what extent will companies raise certain national call costs for the consumer?</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe, Commissioner, and I put this to the Council as well, that the way this process is monitored is very important, not just with regard to reductions for international calls, but also how the national markets evolve in terms of costs. This will truly provide us with the final dimension and consequences of this Regulation and the decisions that we are taking now.</p>

      <p sl="et">Today’s regulation is a good example of the positive things the European Union brings its citizens. Reducing mobile telephone bills is a noticeable and positive change. It is odd that the European Union, which began as a common market, should have to fight for seven years for a common market in one sector. What is important, however, is the successful conclusion to which Mr Rübig has guided us.</p>
      <p sl="et">Although the price level achieved at negotiations held with Member States is not quite what I had hoped for, a compromise is better than a continuation of the status quo. Forty-nine euro cents per outgoing call is six times better than three euros. It is important that the maximum number of consumers be able to benefit from the new prices earlier than, for instance, three months from now, that is to say in September, when the holiday season will already be ending.</p>
      <p sl="et">Since it is in the interests of mobile phone companies to keep consumers paying the old roaming rates during the entire three-month transition period, we must ensure that the new opportunities created by the regulation rapidly reach consumers of the service. Both we and consumer protection organisations have a great deal of work to do in informing the public.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, meaning well is not the same thing as doing well, or so we say in German, and one very much suspects that this regulation is more the fruit of the desire to have an effect on the masses than an expression of rational policymaking. Yes, of course, roaming charges are excessive, and yes, of course, we can all see that the market has failed to do anything about it, but the only question is as to how I remedy the failure of the market; can it be done by means of machinery to determine and regulate prices, which is what we are creating here, or does it not make much more sense, when we come to future deliberations on the telecommunications package, to make the appropriate adjustments to the directive on market access, so that service providers the length and breadth of Europe are enabled to offer their services in every country, thus generating competition that will bring pressure on prices and push them downwards?</p>
      <p sl="de">The liberalisation of telecoms markets has worked; the national markets show us as much, and that must also be possible at the European level. After all, if you have a headache, the doctor does not cut your head off; instead, he might give you an aspirin or something of the sort. It is measures such as these that we should consider rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

      <p sl="nl">I should like to share a very small anecdote with the Commissioner. Over the years, my cleaner has only once talked to me about Europe, and that was about the mobile phone rates, particularly about the excessively high bill she received after she had phoned to Belgium from Spain where she was on holiday.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I think that we have taken the right decision with this resolution, because using your mobile to call abroad in Europe is hardly an option at the moment. It is prohibitively expensive, and that obviously makes it a significant barrier within the internal market. Putting a stop to this will be very much welcomed by businesspeople, tourists, students, and all the rest of us too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is also very useful is that the mobile phone users can automatically enjoy the lower rates. This is another victory for the consumer and for Europe. I am persuaded, Commissioner, that the mobile phone operators will be able to recoup much of the lost income, simply because the number of calls will increase considerably.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the new mobile phone rates are keen and very close to the rates that this House had proposed. The price of a mobile phone call abroad will drop by an average of 60%, which is massive. The Commission and Parliament have taken a firm stand and ended up siding with the consumer in the face of much pressure and lobbying. When things go well, then I think we should be able to say so.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite clear that the consumers who are today’s winners; that is good news for the public, and it is something in which I take great pride, even though we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would have liked to see more, but what has been done today is something positive.</p>
      <p sl="de">In making this law, we have quite deliberately restricted our attention to telephone calls, without enacting anything applicable to SMS, MMS or other means of transmitting data, but we urge the industry to take what we have done as an example. We will look very carefully to see what happens in this area over the next few years. If you in the industry do not take what we have now done by law to heart, we will be obliged to take legislative action in those areas too, and, there too, the Commission will have our wholehearted backing. This is a warning, and I suggest that you should take it to heart. We do not absolutely want to have recourse to the making of laws, but we will if we have to, and the law will be applied with its full rigour.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, this is a temporary, albeit necessary, measure. This is not a genuine market economy. The market economy was not functioning, and the telecommunications operators were charging cartel-like prices. There is something clearly missing, however, in this proposal, which has now come in an otherwise acceptable form. It does not apply to text messages or multimedia services. They can still be billed any way the operators like. Hopefully, they will not make up for their loss of profits by raising charges for text messages. It is a waste of time talking about a viable internal market in telecommunications so long as cross-border calls are manifestly over-priced.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This debate on charges is important, but it is still more important to guarantee that all consumers can effortlessly take advantage of reasonable charges: it should not be left to the individual consumer for the law to be fulfilled.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my heartfelt thanks go to all those who have worked on this project, the result of which is an improvement on what we had before we started our deliberations.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is also a certain amount of good news, firstly that the burden is being lifted from the consumers; secondly that the EU has demonstrated its capacity to act; thirdly, that the House has a regulation before it that is time-limited and expires at the end of three years – and I hope it really will do that – and, fourthly, that we are helping to make things more transparent. That is important if there is to be competition, with the consumers being able to decide for themselves which tariff they want or which service provider they are going to opt for.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is, though, one big problem, and we must not, I think, mince words in addressing it; it is that we are intervening as a political entity and are nevertheless determining prices, and the prices we are fixing are those paid by the end user, yet that is not what politicians are for; price-fixing is not one of our duties. There may be other political and economic systems in which that is an objective, but I do not see it as something that European policy-makers ought to be doing.</p>
      <p sl="de">It may well be, too, that we are failing to consider the consequences of this sort of intervention in pricing, for it is very likely that someone somewhere is going to have to pay the price for this. If we carry on carping about the way things are and keep on interfering in them, then, far from achieving what we want to achieve, the whole thing will end up turning out to be a Pyrrhic victory.</p>
      <p sl="de">Arbitrary prices? Are the prices that we are now determining, really the right ones? In essence, they have been arrived at by way of negotiations. Fair-minded people must concede that what you end up with down this road is a result that is to some degree the outcome of chance. The good thing about it is that the Council has ensured that the prices in question are maxima, and that is the right way to go about it. If we are going to resort to price-fixing, then we ought to start by capping them, something that – theoretically at least – leaves the option of regulation open and does not exclude the possibility of a degree of competition setting in below the maximum imposed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Is this a one-off situation or a precedent? That is the crucial question. My fear is that it was a precedent. One Member has just been brutally frank enough to say that, at last, a taboo has been broken, for we have intervened in the market, and that is precisely what should not happen; that is what I find regrettable, and, indeed, wrong.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I have got one minute to speak, and if I were speaking here on my mobile phone for one minute, as an ordinary consumer, I would still be paying excessive costs for making the call.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course this law will change all of that. Consumers will see the cost of calls halved. They will receive automatic information on the cost of making and receiving calls and they will benefit from an automatic Eurotariff. The IMCO Committee first raised this issue in 2005 when in a hearing we responded to consumer complaints on excessive charging and now in 2007 this Parliament has shown it can deliver for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this is good news and we want this to come in as early as possible. We want consumers to continue to benefit from this, even after the three years when the law will lapse, but consumers should be aware that the costs of using their mobile phone for internet access or texting is still excessive. Commissioner, we would ask you to act in this area. The industry itself should move to reduce these prices. We have shown that we will act here on behalf of consumers if they are being ripped off. I hope the industry will take this message seriously.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, only nine months after we debated roaming proposals in Parliament for the first time, we now have a result of which we can be very proud. Commissioner Reding, you very much deserve to be congratulated on your splendid work in the fight for cheaper telephone bills. However, we too have done our bit here in Parliament. One winner emerges from this fight, and that is the European consumer. European customers will notice the lower prices by as early as 1 August 2007. It will cost a maximum of DKK 4.50 to call home from abroad. I shall not shed many tears over the losers, namely the European telephone companies. They have bewailed their fate, but the reality is that they have made heaps of money out of consumers. Getting on for 95% of roaming income was clear profit. That is something we have now fortunately put a stop to. It was hard going, however. We were in a lot of disagreement in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. My fellow Members Mr Coveney of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and Mr Muscat of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament each wanted to go in a different direction, and there was no end of balletic manoeuvring within the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Now, we are all united in this House, however. I should like, therefore, to ask you for a second dance, Mr Muscat. Once again, thank you for your constructive cooperation, and I hope that Mrs Reding will now move on to the area of SMS and text messages in general, as this area is missing from the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, minister, ladies and gentlemen, if we vote in favour of the package of amendments in relation to the Rübig report on the Roaming Regulation today, we will have every reason to be proud of our role as European legislator. Commissioner Reding’s bold proposal, the work of the various parliamentary committees that paved the way for the Rübig report, as well as the progress that has been made under the German Presidency of the Council, all bear witness to vision and political determination to actually do what we always claim to do, namely to ensure that European decisions benefit the public.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Roaming Regulation bears witness to vision and moral fibre. Of course, we believe in the working of the market, but where the market fails, we are not afraid to step in. Although price regulation is a far-reaching measure to take, this is temporary and therefore appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am also delighted with the speed with which we have been able to work. Laying down an act such as this one within the space of ten months is unprecedented. Moreover, the results are already being felt, even before the act has been published and entered into effect. At this rate, roaming holidaymakers will be able to enjoy the lower rates this coming summer.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, the choices made receive my wholehearted support. The objective to call a halt to excessive consumer prices has been met: the maximum price has dropped some 60% below the average price before the initiative was launched, and this is saying something, and the provisions about more information and transparency are an added bonus. I am looking forward to the reactions from the market which, fortunately, has been left with some freedom and which will be able, and hopefully also be willing, to prove that it works.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should, on a final note, like to thank all my fellow MEPs for their good cooperation on this matter, not least Mr Coveney, who was the shadow rapporteur in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and who played a key role in achieving this result, but is unfortunately unable to be here today.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would also congratulate the Commissioner on her proposal, and wish the Council every success. Ladies and gentlemen, I think that the consumer dimension of European policy has earned itself another star today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, calling home while on your holidays has been far too expensive for far too long. Many mobile operators have been charging customers extortionate prices and, in Parliament’s view, very unnecessary tariffs. We warned them to put their house in order. We gave them the chance to do the right thing but they persisted and it is for that reason that we have had to introduce legislation that gives protection to anyone who uses a mobile while abroad.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not an ideal solution, but it is the only option left to control those who abuse the market. Let this be a lesson to other industries. One of the things we discovered in our discussions with mobile companies was that much roaming traffic is kept in-house as customers are directed on to partner networks. So for many roaming companies, wholesale prices are simply a way of ensuring different parts of the same company benefit. When we understand this, the market price for consumers becomes even more exorbitant. This is a victory for consumers, a victory for the European Parliament and a victory for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I too wish to congratulate both Paul Rübig on the compromise which he has achieved and Commissioner Viviane Reding on her initiative in tabling a regulatory proposal.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe that the regulatory intervention was necessary because competition on the roaming market has not been functioning in the European Union for many years, with the result that charges remain high at both wholesale and at retail level.</p>
      <p sl="el">Despite any weaknesses in the initial proposal which I pointed out from the beginning, I consider that the compromise text we are voting on today covers many of the system’s operating weaknesses. I remember that our main concern was to reconcile consumers’ needs and the competitiveness of the European mobile telephone industry and we have ultimately reconciled them wisely.</p>
      <p sl="el">To be specific, I am particularly satisfied with the proposed charges at both wholesale and retail level, which are very close to those which I proposed in my amendments. Mainly, however, I am satisfied that the ‘opt out’ rationale prevailed. With the ultimate formula of this rationale, I believe that all categories of consumers are protected, including those who wish to opt out of euro-billing and to maintain their contract with their company as it stands, and those with little or no information, who must benefit from the new reduced prices.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, the regulation we are voting on today guarantees transparency of prices for European consumers who, unfortunately, pay high prices for a great many goods and services, which is unwarranted on a single, liberalised and competitive European market.</p>

      <p sl="el">We know that what was sought from the outset was to safeguard maximum charges, so that mobile telephone providers would be forced to set transparent and properly calculated charges. I consider that our job is not yet done, either by the Commission or by the European Parliament. If and when the situation on the roaming market is reviewed, once today’s regulation has been applied, more corrections will need to be made to data services and messaging.</p>
      <p sl="el">In addition, it should be emphasised that serious work needs to be done by the regulatory authorities, which will need to address compliance with today’s agreement.</p>
      <p sl="el">In a period of widespread scepticism about the immediacy and importance of action by the European Union in citizens’ daily lives, today’s initiative is an opportunity for the institutions to demonstrate that the European Union is intervening to resolve their problems and complete the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="sk">() I would like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Rübig, and also to Mrs Niebler and the other rapporteurs, namely Messrs Muscat, Coveney, Mauro and Matsis, as well as to the Council, as represented by our colleague, Mr Joachim Wuermeling, for their work in drafting this difficult report. At the same time I would like to thank the Commissioner, Mrs Reding, for working closely with the European Parliament and drafting this regulation, together with her team, in such a careful way, and on the basis of detailed analysis.</p>
      <p sl="sk">European consumers, especially tourists, students or business people, have often been unpleasantly surprised by the bills presented by their mobile phone operators when returning from trips abroad. Following constructive discussions in the European Parliament, we managed to set price caps so that on the one hand, the roaming costs incurred by customers will be considerably reduced and, on the other hand, there will be enough room for mobile operators to compete on price.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am happy with the compromise, which will have major implications for the ordinary European consumer. The consumer will have three months to decide whether he or she wants to switch from the present tariff to a 'Eurotariff', or would rather stick to the current tariff model. I am pleased that the European Parliament has managed to ensure that those who have a better contract will not automatically come under the consumer protection tariff, but will have the option of retaining their existing contracts.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The final draft has also taken on board the idea that regulation should remain in force for only three years. I am convinced that a genuinely competitive roaming telephony market will emerge and there will be no need for further regulation in the future.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, Europe needs to see concrete results, and the adoption of this European legislation in record time is a great achievement, and one that will bring benefit to the people of Europe. It provides clear evidence that where Europe is genuinely committed to implementing a meaningful and concrete project, it can quickly reach agreement.</p>

Unfortunately, we are not sure whether the prices secured at the end of what was a real hard bargaining debate will fully reflect the true costs. As we have no reliable data on the volumes and associated revenues, we still have difficulty in gaining an idea of the balance required between the margins needed in order to keep European mobile telephone companies competitive and fair prices for consumers. This regulation – especially in relation to retail prices – is an advance, but one that still needs to be improved. We now need to define the prices for sending SMS data and e-mails.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I believe that we can only welcome today the reduction in international roaming charges.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, we should avoid taking shortcuts and, for goodness’ sake, let us not systematically and futilely pit manufacturers against consumers, because the blind pursuit of continually reduced ceiling prices does not just have advantages, far from it. Indeed, with overly low roaming tariffs, operators may try to make up for the reduction in their revenue by reducing their investments, thereby penalising consumers as a whole. The risk run is therefore that of seeing a marked increase in national call tariffs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ceilings proposed in the compromise – 49 cents per minute for calls made from abroad and 24 cents per minute for calls received – are particularly interesting, all the more so since a demand can be made to reduce them in the three years following the entry into force of the regulation, something about which we can be pleased.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This sensible option will make it possible to seek a reduction in prices in the longer term. We will therefore have a competitive market with the widest possible variety of tariffs, enabling consumers to make an informed choice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Under the terms of the compromise, consumers will also have a three-month period after the entry into force of the regulation in which to decide whether or not to take advantage of the Eurotariff. If they do not indicate a preference, they will be automatically allocated the best tariff for them. Users therefore have the option not to be allocated the Eurotariff if they already benefited from favourable conditions offered by their operator, and that is a very good thing. This pragmatic solution will enable the millions of consumers who benefit from lower international roaming tariffs not to have the Eurotariff automatically allocated to them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore hope that this new regulation, which is temporary insofar as it is due to expire three years after it has entered into force, will make it possible for the mobile telephone market to be regulated, while of course respecting consumers, by promoting their interests and by protecting them better, but without for all that hindering competition and innovation in the sector.</p>

      <p sl="pl">What we are witnessing is something unusual. For the first time we are introducing a regulation that will encourage competition, promote the free market and help to implement the Lisbon Strategy in the European Union on such a scale. Small and medium-sized enterprises, students, tourists and millions of Europeans working abroad will all benefit from it. I have to also point out that this regulation will help not just consumers, but also the market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the course of the debates we have heard the arguments against regulation along the lines that a free market does not need regulation. This is indeed the case, but there is one exception, and that is when competition and consumers need to be protected against monopolies. This is a case in point. The European Commission has behaved in the way that all consumer and competition protection bodies would act in any European country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The important thing now is to see how this regulation works. I hope it will not be a one-off, but a precedent, and that we will be able to regulate many other matters to the benefit of the market, competition and consumers in a similar way.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We now face the creation of an energy market, which is a huge challenge. We will have to deal with some national giants, of which we may be proud, but need to be worked into the market.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, it is unusual for us to intervene in market pricing, but unfortunately, it was something that had to be done. There was far too much ambiguity surrounding the use of mobile phones abroad by holidaymakers. Excessive call charges and high costs for receiving calls made for unpleasant surprises when bills landed on the doormat a month later.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have now prescribed maximum prices, albeit still, if you ask me, somewhat high ones, and – something that is even more important – we have demanded more transparency from the telephone providers. If people make phone calls abroad, the precise cost must be clear to them. If prices are transparent, competition will be normalised, and maximum prices will become redundant. All things being equal, telephone companies will soon offer rates that are below the maximum.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is still disappointment about the commencement date, and the telephone companies would do well to themselves take the initiative in offering favourable rates even before 1 July, when the schools break up for the summer. The holidaymaker has been a milch cow for too long.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, the seven-year struggle between Parliament and the European telecoms operators is drawing to a close. As MEPs we were no longer able to stand by as prices rose to five times the level of costs, thus restricting communications in the internal market. We were no longer able to sit back and watch the huge discrepancies between northern and southern Europe in terms of the cost of international calls, and merely to criticise the lack of transparency. The operators proved unable to demonstrate their steep costs to us and the national regulators confirmed that they do not have any influence when it comes to cross-border calls.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We must therefore today take action at a Union level. When the market fails, regulation is the necessary response. The regulation is limited to a three year period, by which time the market will have moved on. The tariff of EUR 49.24 is equal to the average price charged by the three biggest operators, and we are giving the people the opportunity to choose other deals which may be on the market. We are also giving the public the right freely to move from one operator to another and back again. The most important thing is, of course, the obligation to provide consumers with information on prices in good time. Just yesterday, operators began distributing their leaflets and finally publicising their prices. Opponents of the regulation argue that there is no reason to interfere in the market because there are already packages to be found with lower roaming prices. I feel, however, that these offers appeared only when the Commission publicised the regulation; in other words, things started moving only under the threat of regulation and certainly not as a result of market mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="cs">One might ask whether there was a need for a regulation on the retail price of voice services. I think there was, because the consumer is guided by the final price and it is the consumer’s choice alone that influences the market. We will keep an eye on how matters progress on data services not covered by the regulation. I should like to call on the socialists not to block the adoption of this Council regulation, as this will mean that it can be in force by the summer. I hope that the liberal minister for foreign affairs stands her ground in the face of pressure from the lobbyists. On behalf of the Czech people, I should like to thank the negotiating team, Mr Rübig, Mrs Niebler and others from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and the Commission for the job they have successfully completed in the interests of the people of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Finally, we often talk about better legislation in this House. Well, this is a prime example of it, in that the regulation ceases to exist the minute the social partners, the operators face up to their responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this way, a sound balance is struck between recognisable Parliament policy and people’s own responsibility. All credit, then, to Commissioner Reding and to the rapporteur, Mr Rübig, for a visible policy that produces real results.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I too should like to single out two vital points in this issue: excessive charges and lack of transparency. As I see it, the agreement is sound and balanced, and whilst it may not be the result we had hoped for, it represents a major step forward.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I do regret, though, that my amendment in favour of even more transparency, having been accepted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, was rejected in the trilogue. It provided, Commissioner, for a rate simulator to be worked out by the government which would enable the consumers to compare rates of different operators, for these, at the moment, are very complex and leave the consumer in much uncertainty. It could have represented a second star in consumer protection.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Anyway, the agreement that has now been reached receives my backing. I hope that in future, the rates will actually drop even more, due to competition among the operators, and I think that we have proven that, as far as this is concerned, we in this House can make a difference for the man in the street.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as Mrs Roithová said, a seven-year war is drawing to its close, and of those seven years, the Commission spent five hacking around in the bushes, while we, in this House, demanded that something at length be done. I am thoroughly grateful to the Council for having drawn the bureaucratic teeth of the Commission’s draft, for across-the-board regulation – 130% of wholesale rates – would have involved an immense amount of bureaucracy and would have been incompatible with the objective of better regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">We all agree on the objectives, although I have to admit that there are those in this House who are trying to control the prices charged to end-users, and I am thankful that the Europe tariff is high enough to permit competition to develop below it. I am pretty sure that, because this regulation is limited to three years, this competition will kick in relatively quickly, and that we will see the roaming rates remaining below this upper limit, since we will at the same time have achieved the objective of creating greater transparency and empowering consumers. I am convinced that it cannot be our function to fix the prices charged to end-users, and we just managed to strike out that sort of outright fixing of end prices.</p>
      <p sl="de">Years ago – as Mr Goebbels, who was there, will recall – we opted for another approach when it came to cross-border payments, which we regulated in such a way that prices were fixed within the internal market. Insisting on the same prices for transfers within a Member State and across borders makes perfect sense in regulatory terms, but what we are doing here threatens to transgress the bounds of that which is tolerable. I will nevertheless be voting in favour and would like to express my thanks to the House’s negotiators, to the committee chairmen, to the Council, and, finally, to the Commission for being prepared, once the negotiations were over, to agree to this compromise after all.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Jacques Delors said at one time that it is difficult to love the internal market. Now it has been demonstrated by the Commissioner, by the rapporteur Mr Rübig and by Parliament that it is nevertheless possible. The EU means not only the elimination of custom duties but also the free movement of goods in the internal market. Today’s legislation signifies the strengthening of the European idea.</p>
      <p sl="hu">According to preliminary calculations, roaming charges will keep approximately 800 million forints in customers’ pockets. I am convinced that a wider use of telephone services will successfully counterbalance this loss of revenue and no employee will be put at a disadvantage.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Commissioner for taking into consideration the case of the blind and partially-sighted, for whom information about rates will be provided by voice rather than SMS. I wish all Europeans happy roaming and happy summer holidays! Let us all enjoy today’s success.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-062" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joachim Wuermeling" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members – who have given me such a warm welcome – I know from past experience that your House keeps to a strict timetable, but I would nevertheless like to say something about one or two of the points that have featured in today’s debate, and I wish to do so not least as an indication of the culture of dialogue that the German Presidency wishes to encourage.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although many Members of your House – Mr Alvaro, Mr Reul, and Mr Farage, among others – have taken a critical view of the intervention in the market, I should like to remind you that we are all agreed on the market’s need for rules, and for competition to be fair, which it simply was not in the realm of roaming charges, since consumers had no choice between the various services on offer. That was why competition was not fair; that was why it was necessary to do something about it. The single market gains credibility in the eyes of the public only if the European Union ensures that they are not put at a disadvantage within it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some people have been given the impression that those who are in favour of low maximum prices are the ones on the side of the consumer, while those who favour higher maximum prices are fighting the companies’ corner. In the Council, too, there were many who spoke in favour of putting the prices a bit higher, but things are not as simple as all that, for it is of course dynamic and tough competition that does most to benefit consumers.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to remind you all that it is that sort of competition on which the success of the single market and of all forms of liberalisation is founded. It is crucial that a diversity of tariffs remain in place, and that there should be innovations in the field of roaming as much as elsewhere, and this is something to which many Member States, in the Council of Ministers, attached great importance. Setting roaming charges in stone would benefit nobody, for then there would be no scope for flat rate, for hourly contract or for bonus schemes, and what we want instead is to maintain the possibility of the consumer, and also industry, being able to determine the services on offer, with consumers continuing to have a free choice, and that is what this compromise achieves.</p>
      <p sl="de">A great deal has been said from various quarters about the point at which the regulation is to enter into force, and I can assure you that the German Presidency has the greatest possible interest in getting this to happen as soon as possible, but the simple fact of the matter is that a number of formal steps have to be completed between today’s vote and the publication in the Official Journal; first of all, your resolution must be communicated to the Council, which must then come to a policy agreement on it – this will happen on 7 June – and then the versions of it in various languages must be produced – which will happen in the second week of June – then, in the third week of that month, the lawyer-linguists in all the institutions must read through it again, after which COREPER and the Council must formally adopt it, so that a great deal of effort will be required to get it published on 29 June.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can assure you, though, that this dossier is being given priority in all the bodies required to deal with it; all deadlines are being cut, practically all meetings are being dispensed with, and much is being done through written processes; the fact that only in this timeframe can a correct procedure be ensured is something that should be borne in mind by all those who want to obviate legal risks in the publication of this regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think I can say, without having checked all the details, that, by the speed with which this directive has been adopted, we have broken a European record, and, since I have never in my life heard of a European champion who was angry at having run two-tenths of a second too slow, then neither should we be. Instead, let us rejoice in our shared success.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is a good day for Parliament, with a good consensus to get rid of market failure and to guarantee consumer protection. Permit me to respond briefly to the questions that have been raised.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first thing is that we are not fixing prices; we are setting ceilings under which competition will have ample room to offer attractive price packages. I would also underline that the consensus reached today is very close to the Commission’s original proposal but with the flexibility, which the Commission welcomes, for customers to choose other packages when they wish.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has been some criticism of the regulation of prices at retail level. It is true that this is a very exceptional circumstance, which has to be taken into consideration when there is a market failure. Here we have a market failure at European level. We very often have market failure at national level, and then the national regulators regulate retail prices. So what we are doing at European level is also done regularly at national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">There was a question as to why the Commission is doing nothing against cartels. The Commission is acting; my colleague Mrs Kroes has investigated them under competition rules. In the case of roaming, it is much more efficient to work with ex ante regulation, and that this is effective has been shown by the fact that it has been possible to come up with a piece of legislation after just 10 months of work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many colleagues also raised the question of regulating roaming data communications. I can assure Parliament that during the next 18 months the national regulators will monitor the price of data communications and they will report to the Commission. I hope that today will be a wake-up call for operators also in terms of data roaming, and I hope that they will bring down those prices so that we will not have to intervene on that issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">Madam President, I will say just a few words in German. I am delighted that Mr Langen has abandoned his resistance and at last agreed to a compromise, something that he found difficult but has nevertheless – I think – managed to accomplish.</p>
      <p sl="de">To my friend Mr Wuermeling I would like to say that I really do ask the Council to get its skates on and get the regulation published in the Official Journal as soon possible – by which I do not mean only at the end of June, but a good deal earlier.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, this is a great day for Parliament, for a Parliament that is united in defending Europeans beyond the usual political divisions. It is an excellent thing and, as a former MEP, I am pleased to see it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also a great day for the European institutions, which are demonstrating their ability to act in the common interest, quickly, effectively and as one. It is a great day for Europeans, who are seeing the Europe of the people and the Europe of practical projects in operation. Finally, it is of course a great day for consumers, whether they be tourists or business travellers: they have seen their European institutions right the failure of the roaming market with capped Eurotariffs and price transparency. They will be able to see the effect of this action because their telephone bills are going to decrease greatly. With today’s decision, one of the last barriers of Europe has come down, that of overbilling, which penalises those citizens who exercise their right to free movement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me to conclude with an appeal to telephone operators: I should like to ask them not to wait any longer and to enter into a genuine competition to offer the best roaming tariff to their consumers, a tariff below the ceilings on which Parliament is going to decide today.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am pleased to see that in the case of the report on roaming the vast majority of Members of this Chamber have placed themselves in the position of citizens and consumers rather than, as has happened on many other occasions, advocates of the interests of one or another industrial sector. This Parliament has in fact united to demand, in addition to the reduced tariff system and transparency, that the regulation be applied from the beginning of the summer, so that users may benefit from it during the holiday period. I would like to thank Commissioner Reding, who has been strongly in favour of this regulation, for her efforts, and the rapporteurs who succeeded in obtaining better tariffs than those proposed by the Council. What we need now is one last effort: by the Council to rapidly adopt the document and to show that the EU is with its citizens, and by all the institutions to ensure the greatest possible transparency and provision of information, so that all citizens are aware of their rights and may benefit as much as possible from this success. We have shown that with the right will and cooperation it is possible to confront even the large economic monopolies, to everyone’s benefit. My hope is that, after this, other battles may be similarly successful.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The motive for the present regulation of roaming charges is the fact that roaming rates have turned out to be unreasonably high in spite of the growing competition and the liberalisation of markets in recent years. Intervention was necessary because the market did not live up to expectations, and distortions showed up in its operation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">That is precisely why I consider it necessary to draw attention to a point in the regulation that aims to prevent similar potential distortions occurring in the data communications market. For in this point the regulation provides that the European Commission shall monitor and evaluate the market not only for voice communication but also for data communication (SMS, MMS, Internet), and if necessary, extend the regulation to that field as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The international market for data transmission plays an increasingly important role due to fast-paced technological advances. Internet-based voice transmission (VoIP) is revolutionising telephony, opening the door to cheaper calls. The spread of 3G networks and of other related technologies has a significant impact on the market for mobile services.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Closer attention to market processes is therefore justified in the interest of consumers and competition, with the prospect of proportionate intervention if they are not working satisfactorily. Indeed, a situation where citizens and businesses pay fees over and above those justified for recouping necessary technical outlays has a very negative impact on competitiveness and on the efficient operation of the internal market.</p>

    <intervention id="3-071" speaker_id="28199" name="Gábor Harangozó" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="en">The debate on regulating the roaming on public networks activity in Europe is to be seen in the broad context of a lack of knowledge and precise data on the volumes and revenues at stake. Clear assessment and monitoring of the situation are therefore required if we want to successfully achieve a balanced regulation of roaming activity, a balanced approach that would take into account the interests of both the consumers and the telecommunication industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the obvious lack of transparency in this area of the market, it is clear that competition distortion and excessive prices have been hampering the development of a healthy and competitive internal market in this sector. We therefore strongly support the main aspects of the Commission proposal and the improvements proposed in Mr Rübig’s report. We cannot allow European citizens to continue paying unjustifiably high prices. We therefore have the responsibility to ensure the development of a fair, dynamic and globally competitive internal market in the roaming sector by providing accurate information to the consumer allowing them to make real choices when comparing operators. Besides better consumer information and closer monitoring of the sector, we have to ensure a substantial reduction in roaming prices.</p>

      <p sl="en">în scris. – Regulamentul european privind tarifele de roaming este unul oportun pentru cetăţenii români pe care-i reprezint în acest for.</p>
      <p sl="en">Motivul principal este cel al corectării unui nivel nejustificat al preţurilor. Conform statisticii Comisiei Europene, preţurile la telefonia mobilă din România pentru o convorbire medie de 4 minute pe teritoriul Uniunii Europene variază între 3,12 euro şi 9,52 euro.</p>
      <p sl="en">Pe de altă parte, piaţa românească este una matură, înregistrând una dintre cele mai ridicate rate de creştere din ultimii ani. Sectorul comunicaţiilor a contribuit cu un procent de 9% din PIB încă din 2005. Doi dintre cei mai mari operatori din lume au intrat pe piaţa românească de ani buni, ceea ce arată stabilitatea şi maturitatea pieţei. De aceea ne bucurăm că demersurile de excludere a României şi Bulgariei de la aplicarea acestei reglementări au fost respinse prin votul dumneavoastră din comisii. Nu putem pe de o parte să deschidem pieţele, iar pe de alta să limităm accesul consumatorilor români la piaţa comună.</p>

      <p sl="fi">One of the crucial questions in EU legislative work should be what things in general need to be regulated and what method of regulation best promotes the objective set. On the one hand we have to address the flaws in the system and ensure that regulation is detailed enough to achieve the objective. On the other hand, regulation has to be sufficiently flexible for it to encourage competition and innovation and not paralyse development with quibbling details.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The compromise achieved on the proposal for a regulation to lower roaming charges is, I think, an excellent piece of EU legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">First of all it corrects a flaw. Telecommunications operators have kept charges for phone calls overseas unreasonably high for years, and they have not engaged in healthy competition in their pricing policies. Despite prompting by the Commission, charges have barely fallen. As in this case the market was unable to correct its own errors, it had to be done by means of EU legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is a concrete example of a benefit which the EU has produced for consumers, which should be remembered when next time people feel like raging about the EU. We have to interfere if the market is not working and operators are overcharging, using means which directly and substantially reduce people’s mobile phone bills when abroad.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Secondly, the regulation specifically points the market in a healthier direction: it will not stifle it, but encourage competition in the future. Price caps for phone calls in the regulation have not been brought down so low that there is no room for competition beneath them. Low price caps will also boost competition in other areas of the business. The regulation, furthermore, will have a far-reaching impact: if charges are guided downwards it would be silly to raise them again once the regulation has expired.</p>
      <p sl="fi">With capped prices operators will nevertheless be left with a profit margin, enabling product development and innovation to continue.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0068/2007) by Marie Panayotopoulous-Cassiotou, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on ‘promoting decent work for all’ (2006/2240(INI)).</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, allow me to wait a moment while the Commissioner takes his seat and please do not count the time.</p>
      <p sl="el">The concept of decent work as a set of rules and conditions which safeguard respect for workers as human beings was introduced by the International Labour Organisation in 2000 and developed into an internationally pursued objective with the recommendations of the UN Summit of Heads of State or Government in September 2005, within the framework of the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="el">In July 2006, the High-Level Segment of the UN Economic and Social Council adopted a declaration underscoring the priority of managing to achieve productive, full-time employment and decent work for all.</p>
      <p sl="el">The concept conveyed in the Latin-based adjective ‘decent’ has the sense of bestowal, of condescension, so that there is decorum. The Greek word for dignity emphasises the need to bestow value. However, the German word for dignity completely conveys the objective of the global endeavour, combining as it does the word for dignity and the word for man.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Commission communication in May 2006 on promoting decent work for all lays the foundations for the European Union to make a structured contribution to the application of all the objectives of the integrated view of human work under conditions of freedom, equality, security and human dignity.</p>
      <p sl="el">The four basic pillars of the concept of decent work are, as we know, the creation of jobs for productive work with freedom of choice, guaranteed rights, extensive social protection, the safeguarding of conditions of health and safety, the promotion of social dialogue and the peaceful resolution of differences, with a horizontal dimension of respect for the equality of men and women.</p>
      <p sl="el">Five International Labour Organisation conventions safeguard fundamental employment rights: trade union freedom, the promotion of collective bargaining, the abolition of child labour and equal pay for men and women. We hope that the other International Labour Organisation conventions awaiting ratification will be signed and put into practice.</p>
      <p sl="el">Following the Council decision in December 2006, the European Parliament Committee on Employment and Social Affairs welcomes the Commission’s objectives in its report. The objectives must be to:</p>
      <p sl="el">achieve social and economic progress and ensure that it is spread fairly for the benefit of all;</p>
      <p sl="el">strengthen entrepreneurship by adjusting expenditure to the changing phases of the business cycle;</p>
      <p sl="el">design active labour market policies as a component of long-term economic policy;</p>
      <p sl="el">strengthen the institutional capacity for the participation of the social partners and the development of social dialogue;</p>
      <p sl="el">strengthen the employability of all grades of workers, especially of women, youth and the elderly, with renewed education systems;</p>
      <p sl="el">consolidate lifelong learning so that everyone can benefit from progress in science, technology and communications and adjust it to the enhanced demand for qualifications and skills.</p>
      <p sl="el">Certainly there is no one-size-fits-all model of social policies and regulations on the labour market. The European Union is proud because, apart from far-reaching efforts by Member States to ratify the ILO international conventions, it is the economic power that presents common characteristics of social awareness throughout its length and breadth. The European social model aims for productivity and economic performance for the benefit of all, a high standard of social benefits, the safeguarding of conditions of health and safety, the provision of training, education, and retraining of all ages and all categories of workers and social dialogue with equal opportunities for all.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Employment Strategy, the social protection and social integration strategies, the national reform programmes, the revised Lisbon Strategy on development and employment which retains and improves the acquis communautaire and the European strategy on sustainable development are the roadmap of the European Union for achieving the objectives of decent work.</p>
      <p sl="el">Decent work is also a matter of governance. The implementation of effective policies focused on decent work requires accountable institutions, a political commitment to sound management of the state and a vibrant and organised civil society.</p>
      <p sl="el">As far as the European Union is concerned, I hope that it will find a way to combine flexibility of the market and guaranteed security for workers. However, economic globalisation, the globalisation of markets, technologies, information and labour, is a phenomenon which there are plans to speed up by strengthening economic multi-polarity.</p>
      <p sl="el">China is proving to be at the top of the league, along with India and other powers. At the same time, a gap appears to be opening between the rich and the poor, even in developed and industrialised countries. It is time for the European Union to show the planet its values.</p>
      <p sl="el">In this report, the European Parliament is strengthening the Commission’s intention to integrate decent work into its foreign policies, in cooperation with the institutions of the UN, national and regional organisations, the social partners and other segments of civil society.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Commission and the Member States are being called upon to coordinate decent work more effectively in external cooperation and trade policy programmes and to help to implement the national programmes of the ILO on decent work.</p>
      <p sl="el">My thanks to the three committees for their opinions and to everyone who helped in the presentation of this report.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, honourable Members, I should like to thank Mrs Panayatopoulos-Cassiotou for her report. It was worked on by several parliamentary groups, and is clearly an excellent report. I should also like to point out that decent work is a worldwide initiative drawn up by the International Labour Organisation, and thanks to staunch support from the EU it has become a genuinely worldwide initiative, accepted by an ever greater number of countries.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Council has given its backing to the concept of decent work, and it was also addressed recently at a meeting of work and social affairs ministers in the context of the G8. The Commission completely accepts Parliament’s view that the basic elements of decent work – namely, social support, social cohesion, dignified work and the opportunity for free trade-union activities – should be implemented across all international contacts, whether at a bilateral or a multilateral level, and also when setting up individual projects with third countries. This is very much in keeping with the Commission’s social agenda and with the main guidelines set out in the above-mentioned communication.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Although the project is gaining increasing support, it is abundantly clear that much remains to be done. I feel that the priority is to ensure that all ILO conventions are ratified in the EU. In this regard, the Commission is making use of the resources at its disposal and at present we are heavily involved in the ratification moves and social dialogue connected with the new conventions for seafarers.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Honourable Members, the decent work initiative clearly has strong ethical foundations. Furthermore, the initiative will enable us to formulate principles regarding globalisation, so that we may enjoy its benefits while minimising its drawbacks. It is therefore a process which is very much alive and the Commission will, in every instance, make the most of the opportunities it brings.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, half the world’s workers have an income of less than two dollars per day, and half the world’s population enjoys no social security protection whatever; two million people a year die in accidents at work or from work-related illnesses, and over 160 million workers become ill as a consequence of hazards in the workplace.</p>
      <p sl="de">The number officially registered as unemployed are only the tip of the iceberg. The poor cannot afford to be idle; many of them work for hours on end under often intolerable conditions in order to scrape at least some sort of earnings together. The European Union and its Member States should do everything in their power to do justice across the board to the promotion of work with dignity as part of the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. What is needed is a fair and innovative fiscal policy, and I am thinking here in terms of the taxation of such things as financial and currency transactions. Major companies that repeatedly violate human rights and the rights of workers must be brought to the point where they comply with the criteria for proper and decent work, and this should be done by means of sanctions, such as – and this would be appropriate – their being excluded from application for public procurement tenders and from export credit guarantees issued by international financial institutions.

      <p sl="fr">Since the 2005 United Nations Summit, the promotion of decent work has been recognised as an objective of the entire international community. With its communication, the European Commission has begun to consider the issues at stake in this matter, not least its international dimension: I am referring to the EU’s external policies, concerning in particular international trade, hence the work of the Committee on International Trade.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should therefore like to focus on this aspect and express my satisfaction that, through this report, Parliament is taking up several practical proposals that were submitted by my group. These proposals had already been adopted in the opinion of the Committee on International Trade and will make it possible to initiate a new EU policy aimed at promoting social standards at international level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, the Union already makes the signing of preferential trade agreements with developing countries conditional on the ratification of the International Labour Organisation conventions. We are now calling for the sanctioning, the suspension of the preferences granted to countries that seriously and systematically violate fundamental labour standards and, more specifically, freedom of association.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, all future bilateral trade agreements and, in particular, the new free trade agreements, which are due to be negotiated within the context of the global Europe strategy, must include social clauses on respect for decent work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, the multilateral dimension must not be abandoned, because it is the multilateral framework – that of the WTO – which today governs the bulk of trade. However, the Commission communication does not mention it whatsoever.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The debate therefore needs to be re-opened within the WTO. Europe could take a number of initiatives in this regard. Firstly, it could propose the creation of a ‘Trade and decent work’ committee within the WTO, on the model of the ‘Trade and environment’ committee, which has enabled some important progress to be made. Secondly, it could call for the ILO to be granted observer status within the WTO. Thirdly, it could call for the pre-eminence of the decisions taken by the International Labour Organisation to be recognised when the latter decides to call for trade sanctions against countries such as Burma, for example, which is seemingly violating trade union rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have made a number of other practical proposals. I believe that it is in our interest to promote a form of regulated globalisation that …</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the Commissioner has helpfully reminded us of the worldwide initiative on decent work and that it has been recently endorsed by the G8. Indeed, at a UN summit in September 2005 as many as 150 world leaders agreed that the International Labour Organisation concept of decent work should become a central objective of their own national policies. Essentially, of course, this agenda concerns countries where such a concept does not really exist. Within Europe, frameworks providing conditions for decent work are largely in place, though implementation here can always be improved.</p>
      <p sl="de">The rapporteur has shown not only personal initiative in bringing this report to Parliament, but also that a member of the centre-right political family can not only take the lead on this important agenda but also generate substantial cross-party support.</p>
      <p sl="de">That said, there were some close votes in committee that changed the overall balance of the report by inserting new points or paragraphs. These we hope to change in the full vote in the House later today, either by deletion or by modification via agreed compromises with other political groups. In promoting the concept of decent work, we should all be on the same side.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, Parliament does not have the powers to instruct Member States on what to do in this area, and rightly so: it is for Member State governments to decide. However, all such governments should surely agree the importance of providing lifelong-learning opportunities, the need to be proactive on increasing women’s participation in the labour market, the need to do so much more to resolve the challenges of reconciling work and family life and, above all, the need to offer help to the developing world.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a thoughtful report, which deserves to be widely read.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report. The report includes a very long resolution running to 94 paragraphs, but for me its essence is summed up in two paragraphs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recital V states that ‘in order to strengthen the competitiveness of the European Union in a socially sustainable way, it is important to improve productivity by promoting decent work and the quality of working life, including health and safety at work, a better balance between flexibility and security in employment, lifelong learning, mutual trust and participation as well as a better conciliation between private/family and working life; combating gender discrimination and all other forms of discrimination’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Paragraph 6 calls for ‘a better mobilisation of the internal and external policies of the EU on the promotion of the decent work agenda, especially in matters of development, external assistance, enlargement, neighbourhood policy, trade, migration and external bilateral and multilateral relations’.</p>
      <p sl="en">If these two paragraphs were fully implemented, the EU would have made great strides in promoting the decent work agenda, both here at home and globally.</p>
      <p sl="en">Other paragraphs of importance to me include paragraphs 46, 48 and 51, which broadly cover the need for European multinational corporations to behave in a socially responsible fashion in their global operations. These build on our earlier work on the subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of paragraphs set out the need for the EU to use its trade and economic power as levers to promote the decent work agenda globally. For example, paragraph 8 calls for the full and proper implementation of GSP+, in line with the debate we promoted with Commissioner Mandelson on the subject last year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I want to highlight paragraph 47. This calls for the development of ‘a label for products that are produced under conditions that respect the principles of decent work and conform to core labour standards, and that specifically exclude any child labour input’. Let us empower European consumers to drive forward the decent work agenda in their daily choices.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, on preparing this very important document and thank her for her cooperation in discussing changes and seeking compromises.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Today we are talking about trying to attain decent working conditions for everyone, whether in the Community or beyond its borders.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I fully support the Commission's initiative, because increasing employment and improving working conditions is one of the most important tasks, one that should not be procrastinated. However, since we are talking about decent working conditions for everyone, it is worth taking a look at what our working conditions are here in the Community.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Not long ago our colleague Baroness Sarah Ludford and I spoke in London with some Lithuanians living and working there, and with some representatives of trade unions and employees of the Lithuanian Embassy.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It appears that most of the Lithuanians working in London can only dream about decent working conditions. Temporary employment agencies often break the law, demanding illegal payment for job searches and for preparation of documents. They take passports and do not give them back. Particularly flagrant is the exploitation in the hotel industry, where employers do not pay the minimum wage defined by law. After this visit, Sarah Ludford called the Lithuanians in London the slaves of the twenty-first century.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Commissioner, we have an agency in Dublin which investigates working and living conditions. More than once I have spoken with the head of the agency and requested that an investigation be undertaken. Now I am asking, Commissioner, that with the help of this agency you undertake an investigation concerning the economic, social and psychological exploitation of migrants in the Community and recommend measures to eliminate it.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I support the rapporteur's position, which is that the Commission should always provide the European Parliament and the Council with all political measures required to stimulate decent working conditions for the Community's people as well as an account of their effectiveness.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the processes of globalisation taking place in the European Union and the world are attended by tremendous changes in ownership, culture and society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Varying levels of economic development and living standards have led to migration on a vast scale in the search for work. According to the International Labour Organisation there are some 192 million unemployed people in the world and 86 million migrants, of whom 34 million are in the developing regions of the world.</p>
      <p sl="pl">People who are hungry are prepared to leave their homes and families to take on any work they can find, and this often puts them at the mercy of criminals. The numbers are shocking: according to the ILO, in 2004 alone some 2.54 million people were sold into forced labour, about 43% for sexual purposes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The question this raises is: why is this happening? Why are so many countries, including some in the European Union, unable to control the problem?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, this report contains a plethora of good ideas and positive suggestions for decent work, and, for that, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou deserves our thanks. While demanding these things, though, we should also bear in mind that there are in the EU over 20 million people without work, many of whom are stigmatised and suffer exclusion; nor should it be forgotten that more and more workers, even though they have jobs, do not earn a living wage and that what are termed ‘precarious working conditions’ are used as a means of circumventing labour and tax law, with young people in particular being exploited. While all this is going on, the economy is expanding and the gross domestic product is on the rise. If a fair society without either poverty or exclusion is to be established, a radical paradigm shift is called for, and the best way of going about this is to be found in the idea of an unconditional basic income for all. The Commission would be well-advised to join with the Council in examining this idea in depth.</p>

      <p sl="el">However, there is still a lot of work to be done as regards the actual concept of decent work and the application of this concept to all the European Union’s foreign policies.</p>
      <p sl="el">Balancing economic development and social and labour development presents the Union with a unique opportunity today. Consequently, a very detailed evaluation of trends on the labour market is needed, not only at the level of employment, but also of its nature and quality; in other words, decent work.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, as the European Union, we must make provision so that the promotion of gender equality continues within the framework of the policy for decent work through integrated and better-coordinated overall action for non-discrimination and equality.</p>

Cleaning out a cesspit, out in all weathers, knee deep in mud mending broken gas mains or removing asbestos from the Berlaymont Building is hardly decent work, but somebody has to do it – or do generous rates of pay turn a rotten job into a decent one?</p>
      <p sl="de">I am intrigued, therefore, by paragraph 27, which talks about establishing a standard definition of forced labour. Forced labour, here, in the EU? Or is that a reference to the exploitation of people illegally trafficked from one country to another? Now that does need cracking down on, and the best way to do that is to restore national borders and carefully check all those seeking to cross them. At the moment, it is open house all the way from the Russian frontier to the Atlantic coast. No wonder we now have people-trafficking on a massive scale and forced labour to follow it.</p>

Un trai decent în Europa se va baza pe atenţia pe care Uniunea o va da oamenilor care nu au un loc de muncă, acţiune susţinută prin propagarea principiilor sociale şi de politică externă. Desigur, este necesară armonizarea dialogului între instituţii, iar Comisia Europeană are un rol vital în aplicarea legislaţiei şi a responsabilităţilor care-i sunt conferite. Contribuţia organizaţiilor internaţionale, documentele prezentate în preambul de către raportor sunt de mare valoare pentru aprecierea obiectivă a acestui aspect, dar nu şi suficientă, fiindcă trebuie avute în vedere şi firmele private care pot asigura locuri de muncă şi pot oferi premisele creşterii economice şi implicit o viaţă mai bună. Prioritatea raportului dezbătut astăzi la Strasbourg sper să devină şi prioritatea guvernelor naţionale, care trebuie să pună cap la cap piesele acestui puzzle şi să elaboreze strategii socio-economice puternice pentru a se crea locuri de muncă, cu respectarea strictă a drepturilor fundamentale ale cetăţenilor şi cu combaterea încălcării dreptului la muncă.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commission and to the rapporteur for having decided to tackle such an important issue. I shall not dwell upon the need to ensure that all the countries in the Union and, above all, the new Member States ratify the main agreements on this matter as soon as possible, or on the EU’s duty to eliminate all types of discrimination based on gender, religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation, as well as all types of improper conduct such as the still prevalent phenomenon of harassment, which may interfere with workers’ professional or private lives.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like most of all to urge that we stop seeing things through the prism of an economy on an industrial scale grafted onto an eighteenth-century model. We cannot rely for our growth either on our own natural resources or on the availability of labour such as that in China, so we need a real revolution in thinking; we must realise, in fact, that we need to invest in human resources and to train people, offer them security and opportunities for growth. This is the best solution, if not the only one, for promoting the EU’s competitiveness and achieving the Lisbon objectives. If in the new economies such as Brazil or the Asian tigers the challenge of international trade is based on quantity, Europe has a duty and above all the possibility of differentiating itself by focusing on quality, creativity, and its cultural, intellectual and scientific heritage – in other words, on the main elements of our circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="it">The tertiary sector, whose raw material is people, seen not as bodies but as brains, is now the dominant sector. If, therefore, we give our citizens the possibility of expressing as well as they can their capacities and the skills acquired during years of study, then we will be ready to be a principal actor on the international stage – a role that we are in danger of losing. Economic development must be at the service of human beings, and not the other way round.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I support the report by Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, whom I wish to greet and congratulate. The issue of the quality of work is not just about workers’ rights; that would be a reductive view. It is vital that the quality of work be seen as a much broader issue, because, for a start, higher quality in the working environment is one of the most significant factors in increased productivity and, in turn, increased competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The quality of work revolves around having the right public policies and the performance of companies in different areas such as access to infrastructure and communication technologies, education, vocational training, lifelong learning, health and safety at work and access to the labour market. From the companies’ point of view, the quality of work revolves around leadership, career prospects and the organisation of work. I should also like to mention a further reason why we need to focus on this subject. For Europe to carry out much needed reforms at various levels in order to become more competitive in relation to the rest of the world, there needs to be a change of behaviour and attitude, on the part of both companies and workers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The greater the trust between the parties, the easier the reforms will be to implement. Moreover, the more intensive the dialogue, the higher the level of trust, and the greater the transparency on issues relating to the processes of restructuring or change. In my view, European political, economic and social agents must, as things stand, make the most of the opportunity to step up social dialogue at both Member State and European level. This issue of the quality of work will also help to realise this big opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, it is extremely positive that the Commission will be actively supporting the International Labour Organisation’s strategy for decent work.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Decent work is more than simply respecting the ILO’s fundamental working standards, important though they are. It is also about people’s entitlement to viable pay and to social protection, and to their right to organise themselves in trade unions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At the moment, one and a half billion people in the world do not earn enough to cover their basic needs, even though 90% of all countries in the world have a legal minimum wage; in many cases, though, people working from home, workers on the land or people with precarious contracts do not fall within its scope, or the law is not applied. Social consultation and trade union rights are therefore crucial to guarantee the right to decent work for everyone.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is why I am particularly pleased about the joint declaration by the European Trade Union Congress and the American trade unions of their shared intention to fight for decent work.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe should place decent work at the heart of its foreign policy, so that the benefits of globalisation can be shared more evenly and social dumping in respect of pay- and work-related conditions in more developed economies be avoided. Trade agreements concluded between the European Union and countries such as India or Korea, which are the subject of current negotiation, should support decent work, and trade preferences should be withdrawn if countries systematically violate fundamental social rights.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe should also support its partners in the developing countries so that these can prioritise decent work in their national or regional strategy plans and in European partnership agreements.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Not only governments, but also multinationals bear a heavy responsibility with regard to guaranteeing fair wages and working conditions. Multinationals that have head offices in the European Union, but subsidiaries and sub-contractors elsewhere in the world, and that persistently violate those fundamental rights should be blacklisted and excluded from all public tenders in Europe.</p>

There are a number of statements in this report that have given rise to some debate, but I would pose the question: is there anything in this report that should not apply to a member of my family? And whether members of my family live in Ireland or in Poland or indeed if they are third country nationals, I would want the provisions in this report to apply to them. So, if we really mean to promote decent work for all and not just those who because of their birth, their position in society or education can access decent work, then this report is a major step in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said, this report is balanced. Just as a member of my family might be seeking work, they might equally be a small entrepreneur, an SME struggling to survive and thereby create decent work. This report promotes business that does not seek to exploit, that does not engage in social dumping and that does not violate core labour standards. I suspect that most of us would like to work for, or indeed manage such companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is constant tension between the demands of the market and the promotion of a just and equitable society. One group of workers, carers – in fact the largest single group of workers in Europe – often falls between two stools. The market does not recognise or reward them as they do not contribute significantly to GDP growth. Yet they are the glue that holds society together. Without this group of workers societal structures as we know them would collapse, and then who would the market serve?</p>

Yet one only needs to look at the growth in unstable work, poorly paid work, the millions of accidents at work, poverty among workers, unemployment and fresh attacks on the rights of those who are in work – of which so-called flexicurity is a prime example – to realise the contradictions with which we are dealing and which lead workers to protest and struggle.

It is the work of young people, of women, of children, in the United Kingdom or in Portugal; it is the work of migrants, of slaves in diplomatic missions, especially in the Middle East; it is the work of employees in France; it is those who commit suicide at work, at Renault for example; it is the obscene salaries – EUR 1 000 per month for cashiers, builders, workmen – that make it possible precisely to re-form the workforce; and, at the end of a life of exploitation, it is the retirements of shame: EUR 130 for a farm woman’s husband. When it costs EUR 10 to impound a dog, one cannot even impound a retired farm woman!</p>
      <p sl="fr">What are the causes? Well, the causes are the new forms of global capitalism, which is not industrial capitalism, but financial capitalism, in search of a 15% return. In order to obtain such a profit, the capitalism of pension funds, speculative funds, hedge funds, exerts three types of pressure: on salaries, on employees – who use just-in-time methods and who are stressed, hence the suicides – and on the number of employees. Another cause is the immigrant workers from Latin America and Africa to El Ejido in Andalusia, in workshops, in the restaurants of Barcelona, on worksites. It is globalisation, where Chinese workers on 25 cents an hour become the model international worker.</p>

Four things: we should wage social battles, we should wage legal battles, at the ILO and the WTO, by showing imagination, not least with deductible customs duties, we should wage political battles and, above all, we should be clear-sighted and call things by their true name – the deregulated market is capitalism and globalisation, and it is also worldwide financial capitalism.</p>

The fight for decent work is beginning in the EU. We are concerned here not only with the fight against moonlighting but also with decent working conditions within the EU, with living wages and with opportunities for professional development and for exercising influence in the workplace. The fact is that if we are to be able to make progress with these issues globally, we must ourselves first comply with the principle of decent working conditions at home, and that is not something that we are doing fully. We need also continually to work on the situation in all the EU Member States. In international work we have the International Labour Organisation’s conventions, which constitute a good basis for working on. Trade and open borders are important, and I am a supporter of both. It is also important, however, that we at the same time work to bring about sound environmental and working conditions for people in countries poorer than the EU countries. What is at issue in these countries too is the right to organise and to obtain decent wages and working conditions. What responsibility do the various players have, then? Clearly, the EU has a responsibility as an international player in trade and other contexts. The Member States have a responsibility, but companies, too, have a responsibility, including a social responsibility. Sometimes, conflicts are set up between decent work and opportunities for growth. I believe, however, that the two are linked, as without decent work we shall not obtain long-term sustainable growth.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The report is highly relevant, since a debate was recently launched within the European Union’s institutions concerning labour law reform, social dialogue and measures that strengthen social security. These debates might turn out to cancel each other out, but our decision now could help ensure that they lead in the same direction after all.</p>
      <p sl="hu">And what the report has to say is strategic as well, since its concepts of ‘decent work’ demonstrate what employment security, social security, partnership, rights in the workplace, and the equality of men and women mean or ought to mean. All this is inseparable from the strategy for ending poverty, for eliminating the threat of the poverty trap.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Poverty is a mark of shame on the face of Europe, and therefore the introduction of a minimum wage system in each Member State is unavoidable, although in this area as well, significant differences between the old and new Member States are to be expected. Nonetheless, in the long term this arrangement will mean putting an end to living standards that are beneath human dignity.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, every year there are 270 million industrial accidents. In all, 2.2 million employees per year die as a result of unsafe working environments, and it is estimated that 60 million children around the world are engaged in hard and dangerous work. In the World Trade Organisation, in our trade agreements and in our development aid, there must be more focus on decent work. European consumers must also be mobilised, however. Consumers are willing to fight for employees’ rights. We see this in the growing interest in fair trade products, for which consumers are willing to pay extra if they can be certain that they are produced under decent working conditions.</p>
      <p sl="da">Consumers, customers, employees and investors should have the opportunity to choose or reject products and suppliers on the basis of whether or not workers have had to risk life and limb in the manufacturing process. A voluntary product label for goods produced in decent working environments would give consumers the information that is necessary if decent working conditions are to remain in the interests of both consumers and companies. An EU product label developed around the fundamental workers’ rights laid down by the International Labour Organisation could make a difference.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Honourable Members, it would be very difficult, in the time available to me, to make an adequate contribution to this debate. I should like therefore to try to focus only on the most important point. It is clear from the debate that Parliament is strongly in favour of promoting the concept of decent work for all in such a way that it forms part of a strategy formulated by the Commission. Secondly, this is a global project which applies under all conditions and in all countries, regardless of their level of development, and that naturally includes the Member States of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It was also emphasised that even in the EU, standards are not always upheld in some situations, particularly when it comes to illegal work. The Commission has therefore adopted a proposal to crack down on migrants working illegally, and is planning to draw up a more cohesive strategy on combating undeclared work.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I should also like to say that in the first half of 2008, the Commission will publicise a monitoring report on Union initiatives concerning decent work. The promotion of this global concept is something that brings together many areas, and this comes across very clearly in the proposed report. I should like once again to praise the report for its high quality and to thank the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="fr">At a time when globalisation is the source of unrest and social injustice, it is necessary to emphasise the European strategies that increase the social dimension of globalisation. The implementation of the decent work agenda is part of these strategies. Decent work can in fact help the fight against poverty and social exclusion because it enables the advantages of globalisation to be optimised by reducing the disadvantages.</p>
      <p sl="fr">True, the liberalisation of trade must contribute to the objectives of growth, full employment and a reduction in poverty, but, above all, it must be based on the promotion of decent work for all. Furthermore, if it is to be a constant factor in the EU’s external policies, then the promotion of decent work must be the premise and condition of the EU’s trade relations with third countries. In this connection, it is relevant to point out a mechanism guaranteeing the promotion of decent work, namely the system of generalised preferences. The SPG+ is in fact a vital lever that is able to encourage efforts in favour of sustainable development, good governance and the promotion of fundamental social rights.</p>

However much development work might need to be done, the people living nearby also need to be considered, and not only their health but also their acceptance of the work.</p>

      <p sl="pt">There is a further fundamental issue at stake here. The ‘trans-European networks’ are implemented with Community and Member State funding – in other words, clearly public funding – with the aim of completing the internal market, as explained in point 1 of the Council common position: ‘strong and integrated energy and transport networks are the cornerstone of the European internal market and that better use of the existing networks and the completion of missing links will make it possible to increase effectiveness and competitiveness.’ In other words, the completion of the internal market lies at the heart of these projects, with the opening up of the markets and with key sectors in the economy of a country being handed over to private interests, once, of course, public investment has been made.</p>

The EU has broken down barriers across Europe for many years, yet so many infrastructural barriers remain in energy and must be addressed. Scotland in particular has much to contribute to Europe’s energy needs but we need the necessary connections to do so, and I will be exploring all ways to lever EU funding into connections to maximise Scotland’s green energy potential.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the Rübig report on roaming on public mobile networks within the Community because the positions upheld in this report are going to make it possible significantly to improve the situation of European consumers. Many European citizens, including the inhabitants of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais border area, frequently travel abroad, for professional and personal reasons, and the tariffs currently in force when they make or receive calls on their mobiles are excessive and unjustifiable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Rübig report remedies a situation that penalises mobility. I am therefore in favour of the fixed tariffs in this report: the costs per minute that have been adopted are totally satisfactory and much lower than those currently applied. We would, however, have preferred even lower tariffs, which could have provided a better incentive for people to move about Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to significantly reduced tariffs, the requirement for transparency that has been requested is an important principle.

      <p sl="pt">It is interesting to note, in this case, the acknowledgement that the market does not work. Hence the need to regulate prices. They therefore propose both wholesale and retail price regulation, including the creation of a regulated retail price – Eurotariff – which all operators will be obliged to offer, in order to achieve a significant reduction in the price of roaming. Even so, the possibility remains of huge profit margins for the large operators in the sector. That being said, there are advantages for consumers: cheaper international calls, without this cost being transferred to national markets, and the freedom to choose the most favourable operator and tariff.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is another example of the ‘market’ clearly not protecting users and consumers, and this is why regulation is needed. It is high time the Commission and the Member States acknowledged this in other areas and brought benefit to consumers.</p>

Researchers in this area should investigate what market failure we are facing before populist measures are taken.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the long run it is free competition rather than price regulation that will most benefit consumers. To allow politicians to set prices instead of the market is almost never a constructive long-term solution.</p>

Anyone who has ever been abroad knows how expensive it is to make and receive calls, but there are dangers in the EU setting price ceilings. I would have been able to accept regulation at wholesaler level governing, for example, the relationship between Telia and a company in Spain, but I do not approve of setting a ceiling on prices for the consumer. It would not be a ceiling but a floor. If the ceiling is set at 49%, it is obviously that percentage that the companies will deduct. Companies’ profits would decline as they would previously have had revenue that could be used for competing in the national arena. If profits disappeared, this might lead to companies having to increase their national prices. The EU would then, instead, have weakened the vulnerable consumer whom it had always maintained it wanted to protect. The mobile market is a relatively new market. In Sweden, the market adjusted gradually and prices have fallen significantly. If only the system had been made more transparent, better technical solutions sought and the information systems spoken of in the proposal introduced, these measures would presumably have been enough to force prices down. Roaming prices have fallen substantially, and although this has certainly happened unevenly throughout Europe, it is still a sign that the market is regulating itself.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The idea of cohesion, which has been with us since the Treaty of Rome, is one of the cornerstones of the EU. In a nutshell, the development of some is the development of all.</p>
      <p sl="pt">History has shown us that cohesion, a tried and trusted concept, is characterised by generosity and realism, both for the Member States that have just joined and for those that have been in the Union for longer. I therefore feel, like the rapporteur and most European politicians, that cohesion, as a value, should be promoted and defended. I also feel, though, that it needs to be brought up to date. Objectives that ten or 15 years ago were excluded from cohesion, on account of more significant shortfalls and differences, are today issues that should definitely be included, in the context of a growing, more competitive economy. That being the case, cohesion must promote enhanced competences regarding research and development, on the one hand, and support for the most competitive parts of each area, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Cohesion is not a one-size-fits-all solution; it is, more than anything, about investing in deriving the maximum benefit from our differences and about ensuring that the investment is sustainable over a period of time, with a view to harmonious development.</p>

The EU has a responsibility to ensure that developing countries have the capacity to engage in and benefit from the global economy. It is not just about a fairer, more open trading system. Despite enormous advances in market access including the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative by the Commission, the Least Developed Countries’ share of world trade has halved over the last 40 years from 1.9 % to 1 %.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As far as we are concerned, EU ‘aid’ cannot, and must not, be considered as part of the ‘liberalisation of trade’, as the rapporteur would like to see. It must also not be used as ‘one of the most effective drivers of economic growth’ of the poorest countries. This is for two reasons. Firstly, aid is contingent on the appropriateness of these countries’ ‘internal policies’ and a ‘real improvement in the capacity for good governance’, in the interests of the powerful multinationals in the EU and the USA. In other words, conditions are placed on the ‘aid’-based development of these countries, which is tantamount to exploiting their inherent structural fragility, following a history of colonialism, for the benefit of EU capital. They are forced to produce for export, in particular low added-value products with lower financial return, the price of which does not cover the production costs. This is true of many agricultural products, obliging them to erect customs barriers to block the entry of products from outside.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, this guideline establishes a hierarchy between countries, thus deepening still further the gap between the so-called rich and poor countries, with consequences at national level for the EU Member States, and in what are known as third countries …</p>

      <p sl="fr">Momentum and innovation are therefore required, not least through the invention of a new customs technology of deductible customs duties in the form of a customs credit offered by importers to exporters, to be deducted upon purchase from the economy of the importing country and equal to the sum of the customs duty to which the credit is charged. For the countries of the South, this customs credit would be subsidised, along the lines of matching credits and sparing credits, which already exist in international taxation.</p>

      <p sl="nl">To date, the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) has guaranteed the ACP countries preferential access to the EU market, with lower import tariffs at the EU’s borders and better market access.

      <p sl="nl">This arrangement within the WTO forms a formal exception to the non-discrimination rule of the Most Favoured Nation principle. According to the Cotonou Agreement of 2000, this exception is to be lifted by no later than the end of 2007, and to be replaced by individually-negotiated Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). If not, every WTO member would be able to report discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This report is right to strike a critical note. It is of the essence that the Commission should negotiate the EPAs with due consideration for the level of development of the ACP countries. The principle of total liberalisation of the market should not come into play here, because it forms a real threat to them, both socially and economically.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report on promoting decent work for all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The notion of ‘decent work’ seems to be a reference to the terms of multilateral declarations and agreements, but policies, for their part, are still far removed from the concept.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Presentations and declarations are one thing; the everyday political actions and decisions of international institutions are quite something else. Indeed, the world is marked by a ‘deficit’ in decent work: in many unproductive and low-quality jobs that involve dangerous work for a precarious income, rights are flouted and inequality between the sexes prevails.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Faced with this situation, the WTO and the ILO have adopted international labour standards. However, the IMF and the World Bank do not support any initiatives designed to ensure that the fundamental rights of workers are respected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If decent work is to become a reality worldwide, priority must be given to it by all the international institutions, which will have to work together to make this happen.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Decent work must be a universal objective for all the international institutions. It is imperative that these fundamentals – quality employment, workers’ rights, protection and social dialogue – determine all economic and social policies at international level.</p>

      <p sl="pt">What happened in the vote on this report was disgraceful. The majority in Parliament blocked the adoption of some of the best paragraphs adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the theme of ‘Promoting decent work for all – The EU contribution to the implementation of the decent work agenda in the world’. This position needs to be highlighted because it is clear that it is intrinsically linked with the increasing emphasis on so-called flexicurity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As we know, between 2000 and 2005 unemployment rose by one million in the EU, alongside a massive increase in unstable work: more than 4.7 million workers were on fixed-term contracts and at least 1.1 million found themselves working part time. The high number of workers who, despite earning a salary, are living below the poverty line, is also unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The promotion of decent work for all entails ensuring compliance with a progressive labour law, ensuring the dignity of those who work, guaranteeing decent living and working conditions, without any discrimination and inequality.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the future of Europe, in which we are joined by the Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Member of the European Council, Mr Jan Peter Balkenende, whom I welcome most warmly to this House.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Mr Balkenende, it is a great pleasure for me to be able to welcome you, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, to the European Parliament today in order to discuss the future of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Prime Minister, Mr Balkenende, the Kingdom of the Netherlands was not only among the founding members of the European Union, but also, in the course of the past 50 years, played a leading role on repeated occasions, on which it showed a great deal of determination, among those who themselves sought – and supported others who tried – to drive forward the history of our continent and make it an incomparable success story. Significant treaties and agreements within the European Union bear the names of cities in the Netherlands; there is the Treaty of Maastricht, whereby the European Union was founded, and the Treaty of Amsterdam, which accorded this House extensive rights of codecision.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">It was, then, all the more a painful experience for us when the citizens of the Netherlands, in a referendum, rejected the draft constitution that contained such significant answers to the questions about Europe’s future. However, like my fellow Members of this Parliament, and like you, Prime Minister, I am persuaded that the citizens of the Netherlands were not, by this decision, saying ‘no’ to the European Union itself, or to its worth or to its values.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This European Parliament very much values your willingness, Prime Minister, to participate in today’s debate, above all in view of the fact that now, the cooperation of all 27 Member States is needed to put in place a renewed basis for the European Union, one that will stand the tests that the future will bring. The German Presidency of the Council, and the Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in particular, is currently engaged in devoting all its energies to finding a solution on which all can agree and which will satisfy everyone, not only those countries that have not ratified the Treaty, but also those 18 Member States, and hence the majority by population of the European Union, which have already done so.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The European Parliament supports the substance of the Constitutional Treaty, and we want it to become a reality. That will involve necessary reforms and will enshrine our common values. This House will not under any circumstances be satisfied with a result that is not in the interests of the European Union and of its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We are aware, Prime Minister, that the people of the Netherlands, too, have a great interest in making the European Union fit to face the challenges of the future, and in making it possible for shared European solutions to global tasks to be found, and I am convinced that, with good will, we will be able, in the course of the negotiations over the coming weeks and months, not only to reach an accommodation with one another, but also to produce something that will make the European Union democratic, transparent, and effective in action. Prime Minister, I now ask you to take the floor and address us.</p>

    <intervention id="3-241" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jan Peter Balkenende" is_mep="False" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Commissioner Wallström, Commissioner Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, thank you kindly for your invitation to join in your debate on the future of Europe. I would also like to express my gratitude for the very useful visit by your President, Mr Poettering, to the Netherlands on 12 April last.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you very much for coming to The Hague. We very much valued your presence and your contribution to the debate. It was an important visit, and thank you very much again for coming.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it feels good to be back in your Parliament and I have good memories of our meeting during the Dutch Presidency in 2004. We held stimulating debates, which were a great source of inspiration to me at the time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Today, however, I am here in a different capacity, as a representative of a Member State – the Netherlands, which is a pro-European country, a country where the overall support for European cooperation has always been – and still is – above the average. At the end of 2006, 75% of the people were in favour of EU membership.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is a country with an open economy that owes much of its prosperity and employment to the opportunities offered by the internal market. A country that wants to play an active role in the world, as is evident from our involvement in development missions in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world, in which respect, the Netherlands relies on cooperation. The Netherlands, however, is also one of the two Member States where a clear majority of the people said ‘no’ to the Constitutional Treaty in 2005, something to which you, Mr President, have made reference.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I know that a large majority in your Parliament were in favour of the Constitutional Treaty, and I respect that, but whatever verdict one passes on the Constitution, what is now called for is a joint solution, one that is acceptable to us all. A solution that does justice to public concerns which came to the surface in the Netherlands and in France in a very visible way; to concerns that are also felt elsewhere: both in countries that have already ratified the Constitution and countries where no decisions have been taken to date.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am persuaded, Mr President, that obstacles can be overcome, because, in terms of future prospects, there is much more that unites us than divides us, and also because we have a firm foundation of shared values and shared interests.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to start my statement about how I see Europe’s future with the idea that the Union is a rare and successful project. There is every reason to be proud of what we in Europe have achieved in a combined venture.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Europe that was torn apart by huge wars and sharp social contrasts now boasts a model of cooperation and integration that is second to none in the world. A model that is typified by balance: a balance between economic dynamism and social harmony; a balance between unity and diversity. The European decision-making model does justice to the equality of the Member States, as well as to that of its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe is a respected world player, and an example to the world. What makes it that is our unique form of cooperation, our focus on solidarity, and our capacity for commitment, united by values and dialogue rather than by battle.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe has been renewed in the space of 50 years, which, in terms of world history, is a short period of time. Europe is a young, but adult structure, with a bright future ahead. Step by step, we are facing new challenges, building on our achievements, but always with a keen eye on the public’s expectations and concerns.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One of the main objectives of the new Dutch Cabinet is to further reinforce the support base for European cooperation. If we are to do this, we have to find out exactly why nearly 62% of our population rejected the Constitutional Treaty, and to find the right response to that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would first of all like to sketch the background to the Dutch ‘no’ before I go into the detail of what the Netherlands expect of the negotiations for a new Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Much has changed in the 50 years that separate the Treaty of Rome and the Declaration of Berlin. The Union of today is not only many times bigger than the Community of the Six in those days; it also has a much larger sphere of activity.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The enlargement is a historic success. It was the right decision. We have to realise, though, that following the recent major enlargement, the public need time to adjust. It all went very quickly – for some, too quickly. The feeling of reciprocal affinity has to grow.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition to considerable growth, the Union has also experienced an enormous deepening in the past 15 years: the completion of the internal market, open borders, the euro, many new policies in important areas such as the environment, security and law. These are all positive developments in their own right, and have also brought with them a number of new realities that have become commonplace for the public, but not without any resistance, though. For example, the presence of European legislation in many areas is often misunderstood. At a time when citizens had not taken on board the enlargement and deepening, we asked the citizens their opinions about the Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The question ‘Do you agree with the Constitution for Europe’ was understood by many as ‘Would you like Europe to assume the character of a state?’ or even ‘Would you like Europe to eventually take the place of the Dutch national government?’, which was, of course, a bridge too far.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The term ‘constitution’ has different meanings in different Member States. To some, it is symbolic of democracy, of the curbing of authority. It is that, of course. Elsewhere, however – in the Netherlands at any rate – the word ‘constitution’ has a totally different connotation or meaning still. A constitution belongs to a national state. A constitution says something about national identity – hence the Dutch suggestion of a new Treaty not being a constitution. The symbolism of a constitution was a major factor in the Dutch saying ‘no’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There was a sense of loss of control, a fear that our own identity would be lost, but a recognisable and accessible government is precisely what people want. People feel there is a limit to what Europe should do. People want control over the areas which we have to tackle jointly in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Needless to say, there were other reasons why people voted ‘no’. There are those according to whom Europe produces too many rules, or does too many things that should be regulated nationally, while others find the administration in Brussels is too lacking in transparency, and concerns about the Dutch financial contribution also played a part. There was too little appreciation of the specific added value of European cooperation. If you think this through, these issues can, to some extent, be resolved in a new Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To another extent, we must be aware of these concerns that very many citizens in the Union have in our day-to-day policy decisions. We have made a good start on this in the past two years. Subsidiarity and less legislation are at the top of the agenda, not least in Brussels. There is more transparency. We have a budget that enables us to do what we have to do until 2013. We also have the right policy priorities, including climate change and energy policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This, Mr President, honourable Members, we owe to your Parliament, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and the presidents of the European Council, namely, and in chronological order, Mr Blair, Mr Schüssel, Mr Vanhanen and now Mrs Merkel. It shows that Europe is prepared to prioritise matters that occupy the minds of the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Before I turn to the things that the Netherlands hopes to find in a new Treaty, I should like to make a point. A referendum was held in four Member States, which produced two yes’s and two no’s. In total, 18 Member States approved the Constitutional Treaty via their own democratic process. The Constitutional Treaty was widely supported in your Parliament. There is no two ways about it. I hope, though, that we will be able to concentrate on what unites us, rather than on what divides us.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Dutch Cabinet seeks to find a joint solution in a constructive manner. This is, with a view to Europe's future, very much called for. The points on which the Netherlands focuses are directly related to public concerns that have surfaced over the past two years. No more, no less. This is to gather the necessary support for ratification of the new Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this light there are, I think, irrespective of the specific requirements of institutions and Member States, two major joint ambitions regarding the new Treaty. In the first instance, we want to improve Europe’s democratic functioning. Secondly, we seek to enhance Europe’s decisiveness.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe's challenge has always been to set up the institutions in such a way as to ensure that as much justice as possible is done to both – at times – conflicting objectives. The institutional balance which the Convention and the previous IGC worked out offers improvements, both in terms of democratic content and power. The Netherlands is keen to retain these improvements, provided that agreement on this can go hand in hand with a credible way of dealing with the citizens’ areas of concern.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I will outline what the Netherlands faces in order to reach a solution jointly in four points.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, the successful method of changing the Treaty must be continued: improving Europe step by step, with a view to striking a balance. As I said earlier, the symbolism of a constitution plays an important role in the ‘no’, and this is why the Netherlands has argued in favour of a change to the treaty, as was the case with Amsterdam and Nice. This is following in the footsteps of the Monnet method: small steps forward, with concrete meaning. It turns the spotlight to the improvements, the democratic guarantees and increased decisiveness. This is how we can have a positive debate, and move forward from under the shadow of the rejected Constitution. In short: the name, the form, as well as the content that determine the image of a constitution require reconsideration.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, the Netherlands sets great store by improving the Union’s democratic functioning. A very important lesson we need to take away from the referendum is that the Dutch want to be certain that they have a say in the decision-making process. They want their voice heard in Europe. The institutional proposals of the Constitutional Treaty are a step in the right direction. The rule that the European Parliament always codecides when the Council takes decisions by majority is a case in point.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Improvements are possible, though. In the case of the subsidiarity test for European legislative proposals, national parliaments should be accorded a more important role. If national parliaments pass a negative verdict by majority, this should have consequences. More involvement of the national parliaments should not be at the expense of the European Parliament. This test is done in the very first phase of decision-making. A verdict on subsidiarity is very much something for national parliaments to pass. The European Parliament retains its full role in the codecision procedure. The Commission's right to initiative is infringed upon. As you, Mr President, told me recently, the European Parliament and the national parliaments complement each other. Like democratic partners.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This brings me to my third point: in addition to becoming more democratic, Europe must, and indeed can, become more decisive. I am referring to today’s important topics that concern the public, when I say this: climate change, energy policy, the fight against terrorism and migration require a pro-active, joint approach.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Constitutional Treaty contains valuable improvements, with more majority decision-making. We cannot get around the fact, though, that people are reluctant to give up vetoes, and are frightened about a creeping increase in powers. This is why we must be quite clear. There is no power without support. Where necessary, we must, therefore, dare take the step towards majority decision-making. And I am prepared to stand up for those choices, provided that the transfer of sovereignty is a conscious choice, safeguarded by proper guarantees. The Union’s powers must be clearly defined. Only then can we ease the hesitation surrounding the transfer of sovereignty. The Netherlands will be tabling proposals to this effect.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A particular point that is related to this has also been the subject of intense debate in your Parliament. I am talking about the relationship between the internal market on the one hand and the freedom of movement on the part of the Member States when shaping their public services on the other. More clarity can be injected there as well, without taking anything away from the internal market. I am in favour of a strong internal market, as the citizens of all Member States stand to benefit from it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In matters such as the pension system, social security and education, however, the Member States seek to tailor these to the national situation. Europe should allow for this, for example, by laying down a number of criteria for services of general interest.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This brings me to my fourth and final point. I think it is a good thing that the enlargement criteria are included in the new Treaty. We have had the collective wisdom to enlarge the Union and I stand four-square behind that decision. It says something about Europe’s future and the change following the divided Europe dating back to after the Second World War.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Nobody can deny the fact, though, that there is also doubt about the enlargement among the public. In the Netherlands, there is the perception that the Union does not take its own rules seriously, or not seriously enough. We may have the criteria, but these are not strictly followed in the eyes of the Dutch people. As this is something that affects public support for Europe, it is necessary to include the criteria in the new Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, honourable Members, Europe has come a long way in 50 years. Expectations are running high. Together, we can set the tone when tackling climate change, the fight against poverty and insecurity in the world. Together, we can use Europe’s economic potential in an ever more integrated world economy. Together, we must commit to a reliable supply of energy and raw materials. Together, we must fight the degrading spread of illegal migration, which is why we need a strong and decisive European Union, a Union that enjoys the trust of those who live in it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the Netherlands, I will not hesitate to stand up for a treaty that comprises the four elements that I have just outlined – because I believe that the time is right for this, because I have great confidence in the Presidencies of Mrs Merkel and Mr Socrates after her, and because I believe that together we can take the next step, but above all, because this Treaty is needed to face up to today’s challenges together.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I recently came across the words of Robert Schuman, one of our visionary founding fathers, and I was once again struck by how wise and true they were. In his declaration of 9 May 1950, he said – and I quote – ‘Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I think that Mr Schuman’s words are as current as ever, and can be guiding in our joint task to develop Europe further. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, I should like to thank you, Prime Minister Balkenende, for the perspective on Europe that you have given us today, a perspective that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats very much shares.</p>
      <a text="(Protests)"/>
      <p sl="fr">I see that those who are interrupting me have a very good perspective and that they listened carefully to Mr Prodi yesterday: he was ready to part with the flag, you have brought us yours today … This is a very good image and a very good example!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe means, of course, a currency, a great market, the opening up of borders and student exchanges, but, above all, Europe is the ideals, principles and values that are the envy of the entire world. Europe is traditions, a civilisation, but it is also the adaptation to new realities; it is a certain idea of globalisation, of the reforms aimed at creating a fairer society. Europe is not about maintaining the status quo; it is about movement and progress.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Balkenende, you are the Prime Minister of the country that is perhaps most open to the European spirit, I am not afraid to say, a country in which tolerance and solidarity are the driving force of social cohesion. Seventy-two per cent of your fellow citizens have come out in favour of European integration, when the European average is around 53%. However, the people of the Netherlands, like the people of France, rejected the Treaty in 2005. This certainly means that, as far as the great majority of them are concerned, Europe is not legitimate enough, not credible enough, and not effective enough. It certainly means that they regard the actions of the European Union as being too far removed from their everyday lives. We must learn lessons from these judgments, even if we do not share this opinion, which is often too critical.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall not go back over the merits of European integration, as we are very clear about them. However, we must convince Europeans that our common project is not only beneficial, but also absolutely crucial. The draft treaty contained most of the answers to our fellow citizens’ questions and dissatisfactions. We therefore need to take up the best parts of this treaty, namely parts 1 and 2. What Europeans are expecting from us is a better life, is Europe affirming its values in the world, as it has just done in Moscow, and as it must do more in the Middle East, and in Darfur.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By putting ourselves in a position to make decisions, both democratic and effective ones, we are satisfying Europeans because we will be able to tackle the real fundamental problems. Let us cure Europe of its paralysis, let us provide ourselves with the resources for our political ambitions: the sooner the better, and the 2009 European elections is the most opportune time. Let us work relentlessly along these lines.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Prime Minister, you have had the courage to carry out ambitious, long-term reforms in your country. You have not given in to the easiest options or to demagogy, and the results are there to see. You have carried out these reforms by respecting values, solidarity, open-mindedness and responsibility. That is the path that my group calls on Europe, as a whole, to take. You mentioned the role of the national parliaments and the need for a clearer division of responsibilities between the Member States and the European Union. On that point, too, we can only support you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the national elected representatives of our countries do not take hold of European affairs – which no longer come under foreign affairs, but national affairs – if our national fellow Members do not seize the European dimension of our major issues, then the road will be even longer and more difficult. Who does what? Who is responsible for which policy? The citizens want to know! Such clarification will prevent the ministers from putting the blame on Brussels, and we will deprive ourselves of an overly facile national alibi.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You also raised the issue of European enlargement, Mr Balkenende. On this point, too, we must be clear. Europe can no longer let in new members until it has resolved its internal problems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, our immediate priority, and that of our governments, must be to reach an agreement among the 27, as quickly as possible, on the institutions. Mrs Merkel has created the necessary dynamic and, in spite of the dramatic gestures, both sides’ positions are coming into line with each other. Let us seize this opportunity and let us reach an agreement among the 27 on the key issues, namely Europeans’ rights and the decision-making process.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I shall begin by commenting on something we have just heard. You said, Prime Minister, that your government is in favour of a legal framework for services. Thank you very much for that; now perhaps you can say that to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to whom you have close links, who, this morning, rejected that very idea.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like, Prime Minister, to refer to two of the observations you made, and which I see as the most important things you said in your speech. ‘I hope that we can concentrate on what unites us and not on what divides us.’ That was an encouraging thing to say. Until then, we had been under the impression that the Netherlands was focusing on what divides us rather than on what unites us.</p>
      <p sl="de">If that is meant to be an announcement to the effect that you and your government are willing to make compromises rather than insisting that the Dutch ‘no’ must result in fundamental change in Europe, if it is meant to mean that the Dutch ‘no’ means that the Constitution will not enter into force in its present form, but instead in some other, with some other comprehensive reform that will make the European Union more efficient, and that you, to that end, are prepared to make compromises and then defend them at home, then that, Mr Balkenende, was a good speech.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">By it, then, we will judge you, for I was in Rome, where we met, and where I saw you sign the Constitution with a golden pen. As you know, I keep a watchful eye on Dutch domestic politics. Compared with the other battles you have had to endure in the Netherlands, the battle for the constitution was – if I may put it that way – a rather restrained one. Nobody will regret it if you land more punches in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Europe must learn to land more punches, but it will not do that on the basis on Nice or of ‘Nice minus’; that will not make Europe a better fighter, but rather less able to take the action that needs to be taken in such situations as that in the Middle East, where, it is worth remembering, 13 000 European troops are stationed on the border between Lebanon and Israel in pursuance of the UNIFIL mandate, and I ask you also to think of the Gaza Strip in Palestine, where we are in the thick of the chaos, and where the place is getting like Somalia. Why is Europe not represented there by a foreign minister who could get something done? It is because of the unanimity rule in the Council, which is preventing Europe from taking action.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I have nothing against Calvinistic self-denial. I gather that you want no more flags, no anthem, and no foreign minister. Good: Beethoven’s symphonies have survived revolutions and wars; they will outlive the European Constitution too.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="nl">As the President of our Parliament introduced this debate in Dutch, I, too, Prime Minister, should like speak a few words in it. If, in future, the Foreign Affairs Minister is called the High Representative of Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands, then I have no problem with that, provided that he does his job.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is crucial is not what he is called, but rather what he is meant to do.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I am a great admirer of the Dutch people; the Netherlands is a wonderful country with a great tradition, a country with a tradition of seafaring, and seafarers have always been courageous people. It was Dutch people who first sailed round Cape Horn and gave it its name. I, for one, get the feeling that they have today embarked on a ship and set the sails. Mr Goebbels has already pulled the flag down to half mast. I am less sceptical; I get the impression that you, today, have hoisted the flag halfway up again, so I urge you to hoist it all the way up, and I can promise you that this House will put wind in your sails, so that then, Mr Balkenende, you will be sailing towards a compromise.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yesterday saw Mr Prodi expressing his own willingness to compromise; he is completely in favour of the Constitution. If you want half a constitution and you and he can meet one another halfway, we will end up with three-quarters of it, and a 75% constitution would be the Constitution without the anthem, without the flag and with a foreign minister called by another title. It would be a good result.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, yesterday, in this Chamber, one of Europe’s great champions sketched his vision of a Union fit for the 21st century – a Union that is democratic, transparent and, above all, effective. However, crossing that Rubicon requires firm leadership, Mr Balkenende.</p>
      <p sl="de">The German Presidency has shown its strength by uniting Member States under the banner of the Berlin Declaration. It must pull them together again in the weeks before the European Council and the Intergovernmental Conference which follows if we are to win the war of public opinion and unite around a revised Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">The stakes are high. Your Foreign Minister, Mr Verhagen, said: ‘In today’s globalised world people are afraid of losing their jobs, their social security, their quality of life’. Yet that is not an argument for less Europe, indeed, it may well be an argument for more Europe.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Europe cannot secure its energy supply, combat climate change or tackle terrorism with a retreat into unilateralism. You, of all people, should know that, Mr Balkenende. For history teaches us that the Netherlands’ golden years – as the wealthiest nation in the 17th-century world – came from uniting the seven provinces, not dividing them. You must convince your citizens that unity and prosperity are inseparable; that inability to make progress on political integration means Europe will lose its place as a global standard-setter and end up at the mercy of powers like Russia with its belligerent energy policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">To take key decisions on jobs, security and quality of life, the Union needs an end to unscrupulous use of national vetoes. To address the democratic deficit, it needs greater democratic accountability. To maintain its international prestige and internal effectiveness, its institutions must change with the times.</p>
      <p sl="de">None of this is possible without the substance of what was agreed in the European Convention, and that substance must be maintained, whatever cosmetic surgery you try to effect on the surface.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are not just talking about ideology here: we are talking about people’s jobs, their quality of life and their long-term prospects. It is time that you, and others like you, retook the initiative and brought Europe back to their people.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nobody here is seeking a European superstate – diversity of customs, history and language will ensure that. However, we are seeking a European ‘superpeople’, a united people.</p>
      <p sl="de">Too often our heads of government have taken the advice of the English Conservative Prime Minister Arthur Bonar Law when he exclaimed: ‘I must follow them; I am their leader’. But populism cannot move Europe forward, nor cement our quality of life, international influence or economic strength – only solidarity can do that.</p>
      <p sl="de">When concerns over the so-called symbols of a superstate – like flags or anthems –supersede debate on real issues, then it is time for a change of strategy.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Your public demands energy security; it demands a European environment policy; it demands common action on migration. From the new Treaty, they will get it, for the tools are already in the text. So sell that to your people, instead of sidestepping the issues. Stop letting the tail wag the dog, and lead the Netherlands back to the heart of European decision-making, as befits the founder status of your country in our Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, Prime Minister, I would say, do as your countryman Justus Lipsius advised: be stoical in adversity, embrace necessity and be constant in your faith in Europe. For your people’s peace, prosperity and security depend upon it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for his presentation today. I was struck by the ideals of compromise and consensus contained within his speech. Particularly when we look forward to Europe’s future, it is a Europe that has to be based on consensus, because, as Mr Daul said earlier on, if Europe means anything, Europe means equality. Europe means equality between nations, between peoples, between cultures. Europe means equality between all people within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">That means that you cannot drive a coach-and-four and force everybody down the same path. It makes it more difficult to find agreement, yes, but it is still the best way of finding agreement. What we heard yesterday from Mr Prodi was not the new way forward, it was a threat: a threat that we will create a two-speed Europe for those who are with us and those who are against us, words more reminiscent of George W. Bush than of a European statesman.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that the future development of European policy and European ideals will not come from telling people to look at the great opportunities they have lost, to look at the things that they have thrown away. It will come by us convincing people that this is the best way forward, that this is the best path to follow.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many here have mentioned issues such as climate change, pension security, energy security and others. Yes, Europe can play a role and Europe can do things that are positive. Likewise, with regard to immigration and our own internal security, we can do things in a cooperative and consensual way that can achieve good. We have already done that, but there are still things that are best left to Member States, things that require unanimous agreement in the Council, not qualified majority all of the time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is wrong, and I use this opportunity to point this out again. Commissioner Kovács and others are coming forward with proposals for harmonisation of taxes that they do not have the power to implement under the present Treaties and which the new Treaty would not give them the power to implement, and yet they continue to do it. Why? Because it is ideologically driven. It is a political move and one that is driving people further and further away. If officialdom can ignore the rules, why should we not ignore them too?</p>
      <p sl="en">George Bernard Shaw once said that some men see things as they are, and wonder, ‘Why?’. We should dream things as they should be, and say, ‘Why not?’. Consensus, compromise, cooperation – yes, that is the way forward, but most importantly of all, we must convince the people that it is the right way forward.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, my group would also like to extend a warm welcome to Prime Minister Balkenende and thank him for accepting the invitation. In the Netherlands, the new Cabinet has just spent 100 days talking with the public, but it was 500 days ago that we last heard anything said about Europe. Just as well that this came to an end. The question is, of course, whether people have actually been listened to.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You seem to have been shopping selectively. With regard to your interpretation of the ‘no’, you only mention those objections to the Constitution that lead to a less ambitious Treaty, in other words, to fewer changes. This is a very bizarre way of thinking. Do you really believe that people have voted against the European Treaty because they are so satisfied with the current European Union? Do you also think that the flag and the national anthem really are the biggest problem?</p>
      <p sl="nl">According to 80%, not least of the ‘no’ voters in the Netherlands, the negotiations should be seized as an opportunity to carry out more thorough reforms and to continue the democratisation process in Europe. Sixty-eight percent of the people also want a real European foreign and security policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is no mention of this more far-reaching democratic ambition anywhere in your proposals, though. You also want to scrap the Foreign Affairs Minister. You only want less, and you present this as an inevitable development.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This situation is comparable to that of an unsatisfied customer who goes back to the bicycle shop and says ‘fine, you can swap the bike, but only for a scooter’. I will not settle for a scooter, though; all I want is a better bike. One with brakes, that would do. After all, not all decisions should be taken in Brussels, and it is a good thing to demarcate national and European powers better. Brakes only make sense, though, if there are pedals.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You claim that people want more control, but this seems to be in conflict with your commitment to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. You did not make reference to it on this occasion, but I have a hard copy somewhere of the debate in the Dutch national parliament, when you said: ‘In the case of the Treaty being changed without any constitutional pretensions, the text of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights should not need to be included in its entirety’. Surely this is a bizarre interpretation of the ‘no’! There will not be many people who have voted against the constitution because this would have entitled them to more rights.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="nl">Unlike the ECHR, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights also contains social fundamental rights, which can put up a barrier against anti-social interventions from Brussels in the welfare state. Now that would be a brake that I would think worth having on my bicycle.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, your real reason to remove the flag, the constitution, the Charter of fundamental rights and the anthems, is purely domestic. If the Treaty no longer shows any signs of a constitution, then you will be able to avoid a referendum in the Netherlands. We might be able to agree to disagree then. My party is quite happy to abandon the idea of a national referendum if you fear that in future, you will end up feeling isolated again. Perhaps we might get a European referendum instead, though, in which case you would not be isolated, but would instead, be doing what twenty-first century democracy requires of you. I would welcome your comments on this.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, yesterday, the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Prodi, urged the Members of this Parliament to defend in their countries the old draft for a European Constitution and said that this draft already contains so many compromises that it is virtually impossible that there should be any more of them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This sort of talk goes down well here, for this is a place where democracy is mainly seen on a large scale and from up above. It has transpired that this can really clash with a small-scale democracy from the bottom up, in which many more people feel involved.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In 2005, the parliaments of the Member States were in favour of this constitution by large majorities. In the Netherlands, this figure was even as high as 85%, and in the Netherlands, unlike in France, where only the president decides on such things, it is parliament that decides on the subject of a referendum. The referendum was held at the proposal of three parties that were in favour of the constitution and that really believed that the voters thought the same way. Despite a high turn-out, 62% voted ‘no’. It is highly likely that a majority of the voters in Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark would have equally said ‘no’ had they been given the opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Today, the Dutch Prime Minister Mr Balkenende is struggling more than his Italian counterpart did yesterday. Earlier this year, the following agreement was reached in the government agreement on behalf of his coalition and at the behest of the voters – and I quote ‘attempts are being made to change, and possibly combine, the existing EU treaties in which subsidiarity and democratic control are safeguarded and in which content, size and title are significantly different from the previously rejected Constitutional Treaty’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Dutch Government was right to point out that in the European Union, the national parliaments must be given more voting power and that national decisions on public services should not be distorted. This is different from the constitutional text that calls for an ever more far-reaching liberalisation of services and free, unadulterated competition. This Parliament, which backed my proposal on 10 May to give the Member States, their regions and their municipalities more freedom in the way in which they organise their public transport should recognise the value of this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would say the following to Prime Minister Balkenende and his government. If you receive insufficient support in this Parliament today, this does not mean that you are cut off from Europe. You have the difficult task of realising your government agreement. There is no reason why you should let others who still hold onto the old constitutional project dictate to you.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Prime Minister, as a Dutch MEP, I am particularly delighted to see you visiting us here. In this House, since the ‘no’ to the European Constitution in our country, we have talked too much about the Netherlands instead of with the Netherlands. Let it be clear that I largely share the Dutch Government’s view, yet, even so, I should like to make a few recommendations leading up to the European Council of 21 and 22 June.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, I appreciate your efforts in respect of the Constitution’s aspirations to do such things as introduce the position of a permanent president; such a person would soon develop into a European President, and so I would propose a rota system for three presidencies, each lasting one and a half years, made up of one large, one medium-sized and one small Member State. This will avoid the unnecessary concentration of power surrounding one permanent president, and all Member States will retain the prospect of a place in the presidency on an equal basis.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Prime Minister, I support your wish to include the Copenhagen criteria in the new Treaty. It is, however, just as necessary, in this new Treaty, to define once and for all the borders of the European Union, for this is something to which the European Union’s citizens, and its neighbours, are entitled. I am specifically thinking of offering countries like Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus a prospect of EU membership in the long-term, this in combination with a powerful neighbourhood policy in order to help these countries overcome structural problems.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I noticed there was some hesitation when you tabled your proposal to give national parliaments the power to veto legislative proposals from the Commission. I think it is better to give the European Parliament the power to refuse a proposal from the Commission, in which respect national parliaments can make their concerns known to the European Parliament. This route strikes me as purer institutionally and at the same time, it strengthens interparliamentary cooperation between the EP and national parliaments. Prime Minister, I should like to hear your thoughts on the points I made.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Prime Minister, the Dutch electorate rejected the European constitution by a large margin. I can only hope that your government will continue to strive for a new Treaty rather than a constitution. I also hope that the voters will be given the opportunity to speak out on this, not only in the Netherlands, but in all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This debate is not only about the institutional issue, though. It is about the future of Europe, thus including the fundamental question about the EU’s borders, the question as to whether a non-European country such as Turkey could join. When you took over the EU presidency in 2004 and came to the European Parliament for the first time, you said that you would make sure that Turkey met all the Copenhagen criteria. Can you, Prime Minister, three years down the line, declare, hand on heart, that you have kept that promise?</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Turkish-Armenian publisher Hrant Dink was murdered after he was condemned by the Turkish courts as a criminal. Orhan Pamuk, a winner of the Nobel Prize for literature, fled the country after he, too, received threats. In Turkish criminal law, it is a crime to insult what is termed ‘Turkish identity’. Freedom to express opinions is therefore absent. I am not even talking about the murder of three Christian publishers and a Catholic priest.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I could also mention the fact that Turkey still refuses to recognise one of the EU’s Member States or fulfil its duty to open up its ports and airports. Moreover, the trial of strength that is going on between the Islamists on the one hand and those in favour of the secular state on the other, should cause concern in Europe, but the European Union persists with the negotiations as if nothing was wrong. They completely ignore the large majority of the people who are against the accession. And whether they like it or not, this arrogance and this detachment from the world are the biggest threat to the EU’s continued existence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, one has to ask how much energy has now been wasted on chasing the moonbeam of an EU Constitution. In the rarefied atmosphere of this House, an EU Constitution may seem important, but frankly, most of our citizens have moved on and care more about things like good education, a good health service and rising house prices – things a constitution will not change.</p>
      <p sl="en">Part of the reason that the EU institutions are stuck in this rut is because of the refusal to take a democratic ‘no’ for an answer. These debates are dominated by siren demands for what is unobtainable and with demands for stratagems to avoid letting the citizens have their say. Hence the ploys of a change of title, a slimmed-down text and a total aversion to referenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">But rejig it as you might, that which imposes the apparatus of statehood on the EU, with a president and a foreign minister, and that which further savages national sovereignty by promoting even more qualified majority voting, is the same old tired, tarnished product that has already been rejected, and upon which citizens must have their say.</p>
      <p sl="en">Desperate as my own government is to welsh on the pledge of a referendum in the United Kingdom, I say the people of each nation-state have a right to have their say. Only those lacking in confidence in their own case or with a knavish design to thwart public opinion run away from letting the people decide.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prime Minister, you were brought here today – as I am sure you realise – so that the Euro-fanatics of this House could try to pressurise you to depart from the democratic decision made in your own country. I trust you will not be so foolish as to allow that to happen.</p>

    <intervention id="3-256" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jan Peter Balkenende" is_mep="False" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Mr President, I am very much obliged to those Members of Parliament who have spoken for their inspiring contributions. What I sense in this House – and I would not have expected it to be any other way – is an atmosphere of inspiration, one in which the European ideals are considered in the context of the Europe of the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is why I was so moved by what Mr Daul said – and this may well be what matters more than anything – about the values that have made Europe what it is today, the values which Europe stands for and the values for which we shoulder responsibility worldwide: peace, security, democracy, human rights and solidarity. These have made Europe strong, and that is what we need at the moment. This is perhaps where I should like pick up on what Mr Schulz said earlier.</p>
      <p sl="de">It really is very good that we should meet again; I well remember our previous meetings. It was really great to discuss things with you, it is so still today, and for that I am very grateful.</p>
      <p sl="nl">He spoke about the international aspects, the foreign aspects of the European Union, and I can do no other than endorse what he said. We live in a world in which changes are on the way – in China, India and the United States. We see changes in the areas of security, the fight against terrorism, the climate issue and energy. Europe can do better, work more effectively and speak more with one voice in all these areas.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Discussion of what the High Representative is to be called can wait until later, but what is important is the content and the message of the values Mr Daul mentioned. Let us propagate these, and let us do it together. These are issues that say something about our ideals involving the Europe of the future, not only here and on our own continent, but worldwide. Mr Daul made a plea for this, which strikes me as appropriate and necessary.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This brings me to the point Mr Watson made, namely that of energy. I should like to repeat what he said in this connection: we cannot do without one another. If Europe does not speak with one voice, we will face big problems. Energy is not just a matter of its presence, energy is also related to stability. Stability involving the supply of energy has an economic, social and ecological dimension. We need each other on this level too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Listening carefully to what Mr Watson said, which is what I did, I can see a connection between the European ideals, the way in which Europe presents itself to the outside world, foreign policy, and the way in which it tackles specific issues which we advocate, such as the energy issue to which he referred. If you think about this long and hard, then Europe faces a huge task.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I liked the comparison that Mr Watson drew with the Netherlands of the 17th century, the Golden Century. An era in which the Netherlands did extremely well worldwide. Did all of this come out of nothing? No, it did not. In order to achieve this, we had to take action. We needed to sail the seven seas and have a sound administrative structure in place. Did this happen overnight? No, indeed not; it took time. What we did have, though, is determination in terms of wanting to achieve certain things together.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If this is what you refer to, then you have touched a soft spot in me, because it brings up the question: how do we give shape to the Europe of the 21st century? How can we ensure that Europe can perform in the areas of economy, energy and global relations? The key question today is: are the existing relations adequate? No, they are not. The Treaty of Nice is not enough to meet the requirements of the 21st century.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="nl">This, of course, begs the question: what is the best way? Then you face the problem that we in Europe have Member States that have approved the constitution, those that have said ‘no’ and countries that have not yet taken a decision. This is the reality.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The last few years – the time of reflection – have not been in vain. I think that we have given answers to the citizens. We have said, let us work on the concrete projects in Europe. Make it clear to the people how important Europe is, so that Europe can return to people’s minds and hearts.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have spoken about the process of enlargement. Let us turn this into a credible project. Let us carefully consider the criteria that have already been tightened up. That too is a question of the European project being credible.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have said, let us tackle those topics that are so critical to the people in Europe. Namely energy and the climate. This is also why, together with Tony Blair, I have written a letter to my colleagues to say that we want the topics of climate and energy high on the European agenda. They are also matters of concern to you. We cannot do without one another. Let Europe prove what it can do.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is when the period of reflection will come into its own. It should not be the case though, and I would like to make this quite clear, that at the end of the period of reflection, we end up with a climate in which one group is pitted against the other, in which the group of the 18 ratifying countries is pitted against those that said ‘no’. If we were to do this, then we will not resolve the situation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is my sincere conviction that it is possible to find solutions. Let us do this in a way with which we can all identify. This is, as I see it, the method of constitutional amendment, as we have done before, a viable route, because it is possible to embrace the sound elements from the Constitutional Treaty. Because those elements of an institutional compromise should play a key role. Because we cannot leave things the way they are.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Needless to say, we have to look at the various sections. Mrs Buitenweg made a comment on the Charter of fundamental rights, which is very sensitive here, and I can see why. If you talk about the Charter, then you can join our camp, because we are equally persuaded of the importance of fundamental rights. Except, what do we see? The question is whether all of this should be included in such a Constitution, or if it would be possible to refer to it using different means. This is the point.</p>
      <p sl="nl">So let us discuss the significance of fundamental rights, whilst considering the limitations of a Constitution. This is a debate that I should like to enter into with you.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is my sincere conviction that we must make haste. My dream and ideal is that in June, we will be able to say that we will draw up a well-defined time table to resolve the issues. We would like to resolve them within a few years, and that is possible only if we join forces.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have made suggestions to this effect in my presentation. I argued against a Constitution, but in favour of an amending treaty instead, taking into account the role of the national parliaments without impinging on the role of the European Parliament, because your role is indispensable in Europe. I have mentioned these elements, and we must be able to act in unison, to consider what unites us rather than what divides us; that is where Mr Schulz is quite right, and we have to want to strike compromises. This applies to us all.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If we manage to pull it off, then we can make progress; that is my plan. I am also doing this with the feeling and conviction that we must make sure we only talk about a ‘no’ of two countries, because feelings among citizens and concerns are a reality. We must answer the questions that are around today. If we do this from a position that we want to find a common solution, draw short-term conclusions, check what is needed for this, and I have made a contribution to this, then it is possible to find solutions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Indeed, what is unacceptable in a time of further globalisation, of social issues, is that we would be unable to find answers, because the division that was would simply carry on.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I think we owe it to the founding fathers of the European Union, Adenauer, Schuman, de Gasperi, Monnet and all the others, to hold steadfast to the ideals, and, as Mr Daul said, to keep the value of Europe, the European dream in mind at all times – not to overlook public concerns, but do what has to be done. If we draw these conclusions in June, then we will have achieved a great deal. For this, we need each other, and I also think that we owe it to the ideals that we seek to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I was inspired by what you said. I will take your words to the Netherlands, and then we shall all have the task of finding solutions quickly, taking into consideration each other's positions, but always considering what we need to keep at the forefront of our minds, namely working on a European dream in the 21st century.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Prime Minister, I should first of all like to thank you for coming to Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The drafting of a new Treaty is in the interests of all of us. Now that France and the Netherlands have voted against the draft Constitution, we need, as has already been said, to look for another document, one with which all 27 countries can identify. It goes without saying that the Netherlands has a particular responsibility for making a huge effort in this respect. This is why it is useful that you have reminded us of the sensitivities surrounding this issue in the Netherlands, and that you have indicated the direction from which solutions are expected to arrive there.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Whilst the Netherlands is one of Europe’s co-founders and it is still pro-Europe, as is evident from any study, it does not want too much of Europe; it does not want Europe as a super state, or a constitutional set-up. The Netherlands likes to see things progress step by step, with due respect for subsidiarity of the Member States, a Europe that is more democratic and more decisive, and can therefore take majority decisions in more areas, and would like to see the enlargement criteria included in the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is also important to be reminded of the sensitivities and requirements of the other Member States. After all, 18 countries have already spoken out in favour of the draft document and value the progress that could have been made by means of the text that was available at the time. What matters now, is that we all come up with a fresh treaty document in a short space of time, which is in the interest of us all.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I was reminded of Paul-Henri Spaak’s words; he said: ‘Europe still consists solely of small countries. The only relevant distinction that remains is that some countries understand this, while others still refuse to acknowledge it.’ He said that in the 1950s. If this was the case back then, how much more relevant is it now, at a time of globalisation and internationalisation and with huge international issues, for example in the areas of immigration, energy, the environment and the fight against terrorism?</p>
      <p sl="nl">You described Europe as a rare and successful project. Indeed, it benefits the countries and the people. What we could do better together, we should. Anything that can be better regulated at national level should continue to be done at national level. The discussion is therefore not whether we are for or against Europe, it is about how we, in the short term, and involving all 27 Member States, can put the firmest possible foundation in place for a decisive, transparent Europe. The newspaper headlines read: Europe high on Prime Minister’s agenda. Congratulations on your level of commitment in this matter, both at home and in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I bid Prime Minister Balkenende welcome to the European Parliament. Just as, of course, the ‘no’ in the Netherlands was relatively firm, no less so, too, was the ‘yes’ from the European Parliament. I should like to give you credit for the fact that in your contribution and also in your responses, you tried to venture beyond the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to see how we could come up with a Treaty. Not a Treaty of a kind that, I agree with you, has been stripped naked, but a Treaty that gives answers to a number of key issues that we are facing. Sometimes, this means that more is needed than what was set down in the original constitution, sometimes less or different.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to try to move this debate to the next level with a number of very specific questions. You said that you support the idea of criteria being put in place for services of general interest, so that countries will be able to regulate their own public housing, health care or other areas more. Are you prepared, via a protocol or in the Treaty, to include a basis for this of some kind, so that a legal basis of some kind is in place?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, you said something about the Charter. If I understand correctly, you say you and your colleagues in the Dutch Government agree with the content of the Charter, and would like to see it become binding, but it need not be included in its entirety, as long as there is a document in the new Treaty that safeguards this binding character. What I would like to know is whether you have a formula that can make this happen, for, if you do, I share your way of thinking.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, subsidiarity. Your plea in the field of subsidiarity is to create more room, to keep at a local level what can be done at a local level. Do you have a formula to tighten up subsidiarity, and if so, what is it, compared to the formula included in the draft Constitution? Are you prepared, in this connection, to give the regions more room to experiment?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fourthly, you stated that you would like to abolish a host of vetoes, which will give us in this House an undoubted right of codecision, although that is not what we want in certain areas. Are you mainly referring to criminal law? Perhaps you would not mind clarifying again what your formula would be in that respect.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You also said that ‘Foreign Affairs Minister’ is not the title we use. So what are we supposed to call him?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, if the Netherlands opts for a Treaty, and a sound one at that, then I hope that the Prime Minister will blaze a trail in his own country, along with leaders of the other coalition parties, to inform the Dutch people and also get them onboard in good time, so that a real debate can underpin positive support for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Firstly, your determination to keep the three-pillar structure will contribute neither to simplifying nor to making more transparent the system of the Union, nor will it strengthen the capacity of the Union to act effectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I was quite unable to understand what you were saying on the issue of clarifying competences and the transfer of sovereignty. As we all know, sovereignty cannot be transferred and competences cannot be conferred without the full agreement of 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, your demand that national parliaments should be able to block the Union’s legislative process seems to me to be a severe assault not only upon the right of initiative of the Commission, but also upon the legislative prerogatives of the Council and Parliament. The setting-up of an effective third legislative chamber would be quite the opposite of simplifying, it would be an abuse of the principle of the separation of powers and it would certainly confuse the public. I would be grateful for a single example of where the Tweede Kamer [the Dutch House of Representatives] so far could have raised a complaint about a draft proposal breaching the principle of subsidiarity.</p>

The development opportunities of the new countries, accelerated economic growth in old Europe, and ultimately emancipation in international relations are just some examples of the success of integration. The European Union works.</p>
      <p sl="pl">That is why I warn against the hysterical cries of a European Union crisis coming as a result of the problems of the reform of the treaty. The ‘constitutional treaty or death’ approach propounded by Romano Prodi yesterday is a serious mistake, and will bring nothing but tension. But even the supporters of this inflexible position are jointly responsible for slowing down negotiations today. Dressing up the old treaty in new clothes, or separating it into smaller chunks is a rather cheap ploy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Prime Minister, on the television a few days ago, a young Dutchman said, on being asked about the European Constitution, ‘What do we need a Constitution for? This is an economic area.’ I found myself wondering how it is possible for a young man in the Netherlands today, in a country that was a founding member of the European Community, was one of the first to embrace the idea of creating a politically united Europe, and had undertaken to overcome nationalism – how it is possible for such a young man not to know that this is a political union?</p>
      <p sl="de">To that question, you have today provided me with the answer; a government that seeks to remove a symbol, to remove a flag, seeks to do away with an idea, to hide it away, to make it disappear. Take away the rhetorical flourishes and polite formularies, and your speech today is an ice-cold, nationalist, declaration of war on the idea that that flag symbolises.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us consider the various points in it, the primacy of European law, for one. It appears to me from the utterances of your foreign minister that the primacy of European law is no longer to feature in the Treaty, although, at the same time, he does emphasise that the primacy of European law is not to be tampered with, which means that he and you are deceiving your own people and lying to them by not having the Treaty state what the actual nature of this Union is. You are trying to conceal it, for the primacy of European law will remain intact, and well you know it. You want to go back to regulations rather than laws, but I ask you, Prime Minister, what does that title signify? Law has nothing to do with the nation state; republics have had laws, and laws have been in existence for as long as human beings have. It is laws that, when enacted through parliaments, serve as a guarantee to the citizen of democratic legitimacy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Prime Minister, having listened to your demands and understood your thinking, I was grateful that you were, firstly, willing to talk to us, and, secondly, did not also want to do away with this House or rename it, for this House embodies supranational democracy in the shape of the federal and political Europe; by its very existence it assures people that they are living as citizens of a political community rather than in an economic organisation or an association of states.</p>
      <p sl="de">A constitution has nothing to do with being a nation state; it is the basic law of a political community. Not least in the Treaty that we will soon have, there are such things as European citizens, and European citizenship is a real thing; we are here in the parliament of a supranational democracy and of a European citizenry. If you take the Charter out of the Treaty, while making it explicitly binding in law, what are you thereby doing? You are engaging in the same old deception, hiding it away from the people, while leaving it effective in law, which means that you accept the reality of Europe where you have to, while nevertheless denying it. I have to tell you, Prime Minister, that neither the twenty-first century, nor Europe itself, are going to be won over by a lie.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, your government, Mr Prime Minister, wants the European Constitution to dispense with the symbols of the European Union, with Article I-8 being deleted on the supposed grounds that the blue flag with the twelve golden stars and Beethoven’s ‘Ode to Joy’ are expressions of an identity as a state.</p>
      <p sl="de">Is that meant to mean, Mr Prime Minister, that any and every local association may adopt a banner and make it binding under its own articles, but that the EU, with its 500 million people, may not? I hope you will not mind me saying this, but that sort of thinking is both prehistoric and idiotic. European integration is an historic project like no other; it is not a state, let alone a superstate, and so it is not least for that reason that it is astonishing that such a dubious idea should originate from a founding member of the Community.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me tell you that those who deny the validity, 50 years on from the signing of the Treaties of Rome, of the universally recognised and familiar symbols of the EU are – symbolically, adding grist to the mills of those who, questioning European integration as such, wish to turn their backs on it and return to their own identities as nation states. Surely it is not to be denied that the anthem and the flag bind our states and peoples together; it is because they foster an identity that they need official recognition.</p>
      <p sl="de">So, Mr Prime Minister, please do not take the people of Europe for a ride, not even those in your own country who voted ‘no’, for they, together with the people of my own country and in others, do not want a dispute about banners; what they want is a social and democratic Europe. They want an answer to the question as to whether the EU exists to protect people or markets; they want something done about dumping – wage dumping, social dumping and tax dumping, and that is what you should be picking up on, for that is where forward-looking solutions are wanted, so stop shadow-boxing with the symbols of European integration.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Prime Minister, you can be proud of the Dutch people. Sixty-two per cent of them voted ‘no’ – contrary to the advice of the majority of politicians. You are now, however, being put under pressure by Germany, where at least 70% of people would vote against the Constitution if they were allowed to vote on it. That is, of course, a statement that the Germans are welcome to disprove. As an itinerant critic of the Constitution, however, I have not been in any country with more opposition to it. People want less interference by the EU and they want the proximity principle genuinely to be applied. Even the former German President, Roman Herzog, now warns against over-centralisation and the dismantling of democracy. Eighty-four per cent of German laws come from Brussels. In Brussels there is, emphatically, no democracy. Mr Herzog says that it is doubtful whether the Federal Republic can be called a parliamentary democracy. It is that Germany that is now threatening its French and Dutch neighbours and saying: your people were mistaken; you should dress the Constitution up in new clothes and abolish referendums.</p>
      <p sl="da">Why do you accept that, Mr Balkenende? Why do you not insist that Germany too consult its electorate before making war on the voters in neighbouring countries? The Dutch negotiators now want the Constitution to be presented a second time – ‘presented’ being the operative word - so that a referendum can be avoided. However, you are not proposing any real and substantial changes to the rejected text, and two years have now gone by without the approval of 80% of the Member States yet being obtained. The Constitution is legally dead. We should start afresh with new negotiations and a referendum throughout the EU. It will then be possible to discuss matters with the German Government.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, like millions of people the length and breadth of Europe, I am astonished by the creativity with which repeated attempts are made to resuscitate the EU constitution, which was formerly believed to be – and indeed pronounced to be – dead. In order to secure Brussels a licence to satisfy its evidently insatiable need for more powers, the spectre is conjured up of a European Union that is impotent and increasingly insignificant, but I do not believe that the object and point of the European Union, or indeed of European integration, can be to constantly undermine the Member States’ scope for sovereign decision-making.</p>
      <p sl="de">Cooperation between governments is surely no less indispensable than the unanimity principle in the core areas of national sovereignty, particularly in foreign, security and defence policy. Our people have no need of an EU constitution negotiated secretively in backrooms, endowed with a revised dustjacket and small cosmetic adjustments, ratified by an aloof EU elite and sold as a new product. I do not expect the public, across Europe, to fall for that sort of trick with a change of labels. What we have to do is to abandon any new EU constitution in favour of a foundational treaty on the cooperation, as equals, of states and peoples secure in their own identities, relying, I believe, on the principle of maximising strength in our dealings with the outside world and freedom at home, as well as laying down a demarcation of powers between the European Union and the Member States that is not susceptible to misinterpretation. In all these areas, it will be necessary to let people have their say through the holding of referendums, for there is no doubting the need for weighty conventions such as this sort of foundational treaty to be made subject to a referendum by the people of the EU in the various Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">As he said, the June Summit will be an important one, and we know that the German Presidency is keen to reach an outline agreement then. Agreement will not be easy. The stated positions of the Member States continue to vary quite substantially and in these circumstances I believe it would be counterproductive to try to force through the wrong sort of agreement in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="en">You said recently at your bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister that any new amending treaty should not have the characteristics of a constitution. I wholeheartedly agree with this view and I believe that this is the view of many millions of people across our continent. You also said that you were keen to see the role of national parliaments strengthened. I strongly agree with this view too and I hope you will pursue this at the Summit. I believe that our citizens need to have assurances that their national parliaments will also play a greater role in scrutinising draft European legislation. There remains a tangible disconnection between the European institutions and the people at this time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have often said that I am not hostile to the idea of some solution that would improve the workings of the institutions in dealing with enlargement and which address the alienation people feel about the institutions themselves. However, I do not believe this solution is a constitution. We should not be seeking greater powers for the centre. Instead, we should be concentrating on policy delivery.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you have said, and my party leader David Cameron has also said, there is an urgent need for a greater emphasis on making Europe more competitive, tackling global poverty and dealing with the serious issues of climate change. These issues are what people want us to tackle and Member States can do much more to cooperate in these fields.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore urge the Prime Minister and his fellow heads of government not to get bogged down in institutional and constitutional debate in Brussels.

      <p sl="nl">With this, a new Treaty is moving closer, and this is important, because we need one, for things are just not going well enough at the moment.

      <p sl="lv">Thank you, Mr President. I have no doubt that both those who support a European Constitution and those who oppose it want to see a stronger Europe. The differences lie in opinions as to how to achieve this. Just like the majority of people in this Chamber, I believe in the idea of the European Union, but lack of support from society weakens our attempts to turn this idea into a reality. We must therefore ask whether adopting the Constitution will help us to obtain the public’s support. As one of the participants in the European Convention for the drafting of the Constitution, I am not convinced of it. We are far from even remotely exploiting the possibilities offered by the existing treaties. Prime Minister, the European services market you mentioned can be seen as an example of this. And extending the use of the qualified majority voting principle would not have assisted the liberalisation of the services sector — quite the reverse. At this period in history it is absolutely vital to achieve mutual comprehension between the Member States and an increased wish for cooperation, based on common values and the idea of the Union, so that the interests of large and small, rich and poor, new and old Member States can be given equal value. I admit that this is a difficult task, but without it it will be impossible for the Member States to regain steady support from the public. Without this the Union cannot become closer. The draft Constitution does not address these challenges.</p>

We should, however, be clear about what it is that we are now offering to the citizens of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In this regard, I should like to point out that there are a number of people here in this Chamber who are not interested in the debate on the need for an EU foreign minister. They are more interested in why it is that people from other, so-called new Member States still cannot travel freely in the Schengen area even after three years. They are amazed that in the much-vaunted Europe of equal rights they are unable to access the labour market in some countries, whilst at the same time capital flows freely in and out of my country. Why is it that the bigger Member States have more favourable conditions in certain sectors than the newer, smaller Member States? Why, unlike the citizens of some Member States, can we not travel to the USA without visas? We want to extend the competence of the Union to areas where it is not needed and where, for various reasons, it makes sense to maintain distinctions on the playing field based on the relative strength of the different players. It is no wonder that many Europeans often cannot understand our profound debates on the future of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sv">In the summer of 1787, a number of people in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania sat down and devised a Constitution for what became the United States of America. They were at the pinnacle of their era’s knowledge of political science, philosophy and democracy. They put forward a proposal openly and honestly and obtained popular support and support from the various constituent states.</p>
      <p sl="sv">How different is the process that is now under way to force a Constitution onto the EU countries! The EU’s powerful political elite knows that it lacks popular support for its plans for a United States of Europe. The negotiations are taking place in secret. There is no question of the European project having a democratic basis. Rather, it is designed to blind people with science. Angela Merkel asks, for example, whether it might be a good idea to alter the terminology of the draft Constitution without changing the legal substance. Its proposals concerning the flag and the anthem would be removed. The whole plan is designed to enable the political elite to push through a United States of Europe without being forced to win the peoples’ confidence in the project. That is deceitful.</p>

Indeed, we were used to being on the front line for the European project, but ever since the negative referendum in the Netherlands, I get the impression that the Dutch leaders, where Europe is concerned, have been suffering from cold feet to some extent.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This was evident, inter alia, from the way in which you spoke about extending majority decision-making, while surely you know that this is one of the key elements in order to keep the momentum going in an enlarged Europe. I do however, appreciate the difficult position that you are in at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You, Prime Minister, probably remain convinced that the text that you approved at the IGC does indeed adequately meet the challenge we are facing, but should take the verdict of your people into consideration. I therefore value your efforts to come up with solutions and to look for a compromise, in which respect you clearly recognise that due account must be given to those who approved the text as it was. I hope that this can lead to a compromise.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am, however, really concerned about what you said about the involvement of the national parliaments. You explicitly plead in favour of the red card, which I do not think of as the right way forward. What you are actually doing is turning the national parliaments into a new EU institution of some kind, and that is not exactly something we are waiting for. You need to convince your national parliament that their role is to monitor the ministers in relation to their role in the Council. This is the role of the national parliaments, and the national parliaments who have done this have not experienced any problems.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Another reservation I have about what you said, and to which you perhaps ought to give some thought, is that when you seek to include the criteria for enlargement in the Treaty, like the Commission, you have to bear in mind that you would then subject the enlargement to the Court’s legal control, while this is, in the final analysis, about political decision-making.

You have now come along with an entirely opposite position. These things happen in families and we are prepared to build bridges.</p>
      <p sl="es">You have imposed four conditions. With regard to codecision and the national parliaments, I agree with Jean-Luc Dehaene: the national parliaments should show the red card to the governments, not to the European institutions. We are prepared to improve our cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the new issues that are being added, paragraph 12 of our motion for a resolution contains them. We agree on that. With regard to the issue of public services, convince your political family.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is a fundamental problem however: splitting the Treaty open, considering amendments rather than its structure, means dismantling everything and it goes against transparency and understanding on the part of the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">One more thing, Mr President, regarding the anthem: the other day, in my constituency, I explained to my fellow countrymen that the Dutch national anthem, the ‘Wilhelmus’, pays homage to the King of Spain. They said, ‘how nice the Dutch are!’</p>
      <p sl="es">When I then said to them, ‘and they talk about the cruel Spaniard’, they said, ‘that is a football problem’. So I would say one thing: this anthem business is very complicated, and I shall stick to the Ode to Joy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it has just struck me that, in the debate, most of the support for Mr Balkenende came from the SP, the Vlaams Belang, the Party of Haider, the Polish League of Families and the Eurosceptics from Sweden and Denmark. I just thought that worth mentioning.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Cabinet’s efforts bear witness to a depressing void and lack of any sense of responsibility in terms of Europe’s future. After all, the consequence of a mini-Treaty will be reduced democracy, minimal involvement for the public and reduced decisiveness in terms of climate change and terrorism. A mini-Treaty will make Europe a political dwarf. The fundamental rights must be legally enforceable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Is the Dutch Labour Party in this Cabinet really prepared to sacrifice the fundamental rights to avoid a referendum? The national parliaments should indeed be involved more, but rather than introduce paralysing red-card procedures, they should finally develop active interest and knowledge. They can do this now, but just do not bother.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, there is a lot of demagogic twaddle about a superstate. We should stop this, because I did not hear your party discuss this either when you campaigned in favour of the constitution prior to the referendum. Measures in the area of security against terrorism, for example, should, of course, be taken at European level, not as it is being done at the moment, though, in back rooms, but rather out in the open, democratically and with majority decision-making. This is not a superstate, this is democracy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, one condition for a successful future for a united Europe is developing a European consciousness. This is defined by everything that we Europeans have in common – a Christian history and culture, and the understanding that our only future is together.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must remember that we cannot force people to adopt a European identity. No amount of legislation, even when it is adopted in an atmosphere of success, let alone a climate of unwillingness, can create it. The fact is that it is not constitutions that create communities, but communities create constitutions. For that reason, a constitutional treaty for Europe will not lead to a new growth in European identity, and there is no point in waging wars to defend it, particularly if it creates unneeded divisions. We must, however, make sure that our common history is punctuated by more events like the recent Samara summit. We need the world to see us as a united entity more often. We must speak in a single voice, because that is the only way we can rise to the challenges facing us.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is my sincere belief that we can succeed in this, precisely thanks to our common identity, and that is something that no legislation can guarantee.</p>

    <intervention id="3-278" speaker_id="33990" name="Adrian Severin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to say to the Prime Minister that the Constitutional Treaty is not about losing identity but about organising solidarity in a just, effective and sustainable way. Those who oppose it on grounds of identity are not in fact afraid of citizens losing control over the State but of the State losing control over citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">In a world where the market, crime and poverty are globalised, the European Union must be political and coherent. We therefore need the double legitimacy of the European Union as a union of states and citizens and double majority voting.</p>
      <p sl="en">You will agree that the European Union is simply unable to exist without legal personality and is unable to decide whether the single-country veto is its decision-making rule. While accepting that subsidiarity should be an important principle of the Union, we should also accept the precedence of European legislation over national legislation. We cannot expect European citizens to be loyal to the European institutions if their fundamental rights are not legally binding.</p>
      <p sl="en">Likewise, without a social dimension, the European dream simply will not take off. However, a social Europe is not sustainable without a harmonised tax policy and European Union funds. Ultimately it is not possible to imagine a Europe which is economically and socially effective without a common foreign and security policy. By considering this aspect in a positive way you will certainly bridge the wishes of your citizens and the aspirations of other Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Mr President, I am very much indebted to the Members of Parliament for their comments further to what was said on the subject earlier.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to start by clearing up a serious misunderstanding. I have heard a number of speakers, including Mrs Kaufmann and Mr Voggenhuber, talk about things such as the national anthem, the title of Foreign Affairs Minister and the flag, as if these were Dutch issues.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is not the case at all. I have indicated to you that the question is whether these symbols – that are wonderful in their own right and I have nothing against them – should be enshrined in a constitution. They are merely examples of the question whether we want to work on a constitution or would prefer to change the treaty. This is what this is about. Let us simply treasure our symbols, the question is only whether they should be included or not.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What I meant went a lot deeper, as I indicated. I have tried to give answers to concerns that are around. In my contribution, I indicated that we must think in terms of a treaty amendment, a test of subsidiarity by the national parliaments. I will say more about this in a moment. The kind of things that matter to us are majority decision-making in relation to the powers of Europe and the inclusion of the enlargement criteria. Seeing things only in terms of symbols would turn the Netherlands’ vision into a caricature.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I also paid close attention when the comment about nationalism was made. It was one that I did not understand. During the debates which we held in the Dutch Lower Chamber and after the ‘no’, I made it quite clear that our future is in Europe. A positive message about the meaning of Europe in everyone’s life. We cannot do without Europe. This has always been my message, and I have no desire, therefore, to be associated with purely nationalistic trends.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There was also the assertion that Europe is about nothing but economics. to which, you, Mr President, of course referred. Everyone says certain things. You referred to the actions of a young media person. I should like to remind you once again that when we held the presidency of the European Union, I repeatedly said that Europe is much more than a market and currency. Do you remember that I took the initiative to organise conferences on values in Europe? I then raised the question: what makes us Europeans? What are our common motives? What makes Europe this continent? It is my dear wish that the debate on European values be continued. We cannot do without this debate. So do not try to tell me that this is just about economics.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When we consider Europe’s future, we face the question as to what the challenge is we are facing. Mrs Martens from the Netherlands made a pertinent comment in this connection. What is actually the ideal situation? What are we trying to achieve together? This subsequently leads to a host of concrete questions which have also been raised on this platform.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I cannot address all of them. There are simply too many and we are also limited in time. Allow me to single out a few issues, though. One of the points that was made was the issue of powers and of subsidiarity. It is my firm belief that we must spell out what we mean. Mr Duff made no bones about the fact that the Union has only those powers that the Member States grant it. We should lay this down in very specific terms. When these powers are implemented, this is when the issues of subsidiarity and proportionality come into play.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Of course, the national parliaments have their part to play in this. This is also true of the Netherlands. The Upper and Lower Chambers, and the Joint Committee, have reflected on the question as to what Europe should and should not do. This is extremely beneficial for involvement.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Indeed, for too long, the debates were avoided and postponed. This is also the method by means of which we would like to say that national parliaments should be fully involved in what is happening in Europe. If there are points of criticism, they should be made.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We, for example, commented on the harmonisation of criminal law in the fight against counterfeit goods, something with which Commissioner Frattini has concerned himself. This is the sort of thing that should be open to discussion. This is how national parliaments can operate. In a wider sense, it is also a good thing that the question of subsidiarity is also addressed in national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We should avoid a situation in which national parliaments and the European Parliament are pitted against one another. You have different powers and you play your own role in democracy. We should not see this as a sign of weakness, but rather as one of strength.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should now like to turn to the criteria of services of general interest, a subject that Mr Van den Berg raised, along with other questions. It is my firm belief that we need clarification. We can discuss the way in which this is done. At the same time I can see Mr Maaten – we know each other well from the days when we both sat on the town council of Amstelveen, a town near Amsterdam – we go back a long time. I can understand very well what you are saying about the internal market. Of course, we must consider this consequence, but I, in turn, would say, if we discuss pension systems, pension funds, schools, let us closely examine how the principles of the internal market work there. We need clarification on this and we can obviously discuss the way this should be brought about in greater detail.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I understood very well that you talked about the importance of the Charter of fundamental rights. With good reason, because these fundamental rights belong to the values which Mr Daul mentioned. The question is only – and I would like to ask the same question – whether this should be included in a Constitution or if other methods could be applied. We need to find a solution for this. I have listened carefully to what you said and heard how important the topic is considered here.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It was a pleasure to hear Mr Dehaene speak. I value him for his involvement in bringing about the Constitutional Treaty and the Convention at the time, and we have found ourselves thrashing things out on many occasions. I am pleased that you feel for the position that we are in, when people say ‘no’ in a referendum. You have also indicated what is needed to resolve this situation. I would respond to that by saying that we must be a little more pragmatic, as Mr Maaten indicated, but obviously whilst retaining the ideals we all share.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If we can reach this solution, we will need to be mindful of the positions on either side. It is for precisely this reason that I repeat today that it is necessary that we look beyond the existing positions, that we should not take sides in Europe and that this, as I see it, can be done by means of an amending Treaty. I think it is possible to find solutions swiftly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Many comments have been made, which I find difficult to address, although I have taken note of them all for personal use. I listened carefully to Mr Barón Crespo, who mentioned – and I should like to finish with this remark – national anthems. You referred to the Dutch Wilhelmus, our anthem which, it is true, contains the sentence: ‘de koning van Hispanje heb ik altijd geëerd’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The fact, though, that our anthem includes the line ‘I have always respected the King of Spain’ was related to the fact that Spain was involved in totally different things in the Netherlands, which culminated in a fight for independence and an 80-year war. This is now such a great time, a time in which we, for the first time in Europe’s history, are experiencing peace and security so that we can discuss things here in friendship.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I remember very well when I was in Madrid and visited the monastery where Philip II stayed. It was interesting, alongside our version of history, to hear the Spanish version. This is what is so good about Europe, that we can be different. Europe is a continent of diversity, but we also need unity. What is so special about Europe is that we boast this culture and religious pluriformity. This is what has made Europe strong.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If we are talking about the ideals which we stand for, then I would say: let us use what has made Europe strong: human rights, democracy and working on security. Let us remain keenly aware that this should be a combined effort. Let us recognise the powers of national parliaments, let us get the European Parliament to do what needs to be done without any restrictions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I always find it extremely stimulating to be here, because the European Parliament is the symbol of a united Europe. I believe it is a good thing that national politicians enter into debate with you. I experienced the debate with you today as extremely stimulating. Of course we do not need to see eye to eye on everything, and of course I can take criticism, but there is more that unites us than divides us.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If we are guided by the European dream, then we will undoubtedly be able to find solutions for the problems that have arisen. Together we can make a difference; together we can work on this solution.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the situation in Nigeria is of great significance for the stability of West Africa and, ultimately for that of the continent as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">The latest elections in Nigeria turned out very disappointingly, as the Council indicated in its statement of 27 April; there were numerous irregularities and acts of violence, with up to 200 people being killed and many more than that injured or intimidated, and the Council expects the persons responsible for these acts of violence to be called to account for their actions. It is fortunate, at any rate, that there was no evidence in these elections of religious or ethnic conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="de">The elections took place within an improved legal framework, with substantial funds being made available, and all this led us to expect that the 2007 elections would pass off better than those held in 2003. While we are still awaiting the final report from the EU’s election observation mission, initial assessments give credence to the suspicion that the 2007 elections were an even more badly run affair than their predecessors in 2003.</p>
      <p sl="de">The main problems were in the lack of organisation exemplified in particular by the late opening of polling stations, the lack of ballot slips and the lack of secrecy around the voting process. What was even more serious was that, in addition to widespread irregularities, there was visible evidence of considerable electoral fraud.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another major problem with the elections was that failure to publish detailed results from them, with, moreover, those results that were available not being calculated in comprehensible ways, and we should now ask the Nigerian authorities to publish the results with the figures broken down according to the polling stations where the votes were cast, for this is the only way in which the election system can be guaranteed to be transparent.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Council did, however, find positive encouragement in the indications of greater independence on the part of the judicial system during the election campaign, and we hope that this tendency will continue in the post-election period. The lively debates in the privately-owned media before and after the election were also encouraging, and the Council has been impressed not least by the commitment of the Nigerians themselves to the democratic process, in consequence of which the involvement of civil society organisation is, and will continue to be, of very great importance.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Council has appealed to all the political actors to use peaceful means and to demonstrate an attitude of responsibility by having consistent recourse to the legal channels in order not to disappoint the Nigerian people. We hope that the independent national election commission and other bodies will make haste in producing the evidence that the electoral tribunals require in order to complete their work with the minimum delay possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Council also hopes that the Nigerian state authorities will be sympathetic to the idea of repeating the election process in instances where there is irrefutable evidence of grave electoral fraud.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is not, however, the time to turn our back on Nigeria – on the contrary; Nigeria’s stability and development matter not only to its own people, but also to Africa as a whole, and, if the Millennium Development Goals are not achieved in Nigeria, we are not going to be able to achieve them in Africa at all.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nigeria’s future government will have numerous challenges to face; one fundamental area of concern will be the need to monitor efficiently the resources allocated to the federal states, and another will be the continuing insecurity in the Niger Delta.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU should support Nigeria as it faces these challenges, stepping up its efforts to strengthen responsible governance and democracy and promoting respect for human rights in Nigeria. It must involve itself in these areas in cooperation with Nigeria and on the basis of that country’s government’s unequivocal consent.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Presidency will therefore continue to keep a watchful eye on developments in Nigeria.</p>

    <intervention id="3-285" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Benita Ferrero-Waldner" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, as we have just heard, Nigeria has recently held important elections that will determine the transfer of power from one civilian president to another. On the invitation of the Nigerian authorities, the Commission fielded a large independent election observation mission (EOM), which performed well and cooperated closely with other international and domestic observer groups. I appointed Mr van den Berg – who had also observed the elections in 2003 – chief observer for those elections, and he will shortly give us his report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The mission concluded that the 2007 state and federal elections fell short of basic international and regional standards for democratic elections, pointing out that they were marred by poor organisation – as has already been cited, a lack of essential transparency and safeguards, widespread irregularities, significant evidence of fraud and disenfranchisement of voters. Sadly, at least 200 deaths from election-related violence were also reported. Other international observers – including those fielded by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the US National Democratic Institute, led by Madeleine Albright – were also very critical, as were domestic observation groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU Presidency expressed disappointment at these elections not having marked progress in relation to 2003, which has now been reiterated by our president, at the irregularities and at the high toll of victims. The reactions and the messages from the international community had been consistent in urging Nigerians who have complaints about the process to use the legal provisions outlined in the Constitution and in the Electoral Act, commending the independence shown by the judiciary and the engagement of civil society and praising the commitment of poll workers and voters.</p>
      <p sl="en">Disappointment at this missed opportunity is widespread in the international community, as Nigeria – one of the major powers in Africa – could have set an example of successful consolidation of the democratic process, which would have had a tremendous positive impact on the African continent. This is even more regrettable as the elections were held in an improved atmosphere in which the freedoms of assembly and expression were at least broadly respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">The elections have highlighted the many problems and shortcomings of the Nigerian democratic process, and the Commission is aware that many challenges and misgivings need now to be addressed and overcome. In the short term, pressure should be placed on Nigeria’s Independent National Electoral Commission to publish a complete breakdown of the polling station results, which is a basic requirement of transparency, and the judiciary should also be encouraged to act swiftly and responsibly with the election petitions. If redress is not provided, this could have serious implications for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the lessons learned will have to be taken into account in our future relations with Nigeria, entrenching positions should be avoided. I think the political dialogue has to restart, but future relations will have to include a deeper engagement at federal, state and Community level with a wider range of players in civil society and government. The topic of the elections must be a key feature of the political dialogue with Nigeria, based on the recommendations of the EOM. Our readiness to engage Nigeria in a political dialogue and the commitment to promote the strengthening of governments and democracy in the country, particularly together with ECOWAS, is highlighted in the joint EU-ECOWAS communiqué issued on 24 April at the 11th EU-ECOWAS ministerial meeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the main instrument for political dialogue will remain Articles 8 and 9 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, the programming of the development cooperation to be financed by the 10th European Development Fund will also provide a crucial avenue for dialogue and the opportunity to take into account lessons learnt from the elections and the outcome of the discussions with the new Government, civil society and other key players.</p>

    <intervention id="3-286" speaker_id="28280" name="Filip Kaczmarek" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, both the Nigerians and the international community had great hopes for the Nigerian elections for a number of reasons.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa and as the Commissioner said, a successful democratic process in Nigeria could set a good example that other African countries would wish to replicate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, these were the first Nigerian elections where one civilian government would take over another, which is very important in a country with a history of military dictatorships.</p>
      <p sl="pl">And thirdly, there is broad freedom of speech in Nigeria, and the judiciary is independent.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately these hopes of a positive example have been dashed. The resolution we are discussing is very critical, and justifiably so. Poor organisation, numerous mistakes and procedural irregularities, as well as electoral fraud have meant that the latest Nigerian elections cannot be regarded as credible, free or fair.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The elections met neither international standards nor the regional standards defined by ECOWAS. Worse still, the elections were marred by violence resulting in the deaths of at least 200 people. Questions about the significance of this violence by discussing the death toll showed that most Nigerian politicians were unaware of the problem.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It appears that long-term education in citizenship is very important in the case of Nigeria. Sending election observers is not enough, we need to invest in education and building a civil society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is my belief that the Nigerians must not be subjected to blackmail based on threats that any questioning of the election results would be tantamount to inviting the military to stage a coup again. This philosophy of ‘the lesser of two evils’ undermines democracy and justifies and feeds anti-democratic tendencies. The 64 million registered Nigerian voters have a right to election results that reflect their real will, and the European Union must strive to make this happen.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-287" speaker_id="4480" name="Margrietus van den Berg" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I should like to say something on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, rather than as head of the Election Observation Mission, because that is a different role.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Election Observation Mission has had to conclude that the elections in Nigeria were not credible. This is unfortunate, because despite the improved atmosphere in which the freedom of expression of opinion was respected during the campaign and despite the positive and independent role played by the law courts, the election process, and subsequently the results, cannot be seen as credible. The Council has confirmed, as has the Commissioner, that this is indeed the case.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Nigerian elections were badly organised and intransparent; there were far-reaching procedural irregularities and there was clear evidence of fraud. The process fell well short of the measure of international and regional standards for democratic elections.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The point which the Council made a moment ago, namely failure to publish the results either in polling stations or at higher levels, and hence the complete lack of proof and transparency is, and remains, in fact, the most serious problem, because as a result, nothing can be proven or refuted, and this takes all the credibility out of the electoral result as such.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is simply, as we have established, one of the toughest verdicts which we as Election Observation Mission have passed in the different countries. This was particularly painful, because after 2003, there was real hope among the people that actual improvements would follow. The people were committed. When many people have made the necessary efforts and have shown commitment, then something like this will hit them particularly hard. If you compare 14 April to 21 April: at the governor’s elections on 14 April, there was still a great deal of hope, whereas the situation on the 21 April was simply demoralising. This also explains the low turn-out, despite the upbeat figures that were published afterwards.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What conclusion are we Europeans to draw from this? That we should, emphatically, remain committed, and this is where I agree with the Council and the Commission in their conclusions. It is, after all, the Nigerian people we are talking about, and they deserve a better future and serious elections.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This means, therefore, that in our diplomatic relations, we cannot pretend that the government that has just been appointed has been elected in a democratic manner at all. This is, of course, a very tricky business. We could do business as usual, provided we remain involved and active. Business as usual would affect not only the credibility of our European Election Observation Missions, but also – and to a far greater extent – our own values for which we stand when we act in the world and in a country such as this. We should therefore come clean and conclude that we have a democratic crisis on our hands at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This crisis has partly become evident before the courts, where a number of people have objected and tried to prove that certain things are simply wrong. It has also become evident, and can become evident, via working parties of the Senate and the House of Representatives, who are launching investigations of their own and are trying to table fresh proposals. And we have to wait and see, of course, how people in Nigeria come to table their own proposals on the question as to how credible elections can be held.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have said before that it is not up to us to work this out in detail, but this is the essence and it would be good if in this respect, our resources could be put in place, preferably not with the federal government and with the state, but with all those players in society who can promote governance and democracy in this way.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-288" speaker_id="4241" name="Johan Van Hecke" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the analyses of the elections in Nigeria by international observers are, as I see it, strikingly similar: disappointment about the election process that is typified by poor organisation, large-scale fraud, intimidation and violence. These elections do not in any way meet international standards. This is the conclusion of the EU Observation Mission, under the leadership of Mr van den Berg, who has done sterling work under difficult circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The reaction of certain Member States who would have preferred a slightly less outspokenly negative statement from the European observers has rather surprised me, and all the more so because the Member States in question are constantly banging on about the need for more democratisation in Africa. Diverse interests sometimes lead to diverse reactions – history is repeating itself.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The EU Election Observation Mission was right not to be seduced into adopting a political stance. After all, as Mr van den Berg stated a moment ago, it is now up to the political class and civil society in Nigeria to do their bit. The judgment by the High Court on the Vice-President’s participation in the elections demonstrates that this should not be utopia.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Irregularities should now be reported to the election tribunals and the courts. Our role is more of a structural one. Accordingly, by means of dialogue, as the Commissioner pointed out with good reason, we must spell out that an independent election committee must be put in place that is capable of organising truly independent elections, and the newly elected Nigerian parliament can play an important role in this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In summary, following promising developments in countries such as Mali, Benin and Liberia, it is a crying shame that a regional superpower such as Nigeria has missed a great opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, as we all know, the development of Nigeria is crucially important for the African continent. Nigeria is one of the largest countries in Africa and, just as it has done in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the European Union has put effort into organising elections and observing elections there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That being said, the chaotic and violent situation that reigns in Nigeria, especially in the delta region, must open our eyes to a number of issues – obvious and outstanding issues. As in Congo, the issue of the exploitation of raw materials and oil plays an extremely important role in the destabilisation of this country, in the atmosphere of violence and civil war that has come about there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On this point, I believe that we should be very pro-active in supporting the civil society and the democrats, who are fighting to obtain information and transparency on the exploitation of the resources and who are also seeking to preserve their resources. The delta region is totally devastated and plagued by murderous conflicts, and the manœuvres of the Nigerian army in this area sometimes do more harm than good.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also believe that the European Union should be far stricter in making the development aid that it provides conditional on the fight against corruption and on the very clear inclusion in the State budget of the profits made from oil and minerals, because it is all the same absolutely scandalous that the people of Nigeria, who live in a state of great poverty, do not see any benefits whatsoever from these mineral and oil profits! At a time when the price of a barrel of oil has increased, the resources should be considerable. It is therefore most unusual that this issue has not been dealt with.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, progress needs to be made, too, concerning the social and environmental responsibility of large companies – Shell, in particular, has a major presence in this country, but it is not the only one – and we should also act together on these major issues, and not just on the matter of organising elections.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to the reports by the Council and the Commission, and as a member of the delegation of parliamentary observers at the presidential elections, I can fully confirm everything that has been said so far. The elections were definitely not conducted in compliance with international standards, since the standards laid down at international level were not reached, nor even the standards of the African states themselves.</p>
      <p sl="it">There was even a postponement in the opening time of polling stations that was decided on and notified only the day before, so that the majority of the population was unaware of it. Most of the polling stations closed early. There was an absence of any kind of secret ballot – and I could go on indefinitely, mentioning, for example, an electoral commission that was independent solely in name, but in fact was closely linked to the government.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would also like to mention the intimidating atmosphere. Hauwa Ibrahim, holder of the 2005 Sakharov prize, was supposed to meet our delegation in a public place but requested a change in the location of the appointment because she did not feel sufficiently safe.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to move the debate on to what can be done in the future. We absolutely must call for investigations into the electoral irregularities, call for an independent electoral commission, call for the Court of Appeal to be truly independent in dealing with electoral appeals and verify this, and state that new elections are necessary. We cannot, however, stop at just this, and I already see in the background the risk that the political choices of the Council are tending in the direction of continuing as if nothing was the matter. Let us not conceal the reason – some people may think that what matters is to have a government that is more or less legitimised, but in a country from which we can continue to buy oil.</p>
      <p sl="it">This cannot be the solution. I would like to ask what the intentions are with regard to using some instruments that the European Union possesses. For example, there is the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. Are we able to verify that the Nigerian Government remains uninvolved in the selection and implementation of projects that are financed by this instrument? I would like to ask the Commissioner, as I have already done on other occasions, what is happening with the democratic clause on rights, which was adopted by a very large majority within this Parliament, but never accepted by the Commission or the Council. It has never been transformed into the powerful tool that it could be, and in this case it could be extremely useful to place trade with Europe in the scales too, from the viewpoint of democratic progress.</p>
      <p sl="it">Last, but not least, there is the issue of what role Europe intends to play regarding events in the Niger delta. It does not seem adequate to me that individual States should do their utmost and be prepared to pay ransoms when someone is seized. We must call for a start in talks, relations and meetings between the Nigerian Government and the representatives of local people, putting pressure not only on the government but also on the large European companies operating in that region without any respect for human rights or environmental rights.</p>

Above the headline, there is a big picture of two coyly smiling Nigerian boys brandishing their ballot papers. Any comment would be superfluous. The two elections in the most populous country in April have ended in human and political disaster, with more than 200 people killed, and fraud on a large scale – things about which the present joint resolution does not mince words. Where do we go from here in Nigeria?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, if a country is trying for the first time, in the aftermath of civil war and military dictatorships, to organise a peaceful handover of power, it follows that not everything is going to run ideally and perfectly smoothly.</p>
      <p sl="de">We all agree, though, that the elections laid on were a farce, for what has become of democracy when a party rejoices in its own victory even before the votes have been counted, or what of the free choice of the voters when threats are made as the voting papers are counted out, when ballot slips are completed many times over, and when there seem, in rural districts, to have been scarcely any elections at all? What sort of message is it supposed to send out when ballot papers and election material arrive too late or not at all? How, then, are the people of Nigeria supposed to feel that they are being taken seriously?</p>
      <p sl="de">The election process was meant to have brought the region stability and pointed people to a viable way into the future, but those hopes have proved illusory, leaving behind them a disillusioned people whose experience of elections is, at best, of a symbolic act, and an opposition whose threat to contest the election result will probably avail it but little, for the winning party is hardly likely to agree to new elections, so what we are left to consider is to what degree the European Union can and may exert pressure when power is handed over on 29 May, for the European Union itself has hardly been always the best of examples; it, too, has seen the repetition of referendums until the desired result was achieved, something that is highly dubious in democratic political terms.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it was my first visit to Nigeria and my first African election, and I was disappointed: I had expected to see a free and fair election, and it was anything but that. I will not bore the House with my conclusions, because they are the same as those of the leader of the Commission’s delegation and of the leader of the delegation I belong to, and they can be seen on YouTube, in a short video I made, under the headline ‘Nigeria’s rigged elections’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should just like to address some lessons for the European Union from this election in the largest country in Africa. It seems to me that the Chinese influence, referred to by Mr Belder, might be a little deeper than we perceive. We know that China is involved in the democracy backlash around the world: working with Russia as a dirty duet, all over Africa, with Belarus, Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Egypt. There is a process under way that the European Union has to respond to, and I believe that the Commissioner is committed to making the most use of the instrument that she and I are very committed to – the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just make some specific points. I was one of three Members of the European Parliament on this delegation, and that was not enough. I believe we have to reconsider as a House the use of former Members of the European Parliament in such delegations. For example, we will send a delegation to Sierra Leone in August; I will not be surprised if there are very few takers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, concerning the independence of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, we heard that the EU mission in Nigeria is involved with the Government in approving projects. This must not happen: this instrument is supposed to be independent of host-country control.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then there is the question of follow-up for this election. I know that the final report has not yet been published, but I believe that the European Union has a commitment to the pursuit of democracy in those countries and the follow-up to the process of a bad election.</p>

On the one hand, Nigerian voters often travel many miles in great discomfort to reach the polling booths. On the other hand, those manning Nigerian polling stations do everything they can to stop these people from accessing the ballot box. On the one hand, people cast their vote enthusiastically with a view to a better, fairer, more decent life. On the other hand, those manning the polling stations falsify people’s votes with the aim of preventing political and economic change.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I feel there can be no doubt about where the European Parliament and the Union stand. We are on the side of justice, democracy, and free and fair elections. We are on the side of the millions of Nigerians who believe in democratic elections in the hope that democracy is the key to resolving political, economic and social problems. Last month Nigeria had a historic opportunity to prove to itself, to Africa and to the rest of the world that it is equal to that task, that it is capable of making the democratic, peaceful transition from one government to another.

      <p sl="pl">It seems to me, however, that the debate in this House before any pronouncement by the electoral commissions is somewhat premature.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, over 200 people died during the recent elections in Nigeria. The way the elections were conducted had nothing to do with democratic procedures. The head of the EU observers Max van den Berg stressed that they did not justify the hopes and expectations of Nigerians, and cannot be regarded as credible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nigeria is a country riddled by social conflict based on religious and ethnic differences, especially between Muslims and Christians. At the same time, the country has vast resources of oil and other minerals and is the ninth largest country in the world in terms of population. Political killings, torture, and summary justice meted out by the army are commonplace. Freedom of speech and of assembly are restricted. Cases of repression of the Christian minority are becoming increasingly worrying.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Since its establishment, the European Union was built on the basis of respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and citizens’ freedoms. On many occasions in its history the European Community – and later the European Union – has spoken out when democracy and freedom were under threat. The examples of Georgia and Ukraine also show that only decisive action brings results. In Ukraine, this kind of action led to a re-run of the falsified second round of the presidential elections. This was the result not just of the resilient attitude of the Ukrainians, but also of the loud and clear signals sent by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my view, the European Union’s delayed reaction to the events in Nigeria is also cause for concern. Where fundamental standards are breached, instant reactions should follow. Exactly one month has passed since the disturbances and elections in Nigeria, and we should immediately suspend all financial aid from the European Union to government structures in Nigeria, as well as aid for democracy and human rights if there is a danger that this money may go into the pockets of corrupt government structures.</p>

      <p sl="fr">These elections were meant to be a test. For the first time since the country gained independence, in 1960, a democratically-elected president could have hoped to succeed another. This is a missed opportunity! It does not bode at all well for Nigeria, at a time when the country, rich though it is, needs stability if it hopes to escape poverty.</p>

      <p sl="en">The European Union was one of the biggest donors for carrying out elections in Nigeria. Therefore we must hold a certain degree of responsibility that the aid given most efficiently serves its purpose. The whole organisational burden for conducting the elections was carried by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. In Nigeria, INEC was not able to meet the organisational and logistical challenges it faced in order to carry out truly democratic elections. The shortcomings also constitute the most comprehensive part of the resolution. I guess you must share INEC’s responsibility by, for example, educating the approximately 500 000 INEC grassroots-level organisers so that more credible independent and democratic elections in Nigeria could take place next time.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Regardless of the election result – and there is good reason to doubt the validity of that result – the most worrying aspect of the Nigerian election was the electoral process, on which the opinion of the other international observers left no room for doubt: it was disorganised and fraud took place.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report on the subject from our fellow Members who were there as observers is revealing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The conclusion can thus be drawn that the election was used to secure a degree of legitimacy that the observers do not recognise and that is not acceptable to democracies. The result had more to do with intimidation, fraud and violence than the will of the people. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case on the African continent; far from it, in fact.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Despite the progress made in recent decades, much of the most persistent violence still goes on and some of the most corrupt regimes are still very much in place. There is nothing in the geography of Africa or in the genetic make-up of African people that stops them living in a democracy, but the international community needs to be determined and resolute in the process of the democratisation of African countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is not only for all the usual reasons, but also because China has become a global player, and one that does not demand democratisation in return for cooperation; quite the contrary, in fact. Ahead of the EU-Africa summit due to take place in the second half of the year, the EU is now expected to play a genuinely effective role and not be reduced to mere rhetoric. Not all global players behave in the same fashion but we need to work in tandem with our allies. This is firstly for reasons both of values and principles, and of interests. In free and stable democracies it is possible to pursue international trade that is predictable and that is of benefit to all but those who seek to fan the flames of corruption and dictatorship.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We must be tough, therefore, at the forthcoming summit, which is to take place during the Portuguese Presidency. We do not want statements of good intent or mere recognition of the mistakes of the past; what we want is political truth and true politics.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The EU must remain the biggest provider of international aid and must actively promote cooperation. At the same time, though, it must succeed in bringing about reform, democratisation and freedom in these countries. Otherwise, the EU will be giving out fish rather than helping people to fish.</p>

Based on my experiences, I have to say that the coordination of the work between numerous international observer delegations was an exemplary success.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As to the election itself, I can only confirm my colleagues’ statement that Nigeria’s elections can be considered neither fair nor free. They have satisfied neither international standards nor the local norms set by the government of Abuja. We witnessed serious shortcomings in the system of voter lists and in keeping the public informed. In many instances, local polling stations opened late and had no ballot forms. The murky process of compiling the results even raises the suspicion of fraud. It is quite telling that the results of some voting districts have not been disclosed.</p>
      <p sl="hu">What is more, the elections were marred by violence. As we have already heard, some 200 citizens lost their lives in clashes linked to the voting. These massive irregularities are even more distressing in the light of previous Nigerian elections that took place in a much more orderly fashion. This time we witnessed with sadness that the voting public’s allegiance to democracy – this is very important – was not accompanied by the intent of government bodies to keep the voting within legal bounds.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We who were there saw how committed Nigerian citizens are to democratic values. Amidst often chaotic conditions they waited with dignity for the moment to exercise their democratic right.

      <p sl="pl">Nigeria failed to make use of the opportunity the elections presented. Our observers clearly confirmed that the elections were neither free nor fair. This was because of corruption and very poor organisation. The Nigerian Government is entirely to blame for this. The elections were overshadowed by terror, in which 50 people died, most of them in the Niger Delta. At times they were nothing but a caricature of elections, where some polling stations failed to open, while in others bandits destroyed the ballot boxes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Europe should be especially meticulous in observing elections in this country, which is the largest in Africa and for many other African countries is a point of reference economically and politically. Elections in a country of 110 million, of which 64 million are of voting age, should focus the attention of public opinion. Unfortunately these elections did not boost, but have effectively weakened, Nigeria’s position in the international arena.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the run-up to the elections we noted a number of activities and tendencies not related to the election process that are cause for concern. For example, in Muslim-governed areas, girls going to Christian schools were forced to wear veils as symbols of Islamic tradition. This is a clear breach of religious rights and tolerance, but such practices are on the increase, and such discrimination may become even more widespread when Muslims take more power in Nigeria. As the European Parliament, we cannot pass over this matter in silence, particularly as it is an imposition on the minds of children. Tomorrow will be an opportunity to take a stand on this matter in the voting, and there will be voting in an amendment on this very issue.</p>
      <p sl="pl">But what will happen next, after the elections? We should do more than just criticise, for which we have just grounds. What we also need is a clear plan on how to force the observance of democratic rules of play in a country which plays a key role on a continent which is practically our neighbour. In other words we have to force the Nigerian authorities to reflect democracy and free elections or – to be frank – turn off the tap of financial aid. This aid must not be channelled towards state and federal structures. Instead it can and should be forwarded to non-governmental and social organisations. We must also put pressure on the Nigerian Government to act more effectively against corruption, the use of force and the sense of impunity that local authorities, which are practically states within a state, have.</p>

      <p sl="de">In his speech, Mr Kaczmarek gave it as his opinion that an opportunity had been missed, and to that I want to add that it was not a case of the overwhelming majority of Nigerians missing an opportunity, but rather of there having been people who would not allow the holding of free and independent elections with secret ballots that might have had a significant impact.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question has been asked from various quarters as to what we can do about this. In your own speech, Mr van den Berg, you also said, that we cannot stint in our commitment to Nigeria and to its civil society in particular. It is very important that we should now, rather than backtracking on this commitment, clarify how the commitment made by us in the European Union can directly benefit the interested parties, not least civil society.</p>
      <p sl="de">One opportunity to once again spell out what we Europeans think about how elections should be conducted, and about the ways in which they are manipulated, will be the G8 summit in Heiligendamm, at which the President of Nigeria, among others, is expected.</p>
      <p sl="de">This first impression of what has been going on in Nigeria must not, however, exercise a generally negative influence on Africa’s image in our eyes. Some of you have already mentioned the positive examples that are to be found on the African continent. Mauretania may not be a large country, but we have recently seen how it managed to organise a transition, and also, from its example, what sort of support is needed in order to do that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another consideration, bearing in mind the prospect of the Africa Summit between the EU and the African Union being held in November, is the need for it to be made clear for which values the European Union stands, and to what it is committed, in its dealings with its African partners. We must also, at the same time, make clear where we stand in our dialogue with China, for it is not acceptable that China should have only a very limited economic interest in the continent of Africa, whilst the European Union is left to do much else in such areas as responsible action by the state and the development of civil society.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was struck, a few weeks ago, when I attended a joint meeting between the EU and ECOWAS, to hear the participating countries say that, for many small shoots that had sprouted in them and which they hoped would grow still further, this amounted to a retrograde step. There are also many countries in Africa that are enjoying economic growth and that are well governed. I am glad to see that many of the public media are currently, in preparation for the Africa summit, taking note of that as they take a look at Africa, and that was another reason why it was important that the European Union and some of its Member States should show their colours while securing the elections in Congo, for there are, quite apart from Congo, a number of countries where development is progressing well. So, then, I want to say thank you again for that. I hope that we will, together with the Commission, and with your House’s support, find ways of coming to terms with what has happened in Nigeria; I hope that there will be changes, and that we will be able to give our continued support to those in Nigeria who want that land to change and become a democratic country.</p>

This must be part of the dialogue that we have to follow up, based especially on the recommendations of the EOM.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, political engagement and dialogue with the Government are also needed. Such a dialogue has to be regular; it has to be structured; it has to be held at troika, or local or even higher level, and must be extended to national and regional organisations, as was done between the EU and ECOWAS, as was just mentioned, as well as to representatives of civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the Electoral Commission, according to the observers, there were irregularities and fraud, but INEC in particular failed to act independently as it is required to do. It is clear, therefore, that INEC, tarnished as it is by serious doubts over its impartiality, cannot continue to be a beneficiary of EDF support. Issues concerning INEC’s independence, mandate, structure and leadership must therefore be addressed before any decision about the continuation of our support can be taken.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the Niger Delta, which has already been mentioned by some of you, the Human Rights Watch report entitled ‘Chop Fine’ on Rivers State is emblematic of a situation widespread in the Niger Delta, where large financial resources are made available, but very little reaches the people and even less the communities in remote areas of the Delta. People there have been deprived of their voices and land resources, and they are not given anything in return by the Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">The threats and challenges presented by this area are left unaddressed and will, sooner or later, have serious repercussions at national and regional level. The ambassadors of the EU Member States have twice submitted clear and simple recommendations. Before the financial resources allocated to the Niger Delta are increased, total transparency should be ensured and dialogue between all the stakeholders established.</p>
      <p sl="en">Articles 8 and 9 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement have also been mentioned. They contain all the ingredients needed to ensure the most effective dialogue not only with the Government but also with civil society and the regional African organisations, as has been said. I consider it absolutely paramount that more coherent, more regular and more systematic action by the EU as a group vis-à-vis Nigeria is the only possible way of addressing the questions highlighted by these elections. This should be a very strong thrust of our policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, we have to be careful not to push Nigeria into the hands of religious extremists, including Muslim extremists.</p>
      <p sl="en">China has been mentioned. When I was in China in January, I made it clear that we want to have a dialogue on Africa with China. It is not so easy to do, but it is very important and, therefore, it is important that Nigeria is being invited to the G8 Summit in order to give them these messages directly, because we have to tell Nigeria that we want our values and interests to be respected and it cannot only be a question of pure economic matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">I shall just repeat that the EIDHR provides an opportunity to work with civil society. It can work without the approval of the Government, but we normally have contact with the Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, it is also important to see what our financial funding means there. It is a mere 0.2% of the oil revenue and the total international aid to Nigeria. Therefore this makes the consequences of aid suspension negligible from a financial viewpoint and potentially counterproductive, as it would further impair political dialogue with the Government. But, on the whole, 25% of funding is promoting good governance. Therefore, we should use this part in particular in order to work with civil society, as I think we would all agree.</p>

      <p sl="fr">substitute author. – Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, the reports follow each other but are not alike, since we are at present going to deal with biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Minister, this week will have been marked by the desire shown by the European Parliament to fight against the loss of biodiversity. On Monday, the report by our fellow Member, Mr Amadou, and the report on Life+ were debated and, today, we are examining two oral questions tabled ahead of the next meeting of the Conference of the parties to the Convention on international trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna, the CITES. Our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, whose chairman I excuse for not being able to be here with us, questions the Member States’ negotiating method and asks the European Council what key objectives the Union will uphold during the fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the parties to the CITES Convention, which will be held, as you said, Madam President, in the Hague on 14 and 15 June 2007.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The CITES Convention is one of the oldest multilateral environmental protection instruments. It was adopted in 1973, in Washington, by States that were already anxious to go beyond the national regulatory frameworks. The aim was to preserve wild plants and animals from commercial overexploitation. The significance of this Convention compared with the other multilateral agreements on the environment is its great power of adaptation. It directly influences trade through supply, which it restricts. In very practical terms, it influences around 500 000 transactions – that is no small amount, 500 000 commercial transactions! – thereby restricting the overexploitation of biodiversity. With the coming on board of the various institutional partners, nearly 170 States, including our 27 Member States, of scientists and NGOs, the CITES Convention will have made it possible to prevent the removal of particularly endangered species and to save species such as the Siberian tiger, the blue whale and African elephants.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, the challenges facing the Convention are many. On the one hand, they are structural. The Convention struggles, in fact, to find funding to match its ambitions. It has to deal with the over-consumption of natural species, some of which are not always listed. On the other hand, the Convention must take account of new data, including, of course, climate change. It must incorporate the ineffectiveness of certain instruments, such as the action plan for forest law enforcement, governance and trade, or FLEGT, with which everyone in this House is familiar. It must review also the decisions that have had a negative impact on certain species: for example, during the twelfth Conference of the parties, the permits for the sale of ivory originating from Botswana, Namibia and South Africa resulted in almost 20 000 elephants being decimated, according to estimates.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As part of the fight against the loss of species, the European Union must at all costs speak with one voice during the conferences of the parties to the Convention. In this connection, I should like to point out, Minister, that the European Union often abstains when decisions are taken because our Member States do not manage to come to an agreement, with the result that 27 votes are lost, and 27 votes is not a negligible amount; it is even often a large amount.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, Minister, we ask that the Council take account of Parliament’s resolution, which reflects the interests of the European people and conveys that which our citizens want us to defend within the context of this CITES Convention. Firstly, because the resolution points out certain requirements to the negotiators. Thus, the precautionary principle must be applied with the same rigour as that imposed by the European Union in other international negotiations on the environment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Equally, the Union must demand transparency in the voting process and reject secret ballots, a practice that really exists, especially when it comes to listing species in annexes. In fact, the point is to modernise this slightly antiquated procedure, which no longer in any way meets the requirements of the citizens, who must be able to exercise their right to inspect the decisions that are taken on their behalf. We know that the NGOs criticise the EU Member States at every turn for not disclosing their votes and for voting in secret ballots on certain species. We consider this to be totally unacceptable and we call for transparency, because this Convention is special and because the Member States, as we know, have specific interests where some subjects are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The questions included in the agenda of the Conference must be submitted to the European Parliament. We do not expect anything less. Each time a Conference of the parties to the CITES Convention is announced, we put the same questions to the Council: we do not understand why we have not been consulted earlier, so that we know what positions the Council plans to uphold during the Conference.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to ask the Commission and the Council to involve our parliamentary delegation in the work of the Conferences so that we are not forced, as we usually are, to skulk around the corridors in the hope of gleaning some information from them, and that is when the Council and the Commission see fit to invite us! I therefore thank you for involving the European Parliament delegation in the work done on the Convention.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, including those who have spoken on behalf of your colleague Mr Ouzký, I would like to make a statement on behalf of the presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">As at previous meetings of the conference of the contracting parties to the Washington convention on the protection of species, the EU Member States will, together, put forward the position agreed by the Community. The Council will shortly set down this position on the basis of the latest proposal from the Commission, and will, of course, inform Parliament of the position thus arrived at.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Community’s position will incorporate three overarching goals:</p>
      <p sl="de">One is that the Convention shall become as efficient as possible, and the first thing to be done with this end in mind will be to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens; practicable and working solutions to problems of implementation need to be found, and it needs to be ensured that the contracting parties’ resources are targeted where there is a real need for preservation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Greater synergies must be established between the Convention on the Protection of Species and other instruments and processes relating to biological diversity; in particular, the resolutions of the fourteenth conference should help to bring about, by 2010, a marked deceleration of the worldwide loss of biological diversity, and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore, the European Union also wants to ensure at the conference that the planned amendments to the annexes to the Washington Convention actually do improve the preservation of the species in question, and it will, in this respect, be particularly important to ensure that monitoring is carried out, for it is only in this way that poaching and illegal trading can be curbed and the sustainability of the international trade in species guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Elephants and whales are again the individual species on which this conference focuses. To summarise, the Community is not prepared to give its consent to a resumption of commercial trading in ivory until such time as appropriate mechanisms are in place to prevent the more widespread illegal killing of elephants, and it thus calls on all range states of elephants to engage in constructive dialogue and to cooperate in maintaining stocks of elephants and in their sustainable management.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since it is the International Whaling Commission that is primarily responsible for whale issues, no new resolutions should be framed in the course of our negotiations that would alter the current preservation status of whales under the Convention, and it follows that a review of whale stocks with a view to the possible downgrading of their preservation status under CITES should be considered only after mechanisms for checks on their management have been introduced and considered suitable by the International Whaling Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to conclude by expressing my thanks to the author of the question and to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their interest in this important issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the 14th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in the Hague is indeed the first CITES conference to be held in the European Union since CITES was put in place in 1973. Therefore I think it will provide a very good opportunity to highlight our strong commitment to the implementation of this Convention and to raise political and public awareness.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe it will be the first time that a ministerial conference will address key issues regarding the future of the Convention. Therefore the following key strategic objectives for the Conference of the Parties known as COP 14 have been defined. The COP should reconfirm the important contribution that CITES made, or can make, to reaching the 2010 target of significantly reducing the rate of biodiversity loss. The Community fully supports the contribution of CITES to this global target by regulating international trade in wildlife and wildlife products in order to ensure that this is sustainable. The new strategic vision for CITES for 2008 to 2013 will determine how CITES can ensure that conservation, sustainable use and poverty reduction can also be mutually supportive and are therefore crucial for the continued importance and relevance of CITES.</p>
      <p sl="en">The draft strategic vision also advocates that CITES should pay greater attention to the international trade in commercially exploited timber and fish species. Given the strain on natural resources and continued over-exploitation, the Community believes that CITES could focus more on ensuring sustainable trade in such species. We the Community have submitted proposals for listing several marine and timber species on CITES, so I think this will be a very important discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a key issue for CITES COP 14 will of course be elephant ivory. Diverging proposals are on the table from Elephant Range States in Africa. We continue to hold the view that commercial trade in government-owned ivory stocks should not be resumed until we are satisfied that all mechanisms are in place to ensure that trade will not result in the increased illegal killing of elephants. These mechanisms are currently being put in place and should hopefully be operational before we take a final position on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, yesterday the newspapers had some good news. It was about the hatching of some rare Egyptian tortoise eggs. The problem was, they were hatched in Rome. They should not have been in Rome. They should not have been smuggled from Libya to Rome along with 275 other rare tortoises, because they are in the highest protection category under the CITES Convention. Even worse, this is happening inside our European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know that the European Union is one of the world’s largest and most diverse importers and markets for wildlife products, with demands for pets, for fashion products, ornaments and medicines. That is why Europe has a particular responsibility to do something about it. In my country, some 570 illegal wildlife items are seized every day by Her Majesty’s Customs. One wonders how many are not detected.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know that the illegal trade in wildlife is the second biggest direct threat to species after habitat destruction. We know that a quarter of the trade is illegal. We know that billions of euros annually are made out of this, third only to the trafficking in drugs and arms.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know, of course, that we have to take account of the local populations and their traditions and needs, and that is in this resolution. We know there are differences of views between NGOs and between scientists, but this motion for a resolution, I believe, is a balanced one.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, I very much welcome what the Minister and the Commissioner said about the elephant, so will you please support the resolution from Kenya and Mali for a 20-year moratorium on the ivory trade.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, President of the Council, Commissioner, as has already been stated, this CITES Conference will be the first to be held in Europe, and this offers an opportunity to bring the protection of wild animals and plants to the attention of the public at large, more so than before.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Even though CITES is one of the most effective and concrete instruments to protect the international environment, the decline in biodiversity is alarming. For example, a large number of fish species are in a bad way due to overexploitation, among other causes. Demand for fish is enormous and still rising. This has the depressing consequence that even at this stage, many deep-sea fish species are critically endangered, and that in many developing countries, the sea has also been emptied by Europe, or by European boats at any rate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately, the same is true to some extent of tropical forests. Demand for tropical wood, despite all campaigns, remains high. Added to that is the fact that demand for agricultural land is also rising due to the need for food and increasing demand for biofuels, and it is age-old forests that pay the price for this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe’s initiative to include a large number of fish species on the list of protected species deserves our unqualified support, as does the initiative to include a number of tree species on the list. We should, however, ask ourselves how we can improve on things. Pressure on nature is rising worldwide. Increased prosperity goes some way to explaining this, while in a number of developing countries, it is poverty that is the motive.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We should, therefore, take a different course and realise that the protection of nature also creates prosperity and jobs. We must take steps to guarantee that trade is truly sustainable and that the illegal trade is actually tackled and discontinued.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, there is a strong case for supporting the proposal for a 20-year moratorium on the ivory trade. Contrary to what some southern African range States say – that they have too many elephants – estimates by the African Elephant Status Report put the population at between 10 and 20 % of what it was in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
      <p sl="de">The major cause of the decline is the ivory trade. Ivory prices increased more than seven times over in China and Japan in the late 1990s. A 20-year moratorium will send a clear signal that international trade is banned, it would suppress demand, lower prices and remove incentives for buying and stockpiling ivory.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, could you be more precise as regards to what extent the Commission intends to take into consideration the pro-moratorium position expressed by the delegation of Western and Central African States who visited us at the European Parliament?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like first of all to thank Mr Gloser and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for what I was almost tempted to call their reassuring words. However, I received no answer regarding the transparency of votes: I believe that it is crucial for us to know who votes for what within the European Union during this CITES conference.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to begin by also expressing my satisfaction with the proposal made by Germany to include two species of shark – the dogfish and the mackeral shark – in Annex II to the CITES, a proposal that has also been endorsed by many associations working to protect these species. In our view, this is a proposal that must gain full support because these two species, which are included in the IUCN Red Book of endangered species, require special attention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, above and beyond the specific case of these species, we should also give greater consideration to the status of the other species of shark in the waters bordering the countries of the EU, in the Mediterranean, for example, so that, on this issue, the European Union is affected as much as the neighbourhood policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In general, it must be recognised that the Mediterranean is an endangered sea: the indiscriminate withdrawal of fishery stocks over the last few decades, with the use of drift nets in particular, has resulted in a significant depletion of species.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The case of bluefin tuna is one such example, which has been highly publicised recently by Greenpeace. Yet, what do we know, for example, about the sharks in the Mediterranean? What we know overall about sharks is that, throughout the world, they are totally endangered, overfished and that they are suffering from the deteriorating marine balance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That being said, does the European Union have any information or studies enabling it to assess the situation of the sharks in the Mediterranean? That is the question. If it does not have these, can it envisage serious studies being carried out so that, in the long term, it will be in a position to make concrete proposals, on the CITES in particular?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, we also think it crucial that red coral, which is also overfished in the Mediterranean, be included in Annex II to the CITES.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the CITES Conference that is to be held in The Hague next month is of huge importance if we want to take measures against the international trade in endangered animal and plant species. It is for that reason that I wholeheartedly support the resolution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is, however, one issue that I should like to single out and that came up several times this afternoon, namely that of the elephants in Botswana and Namibia. Three quarters of the 400 000 elephants in Africa live in this region, thus resulting in inevitable risks for the people and the environment, and being detrimental to biodiversity. This is why these countries have tabled their own proposals in order to maintain the elephant population and to reduce the risks.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The resolution, unfortunately, rejects these proposals. Whilst it is understandable that people are keen to stop the trade in elephant products, a view which I share, it is equally important to face up to the situation in Botswana and Namibia, that boasts such an enormous expansion in the number of elephants. We must give this matter some more thought. After all, we cannot afford to reject solutions without replacing them with alternatives.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mrs Isler Béguin has, in fact, already presented the substance of this oral question, which has particularly to do with what the Council is aiming to achieve through the negotiations, but also with the methods of negotiation and the way in which this House’s delegation is involved in the work on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="de">Like many other Members, I would like to return to the subject of the trade in ivory, which the Convention has prohibited since 1989, while allowing since 1997 the sale of individual items of stock. Understandable though it is that the countries in which the trade goes on have an interest in this, the problem is that it has not so far been possible to distinguish between legal and illegal ivory, and hence there is a great danger that the legal trade will contribute to a revival of poaching.</p>
      <p sl="de">A greater incidence of poaching putting those engaged in the protection of wildlife and the natural protection authorities under increasing pressure, and effective protection of pachyderms, which are important in terms of many countries’ incomes from tourism, makes increasing demands on resources that are generally scarce; the only long-term protection for ivory is an absolute ban on the trade in it, for it is estimated that some 20 000 elephants a year are killed in Africa for their tusks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our resolution, then, endorses the proposal made by Kenya and Mali, and their demand for a 20-year moratorium on any kind of trade in ivory. We hope that the Commission and the Member States will, in the course of the negotiations, give this demand their backing.</p>

      <p sl="it">I have called for the deletion of the seventh indent of Article 10 in the proposal for a resolution on the CITES Convention. There is no scientific justification for transferring coral to Appendix II, since a panel of highly-respected experts working for the FAO has stated that the requirements for including the species in the genus corallium in the CITES Appendix II are not met – and this is a direct quote.</p>
      <p sl="it">Coral can be properly preserved through a system of rotating the protected areas between producer countries.

      <p sl="unknown">The following questions are addressed to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Question No 1 by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (H-0339/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Political crisis in Turkey and prospects of accession</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the last few days, in connection with the appointment of the President of the Republic, Turkey has fallen into a deep political crisis which gives rise to serious doubts about the functioning of its democratic institutions. The country's Constitutional Court has annulled the first round of the elections, a decision vigorously contested by the government. The Prime Minister has stated that the parliamentary system has been brought to a halt and he is calling for early elections, while the General Army Staff has issued a warning that it will intervene to prevent the election of the Islamist, Abdullah Gül, to the office of President.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What are the Council's views on this situation in a candidate country for accession to the EU? Does it share the opinion of the Commissioner responsible for enlargement, Mr Olli Rehn, that the armed forces should respect the independent role of the democratic process, that the EU is based on the principles of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and the sovereignty of political forces vis-à-vis the military, and his insistence that any country seeking accession to the EU must respect those principles, which are the key elements of the Copenhagen criteria? What impact does it believe such interventions by the military could have on the country's accession procedure? Does the Council have direct contacts with leading political figures in Turkey and what is their reaction?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, we are following developments in Turkey with close attention, and I would also like to remind the House of the Presidency’s statement on 28 April of this year, in which we emphasised the need for the presidential elections to be conducted in line with the principles of democracy and the rule of law laid down in the constitution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Generally speaking, it is worthy of note that negotiations were commenced with Turkey in 2005 on the basis that Turkey would meet sufficiently the political criteria laid down by the 1993 European Council in Copenhagen, on which membership of the EU is conditional, and one of which is that a country should demonstrate institutional stability as a guarantee for democratic order and the rule of law, for the safeguarding of human rights and for respect for, and the protection of, minorities. Over and above these, and in accordance with the framework for negotiations adopted by the Council in October 2005, the European Union expects Turkey to press on with its reform process and work towards making further improvements as regards respect for the principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law, together with that for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including European court rulings on the subject.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Council noted on 11 September 2006 that further considerable efforts would be needed in order to develop free expression of opinion, freedom of religion, the rights of women, minorities and trades unions, together with civilian control over the armed forces. These issues are discussed on a regular basis as part of the political dialogue with Turkey, and, since the Council expects the principles I have mentioned of the rule of law and the civilian control of the armed forces to be fully complied with in the current situation, the presidency will continue to keep a watchful eye on the progress of the Turkish elections.</p>

The Turks are quite well aware of that, and the Presidency does not at the present time have occasion to cancel the forthcoming talks or accession conferences with them.</p>
      <p sl="de">In response to the second comment, I would like to say that we are not just observing; how, after all, is the European Union, having laid down the framework, supposed to remind Turkey of the undertakings it has made and of the criteria with which it must comply if not in dialogue? While the present government does indeed bear ultimate responsibility for the country, it has not changed the criteria; it is rather the case that other groups in the country have threatened to intervene if the result that emerges is not to their liking. One has to distinguish precisely who is responsible for the country, and, as we see it, that is still its democratically elected government.</p>

      <p sl="de">I would refer the honourable Member to the explanations given to him in response to an oral question in the April question session, and would like to reiterate that the Presidency attaches great importance to the constant improvement of integrated border control at the external borders of the European Union and, in particular, to the reinforcement of the maritime external borders to the south.</p>
      <p sl="de">Further to this, the Council has already stressed, in its conclusions on the reinforcement of the southern sea frontier on 5 and 6 October 2006, that Frontex has to be built up by means of additional personnel and increased budgetary resources. In order to improve Frontex’ immediate response capability in emergency situations, the Commission put forward, in 2006, a proposal for the formation of rapid reaction border intervention teams.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Council has had fruitful discussions with your House on this proposal, and your House voted on the text of the proposal on 26 April this year, so that the Council can adopt it at first reading. The Presidency’s ambition is that the text should be able to be adopted by the Council over the next few weeks, so that the instrument can be applied over the coming summer period.</p>
      <p sl="de">In accordance with its working programme for 2007, Frontex will, as well as completing the European Patrol Network, be carrying out a number of joint operations on the maritime borders, the number and location of which will be determined by its management board.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, the Council wishes to stress that the Commission, in accordance with the Hague Programme, which the European Council adopted on 4 November 2004, will, before the end of this year, be submitting an evaluation report on the agency.</p>

      <p sl="es">Our concern is that that system should be permanent and I hope that, by means of the measures announced by the President-in-Office of the Council, that system will really be permanent, since each day or week without it may mean the deaths of hundreds of people in the waters of the Atlantic.</p>

I said back in April, in response to a question, that the protection of the external border is in the first instance a task for the Member State in question, while assistance may be sought from Frontex in a particular situation, in which case immediate response teams can also be formed. This all depends on the interaction between the relevant Member States and the Frontex agency itself.</p>

Yesterday 24 people were saved at sea and one person remained unaccounted for after a boat capsized. Also yesterday, another boat with 53 people on board went missing.

I can tell you that not a week goes by without a boat arriving, running aground, and requesting assistance, during its voyage to the Canaries. These poor souls must be accommodated, and, as may sometimes be the case, they must be accommodated in the Mediterranean waters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should therefore like to know what resources the European Union – this European Union that uses up so many resources on protecting its borders – is making available to neighbouring countries, that is to say, to Mauritania, which is a transit country – these countries are not migrant countries, but merely transit countries and host countries – and what resources the European Union is putting in place to help these countries to manage this issue.</p>

      <p sl="de">Since I have also mentioned the numerous initiatives taken by the European Union, including the African Union/European Union Summit in Tripoli, it would be misguided to consider only Frontex and its role in combating the problem. The issue is, after all, just how we can pursue our strategy together with the African countries. We have already discussed with Nigeria how good governance can help keep people in their own countries, while at the same time beginning to enjoy prospects in such areas as education, training, schools, health and job creation where they live. That is the most important thing. I hope that this issue will be taken up at the European Union/African Union summit meeting.</p>
      <p sl="de">Terrible things often happen at sea, but, in the past, where it was aware that people-smugglers were operating, the European Union has helped to supply the boat people, at short notice, with lunch parcels, and, while it has to be said that these were not enough to ensure their safe arrival, they did receive support.</p>
      <p sl="de">We can agree, then, that it is the Member States that are responsible for the defence of the external borders, while Frontex can be called on to act in a supporting role by – for example – monitoring a stretch of the sea or of a land frontier.</p>

      <p sl="de">I am sure that Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou is aware that we would all like to have the opportunity or the freedom to travel in ways other than we are, but, measures have been taken in the European Union in the form of the Regulation that the Commission adopted in October 2006, in order that a certain standard of safety should be guaranteed. The adoption of this regulation is a matter for the Commission, which has been supported in this by the Civil Aviation Safety Committee, which is composed of representatives from the Member States and was acting in accordance with its own rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since the Commission has undertaken to have these measures reviewed six months following their adoption, questions pertaining to this regulation should be addressed directly to the Commission, which is responsible for such a review.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would remind the honourable Member and the House that the Council’s functions as regards air safety is limited to the examination of legislative proposals on the framework conditions for the relevant safety measures, further to which the Council and your House are currently discussing the Commission’s proposal for a Regulation of the Council and Parliament to lay down common rules for safety in civil aviation, which it is intended should replace the Regulation currently in force.</p>

None of this was done on the spur of the moment, and there were concrete reasons why security under these conditions had to be guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is certainly important that the persons involved be asked just what all this achieved. It is unfortunate that there are at present no other mechanisms for examining things in a more transparent manner and perhaps as simply as was formerly the case, but none of the members of the public who are happy to avail themselves of their freedom of movement and their freedom to travel would understand persons responsible for their safety and freedom not themselves guaranteeing the highest possible standard of security. If new technical developments make it possible to do this in new ways without such hindrances, then all parties will surely be happy to accept them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Further to the points that you have made, despite all the information provided as to all the things that may no longer be taken through the checkpoints, there are still far too many members of the public taking their own bottles of mineral water and fruit juice or other items with them.

      <p sl="de">As we have learned from events in the United Kingdom, it may well be enough to exploit one, two or three of such loopholes. It is right and proper that, after a given time, measures be reviewed in order to ascertain whether or not they have achieved their purpose.

I am sure that you will understand that the Commission and the Council, when enacting trade protection measures, constantly consider the facts and the various interests involved – for example those of producers, users, importers and consumers – and try to keep them in balance in order to make it possible for a suitable level of protection to be guaranteed to the branch of industry in question. What that means is that action will be taken only to such an extent as will make it possible for the Community sector in question to be protected against unfair practices in third countries, and only for such a length of time as is in the interests of the Community.</p>

      <p sl="en">Well that was a most diplomatically crafted answer, but perhaps I could try again in a slightly different context. I see announced in the paper today that a certain food processing company is now asking for protection against imports of sweetcorn from Thailand. Is the Council – not the Commission – concerned at the growing tide of protectionism coming up from fellow Member States and is the Council under your Presidency going to provide any leadership to combat this?</p>

      <p sl="de">I can assure you that my answer to you was not diplomatic in character, but had to do with various things that have to be considered not by the Presidency alone, but by the Member States together, since various interests – the interests of what are now 27 Member States – are affected.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also made it clear that there are various users or consumers, together with importers, manufacturers and competitors, to consider. I do believe that it is right in principle that we have named October 2007 as the target date for reviewing whether the present protection, as it is laid down, is still appropriate in terms of time or whether there has to be a response on the part of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not familiar with the case to which you refer, but I do believe that it is the Commission’s practice to consider the various areas before possibly suspending the protection mechanism. The question that arises for me and for the Presidency, not least from the discussions we have had is that, if all these things had not had an influence on our process of deliberation, it is to be expected that there would be anger directed at the European Union from certain Member States, because it would have been seen as not keeping the different interests in balance.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 9 by Marie Anne Isler Béguin (H-0294/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Agreement on facilitation of the visa system for nationals of the Russian Federation</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The European Union recently facilitated the visa system for nationals of the Russian Federation on the basis of the agreement reached at the St. Petersburg summit in 2003.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This means that residents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two secessionist regions of Georgia not recognised by the international community, will be able to benefit from this new visa system since they all hold Russian passports.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">No such agreement exists with Georgia, making Russian nationality appear more advantageous for people in those two separatist regions and further distancing them from the other parts of Georgia.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Given that the European Union is pursuing a peaceful settlement to the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and working for their rapprochement with Georgia, what will it do to remedy this situation? Are there any plans to enter into negotiations in the near future on a similar agreement with Georgia in order to grant the peoples of the Southern Caucasus the same rights?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-358" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Günter Gloser" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="de">The intention is that the agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation on the facilitation of the visa system should enter into force with effect from 1 June 2007, and this, too, was the subject of a debate here in this House a few weeks ago. The object of this agreement is to make it easier to issue visas for a planned stay of no more than 90 days in duration for nationals of the Russian Federation travelling to EU Member States, or for citizens of the European Union travelling to the Russian Federation.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to this agreement, a national of the Russian Federation is a person possessing Russian Federation nationality or having acquired it in accordance with Russia’s own regulations. The consequence of that is that, in accordance with the law as it currently stands, the agreement is applicable to all Russian citizens irrespective of the country in which they live.</p>
      <p sl="de">No initiatives have been taken to mandate the Commission to commence negotiations on a similar agreement with Georgia, for provision is already made in the EU-Georgia action plan and within the European Neighbourhood Policy for the initiation of a dialogue on the transit of persons, with specific reference to issues of return and the visa problem.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Minister, you have given me exactly the same answer that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner gave me three times, but you are not in fact answering the question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The question concerns the facilitation of the visa system for persons residing on Georgian territory, in Abkhazia or South Ossetia, and to whom Russia has kindly offered nationality by issuing them with Russian passports – even though these people are Georgian – to the extent that the people of Georgia are subject to a system of double standards.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My question is this: did you weigh up the fact that, when the visa system was facilitated for Russian citizens, those persons, to whom Russia has granted nationality, with passports in support of this, and who, residing on Georgian territory, are Georgians from Abkhazia or South Ossetia, were going to benefit from the facilitation of the visa system, while the people of Georgia themselves would not benefit from it?</p>

Listening to your question, though, I alighted on the political issue of how one can – in view of the frozen conflicts in these regions – make concessionary arrangements for the citizens in, for example, Georgia or – as Mr Paleckis has just pointed out – in other countries. These issues are the subjects of negotiations in the context of the specific relationships, and with Georgia, for example, within the framework of the neighbourhood policy. It is quite clear to me that the special relationship between the EU and Ukraine or Belarus makes it necessary for us, in these specific cases, to keep on trying to bring about such agreements in accordance with the provisions of the EU and with the Schengen regime.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the verification of the credentials of Mr Beniamino Donnici (A6-0198/2007).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-366" speaker_id="4562" name="Giuseppe Gargani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention in this Chamber the work carried out in committee, which has thoroughly discussed the credentials of Mr Donnici, resulting in a large majority in favour of the report.</p>
      <p sl="it">I defend the committee, of which I have the great honour to be chairman, and I would like to answer those making petty insinuations to the effect that the committee has not been calm or objective – insinuations that clearly do nothing to honour this Parliament, given that the committee contains many jurists. We have people and jurists such as Mr Lehne, Mr Medina, Mrs Wallis and Mrs Frassoni, to mention just the coordinators, and also very many other prominent figures throughout the committee. Our discussions were always at a high level, and were conducted exhaustively and with great sincerity. We always focused primarily on the role of this Parliament, which is a giant in terms of many things that it does and its role in Europe, but a dwarf on some occasions when you want to force it into a procedural corner.</p>
      <p sl="it">The issue we were discussing comes within this major issue: the facts are known, the withdrawal by Mr Occhetto infringes the European Act, and we cannot give Mr Donnici a positive verdict.</p>
      <p sl="it">The rules governing the European election procedure fall within the Community’s jurisdiction and therefore the reference to national provisions laid down in the 1976 European Act is of a solely supplementary character. The national provisions must, however, conform to the fundamental principals of the Community legal system, its primary rules and the spirit of the wording of the 1976 Act. For these reasons, the relevant legislative and administrative national authorities, as well as the jurisdictional authorities, may not omit to take account of the Community legal framework on election issues.</p>
      <p sl="it">The admissibility of the withdrawal by Mr Occhetto must be assessed firstly on the basis of Article 4 of the 1976 Act, pursuant to which Members of Parliament may not be bound by instructions and may not receive a binding mandate, and the freedom and independence of parliamentary representatives constitutes a fundamental cornerstone of the freedom of citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is laid down in the 1976 Act, but the new Statute for Members of the European Parliament, which I now quote, even though it enters into force for the next parliamentary term, is, in the current state of the Community legal system, a legislative act of primary law, adopted by the European Parliament with the approval of the Council and published in the Official Journal. It is perfectly obvious that the withdrawal from election made by Mr Occhetto is the result of an expression of will that has been affected and vitiated by an agreement made prior to the proclamation of those elected in the 2004 European elections, that this agreement was entered into with the other member of the Società civile Di Pietro-Occhetto list, and that this withdrawal must be considered incompatible with the letter and spirit of the Act of 1976, and specifically with Article 6. It could not under any circumstances be validly revoked, as it was revoked. In the grounds for the judgment holding the opposite to be true, the Italian Council of State – I want to confirm this in this Chamber, as an Italian – did not mention or take into account in any way the aforementioned principles of Community law, thereby disregarding not only the spirit and the letter of the Act but also Article 4 and Article 6 of the text.</p>
      <p sl="it">Pursuant to settled case law by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the infringement of Community law by the authorities of a Member State, even when committed by a legal body of the highest level, through a final judgment, does not prevent the Court of Justice from holding that the supreme national court is in breach of Community law as mentioned above. This does not, however, constitute a waiver of the responsibility of the State – in this case, Italy – to which the said court belongs, as has been established. I believe that all this clearly demonstrates the situation in which we find ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to quickly explain two things that are part of Italian law. The act of withdrawal may validly have existing rights as its object, and in such a case the withdrawal made by Mr Occhetto with regard to Mr Chiesa is, because of its explanation, fully valid and effective. The withdrawal also holds valid for future rights, but naturally the withdrawal may certainly be revoked before the event ends, before the withdrawing party finds himself in the actual circumstance of being able to withdraw.</p>
      <p sl="it">The withdrawal expressed by Mr Occhetto following the proclamation of the electoral results did not alter the classification of the candidates on the Di Pietro-Occhetto list. The final argument, Mr President, is that we must recognise as a basic principle of law the fact that withdrawal can only take effect at the moment in which the necessary prerequisites exist for the right to be realised.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this very reason, in the decision of 3 July 2006 that is alleged to contradict what we have done – in fact because of that decision by the Committee on Legal Affairs – we have confirmed the election of Mr Occhetto, because at the time the proclamation was in conformity with the European Act, in that we recognised his withdrawal to be invalid, improper and null and void. The exceptions with regard to Mr Donnici were then irrelevant. It is because of this that there is no contradiction.</p>
      <p sl="it">We took this decision last year, and today we can confirm that decision because it is consistent, thoroughly reflected on by a Committee on Legal Affairs that naturally has no partisan interest, but has every interest in promoting and guaranteeing the autonomy of this Parliament.</p>

    <intervention id="3-367" speaker_id="1337" name="Manuel Medina Ortega" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I believe that we are at an important moment in the history of this Parliament. The rapporteur, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Gargani, has explained the legal reasoning, with which we agree. My group has tabled a series of amendments aimed at enhancing this kind of legal reasoning.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should look at the issue from a rather broader perspective, however. The European Parliament – the Committee on Legal Affairs – has always recognised the decisions of the national authorities with regard to the appointment of an MEP, and has also recognised electoral dispute procedures.</p>
      <p sl="es">What is not acceptable is for the Italian judiciary, practically three years after the last elections, a year after Mr Occhetto was accepted as a Member of this Parliament, to suddenly tell us that that appointment was not valid.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Gargani has explained the reasons from a legal point of view, but there is a fundamental political aspect: Parliament is made up of Members appointed in accordance with national law, by means of decisions by national authorities: administrative, electoral or judicial.</p>
      <p sl="es">Once we are in this Parliament, however, Parliament constitutes a body in its own right, with its own personality, with the right to defend itself. I believe that the Occhetto case is going to set a great parliamentary precedent. From this point onwards, the national administrative or judicial authorities will know that Parliament has the power, at a given moment, to declare that a national decision does not comply with the law, that it has been arbitrary.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament has the right and the duty to protect its Members. If we do not do so, Mr President, we shall be exposed to a situation in which, as a result of an arbitrary decision by a national authority or national court, you or any other Member of this Parliament can have their status as MEP taken away. It is essential to our parliamentary work that Members of Parliament should feel secure when carrying out their work.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that Mr Gargani has done a great job as chairman – we have discussed many issues over many years – and in this case we have an agreement that is accepted by all of the parties, which does not reflect any party-political interest, but which responds to the need to defend the very status of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Parliament, the body that represents the people of Europe, is established as a body in its own right and makes its own decisions. It is not like the Council, which is subject to the vicissitudes of national politics. We MEPs have a mandate, a fixed-term mandate that cannot be interrupted by means of an arbitrary national decision.</p>
      <p sl="es">I shall therefore say once again that the Occhetto decision will be an historic decision in the history of Parliament, in the history of the affirmation of the personality of Parliament and of the rights of MEPs.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-368" speaker_id="4470" name="Luigi Cocilovo" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one thing with which I agree, it is that there is a risk that the decision by this Parliament may mark a genuinely historic step, in that it will compromise issues, problems, principles and rules that go far beyond this specific event. This Parliament has never cast doubt upon the principle and rule laid down by the provisions of the Treaty on the national jurisdiction to settle disputes relating to electoral procedure and, thus, to proclaim those elected, with regard to whom Parliament then proceeds to carry out the so-called ‘verification of credentials’ – in other words, verification of electoral offices.</p>
      <p sl="it">To confirm what I am saying, instead of commenting on it I would like to quote word for word the content of Parliament’s decision, adopted on 14 December 2004 by this plenary, validating the mandate of all of us who were elected in those European elections. The mandate was declared valid, and I quote exactly ‘ … subject to any decisions by the competent authorities of Member States in which the election results have been disputed’. This plenary confirmed a rule that is well-known to all!</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to add that in support of its decision the Committee on Legal Affairs refers to several articles both from the European Election Act and from the Rules of Procedure, referring to Parliament’s jurisdiction to intervene in the event of resignations. We are not talking about any resignations! The issue on which the Italian courts handed down a judgment relates to the dispute or the resolution of the dispute regarding the election, once Mr Di Pietro had resigned as a Member of this Parliament, his replacement being Mr Occhetto or Mr Donnici. The dispute was resolved by means of a provisional judgment, subject to appeal, which resulted in the proclamation of Mr Occhetto as the successful candidate; then came the judgment by the Italian Council of State – the Electoral Office, it is the same thing, Mr Gargani, it is not important – then came the judgment on the dispute, the final judgment by the Council of State, which proclaimed Mr Donnici as the successful candidate. Let us not discuss the resignations by Mr Occhetto, their compatibility with the wording, with the letter or with the mandate – let us simply discuss the prerogative and the jurisdiction of the national authorities to proclaim a Member, whose electoral credentials are then verified.</p>
      <p sl="it">The consequences of the vote that we are about to make would involve a serious institutional conflict, breach of the provisions of the Treaty, and a possible empty seat, because in any case it would be for the national authorities to proclaim the person elected to replace the person whose mandate was not validated.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will end by expressing my full appreciation for the members of the committee. Mr Gargani, nobody is casting doubt on the competence of the members; on the contrary, you have all my admiration, because the real skill of a jurist can be seen not when he is defending just causes, but when he is defending lost causes. I have every appreciation and respect for the way in which you have succeeded in obtaining this result.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all respect to the multitude of authoritative jurists with which the Committee on Legal Affairs is swarming, more modestly, I believe that if this Chamber were to approve the Gargani report tomorrow, the European Parliament would be committing a very serious and unprecedented act. It would be an unheard-of abuse of a Member who would see himself illegitimately deprived of his parliamentary mandate, and an unprecedented and unique breach of the treaties which, on electoral matters, clearly recognise the pre-eminence of the laws, procedures and authority of the Member States. This would be a serious conflict with a Member State, which would be deprived of a Member recognised as such by the laws and the legal authority of that country.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs has usurped powers that do not belong to it. I do not side with either of the two contenders. I am politically indifferent because they are both from the centre left; I understand Mr Occhetto’s personal problem, for which I have empathy in purely human terms. What is at stake here, though, is the law, the correct composition of the European Parliament and the credibility of the highest Community institution. Justice, and only justice, must therefore be done, and any hint of politics and petty political party calculations must be left aside. What sort of trust can the citizens place in a European Parliament that distorts its own composition by excluding a Member who is eminently qualified to be a part of it?</p>
      <p sl="it">Let us look at the facts: the legal authority proclaimed Mr Donnici as the successful candidate, in an unappealable judgment. The Italian State notified the European Parliament of his election. The committee was charged with verifying Mr Donnici’s credentials. It was supposed to verify the offices he held and any incompatibility in them. It is of course true that it could examine appeals by third parties and therefore it legitimately examined the challenges put forward by Mr Occhetto. What it could not do was to declare null and void an act delivered before a public official of a Member State. This is a legal act that may be carried out solely by the legal authority of the Member State that has dealt with the matter and that has handed down an irrevocable and unappealable judgment.</p>

      <p sl="it">The main or crucial point of the decisions taken is right and, above all, it avoids a precedent being set, namely the recognition of acts or initiatives that restrict the choices of candidates or of those who are about to become MEPs.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is true that this is a first, and probably also sets a precedent, but this precedent and this first are fair and guarantee the prerogatives of the European Parliament. The decisions that we are taking are linked to a function and to a prerogative that is granted to us, giving us the right to express ourselves, to accept, to assess or to reject credentials and acts that are put before us.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Adam Gierek, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on putting knowledge into practice: A broad-based innovation strategy for Europe [2006/2274(INI)] (A6-0159/2007).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-376" speaker_id="28379" name="Adam Gierek" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, The aim of this document is to implement the Lisbon Strategy in real terms and to lay the foundations for a European innovation policy. The aim is to apply to the implementation of innovation policy instruments which will rationalise research, the flow of knowledge into the economy and the implementation of innovative solutions in business and social practice.</p>
      <p sl="pl">First of all, let us ask ourselves the question: what is innovation? Defining the term is essential, as a great deal of funding is allocated to innovation in current regional development programmes. It should be understood as meaning any innovative solutions to existing problems that shape the human environment, in other words, the creation of material and intellectual products and their use, including in the field of service provision. The aim of innovation is to continually rationalise how products are made and used, and how services are provided. It is associated with the efficient use of energy and materials, as well as of working time and protecting the workplace and the environment. It therefore relates to anything that improves the quality of human life.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Of course, we need to make sure that any artificial innovations, such as known products re-introduced to the market under a different name, are excluded. This, unfortunately, is a common ploy which is more often than not preceded by deceptive advertising.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The broad formulation of the issues facing innovation, which we are dealing with here, will make it possible to transplant known innovative solutions from one area to another where they have not yet been implemented, in accordance with the above definition. In such cases, the criteria of local innovation should, it seems, be defined by local authorities with the help of experts. And these tasks need proper funding.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Innovation is stimulated above all by a properly functioning European market for goods and commercial services incorporating all four freedoms; an appropriate innovative approach and education, but above all a structure, as educational courses are currently turning out graduates with little innovative potential; better use in practice of the huge intellectual resources of research establishments, especially in the new EU Member States; more effective use of tax concessions allowing, for instance, the establishment of innovation funds, as well as credit guarantees, public procurement and public-private partnerships. Innovation also stimulates the synergy effect thanks to the creation of uniform Community norms and standards. And ultimately the proper regulation of intellectual property stimulates innovation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the broader sense of the term, innovation covers three groups of innovative solutions. The first group covers rationalisation in all areas, including administration, education, tourism, business and many other areas where processes can be simplified and streamlined, but in ways which would not be considered an invention. Such innovation tends to require a great deal of practical knowledge.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second group relates to innovation based on inventions whose characteristic feature is the fact that they can be patented, or could constitute the basis for industrial or utility models. Innovation of this kind requires a large amount of theoretical and practical knowledge, much of which has been accumulated in patent offices and similar establishments.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The third group relates to innovative research into new, strategic designs, systems and technologies conducted on a broad scale at the level of European or national research programmes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fundamental innovative research, and particularly applied research, leads to the creation of pioneering markets and new patents. The proper development of the second and third category of innovation require a standard Community strategy for patents and licences, and the appointment of a centre of innovation in the form of the European Technology Institute.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The present systems of patents, of which there are as many in the European Union as there are Member States, are too costly, and the procedures are too slow. The lack of a functional, cost-effective and efficient European patenting system does not encourage innovation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The current patent policy in the European Union benefits the large corporations, which impose conditions on competition benefiting themselves by using patent protection. It does not favour small and medium-sized enterprises, which could be the main drivers of innovation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In summary, I would like to say that innovation in the economy and public life depends both on properly functioning pure market mechanisms, and EU and national regulation, and this depends on how projects are supported from budget funds.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Our task is to create a European innovation area by having a comprehensive and suitable education, fiscal, research, patenting and information policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">To conclude, I would like to express my great thanks for the fruitful collaboration of my colleagues, the vice-rapporteur Mrs Toia and Messrs Kubaciek, Hammerstein, Randsorf and also Mr Janowski.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, the creation of growth and employment was the urgent task undertaken by the Commission when it took office. I believe we are making excellent progress. The general economic situation in Europe is better than it has been for a long time, but we have not yet been able to reverse the trend. We must ensure that this growth is sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why we need the appropriate boundary conditions, which allow European businesses to further improve their competitiveness. A key factor in this is Europe’s innovative strength and its ability to find practical and commercial applications for our outstanding research results. We must compete on the basis of higher standards and better quality. We must be better than the others. We must apply the highest standards to the quality of our products. We must be technological leaders. New technologies, new processes, new products that give us the edge over others, these give us an opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to mention two very recent examples of how innovative ideas can increase the competitiveness of companies. Take innovative sensors for airbags. These have turned airbags from an excellent but unaffordable idea into a value-for-money, surface-covering item of safety equipment in use all over the world. At present 50 million of these sensors are produced annually on this basis. They are no longer used exclusively in the motor industry, but are also found in, for example, mobile phones, laptops and DNA chips.</p>
      <p sl="de">A quite different success story is the invention of a biodegradable plastic bag. A tiny group of scientists invented this environmentally friendly product and turned the patent to good account in the market. In the space of a few years this has grown into a successful medium-size business with a turnover of EUR 50 million and 60 patents – and the trend is upwards. These are only two examples from the hundreds, if not thousands of cases found every year in Europe, which we need to create employment and maintain it in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very grateful to the European Parliament and the rapporteur Mr Gierek for their support of our innovation strategy. That is particularly true of the areas also identified as a priority by the Council of Europe in December 2006. These are the topics to which we are devoting special efforts at present. They include, for example, our policy of strengthening clusters and the initiatives on creating and stimulating leading-edge markets, as part of which we shall be presenting before the end of the year after consultation with the interested groups a proposal for the establishment of several innovative leading-edge markets.</p>
      <p sl="de">Something else we are using in support of innovation is standardisation – a term that covers a great deal, and a communication on this subject is planned for the autumn of this year.</p>
      <p sl="de">The allocation of public funds also needs to be done more with a view to the more targeted support of innovation, and we have done this by drafting the guidelines for the use of the Structural Funds accordingly and by adapting the aid rules in such a way that innovation has to be capable of being more strongly promoted than formerly.</p>
      <p sl="de">I regard the improved protection of intellectual property as most especially important, for it is crucial not only at the European level but also in the global context. As the rapporteur rightly said, small and medium-sized enterprises find it difficult to secure what is rightfully theirs where intellectual property rights are concerned, and the Commission is working on a strategy for helping them do this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to point out that such rights have to be affordable and of high quality, and it is for that reason that the advancement of the Community patent is crucial in terms of the competitiveness of our economy, for the present state of affairs in patent policy is a serious hindrance to its ability to compete.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very grateful to you for attaching such significance to small businesses in particular, for it is indeed here that the greatest potential for innovation is to be found, and it is important that access to financial resources be made easier for them – which is precisely what we are doing by means of the competitiveness and innovation programme, which is specifically aimed at small and medium-sized innovative enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also agree on the outstanding significance of eco-innovation, which will be a very major issue in the years ahead of us, for both it and energy efficiency are areas in which innovative European solutions can make headway on the global market, making us more competitive internationally and thereby also capable of bringing about growth and creating new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="de">I get the impression that there is, to a large degree, agreement between this House, the Council and the Commission that the continued improvement and promotion of innovation is indispensable if we are to keep Europe on course for success; we all know what is needed, so what matters now is that we should all actually do it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. – Mr President, this report contains a long list of ways in which to encourage innovation, many of which are valuable. But I cannot reiterate too strongly that easy access – and I do not just mean simpler or less complicated access – to innovation programmes and ventures for smaller businesses is imperative and a lot of work remains to be done in that sphere.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased that the report includes several of the suggestions from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in particular the one emphasising that the 3% of GDP target for R&amp;D expenditure should be a minimum. I am also pleased that it welcomes the proposal for a Risk-Sharing Finance Facility and recognises the problems associated with protecting innovation in services, most notably smaller businesses’ difficulties with trade secrets and confidentiality agreements, which can hinder their ability to raise finance.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clearly true that intellectual property is intimately related to innovation. However, I am sorry to see statements in the report that are pre-emptive of the work that is going on within the Commission under the auspices of Commissioner McCreevy on various ways to improve the patent system.</p>
      <p sl="en">The approach of that work is pragmatic and constructive and may offer better solutions, for example, than trying to integrate the European Patent Office into the Community, which is by no means a simple solution, nor most likely to resolve most of the outstanding problems. It is certainly not something that could be achieved rapidly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Innovation, intellectual property and competitiveness are part of globalisation, where international norms are important. This means an outward-looking international approach is essential, and I welcome recognition of that with regard to standards. I caution against being too introspective with regard to patents. The victim is eventually competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this subject is naturally very seductive for politicians, as it is so broad-based – which is the way the Commission wanted it. Therefore, I should like to confine myself to a few of the most important points on which the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection decided – with relatively little controversy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We believe that a well-functioning internal market creates a favourable environment for innovation. Our understanding of a well-functioning internal market is one that has no unnecessary barriers or detrimental effects on society. We advocate better management of the transfer of academic results, particularly to SMEs, than has previously been the case, since SMEs – as the Commissioner has already said – have been a driver of innovation and creativity. SMEs are also the enterprises who, in Germany and throughout Europe, have been devoting particular attention to training young people. I predict disaster if fewer young people are trained and thus qualified to work on our issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">We believe that better regulation can give rise to unnecessary burdens on SMEs, but that it will raise consumer trust and confidence. We advocate the swifter introduction of European standards and supra-EU international standards, and we believe that sound, flexible rules in the field of public procurement could also help improve the innovation strategy. We believe that the provision of information to SMEs and other institutions must be improved, and – to reiterate – I welcome the fact that the Committee on Regional Development intends to introduce a technology adviser.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to conclude by mentioning two more aspects that we consider particularly important: the promotion of innovations with social applications, as we believe this has prospects, and the need for this Commission initiative to also give citizens a better quality of life.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, the fact that the most recent Innovation Scoreboard shows Europe to be increasingly well placed in an international context is a welcome development. It is now the fourth year in a row that the innovation gap between the USA and the European Union has been narrowing. Nevertheless, at a time of constant change and rapid developments, we are repeatedly called upon to tackle new innovations. In a long-term perspective, innovation is a necessary response to future global problems. Throughout the EU, it is much rarer for innovative enterprises to work together with universities and other higher education establishments than with customers and suppliers. Interaction between universities and educational establishments, on the one hand, and enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, on the other, is a further prerequisite for economic innovativeness.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this connection, I should like to mention the European Institute of Technology, and would ask the Council and the Commission to provide a financial basis for this. Funds should not be taken from current programmes to allocate to this Institute, however – to do so would be counterproductive and would interfere with the other projects. The innovation potential of SMEs is particularly great at local and regional level. Throughout the EU, this innovative potential must be better recognised, fostered, and cultivated through specific political measures, including improving access for the regions. Taking the example of Austria, according to 2004 statistics, more new or significantly improved products were placed on the market by small than by medium-sized enterprises. I should also like to mention the promotion of clusters, and to say by way of conclusion that innovation policy should also be discussed in relation to women, and that women must be given better access.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that, on this issue, no unrealistic goals have been proposed for catching up with and overtaking the rest of the world. In Europe we must attempt to ensure, from an entirely realistic perspective, that our science, research and development do not lose contact with the rest of the world. When it comes to technology and innovation, I doubt there is a magic wand that politicians can wave.</p>
      <p sl="cs">My worldwide experience on various political programmes in this area makes me somewhat sceptical. The EU has recently had a less than positive experience in the form of the so-called Lisbon Strategy. Our responsibility as politicians should be above all to define a reasonable and stable legal framework and of course the greatest possible financial support for research and technological innovation. In my view, science and technological development requires transparency, sufficient freedom to carry out innovation and, last but not least, funding.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I am pleased that the report includes calls to enhance the prestige of research and development. After all, it should be one of the main tasks of politicians to influence people’s values. In the Committee on Legal Affairs, we once again discussed regulatory and legislative aspects of the European innovation environment. As regards protecting intellectual property, the EU is bound by the relevant international agreements and it should be capable of harmonising its own economic and cultural environment.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We can see some typical shortcomings in the area of patent policy, where there has been no significant improvement, in spite of repeated efforts. Once again, we note with dismay that the EU’s patent environment is inconsistent and lacking transparency. In Europe, scientists and inventors, as well as our technological centres, have to spend considerably more on patents than is usually the case elsewhere. This report is, I feel, markedly lacking in controversy, because we all clearly recognise the importance of innovation for the future of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="sk">First I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gierek, for a balanced and thorough report.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Notwithstanding the fact that the report deals with the subject of fostering innovation in the European Union from every conceivable angle, I would like to highlight an important factor that cuts across our entire innovation strategy. I have in mind the advancement of a competitive environment and flexible initiatives, which should be the driving force for innovation in companies, clusters, technological and development centres, and similar institutions. Levelling the playing field for activities that rely on an adequate supply of expertise, experience and know-how, and which are directed at meeting market requirements as efficiently as possible, is key to ensuring the smooth development of all initiatives in this area.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Hence, we need to make arrangements at local, regional, national or international levels in order to allow the formation of information-based groups which will apply knowledge through an R&amp;D and business environment that is flexibly structured and that will encourage both cooperation and competition between them.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In practice this would mean that a university, research and development centre or innovative enterprise may form an ad hoc cluster and work together on an innovative project, and then fiercely compete with each other as part of a different cluster working on another innovative project. In formulating a new strategy we should keep clear of inflexible long-term arrangements, which tend to close in on themselves, becoming institutionalised and entrenched in a loosely-justified long-term system often based on senseless requirements, such as the principles of excellence or critical mass, which typically exclude small entities from innovation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Such complicated arrangements use up enormous resources in an inefficient manner and after a while lose the ability to respond flexibly to the rapidly changing requirements of a globalised world.</p>

      <p sl="en">în numele grupului PSE. – La Lisabona, Uniunea Europeană şi-a propus să devină cea mai dinamică şi competitivă economie bazată pe cunoaştere. Pentru a încuraja cercetarea, au fost dezvoltate programele-cadru de cercetare şi instrumente precum JEREMIE, care sprijină dezvoltarea întreprinderilor mici şi mijlocii la nivel regional. Aceste instrumente financiare ar trebui să existe şi la nivel naţional, cu sprijinul sistemului bancar. Din păcate, există încă multe regiuni ale Uniunii Europene care nu investesc 3% din produsul intern brut în cercetare şi dezvoltare. Există însă şi state membre care au decis să-şi dezvolte economia prin investiţii masive în resurse umane, în noile tehnologii şi în cercetare şi inovare. Aceste state au acordat inclusiv facilităţi fiscale companiilor care au investit în cercetare. Ele nu trebuie să rămână însă cazuri izolate şi solicităm Comisiei Europene să faciliteze cunoaşterea bunelor practici şi să recomande statelor membre acordarea de facilităţi fiscale pentru investiţiile realizate în cercetare.</p>
      <p sl="en">O economie bazată pe cunoaştere se bazează pe triunghiul cunoaşterii format din universităţi, centre de cercetare, parcuri ştiinţifice şi tehnologice şi companii, iar toate acestea trebuie să fie sprijinite.

Pentru a încuraja cercetătorii şi, mai ales, companiile să investească mai mult în cercetare şi în cercetarea aplicată, trebuie să protejăm munca intelectuală a acestora. În acelaşi timp, roata nu trebuie reinventată, iar rezultatele cercetării trebuie să fie disponibile celor interesaţi. Pentru aceasta, reţelele de comunicaţii de mare viteză, accesibile în şcoli, universităţi, parcuri tehnologice, institute de cercetare şi companii, trebuie să fie infrastructura minimă existentă.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the growth of Europe’s economy depends increasingly on the capacity for innovation and the technological advancement of Europe’s production system, so that it can maintain competitiveness in an increasingly tough international system. Unfortunately, the innovation gap between Europe and the other large world economies, particularly the United States, is still significant and is detrimental to Europe. We can say, however, that in our Europe, in the European States, there is a considerable research capacity in the universities, in the centres of excellence and in the laboratories; this excellence is widespread, and there is a high level of specialist and scientific knowledge.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is tragically missing in Europe is the opportunity and the capacity to transfer this research and its results into productive processes. What is missing is, in fact, the capacity for technological transfer of the know-how provided by research, to reinvigorate the production system, businesses and service companies in all spheres, in terms of innovation of products, processes and organisational innovation. Commissioner, the efforts you and the Commission have made to move forward on the innovation issue are very positive: the measures in the Seventh Framework Programme, the CIPs, the financial instruments that have today been relaunched, all these elements need promotion, and this is needed even more to sustain the projects for training to support small and medium-sized enterprises, with adequate financial resources and with appropriate organisational and procedural instruments.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is a need for similar initiatives, and there is still a need for different initiatives. More accessible organisational instruments and procedural routes need to be defined to ensure that these efforts of ours really produce concrete results within Europe’s industries and services. To increase innovation in Europe, I believe that it is also necessary, as stated in the report by our colleague Mr Gierek, to start with a cultural concept that is in favour of innovation, even at school, which may seem far removed from the processes of production, but is not, in fact. Today’s students are tomorrow’s workers and businessmen.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is necessary to labour this point in order to create in Europe an attitude, a mentality, an openness to change, to research, to experimentation, and, finally, also a readiness to undertake training. At a time when we are talking a great deal about training in Europe, I believe that this is important. As you point out in the Commission’s report and as is also stated in our resolution, the public sector is important. I have a great belief in the contribution that the public sector can make to innovation, directly through improvements that produce better quality and a more adequate range of services offered by public administrations; if public administrations reinvigorate themselves and adopt better production processes, this can also help with the growth of the economy and the cost reduction.</p>
      <p sl="it">The last point relates to ‘clusters’. The Commissioner spoke of these, as did my fellow Members; it is very important to link regional policy with innovation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group. Two weeks ago I presented a report on innovation in the context of regional policy, and I would like to thank the author for incorporating this aspect in his report.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that Mr Gierek’s report can bring about more effective and practical results from research, patents, inventions and rationalisation in the broader economy. Without it we are threatened with failure. This is not because of innovation per se, but because of artificial, or false, innovation. There is a glaring need for us to use the results of the work done by scientists, inventors and engineers who create the real added value for Europe and our civilisation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must find out where the sticking-points for implementing innovations are, and whether there is not too much red tape. EU institutions, along with the governments of Member States and the regional authorities, can also play a role in encouraging positive action in this respect, because it is often the regions that have first-rate universities, research establishments or clusters. We have already discussed the clear role to be played by small and medium-sized enterprises. However, we cannot forget the financial instruments, including tax instruments, and the proper use of the structural funds.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Innovation naturally relates to specific problems of design technology, and particularly today digital technologies, nanotechnologies, materials engineering, biotechnology, medicine and so forth. Hence the huge opportunities facing the European Institute of Technology and the proper implementation of the Seventh framework programmes. We should also underline that innovation is needed in education, management, administration, services, agriculture, utilities, etc.</p>
      <p sl="pl">To conclude, I would like to say that real innovations always have a humane aspect to them, both on the part of their creators, and on the part of their users, as they serve humankind.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, firstly, please accept my sympathies following the result in the football. We see Liverpool as our team to a certain extent, given that so many Spaniards play for them.</p>
      <p sl="es">Turning to innovation, I would like to thank Mr Gierek for his work, since innovation is a great challenge for the European Union, for the economy, for people, for communities and for territorial cohesion. I would like to point out the importance of the emphasis placed on programmes such as Eureka, which benefits small businesses.</p>
      <p sl="es">Also the promotion of initiatives such as the Eurostar initiative is important for small businesses and the whole notion of creating clusters of small businesses, which are promoted, for sharing information, for receiving public support, can be a shared objective for the whole of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are seeing a change of thinking in the Community: from the creation of tarmac motorways to the creation of information highways; rather than directing almost all of our European funds towards concrete, directing it towards knowledge. That is important when we are considering what to spend the funds or the majority of the Structural and regional funds on.</p>
      <p sl="es">I was recently in Poland and I wished to share the experience of trying to divert increasing amounts of funds towards research, innovation and infrastructures, not just heavy infrastructures, but also intelligence infrastructures.</p>
      <p sl="es">Because, at the same time, the issue of intellectual property is extremely important. If we create insurmountable obstacles to scientific and technical information, we may also thwart the necessary requirement of creating a closely woven economic and cultural network. We may deny access to the information necessary for innovation.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must not confuse the accumulation of patents with innovation. Because in Europe, despite what some people say, we are currently attracting considerable amounts of risk capital drawn in by a less strict intellectual property system.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should not make the mistake of copying the United States’ system of intellectual property patents at a time when that country is entirely rethinking their system of patents because it is too costly and because it promotes the creation of patents for their own sake, creating lists of patents more in order to protect what one has than in order to conquer new innovations.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are entirely in favour of integrating the European Patent Office into the European Institutions and keeping it under democratic control.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, we believe that, in the case of real, physical, patents, which could promote innovation, there must be patenting. However, we must not accept the mistaken notion that intellectual property is an end in itself. No. Intellectual property must serve the imagination.</p>
      <p sl="es">The priority must be sharing. The priority must be to create fields of lively creative activity in which information can be shared, in order to create a better world and a better social fabric.</p>

      <p sl="nl">… in view of the new and very hefty challenge we are facing at world level. Globalisation is pricing us out of the market, while some sectors of our traditional manufacturing industry are leaving it, and Mr Aho’s much-discussed report calls for more clustering, a more critical stance among the public, more specialisation and for harnessing creativity.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the Union, we spend about 43% of the Budget on reinforcing our competitiveness in the form of structural funds, money for research and money for the small and medium-sized enterprises. My question remains whether we, with these instruments, are taking due account of competitive relations. What do we do if it eventually transpires that we have an insufficient number of technically trained people to carry out various jobs?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Globally, it appears that we do not focus enough, while in Europe, we do not dare bring certain things into profile via knowledge regions of all kinds. As I see it, open innovation for large and small companies, together with knowledge institutions and governments are the answer to this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the final analysis, we need top regions. This is about a top sport, as Mr Verheugen also pointed out. This is about wanting to be a leader in technology. Without a leader, there is no following. In this case, there is insufficient scope for cohesion policy to be deployed across Europe, including the less developed areas.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The economy of the European Union is facing ever increasing global challenges. In order to meet these challenges, it needs specialised companies which engage in innovative activities with high added value, and which collaborate effectively with each other.</p>
      <p sl="hu">At present, small and medium-sized enterprises are faced with numerous problems. Prominent among these are their low visibility at the European level on account of their size, and the difficulty they encounter in accessing services that are essential for competitiveness on an international scale. This market disadvantage resulting from their size can be overcome through networking and clustering.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Clustering and creating growth poles are therefore important and effective tools of economic development. Although there is no doubt that the developmental poles fulfil a key role in increasing European competitiveness, the implementation of the European Union’s innovative strategy should not emphasise only such research and development centres, but we must keep in mind that the European Union is a unified entity that combines both developed and less-developed areas. It must play a role both in increasing innovative opportunities and in reducing regional disparities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There needs to be better cooperation among the various organisations, economic actors, universities, research centres and the public sector. We must ensure that the knowledge obtained through these channels is put into practice in companies’ operations. We need to simplify the administrative processes, facilitate financing and design a tax system that provides incentives to encourage the growth of enterprises’ innovative capacity.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Moreover, by injecting fresh blood into Europe’s business life, innovative strategies should increase the attractiveness and competitiveness of the Union’s economy. It would be a unique opportunity if, through the European Development Centre, we could make such developments accessible to everyone, and could create opportunities for the ongoing exchange of information. Innovation belongs to everyone, and the goal is that it should improve living conditions and the quality of life for all citizens throughout the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, I would like to thank Mr Adam Gierek and all contributing Members of Parliament for this comprehensive report. For my part, I would like to briefly focus my attention on certain important aspects.</p>
      <p sl="lt">First of all, I suggest that it be stressed even more clearly that regional partnership is precisely the key to implementing the European innovation policy that we are creating. Enterprise 'networking' is very important, as it provides enterprises, especially small and medium-size firms, with the opportunity to feel more secure and to react dynamically to the challenges of the new globalisation. Europe and the Member States must encourage the formation of such a system!</p>
      <p sl="lt">Secondly, the priority areas in scientific research and innovation propagation need to be chosen very responsibly. Lithuania has just completed a thorough review of the development of its economy according to regional and global tendencies, and it showed that the economy grows not so much because of the creation of new economic sectors and the allocation of national funds to those sectors, but because of economic sector transformations already in progress. Therefore, to guarantee stable economic growth it is essential to encourage innovation in enterprises in every sector of the economy, not forgetting that the vitality of high-technology enterprises depends very much on the vitality of local traditional industries and on the application of new ideas.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Colleagues, in the long run the future of Europe's industries depends not on which sectors of industry we choose to develop, but on whether we manage to create a new society in which implementing new ideas is a way of life!</p>
      <p sl="lt">The third thing to which I wish to draw attention is each country's handling and evaluation of innovation. New methodology is required for assessing innovation! Studies show that the way Lithuania and other European Union countries assess innovation in various economic sectors, based on the accepted evaluation methodology (‘European Scoreboard’), may be quite erroneous, and the established statement about a direct link between scientific research activity and the economic innovation of a national economy raises some serious doubts.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in taking the floor in this debate I would like to draw attention to the question of research and development in the European Union, which receives a mere 2% or so of GDP, when the most developed countries outside the EU, including the United States, allocate at least 3% of their GDP for this. In this situation, we are not only failing to close the gap between the United States and Europe, but letting it grow larger.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, it is very important that the cash for research and development from the EU budget is supplemented by funds from national budgets, local government, and in particular the private sector. It is anticipated that in 2010 the costs of R&amp;D in the European Union will be 2.6% of GDP, of which as much as two-thirds will come from the private sector.</p>
      <p sl="pl">And thirdly, I must express my hope that the research and development funding allocated from the EU budget will not just go to established academies and research centres, but also to universities and research establishments from the new as well as the old Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">First I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gierek, and Mr Hudacký, my colleague and shadow rapporteur in the lead Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for including several amendments in this report proposed in the opinions of the Committee on Development and the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. I have participated in drawing up these amendments as a shadow rapporteur for my political group.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The European Union is facing new challenges in a globalising world, and therefore competitiveness should be strengthened by promoting the commercial exploitation of the findings that emerge from research and development efforts. The European Union has numerous instruments that could be used more effectively to promote innovation. In particular I am referring to internal market instruments, such as the public procurement of innovative products and services, the establishment of public-private partnerships in innovative areas, and the application of technical standards. I firmly believe that the fast and effective introduction of technical innovations can be achieved through standardisation. Therefore I am very glad that the rapporteur took this idea on board and incorporated into his report my amendments concerning the rapid development of technical standards in new areas, especially in the area of innovative technologies and telecommunications technologies.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my amendments I emphasised the importance of the timely identification and promotion of leading markets. Examples of markets where the European Union may potentially become a global leader include the smart textile industry, environmental technologies or electronic health cards. Now that very little time is left until the 2010 deadline set in the Lisbon Strategy, we must focus on European regions. More than ever before, a competitive Europe needs the dynamism, inventiveness and enthusiasm for innovation of its regions.</p>
      <p sl="sk">A consistent transparent framework of state support serving as an incentive could be instrumental in launching regional partnerships based on the cooperation of small and medium-sized enterprises, universities, research institutes, local authorities and financial institutions.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I urge Member States not to underestimate the promotion of innovation strategies, which must become a priority within the operational programmes. I believe that if we use the EU offer of adequate allocations from structural funds for investment into research, innovation and continued education, we will manage to create new jobs and prevent the brain drain and depopulation that has been seen particularly in less attractive European regions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Gierek, who has presented a truly excellent report. It is good that we are discussing innovation, and it is good that we have used the broad concept of innovation – something that has been neglected for years. For much too long, we have concentrated solely on research itself rather than on implementing its results – but here, at long last, we have a report that does concentrate on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The broad concept of innovation also represents an opportunity for us to achieve dominance in new fields. One example is the discussion on climate change, in which Europe is indeed creating new innovation areas, particularly by focusing on CO2 reduction. I think this is a very good thing, and it is also mentioned frequently in the report. I should like to illustrate what this means using the example of the motor-vehicle market, where we have a strong position, where we are even leaders in the premium sector at international level. It means that we can indeed set ourselves ambitious objectives – that is not the problem. After all, we are talking about reducing the CO2 from exhaust fumes.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we also have to do, however, is to follow up these objectives with research projects, and focus on them. This is still something of a weak point for us. We can set ourselves ambitious objectives; but, if we are to create model markets, we really have to follow them up.</p>
      <p sl="de">I could also mention the EIT, the new European Institute of Technology. This is a good thing. I should like to offer my personal congratulations to the Commissioner for taking the initiative in the form of the CIP, the framework programme for competitiveness and innovation, which is now to be followed by its own innovation agency. This is an excellent initiative! Parliament – and I, in particular, as a former rapporteur – will support you on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">One final word on the Lisbon process. Let us replace the phrase ‘Lisbon process’ with ‘Liverpool process’. Tonight, Liverpool are playing Milan. Two years ago, they came back from 3-0 down. That is how far behind Europe is at the moment. We have fallen behind, so we have to catch up. This is possible, as Liverpool proved. Therefore I hereby proclaim the Liverpool process!</p>

      <p sl="pl">Thank you, Mr Chatzimarkakis, for giving us the latest soccer results! Madam President, first of all congratulations to the rapporteur, Adam Gierek, and Commissioner Verheugen, for all their innovation initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Innovation is undoubtedly the paramount issue in the Lisbon Strategy, as it means competitiveness. The innovation strategy set out by Mr Gierek in his report deserves respect, as it contains sixty-one detailed points.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The new definition of innovation is important: it covers not only technology, but also marketing, management, services and non-technological innovations. An important point is a cohesive innovation strategy; in particular a knowledge triangle, which is represented here by the European Technology Institute. Also important are protecting intellectual property and stimulating the market or the macro-economy. The report brings together previous developments, such as the Competition and Innovation Programme, the EU educational programmes, and, of course, the Seventh Framework Programme, very well.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One question that arises, however, is why do we have problems in the European Union? The answer is the weakness of the market. Firstly, we have overblown public assistance. Secondly, we protect leading national companies. Thirdly, we are slow to respond to monopolistic practices. And fourthly, we do not have a complete, uniform market for services, labour and the movement of capital. Instead of opening up, we withdraw. We rarely listen to the market or to consumers, with the exception of today’s vote on the Roaming Directive.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is clear that the Commission’s proposals are better for the Lisbon Strategy and for the European market than the proposals of the Member States. I would like to congratulate the Commission, and congratulate the rapporteur once again.</p>

      <p sl="en">Innovation in Europe is hampered by the absence of an adequate regime for protecting intellectual property rights. This much is clear. The report rightly stresses this point and calls for a number of improvements.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I believe we should go further in identifying the flaws in the current system, and be more ambitious about our proposed solutions. The report proposes incorporating the European Patent Office, presently an intergovernmental body outside the EU, into Community structures.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a welcome idea, albeit one that will take years to bring about. Bureaucracies do not merge easily, especially ones such as the EPO which have developed a questionable profit-making and unaccountable orientation. It grants patents too easily from the point of view of achieving broad-based innovation across the economy, which too often only serves the interests of the patent holders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, in anticipation of a Community patent run, eventually, by an EU patent office, let me reiterate my support for the efforts of the Commission to enact medium-term pragmatic solutions, e.g. the European Patent Litigation Agreement. It is only a first step, but one that is badly needed for common rules to develop, and innovation to flourish.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Bill Newton Dunn, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on developing a strategic concept on tackling organised crime [2006/2094(INI)] (A6-0152/2007).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-401" speaker_id="1394" name="Bill Newton Dunn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am sorry to tell you this is going to be a tale of woe, of unhappiness and of problems for Europe, because organised crime is growing in every field, it is hidden and we do not have a full picture. It is based in states outside the EU, mostly, where government is weak and therefore there is very little action to stop the gangs and the criminals who are working in an organised way.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am referring to drugs like heroin and cocaine, which are brought in from different parts of the world; to ecstasy, which is exported from Europe to different parts of the world; to illegal immigrants, who are brought in from Asia and Africa without proper controls; to counterfeit goods of every imaginable kind, some just simple toys or music CDs but also some things like medicines, which are deeply serious and life-threatening; and to crime on the internet – the theft of money and identity. In every area, crime is growing and in every area we each have, maybe, some small experience.</p>
      <p sl="en">Every industry is aware of the problems in its own sector, but it keeps the statistics hidden because it does not want to damage public confidence. If a bag manufacturer says, ‘Be careful about buying my beautiful leather bag because it may be a fake from the Far East or elsewhere,’ they damage their prospects. So, nobody tells the public what is really going on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some organised gangs are ethnic families working very well in a tightly-knit way; some are now organised like very efficient, very big multinational corporations – this week I was even given an organisational chart for an organised criminal gang! They cross the borders inside our Union with total ease and without any difficulty at all. Here is the problem: our police cannot cross any borders. So, the criminals are going wherever they like, doing whatever they do, but our police are restricted to their own regions or their own Member States and therefore are deeply handicapped and cannot fight the criminals on equal terms. What do individual police officers do if there is a problem across the border? Do they go to a central point and get contact details from the telephone directory? There is no directory. There is no facility for a police officer in any one country to find a telephone number or an e-mail address for an appropriate contact in another Member State. It is unbelievable – a total lack of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reason for this is the lack of mutual trust and understanding, meaning that, traditionally, we do not want to give foreigners our information or reveal the source of our information, because that would give away too many secrets. We do not trust each other inside Europe. The gangs trust each other beautifully and so they are winning hands down.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not all woe. The Americans, with their open borders between states, found exactly the same problem in the 1930s. You probably saw the film Bonnie and Clyde. They robbed banks, took the money across a state border and the police could not follow them. The Americans invented the FBI with powers to cross borders, and I suspect that is the stage we have now reached in Europe. We need a law enforcement agency that can pursue criminals across frontiers. The public will be very sceptical; the national leaders say nothing about it, but I think we have reached that point and we have to do something about it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, however, on this side of the Atlantic, in the European Union, there are no statistics to tell the public the scale of the problem. Each of the 27 Member States collects statistics in its own different way. There are no comparative EU statistics, so we hope that the Commission is working in that direction to start that happening in a few years’ time. We have no idea, no clear picture, no information for the public, no democratic control, because this comes under the third pillar and is therefore controlled by the national governments, who do very little because they do not feel any pressure from the public to take any action.</p>
      <p sl="en">The only way that we will get a change, I fear, is if there is a dramatic shock, something like 9/11 in Europe. Something so bad that the public says, ‘How was this allowed to happen? How did the criminal gangs get away with this for so long when there was so much inactivity in 27 national capitals?’ But, if the criminals are smart – and they are very smart – they will never come up above the horizon. They will never commit a 9/11 and they will just go on eating into our society, feeding off us, weakening us, taking away jobs and, basically, weakening the whole Union. We really need action, and I hope Parliament will support this report and push the ministers into taking some decisions.</p>

    <intervention id="3-402" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Franco Frattini" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Newton Dunn, on this report. I think that it is clear to everyone how important it is to develop all means at our disposal to combat organised crime, and nobody, I believe, can have any doubts on the matter. I will restrict myself to giving some brief information on some recent progress made by the European Union in this field and some initiatives that the European Commission will launch very soon.</p>
      <p sl="it">First of all, on the subject of improving knowledge of the phenomenon of organised crime, I am in especial agreement with the rapporteur. We do not have a precise framework of knowledge on the dimensions of this criminal phenomenon and the movements of organised crime. In this sphere, the development of Europol’s activities is particularly valuable. As you know, starting this year, 2007, Europol will publish and has proposed to supplement its traditional informative report on the state of crime in Europe with an annual threat assessment. The Europol report will thus be a proactive report, not just an informative one; that is, it will indicate, year by year, the sectors in which the threat of organised crime has grown and, as we hope, also those in which the threat has diminished. Unfortunately, we are seeing a growing increase in all the main spheres of organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another important result, which the rapporteur referred to just now, is European activity in the field of crime statistics. Up until now we have not had a statistical framework. You will remember that in a communication adopted last year I proposed a Europe-wide system of crime statistics. We have already put together a group of experts, and I can say with satisfaction that Eurostat has already brought out the first publication of statistical data on offences across Europe. We are beginning to produce concrete results.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the field of prevention, which is extremely important, we have decided to concentrate, for example, on the fight against corruption, which is often linked to organised crime networks. We have decided to set up a European network of national experts permanently linked together, precisely with a view to preventing corruption. I have decided to include in next year’s programme the 2008 programme an initiative that will explore the links between corruption, money-laundering and thus organised crime networks. This is a sector on which Europe must work harder.</p>
      <p sl="it">Next, there is a major action with regard to trafficking in human beings; there is an action plan, which has already been adopted and which is in the process of being developed and implemented in practice. Besides, as you probably know, one of the measures we have promoted is an annual European day against trafficking in human beings, which will be a concrete signal of development, a realisation on a European scale that until now was inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have also decided to concentrate on witness protection, which is a vital element when it comes to combating organised crime. I will make available to this Parliament a working document with some concrete proposals by the end of July this year, that is, within the next two months. This working document will be the outcome of an analysis that we carried out with the police and the legal authorities of the Member States on how witnesses should be protected in the fight against organised crime, because, if witnesses are not protected, a fundamental element for combating organised crime fails.</p>
      <p sl="it">On police cooperation and judicial cooperation, coordination should be stepped up, above all between Europol and Eurojust. Admittedly, a multidisciplinary approach is vital, and we have done a lot for Europol. I have proposed new rules of procedure for Europol so as to increase its powers, extend its mandate and give it more flexibility; organised crime is unfortunately very adaptable, and thus Europol must also be much more flexible. I hope that, in the case of Europol, the Council will accept our proposal for Community funding. This would have an immediate advantage, that of the European Parliament’s having democratic control of the use of Europol’s budget, which will thus be subject in what I would call a more transparent manner to a democratic parliamentary control authority.</p>
      <p sl="it">As you know, the Council still has some reservations about accepting this proposal of mine. On the operational front, Europol is getting stronger. Where is the weak point? The weak point is that the Member States are not forwarding to Europol the necessary amount of operational information that Europol needs in order to coordinate its activities. You probably know that 70% of the data in Europol’s central computer system comes from only five Member States, and the remaining 30% from all the others. This demonstrates what Europol’s potential could be if all the Member States contributed better. This is something that they will now have to do because all three Europol protocols have entered into force and thus cooperation will be improved.</p>
      <p sl="it">For Eurojust too, we need to do more. I will certainly put forward a proposal on Eurojust this autumn, I believe in October or November, and this will be a proposal to strengthen Eurojust’s powers of initiative. The point that will be at the heart of my initiative will be the involvement of Eurojust – I would say involvement on a normal and systematic basis – with joint investigation teams. These joint investigation teams are a basic tool for combating crime, and Eurojust is being called on to participate in the joint investigation teams in a way that is insufficient, non-systematic and sometimes incidental. This is no good. Eurojust must be a regular participant in the joint investigation teams, in order to increase their capabilities.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, all this activity that we are carrying out must always achieve a balance between security requirements, which are, as I am personally convinced, a fundamental right of citizens. Citizens have a right to security, but alongside security there are other rights, which are also fundamental rights, and therefore I believe that the issue of data protection in the field of police cooperation – an issue which has not yet received a positive response from the Council, despite my proposal of a year and a half ago – should finally receive a systematic response, namely a European legislative initiative on data protection in the so-called third pillar. This will also act to give citizens a tangible sign that, alongside taking strong action against organised crime, we strongly respect other fundamental rights such as the right to handling of personal data.</p>
      <p sl="it">In all these spheres, I hope that the Council will decide in June to incorporate the provisions of the Prüm Treaty into European legislation, that is, I hope that instead of being, as it is today, mere enhanced cooperation between a few Member States, it will become a provision that is an integral part of Community legislation. If the Council, as I hope it will, lets this proposal pass, we will have taken a step forward.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, I would like to point out two issues. Firstly, the implementation in practice of the new Agency for Fundamental Rights, which was set up in March. The Agency will be an important tool in ensuring that fundamental rights are respected, including at the request of Parliament or the Commission, with regard to cooperation and investigative police activities.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is also the major issue of combating organised cybercrime. As you know, yesterday I presented a communication on cyber crime, which deals with various sectors of organised computer crime, from paedophilia to computerised attacks on banking systems. I believe that computer crime is one of the new frontiers on which this Parliament will clearly be able to work.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done and also Mr Frattini for the concrete progress made and for the information that he has given Parliament this evening.</p>
      <p sl="it">This report is certainly an important sign of the political will to energetically combat the phenomenon of organised crime, which is unfortunately increasingly widespread. This form of crime has been able, despite our efforts, to develop a criminal network across national borders. Currently we have not been successful in providing police services equipped with the necessary tools to combat it.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must therefore give a strong, authoritative and credible response, by strengthening all the cooperation instruments, as the Commissioner was saying, from awareness of the criminal phenomenon to the collection of statistical data, from the improvement and simplification of information exchange to the honing of investigation methods and the increased coordination of investigative and punitive operations.</p>
      <p sl="it">I personally believe that the creation of more rigorous, Europe-wide collaboration and contact instruments, such as Europol will be able to be, is the key to enhancing trust between the Member States, creating the necessary synergies between national police authorities and launching a true European policy in this field. In recent years, associations of a criminal type have increasingly assumed the actual form of companies, and they find on the economic and financial markets a perfect place for laundering illicit proceeds; the damage that ensues for national economies and the Community economy can be easily imagined. We must also combat organised crime on the economic front and systematically attack financial resources, fixed and movable assets that have been legitimately acquired. For one thing, depriving crime of its resources means damaging the relations and links between them and terrorist organisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also hope – and I note the Commissioner’s communication – that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and the two protocols on trafficking in persons and immigrant trafficking will be ratified swiftly and, above all, applied.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am sure that, on the basis of this information, concrete proposals will soon arrive from the Commission, and I take note of this with great pleasure this evening. I wish Mr Frattini the best in his work; he has shown that he is not only aware of these issues but that he has implemented in practice some initiatives that he has outlined this evening.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The excellent Dunn report is a high quality contribution to the committee’s communication. As a co-rapporteur, I too consider it extremely important for the Union to be able to contribute to improving the day-to-day security of its citizens, and that it strengthen its efforts to prevent corruption in politics and public administration.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We, the socialist members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are urging progress and implementation primarily by raising a few issues in connection with the report. We need to strengthen the cooperation between the police and judicial bodies of the Member States, in particular because in a Europe with no internal borders, crime, especially organised crime, can only grow in the absence of effective cooperation among these bodies.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Moreover, we need step by step to strengthen the independence and scope of EUROPOL and EUROJUST, in order to provide a European-level law enforcement and judicial body that can deal with crime with a comprehensive approach above the Member States, thereby providing incentives to domestic bodies to perform careful and corruption-free work. Member States must be urged to support and finance the competent authorities as well as training and cooperative programmes for the sake of better and more effective cooperation on cases involving organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We think that the witness protection programme can only be developed further at the European level, since the majority of countries in themselves are not able to hide citizens testifying against organised crime within their own territory, and must ensure that they receive the protection due them. One of the most important tasks is for us suitably to inform concerned European citizens of the steps being taken at the European level, and of the successes of our cooperation, and in this way to emphasise the usefulness of European cooperation in the area of communications as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">And now for a few thorns that remain in my flesh. In my proposals for amendment submitted to the committee, I tried to draw attention to the fact that Member States have extremely diverse histories, and their citizens have experienced very different types of socialisation. In some Member States, certain concepts in criminal law have an entirely different significance than in others. For it can happen that in one Member State something falls under serious moral condemnation, while in another it is a matter of civil virtue. A Hungarian political scientist has said that a country is corrupt where it does not even occur to a citizen to purchase a train ticket when he gets on a train. And we do not ask ourselves where they purchase train tickets.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is also my conviction that there will be certain policies in the geopolitical and economic area which will become the targets of organised crime, and if we do not pay careful attention and do not take steps on behalf of national security, we will find ourselves in danger.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I hope that our disagreement was not based on principles, but only on linguistic misunderstandings, and that support for this report will be based on an agreement on the principles.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I congratulate Mr Newton Dunn on his excellent report. In order to make this report and the level of debate associated with it even more practically useful and perhaps more controversial, I would like to take the opportunity, to address one issue which, although dealt with in the report and referred to by the Commissioner, in my view needs to be further elaborated upon.</p>
      <p sl="de">I refer to the issue of money laundering. Money laundering constitutes the oxygen supply to organised crime. Legitimising crime profits is essential for crime barons to survive and expand their illegal activities. I question whether the EU, despite its frequent criticism of money laundering, is in fact doing very much to combat it.</p>
      <p sl="de">My thesis is demonstrated by the following example. A vast amount of money laundering is taking place through institutions based and functioning in areas such as the Channel Islands, in particular Guernsey and Jersey. These islands have a rather peculiar status as regards their relation to the EU. The British Government, although fully aware of the money laundering problem associated with these islands, conveniently turns a blind eye to such activities under the pretext that these areas enjoy a certain degree of autonomy from British sovereignty. The same applies to institutions based on other British overseas territories or British Crown dependencies. Such territories are the Isle of Man and the British Virgin Islands. I note that in 2000 KPMG reported that the British Virgin Islands had 41% of the world’s tax-haven-seeking offshore companies.</p>
      <p sl="de">I call upon the Commission to make a statement in relation to the aforementioned money laundering activities in British-related territories and to declare before us what action it intends to take, in particular with regard to the British Government, in order to halt the money laundering legitimacy cover-up currently afforded to the areas I have mentioned.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, as fate would have it, today, 23 May, we are discussing in this Chamber the fight against organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="it">It was on this very day, 15 years ago, that an extremely serious event took place in the history of Italy, and the history of Europe: Giovanni Falcone, the high-level judge, was assassinated by the mafia in a horrific manner, when they blew up the section of the motorway between the airport and the city of Palermo. His wife and three other agents in the escort died together with him. That year, 1992, was a terrible year, because after Falcone, another judge – Paolo Borsellino – was assassinated by organised crime, specifically the mafia.</p>
      <p sl="it">Both of them had realised how important it was to conduct legal and police cooperation at international level and thus they had gathered how necessary it was to combat criminal organisations at a higher level – at an international level – focusing above all on intercepting the capital of criminal and mafia organisations. Falcone and Borsellino were the umpteenth victims in a series of slaughters in the Italian Republic that began with the massacre at Portella della Ginestra on 1 May 1947.</p>
      <p sl="it">So many things have changed over the years; criminal organisations have become transnational, and this change had already occurred by the end of the 1980s, when the liberalist dogma was confirmed in the policy of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The globalisation of the economy and of finance has occurred through the deregulation of the financial and trade markets, the privatisation of services and the reinforcement of tax havens.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have seen confirmation of what an authoritative research body, the Transnational Institute of Amsterdam, has called ‘the Global Fix’, that is, a global compromise between the theoretically legal economy and the criminal economy. This is international trafficking in arms and drugs and money-laundering. In certain ways there has been confirmation of the tendency of liberalist globalisation to encourage crime.</p>
      <p sl="it">If we analyse the studies by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, we can see that, since the 1980s, the underground economy has quadrupled. In 2001 black-market transactions ranged between USD 6 500 and 9 000 billion a year, that is, between 20% and 25% of the world’s gross domestic product. We are talking about a horrifying figure that could help to overcome poverty on a worldwide scale.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this context some important phenomena have arisen. Most important of all is the fall of the Soviet Union, which resulted in the transfer of many State assets into cash and directly to cartels and criminal organisations. It is no coincidence that, today, the Russian mafia is very strong, in both economic and political terms. Much of this money transited via numerous accounts in Switzerland, the Cayman Isles, the islands to which Mr Matsakis referred, and Gibraltar.</p>
      <p sl="it">The other major trend that was confirmed in the 1990s was the push by the US and the UK to deregulate the financial and international markets. The globalisation of the financial markets itself contains the seeds of the reorganisation of criminal forces.</p>
      <p sl="it">The other great event that increased the income of organised crime was the return of war. The war and the way in which it is intertwined with liberalist globalisation has led to a frightening increase in revenue for international mafia groups, including in particular an increase in profits from drugs.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the Andes region in Colombia, the ‘War on Drugs’ philosophy has given rise to an exponential growth in the production of coca and the processing of coca plants into cocaine. The war in the Balkans has turned that region into an off-limits area where money is laundered and heroin is refined for the European market. Think about what happened in Afghanistan! In 2001, before the military occupation, opium production was 74 tonnes per year. In 2006 – and my source is the US Department of State – opium production had risen above 6 000 tonnes, and this growth is closely linked to the military occupation. Today Afghanistan produces 93% of the total world output of opium.</p>
      <p sl="it">How much is drug production worth today on the global market? The UN, which is unfortunately not very credible on this subject, says that 1% of the world’s GDP is derived from drug trafficking; the US Department of State says that it is 2.5%, and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs says that between 2% and 5% of the world’s GDP is based on international trafficking in narcotics. This is just one piece of information, because to this should be added trafficking in human beings, arms, waste, counterfeiting of products, and all these profits are immediately laundered and injected into the legal market.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need to take action on capital, assets and financial transactions, and that is why we believe that the confiscation of the assets of the mafia and of transnational organised crime is a key factor in the war that we must wage on the mafia. Pio La Torre understood this, and proposed a law to the Italian Parliament stating that there was an overriding need to take action on capital. For this reason I endorse the report by Mr Newton Dunn, because it tackles this point by stating that there is a need to intervene by chipping away at the funds of criminal and mafia organisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">A section of my group will not support this report, perhaps for reasons that can be understood, because it considers that it does not offer enough guarantees, particularly with regard to the handling of personal data. This section is led by Mr Adamou, the shadow rapporteur for our group, who will abstain and will not endorse this report. I, on the other hand, think that combating organised crime is a priority, but it is not only a matter for the police.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need to take action in the cultural sphere, we need to build a real social structure against the mafia, one that will take on the great burdens of social unrest and unemployment, and we also need to take action in the political sphere. In recent years the mafia and transnational criminal organisations have infiltrated the public administration and politics. This is no coincidence, and I would like to conclude by mentioning the fact that, for example, the president of my region is under investigation for relations with organised crime and the mafia.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to conclude by endorsing the paragraph in the Newton Dunn report that calls for monitoring of the activities of those administrations that have been infiltrated by organised crime and the mafia.</p>

      <p sl="en">în numele grupului ITS. – Demersul deputatului Newton Dunn privind recomandarea pe care Parlamentul European urmează să o adreseze Consiliului în legătură cu elaborarea unui concept strategic privind lupta împotriva criminalităţii organizate este unul deosebit prin necesitatea şi utilitatea unui astfel de instrument în această perioadă în care criminalitatea organizată, în special criminalitatea economico-financiară, a căpătat valenţe noi, din ce în ce mai rafinate. Pornind de la această stare de fapt, în prezent lupta împotriva criminalităţii organizate nu mai poate fi continuată utilizând instrumente clasice, fiind necesară, aşa cum se remarca şi în motivaţia raportului, citez, „o schimbare radicală de perspectivă, care să permită soluţionarea constrângerilor interne din ce în ce mai complexe şi, în acelaşi timp, rezolvarea dificultăţilor aferente constrângerilor externe aflate în creştere exponenţială.” La aceste obiective consider, însă, că trebuie adăugat şi faptul că numai o schimbare de optică sau de program, oricât de judicios ar fi elaborată, nu va da rezultate dacă nu se asigură un mediu de stabilitate care să confere voinţa politică necesară realizării practice a acestora. Aceasta, voinţa, ar trebui canalizată în primul rând spre asigurarea funcţionalităţii independente şi eficiente a structurilor statului, desemnate să realizeze controlul modului de derulare a activităţilor susceptibile de a face obiectul operaţiunilor care intră sub incidenţa legilor criminalităţii organizate. În sfârşit, consider că un capitol separat din conceptul strategic ar trebui să fie consacrat acelor state, membre mai noi sau mai vechi ale Uniunii Europene, în care stabilitatea politică este deseori perturbată de acţiuni mai mult sau mai puţin democratice, stare de care structurile crimei organizate nu ezită să profite din plin.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I want to focus on something we might all take for granted, namely that in the EU one would expect every member of any form of government in the EU to wholeheartedly support the Europe-wide fight against organised crime and terrorism. Considering the antecedents of some of those recently admitted into the new government in my country, Northern Ireland, the irony of the welcome call in this report for the Council of Ministers to monitor the governmental activities of institutions at regional level whose members include political figures with links to criminal organisations is not lost upon me, especially in a week in which the Deputy First Minister in my country, Martin McGuinness, protested at the use of the European arrest warrant to seek the extradition to Germany of a person wanted in connection with an IRA bombing charge, and during a week in which his policing spokesman condemned arrests in Northern Ireland in an organised crime investigation in which a leading Irish Republican figure has now been charged.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you genuinely support the rule of law, then you do not attack and protest against the means of securing international justice and you do not protest against operations attacking organised crime. But if shamefully, as in Northern Ireland, you are a Sinn Féin minister, then your first loyalty is still not to the rule of law, but to protecting the interests of the republican movement. Little wonder some of us still regard Sinn Féin as unfit for government.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Newton Dunn on his outstanding report. I am not as sharply critical of the situation as he is. I feel that there have been some positive contributions in the last 30 years in the area of police and judicial cooperation in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I do agree with him, though, when he highlights the significant difference between the mobility of criminal networks, which are taking advantage of border-free Europe, and the level of intervention of the law enforcement authorities, which fall under the jurisdiction of the Member State in question.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is a contradiction that cannot be resolved. There are some who, wrongly, advocate restricting freedom and movement and who seek to reinstate national borders. This conundrum, however, can only be resolved with more and better collaboration, and more and better cooperation on the basis of shared procedures and basic harmonisation of legal standards.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What we need, as Mr Frattini correctly said, is to increase knowledge of the phenomenon of organised crime, which is becoming more and more sophisticated. We need to strengthen the policy of prevention in order to reduce the level of threat to our societies from organised crime. We need to derive benefit from existing legislation and to make better use of joint investigation teams, of special investigation techniques, of systematically targeting illegally acquired economic and financial resources and of the effective use of the European Arrest Warrant and the European Evidence Warrant. We must make better use of the various instruments already at our disposal, such as Europol and Eurojust, as Mr Frattini mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I should like to finish by adding my voice to those calling on the Member States that have yet to ratify the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, and attached protocols on the fight against the trafficking in human beings and the trafficking of immigrants, to do so at the earliest opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we have committed ourselves to creating in Europe an area of freedom, security and justice with no internal borders. However, we are often reminded that criminals and terrorists do not recognise borders. They take advantage of the lack of borders and are fully in command of the new means of travel and communications.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, our law enforcement agencies still have to face enormous administrative burdens that hinder their efficiency. It is now our responsibility to take all the necessary steps to adapt means and methods to the new realities. We must overcome the lack of mutual trust among law enforcement agencies, increase cross-border cooperation, intensify joint training and work together.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe, however, that the Union must pay greater attention to its external borders and its neighbourhood policy. Since the recent enlargements, enforcing strong external borders has become a wider challenge. Some of the new EU border countries do not have the appropriate resources to tackle the phenomenon of organised crime. Corruption must be tackled with as much energy as we bring to the fight against organised crime and terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU must recognise the situation and provide additional human resources and financial means, as well as sharing its know-how. We must adopt a comprehensive and specific approach built on transparency and anti-corruption measures. Our citizens need a safer world and more security, but this should not be at the expense of our civil liberties. We need more safeguards to ensure the balance of rights in our democracies, which means more parliamentary oversight of security activities and a high level of protection of privacy. This is why, once again, I urge the Council to adopt the framework decision on data protection under the third pillar as soon as possible. We have all waited too long.</p>

      <p sl="et">Ladies and gentlemen, Europol’s latest danger analysis speaks of criminal markets. Indeed, the criminal world is no less dynamic, complex or adaptable than any other sector of the market economy. Resources go where their productivity is greatest. There is an international competition for markets, in which foreign gangs have in some cases displaced local gangs.</p>
      <p sl="et">The newest technologies, the growth in the transport and finance sectors and the elimination of internal borders are being used against us. Our own sluggishness is also being used against the lawful order.</p>
      <p sl="et">Less and less crime remains solely within the boundaries of one country, yet the European Union’s internal security cooperation is still limited to the framework set by the third pillar.</p>
      <p sl="et">Freedom of movement within Europe is a genuine gift to criminals. Physical boundaries have disappeared, but administrative barriers remain.</p>
      <p sl="et">Europol and Eurojust need autonomy and respectable budgets. These things should not be bargained over any longer, and the same applies to Parliament’s right of supervision.</p>
      <p sl="et">I concur with the rapporteur and Europol concerning the need considerably to strengthen research and analytical activity and to refocus. In addition to traditional surveillance, we need more analysis ‘from above’ which would make it possible to discover illegal activities in such vulnerable sectors as finance, taxation and government business.</p>
      <p sl="et">Our greatest unused resource, however, is cooperation among citizens. Only indifference makes forced prostitution and the drug trade possible. Only democratic fatigue permits corrupt politicians to return to power.</p>
      <p sl="et">Citizens’ faith in the effectiveness of police and the fairness of the courts can only be based on real achievements, which are only amplified by communication. I would like to thank the rapporteur and call for us to move from words to deeds.</p>

      <p sl="it">The phenomenon of organised crime in Europe, along the lines of the mafia or similar groups, is taking root and spreading rapidly in the ‘Old Continent’.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is a worrying phenomenon where criminals profit from the free movement of persons and economic and financial movements within the European Union in order to expand their own illegal activities more and more, including in countries outside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="it">These activities include arms and waste smuggling (including radioactive waste), drugs trafficking, the sexual exploitation of women and children, trafficking in human tissues (the cases discovered and reported a few days ago in Ukraine are tragic examples of what is currently taking place) and illicit operations involving animals and artworks.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Newton Dunn report points out, among many other things, the role played to date by Europol and Eurojust – the only available Community instruments – in the fight against organised crime, underlining some results that have been achieved but deploring their lack of genuine autonomy.</p>
      <p sl="it">On this point, I would like to advance once again my proposal, which was addressed to the Commission and the Council back in February 2004, to create a European monitoring centre on organised crime with the aim of reducing the discrepancies in the sanctions existing in the various legal systems of the individual Member States, discrepancies that Mr Newton Dunn has taken the timely step of pointing out.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Niels Busk, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products [COM(2006)0822 – C6-0045/2007 – 2006/0269(CNS)] (A6-0171/2007).</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I want to start by thanking Parliament, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and the rapporteur, Mr Busk, for the swift and constructive way the proposal was dealt with.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, on behalf of Mrs Fischer-Boel, I am grateful for the political support you are giving to the proposal. I also greatly appreciate the positive thrust of the Committee on Agriculture’s report. We are discussing a very specific subject: the European Parliament’s opinion on the single common market organisation, or CMO.</p>
      <p sl="en">Simplification in the field of agriculture is one of the flagships of the Commission. This text is different from most Commission proposals in the area of the CAP. Why? With the single CMO we want to make an important step towards simplifying and improving the legislative framework of the common agricultural policy. I know that it has become popular to talk about simplification and better regulation. This proposal shows very clearly what these terms can mean in practice. The single CMO will merge all 21 CMOs into one text. It will replace more than 40 Council regulations and almost 620 articles and it will reduce the number of articles and pages in the Official Journal by more than two thirds.</p>
      <p sl="en">Apart from such merely quantitative parameters, the single CMO will make our market legislation more homogenous and consistent, in other words more easily accessed and read and thus better understood and applied. According to the Presidency’s planning, this proposal will be discussed at the meeting of the Special Committee for Agriculture on 29 May and 4 June and probably on 11 June in the Council. Let me also at this stage thank Parliament for helping make this early decision possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">From time to time the Commission is told that the single CMO is not enough to make our farmers’ lives easier. I fully agree. It takes more than one legislative text to achieve real simplification. That is why the single CMO is only one element, even though a very important one, of several components of simplification strategy in agriculture. Other components, as you will recall, include the Commission’s cross-compliance report, which will have a real impact on farmers’ lives once its proposals are implemented, the simplification action plan, currently with 37 practical measures, which agriculture is busy implementing, and the health check, which will also be targeted at further simplifying the CAP.</p>
      <p sl="en">But back to the CMO. As I have already said, on behalf of the Commission, I appreciate the positive tone of the report and I will therefore be able to accept a number of amendments set out in the Committee on Agriculture report. But you will not be surprised that I have some serious difficulties with some of the proposed amendments because I believe they would unnecessarily reduce the proposal’s impact. I would like to mention two points of particular importance.</p>
      <p sl="en">First there is the request to keep two areas entirely out of the single CMO until they are reformed: fruit and vegetables and wine. I do not share this view but I could accept incorporation of their substantive parts only after the reform processes are over.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point concerns the set-up of the management committee. The Committee on Agriculture report recommends four subsections. This would in our view be in contradiction with the single CMO and make the new committee unnecessarily inflexible. But I can assure you that the Commission is determined to organise the meetings of the single committee in such a way as to include the necessary expertise and take account of the specificities of the sectors concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for your attention at this late hour. I am looking forward to the discussion.</p>

    <intervention id="3-418" speaker_id="4442" name="Niels Busk" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="da">Madam President, Commissioner, firstly I should like to thank the German Presidency and the Commission for their particularly constructive cooperation during the preparation of this report. The cooperation has been based on openness and trust and has without a doubt contributed to this report being adopted by a very large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I would, of course, also thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for some interesting debates and for their major contribution to this report. It has, overall, been a pleasure to cooperate with them on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="da">The Commission has put forward a very ambitious proposal, which I welcome. It is good to simplify and to create openness and transparency, and transparency is something that I do most certainly believe that this proposal will result in. That being said, it should be added that this simplification is most evident of all in the legislative document itself, which overall has been reduced from 600 to 200 pages. This shows that a lot has happened. This legislative package constitutes the agricultural industry’s framework conditions, and the overarching objective should be to create clarity regarding the framework conditions, and in such a way that those at whom this report is targeted, namely the operators, also perceive the changes as a simplification. There is no real policy change here, and the simplification will not be noticed in any way by the end-user, that is to say the farmer.</p>
      <p sl="da">During the process, many people have complained that what has taken place has been anything but a simplification. The operators have until now worked with one market organisation or perhaps with quite a small number of them. These are now to be incorporated into just the one, which will comprise all the old organisations. Some people may not immediately perhaps see the changes as a simplification. For those, however, who use more than one of the sector-specific market organisations or those who want to obtain an overview of the different market organisations, this consolidated set of regulations is definitely a simplification.</p>
      <p sl="da">The Commission proposes that a number of provisions of a technical nature be transferred from the Council to the Commission. The provisions concerned are ones that, until now, the Council has been able to adopt without first consulting the European Parliament. These are what are known as the second-generation agreements. Insofar as we are concerned exclusively in this case with provisions of a purely technical nature, I think it very appropriate to transfer these, as a regulatory power, to the Commission, which will thus be able to take some very rapid and effective decisions. I should like, however, to emphasise that any decision of a political nature must still be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 37 of the Treaty, that is to say after consulting the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="da">As a natural extension of the simplification, the Commission proposes that, in future, only one management committee be employed. That is something I am very sceptical about, since I cannot imagine only one management committee being able to provide the necessary expertise. There are such big differences between the many market mechanisms we have, for example as regards animal production and vegetable production, and that applies within all the various sectors. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has therefore proposed that four management committees be set up. This is an area that I want the Commission to keep a careful eye on and that it should also report on. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would like a progress report to be drawn up two years down the line. We shall then have to look more closely at the number of management committees. We must look at the organisation and at the support we receive from experts, and we must take an overall look at how this very important area – the market sector - operates.</p>
      <p sl="da">In conclusion, I should like to wish the Commission good luck. I am convinced that it will continue to be possible for the Commission and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to cooperate in this area.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to our rapporteur Mr Busk for the truly constructive, collegial and – in my opinion – very good work he has done in cooperation with the other members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have all been calling for a simplification of the CAP and the market organisations for a long time. I am delighted that it is agricultural policy, the only policy really brought within the Community, that is prepared to take this course. I warmly welcome the fact that these 21 regulations on sector-specific market organisations are being combined into a single Regulation, and thus that the legal framework is being streamlined.</p>
      <p sl="de">The rapporteur has already specified the benefits of this single common market organisation. In my opinion, the CAP should be managed by means of the four basic regulations. I fully agree with the rapporteur that this can only be a matter of technical changes, which are dealt with by the Commission, and not of changes to political decisions. We, as representatives and Members of the European Parliament, want to, and must, insist on having codecision powers and on participating in dealing with these issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also consider it important that the wine and the fruit and vegetables sectors be exempted, as the process of reform for these is not yet complete. I am also in favour of the special management committees, as, particularly in very specific matters, things cannot just be lumped together.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and say on behalf of my group that this is a very successful report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In theory, I cannot believe that anyone could object to the principles of simplifying, streamlining and removing bureaucracy announced by the Commission in this proposal to bring the 21 current regulations under one single regulation. Anything that can be done to remove or reduce the bureaucratic intricacies woven by agricultural policy while it has been in force, which in some cases have been the most surreal puzzle for farmers, has to be applauded.</p>
      <p sl="pt">When it comes to the practical benefits of the proposal for farmers’ lives, one cannot help but feel a certain amount of disappointment. The proposal is a good exercise in codification, insofar as it brings a series of dispersed rules under one single text. I also welcome the inclusion of the new common market organisations (CMOs) for various products thus far covered by standards that did not constitute genuine CMOs and the fact that other rules adopted by the Council not currently part of CMOs have been brought under the same regulation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The reduction in the number of management committees will also certainly lead to some savings for the Commission’s budget, although there is a serious risk of a drop in the technical level. All of these are real gains for the Commission services but, let me repeat, I do not expect real gains for the farmers, who are the biggest victims of the complexity of the bureaucratic system.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For these reasons, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament gives the benefit of the doubt to the Commission’s proposal, and seeks to contribute by means of amendments on its initiative and by supporting others aimed at improving upon the proposal. Examples of this include re-establishing the balance of powers between the Commission and the Council, clarification and strengthening of the role of interbranch organisations and the guarantee of adequate involvement of the Member States in a more limited number of management committees, with the aim of ensuring that the technical quality is kept at an acceptable level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We also support the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development aimed at excluding the CMOs under review from the new regulation, as we believe that their inclusion at this time could lead to less compliance among participants with the ongoing process, the conclusion of which cannot and must not be brought forward.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission will hopefully welcome these constructive suggestions, which I am sure Parliament will adopt by a resounding majority.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Lastly, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I should like to commend the work of the rapporteur, Mr Busk, and all those who helped to achieve a broad consensus on the core issues.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the initiative to simplify the common agricultural policy and to adopt more comprehensible and transparent legal norms deserves our support, but on condition that the new regulation does not end up imposing yet another set of technical – supposedly universal – standards on the Community.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This begs the question as to whether such wide-ranging simplification is not tantamount to restricting specialisation, and the loss of sensitivity to specific agricultural conditions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Commission assures us that these are merely technical amendments, but in reality it also wants to take some of the powers away from the Council. The Commission also assures us that all decisions of a political nature are taken in accordance with Article 37 of the EU Treaty, after consultation with the European Parliament. But we know that this is not the case. One instance of this rule being infringed was the sugar market reform.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, please allow me to re-iterate the fundamental facts of discrimination against the new Member States in the framework of the so-called ‘common’ agricultural policy. And note that these statistics come from EU institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For example, in 2004 the new Member States had 22% of the total farmland, but received just under 4% in subsidies. Per-hectare agricultural and rural development subsidies in 2007 were EUR 148 per hectare for the new Member States, and EUR 366 per hectare for the old Member States. A similar imbalance is expected for 2013, which means we face ten years of discrimination against the new Member States, thereby losing the opportunity to build up a strong European agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Imbalances in the allocation of milk quotas persist. Holland, which has one-eighth of the farmland that Poland has, has a higher milk quota. As regards the sugar market, the reform mainly favours the old Member States, which are the ones responsible for over-production in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="pl">And finally, the fruit and vegetable market, where some EUR 700 million are allocated to producers’ organisations. 90% of these subsidies go to three Member States where they go to a narrow circle of the most powerful producers’ organisations. The processed fruit and vegetables market currently enjoys EUR 775 million of subsidies, of which more than 86% go to just three old Member States, and 2.5% goes to the new Member States. All new Member States receive one-tenth of the average for one old Member State.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, in his speech before this House on 25 of April this year, the Indian President Abdul Kalam said amongst others that achieving a lasting solution required ‘righteousness in the heart’. His message was warmly received with ovations by yourselves.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The agricultural market reforms we are discussing today has many good points: it will simplify legislation and reduce administrative costs, and make the lives of farmers easier. But it has one fundamental flaw, and that is that it does not have ‘righteousness in the heart’, as it fails to correct the unfair subsidies for farmers on individual markets. It affects mainly the poorer farmers in the new Member States. The poor get less, and the rich more. This has nothing to do with fundamental principles of the European Union, such as solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The rules of the CAP are blatantly breached in many markets. Repeated attempts to introduce fair subsidies for farmers in particular markets have proved ineffective. Statistical data showing clear discrimination have been ignored.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Commission’s present proposal retains some of the organisational defects of individual markets. It is artificial, unfair and cut off from the real situation. Voting for simplification in this situation is voting for continued injustice and discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="pl">So I appeal mainly to the Members representing the new Member States: do not vote for simplification, because despite its apparent merits, it discriminates against your farmers. At the same time I appeal to the representatives of old Member States: do you know that financial discrimination against the new states is a threat to the future of the entire European Union, and perpetuates the division of the EU into rich and poor by denying the idea of building a strong Europe capable of competing on the global market?</p>
      <p sl="pl">For this reason I am voting against the Commission’s proposal and against adopting this report. While I realise that simplifying legislation is necessary, it should only happen when individual markets have been organised fairly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, consolidation of 21 regulations on sector-specific common market organisations into a single regulation which combines all sectors as a simplification step is welcome. But it is the impact delivered on the ground that really matters. Simplification must translate into noticeable improvements in terms of a lesser bureaucratic burden for the agri-food sector right across the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I have one major concern: we must not denude the new management committee – or committees, if it be that – of the valuable expertise which existed on the outgoing sectoral management committees. A super CMO which, on the face of it, ticks the boxes of regulation reduction but which diminishes expert sectoral input would only be a short-term gain. A triumph of bureaucrats over experts from the sectors is not a good deal. Sectoral expertise has been valuable and must be preserved. Thus, I think we need to hear more from the Commission in terms of assurances and indications as to how sectoral expertise will, in fact, be retained, utilised and respected.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, today we are debating the simplification of CAP legislation. On the table is the creation of a unified common agricultural market organisation in place of the 21 sectors that currently exist. We will be able to abrogate 41 Council regulations containing more than 600 articles and replace them by one single regulation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These activities obviously deserve a positive response, if they lead to an improvement in EU legislation and will be more readily understood by farmers and taxpayers. However, it all appears somewhat unrealistic. Let me give you an example: the paying authority in Poland is now accepting applications for direct payments for the third time. This year they have been so simplified that we were late in submitting them because the farmers had problems filling them in. The whole idea of simplification will be technical in nature, and therefore cannot by metamorphosed in the latest CAP reform. Removing intervention purchases for the pork meat market is not acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also tread carefully on the matter of transferring the Council’s regulatory authority to the Commission, as it may give Member States less say in the decision-making process concerning the functioning of the first pillar of the CAP. Another question that arises is what is the point of making all of these changes, when we are in the process of reforming the fruit and vegetable and wine markets anyway, and we do not know the results of the 2008 health check which will generally determine the future of the CAP.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my view, we should streamline and simplify the system of direct payments in the EU 27 particularly, and equalise the rates of subsidies, and only then can we talk of equal conditions for competition. As regards the simplicity of the SAPS system, we should consider its simplification for the EU 15. Let us hope that this simplification, and the creation of a harmonised common market (…)</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good report. He is a very experienced Member of this House and I would have expected nothing less from him.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no doubt that the need to streamline decision-making and removing red tape from the common agricultural policy is a primacy of importance. It is my view that if we have to harmonise – and we must have harmonisation – we should always harmonise up to the best possible standard. It is clear that better regulation can be achieved. I do not want more and more civil servants – let me make that very clear – either in Brussels or in Member States making more difficulties for the farmers trying to do their job on the ground, creating and developing more problems than we would like to solve. Yes, we need better regulation, but we also need more transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I share Mr Busk’s view on the need to keep intervention for pig meat, because this sector does – as we have experienced on numerous occasions – from time to time go into over-production, which is very difficult to control. I believe that, for short periods, we require support in that sector. I also believe that it would be going much too far, in the short term, to reduce the advisory committees, as we require a high degree of expertise on what can be extremely delicate issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would give qualified support to the Commission to consolidate the existing 21 regulations. It is my belief that we need less regulation, not more. This is a welcome start, and I trust we can look forward to the health check to bring forward even more deregulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us destroy red tape in the common agricultural policy forever.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate Niels Busk for his report in such a difficult area as the creation of a harmonised and common organisation for agricultural markets.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Replacing the 21 common market organisations by a single horizontal Regulation of the Council for a single market organisation will undoubtedly lead to a simplification and improvement of the legal structure of the first pillar of the CAP, and to greater transparency in agricultural legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, we must not forget that creating a uniform, common market organisation is a process of technical simplification which cannot incorporate elements of policy change. The work currently underway on the new directive cannot mean the endorsement of the adopted rules of the CAP, and should not be a pretext for changing political decisions already taken in respect of agricultural policy. In this regard, the Commission’s proposal to remove the intervention group on the pig meat market, which in Poland at least is so important, is unjustified.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Commission’s proposal to create a single committee to manage the common organisation of agricultural markets also arouses doubts in me. Can one committee with a limited number of national experts function properly? Will this solution not result in a limitation of the influence of Member States on the administration of market instruments? How does the Commission intend to ensure the full representation of national expertise in the committee-based process? Would the above not indicate the need for at least a few management committees, including separate committees for the meat, milk and vegetable markets?</p>
      <p sl="pl">And one final question: As regards extending the authority of the Commission, I would like to say that the competences of the Council can only be transferred to the European Commission on technical matters which do not have any effect on the functioning of the agricultural markets. This means that the authority to define quality standards and the system of classifying carcasses on the beef, veal and pork markets, the authority to determine trading standards on the egg, poultry and live plant market should be within the competence of the Council, and not the European Commission. Furthermore, any questions of a political nature should continue to be discussed with the Council and Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, this was a very interesting discussion, I should like to thank you very much for it.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, let me recall that this exercise is indeed about simplification and not about another reform of the CAP or a redistribution of aid as some have feared. I think it also revealed that there are quite a few points which I can accept or where I am certain that acceptable solutions will eventually be found, notably on the carcass classification, the reference to potato starch quotas and also a clause giving a further assurance that the status quo for producer and inter-branch organisations is maintained.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as the fruit and vegetable and wine sectors are concerned, and their inclusion in the single CMO from the outset and as regards the kind of management committee, I have already made my point.</p>
      <p sl="en">In some cases the report is asking to go beyond the status quo of what we have today. I do not think we should introduce any such amendments on this occasion as that would change the character of the exercise. Concerning the set-up of the management committee – a matter raised by Mr Busk – organising four subsections would go against the idea of a single CMO and make the new committee unnecessarily inflexible. But we can assure you that the Commission is determined to organise the meetings of the single committee in such a way as to include the necessary expertise and take account of the specificities of the sectors concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also make very clear that with regard to the role of the European Parliament, technical decisions and market management decisions need to be decided at Commission level. In no way is the Commission receiving powers to amend substantive or any other policy decisions. Therefore Parliament is not being bypassed. The Commission’s powers will be restricted to implementing rules. I can assure you of that.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to pigmeat, I am not so certain why an instrument that has not been used in more than 30 years should still be considered as a basic policy decision that needs to be maintained.</p>
      <p sl="en">In concluding, let me stress once again in answer to the points raised regarding the complexity and the bureaucracy of the CAP, this is just a first step. Others will follow.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0141/2007) by Béla Glattfelder, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (COM(2006)0755 – C6-0044/2007 – 2006/0256(CNS)).</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, the Commission has followed with great interest the debate in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on Mr Glattfelder’s report. We are dealing with a sensitive issue here.</p>
      <p sl="en">Doing away with an instrument such as maize intervention, as the Commission has proposed, is never easy. But in this case it is necessary and the evidence shows that we are faced with a structural problem with maize intervention. It is no longer a safety net but has become a real market outlet. In one Member State about one third of the harvest in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 was offered to intervention. Farmers are producing directly for intervention. Is this normal at a time where market prices are at a normal level? EU maize intervention stocks doubled from 2003-2004 to 2004-2005 from 2.8 million tonnes to 5.6 million tonnes. If this growth continues, the European Union will have 15.6 million tonnes in its stocks by 2013. This is hardly a development the Commission wants to see at a time when the CAP reforms are doing away with stocks in other commodities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report suggests that the Commission’s proposal is inconsistent with the principle of legitimate expectations, is founded on incorrect market estimates and would have negative effects on cereal markets. I would like to explain why the Commission does not share these views, beginning with the legitimate expectations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Farmers’ sowing decisions are based on a series of considerations and mainly the marketability of their crop. The Commission’s proposal does not interfere with the broad range of potential commercial outlets for maize. Market and income stability are not threatened in any way and the legitimate expectations of farmers are fully preserved.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the economics of the proposal, I would stress that Commission’s estimates are based on long-term trends. Forecasts by independent research institutes support the Commission’s own analysis that maintaining the status quo is simply not sustainable. The lack of intervention offers during the ongoing campaign and the resale of intervention stocks in the internal market cannot be presented as conclusive evidence that the market has found a new balance. Indeed, this is far from the case and the economics of maize production indicate that with price levels back to normal maize will once again be offered massively to intervention in some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission sees from this that there is a need to act. We cannot defend a simple status quo. It is not in the interests of the agricultural sector to insist on a scheme that so clearly has departed from its original objective. We wanted to act quickly and we proposed abolishing the scheme immediately, but we realise that this would create some difficulties. We are therefore prepared to discuss a phased reduction of the maize intervention scheme. This could be done over a period of two years and then we would have the opportunity to assess and discuss the future of the scheme in the context of the health check. Commissioner Fischer Boel is prepared to have such a discussion. But for the Parliament simply to refuse any considerations on altering the maize intervention scheme, as proposed by Mr Glattfelder, is not acceptable to the Commission. We therefore sincerely hope that the European Parliament will not support the recommendation to reject the Commission’s proposal and will instead engage in a debate on how to design a phased reduction of the unsustainable maize intervention scheme.</p>

    <intervention id="3-432" speaker_id="28145" name="Béla Glattfelder" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="hu">We can examine the proposal of the European Commission from two perspectives, and I hope you will pay attention to what I am about to say. The first perspective is whether the proposal is justified, the second is whether it is lawful.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As far as the first perspective is concerned, our task is fairly easy, for what we need to examine is whether the reasons offered in the submitted proposal are still valid today. Half a year ago, when the Commission submitted its proposal, it claimed that by now, by this day, there would be 9 million tonnes and by the end of this year 11 million tonnes of intervention corn. This has not turned out to be the case.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The intervention stocks currently comprise only 3 million tonnes, rather than 9 million, and at present the stocks are not increasing, there was no intervention offer in 2006, and there will not be any in 2009 either. The stocks are steadily decreasing, and by the end of the year intervention stocks may even reach zero, instead of 11 million tonnes.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The current prices are considerably higher than the intervention price. Contrary to the justification offered by the Commission, the market prospects for corn are good. It would be worth it for the Commission to read its own market forecasts. Last week DG Agriculture published an entirely new market forecast. According to this report, prices will continue to rise. Consumption in the EU is growing more rapidly than production. We should not base our present decisions on the flawed forecasts of half a year ago, but on these most recent predictions, which are supported by market trends.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Let me add that since 2004 sales of intervention stocks have in every case been at prices above the intervention price. The EU gets more money for corn than the amount for which it bought it. At the moment the price of corn in Hungary is around 130 euro, as compared to the intervention price of 101 euro. For the corn growers, however, in 2005 the buying up of the stock made it possible to avoid a loss of around 200 million euro. Sales of the produce that was bought up has in turn made it possible for livestock farmers, primarily in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Poland to purchase feed at prices well below those of the world market.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Over the past four years, not only did European growers benefit from the intervention, but consumers did as well. The Commission began, however, to panic because during two years of record production, intervention stocks rose significantly. Now there is no longer any reason for panic. During years of lower production it was proven that stocks began to fall, and according to the latest forecasts made by the Commission, these stocks will continue in future to remain at a low level. It can be established, therefore, that the proposal, in the form in which the Commission submitted it, is no longer justified, and the original reasons for it have turned out to be false.</p>
      <p sl="hu">So let us look at whether the proposal is lawful. The proposal seeks to terminate intervention as from this year. The farmers already planted their corn back in April, the plants have sprouted and are now this big. Please, look at this: this is how big the corn is! I picked this corn here along the Rhine. I hope the grower will not be angry about this, for after all I am defending his interests and rights as well. Even the European Commission cannot order this corn back into the ground.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Naturally, the growers had to prepare for sowing quite a while ago. In the autumn they set aside the field in which they would plant corn. They ordered the planting seed and plant protection products, and spent money on these things. During the year, any sort of restriction to the intervention system constitutes a retroactive regulation. This is a serious breach of legal security and of growers’ legitimate expectations.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The European Union, which is so proud of its principles and its liberal rule of law, cannot allow this to happen. This proposal is not only contrary to our principles, but also to the Commission’s own earlier practice. In the course of earlier reforms – sugar reform, the abolition of the rye intervention – they allowed sufficient time for preparation. For instance, when the rye intervention was abolished, a year went by between the publication of the regulation and its implementation. Why do the corn growers not have a right to equal treatment? Are they not equal citizens of the European Union? If this can be done to the farmers, who will be next?</p>
      <p sl="hu">If the European Parliament does not protect citizens’ rights, how can it protect its own rights? For in this case this is what is needed. The Council in fact did not wait for the opinion of Parliament to be accepted. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development already decided last week to abolish the intervention with retroactive effect. They also decided that at the next Council of Ministers meeting, they would vote on this without debate.</p>
      <p sl="hu">No matter what decision we take, we can no longer influence the Council. Tomorrow we will not be deciding on the future of the common agricultural policy, but will debate this instead within the context of the ‘health check’. We will decide that we do not accept regulations with retroactive effect, and now we can afford to be honest, we can stick to our principles, which means that we must reject the Commission’s unlawful proposal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and express the view that I hold quite strongly that I can see his difficulty, given the Member State he comes from.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that if there is to be a change in policy it has to be phased in over a period, regardless of what policy it is, to allow for production to adapt to change.</p>
      <p sl="de">When I became a Member of this Parliament – a number of years ago now – we had butter mountains, we had milk lakes, we had cold stores bursting at the seams with beef. And now to a large extent all this is behind us. We have come through many reforms of the common agricultural policy that have taken place over the years, from MacSharry to Agenda 2000 to the Mid-Term Review, and now – the Commissioner is not with us tonight and I know why – we await the proposals for the health check.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are living in a world of changing markets and it can be very difficult to speculate upon what future prices may be at any particular time. You only have to look at the present world prices for milk to see the change that can occur in a very short period of time.</p>
      <p sl="de">Intervention can be nothing but a short-term solution for farmers because in the long term they will achieve better returns from the market. I believe the new Member States must look in the long term to other solutions for maize, rather than simply for food. There is an alternative use where it can be put to even greater good for everyone. I believe the new Member States should investigate the alternatives and we should support them in this. In the long term they will be more rewarding than continuing in intervention.</p>
      <p sl="de">There must be some degree of compromise in this particular area between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. I believe that the four compromise amendments recognising the problem of the new Member States represent the best way to move forward.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the European Commission’s planned changes in the current system of cereal market intervention by excluding maize from the scheme intend to resolve the problem of the year on year increase in the maize surplus.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree with the Commission’s arguments on the need to reform the mechanism of intervention, but implementing the planned changes overnight may do more harm than good. Reforming the cereal market should be gradual, and the measures taken should solve the existing problem in a comprehensive manner. Farmers must be given enough time to prepare for the changes. Instead of suddenly excluding maize from the intervention scheme, one solution would be to maintain intervention until 2008, and then gradually reduce or phase out the maize intervention scheme by establishing maximum intervention limits for individual Member States depending on their production levels, as is currently the case with the rice market (such a solution would increase the transparency of the system and make it easier to control the market); and eventually to maintain the maize intervention scheme for a transitional period of two years, as long as control is tightened to avoid the accumulation of excessive surpluses.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These solutions would allow us to phase out maize intervention without suddenly upsetting the market, as it is not just an intervention scheme, but also an export support scheme from the free market in the form of export refunds. In this context we also need to modify our current export support instruments for cereals from the free market to enable the export of goods from countries with unfavourable locations such as Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. The main market for EU cereal exports is North Africa and the Middle East, which means that for the countries mentioned any exported cereals require expensive sea transportation over a longer distance than cereals exported from ports in the west or the south of Europe. This solution would also increase the efficiency of cereal exports. This mechanism is also worth maintaining in the coming economic year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Please do not regard my speech as an attempt to purely and solely express my solidarity with the wonderful Hungarian people (according to the famous Polish and Hungarian proverb ‘Poles and Hungarians are brothers, both in the sword and in the glass’, although in this case I would say ‘Poles and Hungarians are brothers, both in the sword and in cereal’, which in Hungarian would be lengyel, magyar két jóbarát, együtt harcol s arat gabonát), but rather as a means of logically phasing out the maize intervention scheme.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The cereals market has changed since 2003. In neighbouring countries such as Ukraine and Russia, once the granary of Europe, local and European capital has been invested in cereal and pig breeding. A powerful rival to European Union agriculture is emerging.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The maize crop has already been planted, and we cannot change the conditions of maize intervention for farmers in the middle of the production cycle. The idea of excluding only maize from the regulation could have unintended repercussions on the entire cereal market. The demand for cereals, including maize, will increase with increased consumption of meat, as will their use for the developing biofuels industry which is extremely important for the future of this market.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the European Commission’s original proposal to eliminate the maize intervention scheme from the 2007-2008 economic year is unacceptable. I join my Hungarian colleagues in opposing this radical restriction on intervention in the market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Whilst it is true that there is room for change, instead of throwing out the intervention scheme altogether we should provide opportunities for the EU cereals market to develop and be supported. Not so long ago, the Commission adopted very harsh criteria relating to maize intervention; perhaps we should wait and see how the results of these restrictions turn out. Furthermore, the Commission should take current market trends into account. There are EU Member States that have to import maize to meet their demand. For this reason we should first of all improve the fluidity and operation of this market within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Commission has to develop proper solutions requiring the effective removal of cereal surpluses from countries which are unfavourably located, and where transport costs are significantly higher. For example, we should support the export of cereals to third countries, and in particular those countries situated in a difficult location. If EU limits are placed on the purchase of maize, as our German colleagues and the Council propose in their amendments, it seems that the best solution would to share the limits among the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">În primul rând, eliminarea stocului de intervenţie la porumb reprezintă o schimbare din mers a politicii agricole comune. După un efort susţinut de transpunere şi adaptare la legislaţia europeană în agricultură, şi ţin să vă amintesc că este vorba de un corp de legi care însumează în jur de 20 de mii de pagini, agricultorii români au devenit participanţi la o politică instabilă şi care le înşeală aşteptările. Indiferent de calităţile politicii de intervenţie, dacă aceasta este o măsură bună sau nu, aceasta nu trebuie schimbată înainte de a avea o discuţie generală între toate instituţiile Uniunii şi statele membre. Această discuţie este prevăzută să aibă loc în cadrul controlului sănătăţii finanţelor europene din 2008-2009. De asemenea, o reformă cuprinzătoare a politicii agricole comune nu trebuie şi nu poate fi pusă în practică înainte de 2013. Cert este faptul că măsura propusă de Comisie creează efecte retroactive. La fel ca şi în Ungaria şi alte state membre, agricultorii români au semănat deja cultura de porumb şi este nedrept faţă de ei ca în cazul unor surplusuri neabsorbite de piaţă să nu beneficieze de plasa de siguranţă ce o reprezintă stocul de intervenţie.</p>
      <p sl="en">Doamnelor şi domnilor, România a devenit după aderare al doilea producător din Uniune, cu o cotă estimată de 17 procente. Comisia a argumentat că sistemul intervenţiei este abuzat de fermierii din Uniune pentru care stocul de intervenţie a devenit un debuşeu comercial important, dar acest argument nu este universal valabil, nu se poate în nici un fel spune că planificarea agricultorilor români ar fi depins de un calcul prealabil privind vânzarea către intervenţie. Dacă vor apărea stocuri în România, acest lucru va reprezenta pur şi simplu şi va rezulta din mecanismele pieţei. De asemenea, vreau să accentuez faptul că susţin raportul domnului Glattfelder aşa cum este el. Amendamentele depuse la propunerea de regulament nu corectează neajunsurile documentului legislativ, întrucât orice limitare impusă posterior campaniei de semănare, indiferent de amploarea ei, este incorectă faţă de agricultori.

      <p sl="en">An important point concerns the question of whether legitimate expectations of growth were respected. The Commission is convinced that they were and that they are still. The maize-sowing season is in March and April. Farmers deciding to plant maize in the spring of 2007 are aware that there might not be any intervention for the 2007 harvest. In this regard, a communication to maize producers was published in the Official Journal in December 2006.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was mentioned that we have not seen major offers of maize intervention in the current market year. This is true. However, the current high prices for cereals are not driven by the internal market but by the situation in the international market. The boom in the bioethanol industry, particularly in the USA, has also played a role in keeping cereal prices high. Situations change from one year to the next. It is possible that the 2007-2008 marketing year might be similar to the last two marketing years, with massive intervention offers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another issue that was raised is that this proposal moves the problem from maize to other cereals. As I have explained, this proposal is aimed at solving the current maize problem. It is true that the removal of maize intervention could lead to a relative loss of competitiveness for barley and possibly soft wheat, triggering the risk of increasing public stocks for cereals. A full examination of the cereal intervention system is certainly necessary. This will be done in the framework of the health check.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although the discussion has clarified some points, it has also confirmed that the fundamentals of the Commission’s proposals are right. As I made clear in my opening statement, the maize sector needs this proposal. The Commission is prepared to be flexible in finding options to provide operators with a soft landing but it cannot simply agree to maintain the status quo. As already stated, the Commission is also ready to accept a phasing-out over two years, as many have requested. If the Glattfelder report is adopted in its present form as a rejection of the Commission proposal, Mrs Fischer Boel will certainly go back to the College, but her position on this issue remains quite clear.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission intends to stop the maize intervention scheme right from the 2007/2008 economic year. The apparent aim is to avoid the surplus from increasing. Unfortunately, this step is ill-considered and pointless, particularly as the Commission has agreed to import genetically modified maize in large quantities. The Commission does not seem to comprehend the consequences of this decision, both for the cereal market and for the pig meat market.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my view, the Commission should think and act differently, which is to continue payments for environmental crops, and impose a complete ban on genetically modified maize, and protect our market from such products from third markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">This will be a healthier and more responsible attitude to the natural environment, and will give an opportunity to increase demand for our agricultural products.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I must express serious objections in connection with the proposal by the European Commission to put an end to the corn intervention. This is yet another example of the European Commission neglecting to consider in particular the interests of the new Member States. This measure is completely unlawful, since by December the growers had already bought the seeds for planting corn and signed their contracts, and can therefore no longer transform their production mechanisms. The proposal is all the stranger because not quite two months before it was made, the rules for purchasing corn under the intervention regime were changed, which suggests that the European Commission is flailing around without any particular ideas. The European Court of Justice will be starting hearings on this case in a matter of days, upon the submission made by the Hungarian Government.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Putting an end to the intervention system is unjustified, and is to the disadvantage of the entire Union, since according to prognoses, in a few years there may even be a shortage of corn with the EU. Our competitive position on an international scale will suffer if the abolition of the corn intervention now leads to a fall in prices.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This step may call into question the solidarity of the Union in the eyes of Hungarian and European growers.</p>
