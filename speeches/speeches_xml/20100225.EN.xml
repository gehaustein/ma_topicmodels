      <p sl="es">Mr President, yesterday, because of the time it took to get through our work here in the House, there was no opportunity to mention the recent death of Orlando Zapata, which the Spanish delegation sincerely laments. He died after a long hunger strike. He is the first prisoner of conscience to die in Cuba in 40 years, and we are calling here for the release of all prisoners of conscience in Cuba and in the rest of the world. We would also like to express our solidarity with his family and with the Cuban people on their path to pluralism and development.</p>
      <p sl="es">This very sad occasion could act as a catalyst for a discussion aimed at positioning the relations between the European Union and Cuba, within a comprehensive bilateral framework providing for permanent, constructive dialogue on human rights, on an equal footing with the European Union’s agreements with third countries.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0014/2010) by Maria do Céu Patrão Neves, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy (COM(2009)0163 - 2009/2106(INI)).</p>

      <p sl="pt">Permit me to address a few words to the group of 50 fishermen who should be entering the Chamber just now, and who are here to watch this debate and the vote on the report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I think I can speak for all my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, who have worked hard on this report, when I say that I am very happy that this day has arrived, the day on which the report is to be presented to Parliament and put to the vote. Why? Because the common fisheries policy is one of the flagship policies of the European Union. It had a rather difficult start, having been formally launched in the 80s and undergoing its first reform in 2002. Today, we are aware of some of the main problems that were identified back then (I am referring to overcapacity, overfishing, and overinvestment that, it appears, was not equal across the whole EU), because these problems are still largely present today.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is the starting point for the reform, a reform that has to be broad and intensive, and which has long been awaited by the industry.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Which direction should this reform take, according to the content of our report? Firstly, in terms of basic principles, there needs to be a balance between environmental, social and economic aspects. Environmental aspects are needed to guarantee the conservation of stocks; social aspects to guarantee the advancement and dignity of the profession; and economic aspects to guarantee that the industry can generate income. Without these three aspects, we will not have any fisheries in the European Union, or, at least, there will be none that are sustainable and capable of developing, which is what we all want.</p>
      <p sl="pt">How should these general principles, aimed at reducing fishing, making more profit and conserving stocks better, be implemented? The report points out certain fundamental aspects: investment in decentralisation; promoting the empowerment of fishermen and the entire fishing industry to have decision-making powers; giving them greater involvement in managing fishing, which will also allow a policy of compliance and responsibility; the need to draw a distinction between small-scale and industrial fleets, with specific regulations for each; the need to appraise management models that are better adapted to different fishing areas and different types of fisheries; the importance of strengthening the market by fishing that is aimed at value-added products and increasing the first-sale price; linking subsidies with good practice; regulation of the modernisation of the fleet in terms of safety and hygiene; decisive development of aquaculture, which is ecologically sustainable within the European Union; and the development of other sectors involved in catching or processing fish. We should not forget to draw attention to the growing role of women in fisheries either, and the need to require that fishery products from third countries, which are imported to the EU, be subject to the same requirements as those of our producers. This means certification, labelling, traceability and, finally, the integration of fisheries into European maritime policy within the broader context of enhancing its capacity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let me finish by saying that the work that we present here today is the product of a joint effort by all the members of the Committee on Fisheries, particularly the shadow rapporteurs, with whom we worked very hard, and also with the Commission, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the advisor to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and other advisors to other political groups, and, of course, my office and my assistant for fisheries. The work that we are presenting here today represents a truly joint effort, and we hope that it will be adopted here too.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the Presidency also welcomes this debate in the European Parliament as it is an important contribution to the broad consultation procedure on the Green Paper, and the European Parliament’s contributions should therefore be given serious consideration by the Commission when it draws up its legislative proposals.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Council is also going to examine carefully all of Parliament’s opinions to enable it to subsequently examine and adopt the legislative proposals under the ordinary legislative procedure.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Green Paper of April 2009 looks at various structural constraints in the common fisheries policy: overcapacity, lack of precise objectives, adoption of short-term decisions, lack of responsibility in the sector and poor compliance in general.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Green Paper also set out possible ways of combating these structural constraints and looked at important issues such as the differentiated regimes for industrial fleets and small-scale coastal fleets, waste, relative stability, transferable individual rights, greater orientation towards the markets, integration of the common fisheries policy into the broader maritime policy context, public financing and the external dimension of the CFP.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Member States, both individually and jointly in the Council, are studying in detail all aspects of the questions concerned. The first consultation phase ended in December 2009 and the Commission has received 1 700 proposals and held more than 125 meetings and seminars to date.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second phase, which will begin on 1 September of this year, will analyse the contributions made and discuss the main ideas. In January, the Commission organised seminars on the key elements of the reform and on rights-based fisheries management, and even today there is a seminar on small-scale fishing. The impact assessment will be conducted in March. The European Fisheries Fund and the future financial perspective will be dealt with in April, followed by the external dimension in May, and waste and selectivity in June.</p>
      <p sl="es">On 2 and 3 May, the conference being organised jointly by the Presidency and the Commission will be held in La Coruña. It will deal with three fundamental elements of the reform, namely governance, stock management and the differentiation between large-scale and small-scale fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="es">On 4 and 5 May, the ministers will meet in Vigo to examine the results of the conference, and it is possible that the June Council will include in its agenda an informal debate on a working document concerning possible changes.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the third phase, as I said before, which will begin in the second half of 2010, the Commission will present a White Paper and, subsequently, four legislative proposals: the basic regulation, the new COM, technical measures and the new regulation on financing. The objective is for the CFP to enter into force, with the new reform, on 1 January 2013.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Council has yet to adopt a position in this respect; it will only adopt formal decisions on the basis of the legislative proposals it receives from the Commission in 2011, and it will do so in accordance with the rules on the ordinary legislative procedure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, since this is my first speech as a Commissioner to the Members of this House, I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to address the European Parliament. I feel very honoured to be here with you and discuss the reform of the common fisheries policy, which is a core issue for the whole sector. I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Neves, on her hard work in bringing together different positions into a consistent document. I could not agree more that we need radical reform to turn around the structural failings of our policy. As you all know, the last reform in 2002 was not sufficiently successful.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now we have to tackle all the past deficits, to achieve better results from an environmental, social and economic aspect. The public consultation has shown clearly that there is broad support for this reform. Of course, I will not be able to respond today to all issues raised in your report, which is due to be voted on. However, I bear in mind your compromise amendments on sustainability, over-capacity, small-scale fisheries, horizontal decentralisation, phasing-out of discards, new fisheries agreements and deployment in the fishing sector. I am very thankful for your constructive input.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to highlight two specific issues: first, public funding. I believe we have to focus our subsidies to achieve better results by steering them towards the objectives of our policy. For example, instead of supporting the building of new vessels, we should support innovation for selectivity and greening and help producer organisations respond to the future challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I share your views on the social dimension: we want a fishery which creates attractive and safe jobs. Today I am looking forward to hearing your proposals during this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also inform you of our next steps. We will prepare a summary report on last year’s consultation which will help us prepare the proposals for the new policy. We are organising workshops to discuss specific topics with stakeholders, the institutions and the Member States. Together with the Spanish Presidency, a broad conference of CFP reform will be held in May.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know, and it has already been mentioned, that there is a technical workshop taking place in the Commission at this very moment, with participants from all over Europe. I am sorry that you cannot attend this workshop. This workshop was organised a long time ago. I will try, if at all possible, to make sure that meetings do not clash in future.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the basis of this input, in late 2010, we will start to develop our proposals to be adopted in the Commission in spring 2011. This large consultation process will culminate in a very fruitful discussion with you. You, as colegislators, will then have a major role to play in shaping the new policy together with the Council. I am really looking forward to cooperating with you.</p>

    <intervention id="4-013" speaker_id="97193" name="Antonello Antinoro" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Council for its comments, and I would like to thank and wish the best of luck to the new Commissioner – who is making her debut today in this House – for the work that we are preparing to carry out.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that what we are implementing is important, and I hope that this Green Paper, which we are beginning to discuss today and which we will vote on later, does not end up as it did in 2002.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, however, the European Parliament finds itself in a different position. We have the ordinary legislative procedure and the Treaty of Lisbon, and therefore I believe that we will all have to take advantage of them in order to meet the objectives.</p>
      <p sl="it">The key points have been described by our rapporteur, Mrs Patrão Neves, to whom we, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), express our gratitude for the work she has done, for the summary she has been able to present and for everything she has been able to outline.</p>
      <p sl="it">I merely wished to take the floor and to take advantage of this opportunity so as to broach the subject of fisheries, but by going beyond the normal Green Paper – and the White Paper that has been announced for June – and addressing the needs that exist in relation to Europe’s seas, and to the Mediterranean in particular.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today we need to set ourselves rules that we have already been imposing on our economy and on our fishermen for a number of years. However, coastal states, even those bordering Europe, have wilfully and often, indeed very often, ignored these rules, and we find ourselves in the paradoxical situation in which all this is imposed on our fishermen, while the others can do as they like.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, the European Commission has a different and more powerful role; it has a Minister for Foreign Affairs and a more powerful Parliament. My hope is that, within the Green Paper, and before embarking on the White Paper, we can work with third countries – those countries that are not part of the Union – in order to come up with shared and common rules to ensure that those who are subject to the rules do not feel betrayed or ignored by the Union and do not view the Union as an enemy rather than as a friend.</p>

      <p sl="es">Thank you, Mr Martín Fragueiro, welcome, and thank you, Mrs Damanaki.</p>
      <p sl="es">I, too, am speaking here for the first time on the topic of fisheries, and indeed we are facing a significant challenge in this area. We are obliged, and it is our responsibility, to define the guidelines that are going to guarantee the sustainability of the seas, fisheries and, in short, the planet itself.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are also talking about an important element of production in our countries, at our coasts, in our regions – an economic and cultural element that encompasses many values – and as you quite rightly said, Mrs Damanaki, there are problems with the 2002 reform.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to revise the principle of relative stability and we need to look for new approaches to management that are more flexible and more adaptable because there have been problems with the TACs and quotas. There have been problems because of the all-too-familiar discard issue, discards that we cannot allow for the sake of our fishermen or for the sake of our planet.</p>
      <p sl="es">The future reform of the CFP must ensure a sustainable fishing system and we are in favour of a new management system based on fishing effort. We have to be more open, we have to think about things and we have to try to make management more flexible.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to ensure widespread introduction of environmental criteria and differentiate between coastal fishing and deep sea fishing. This is important and it is something that the entire sector wants. We need to reduce the overcapacity of certain fleets. We also need to finalise the common organisation of the market and work out how to stabilise the market and how to reconcile it with fish imports from third countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">The fight against illegal fishing, which has been criticised and which has been ineffective to date, needs additional resources, harmonised sanctions and international agreements based on principles of law, principles of human rights and principles of compliance with the agreements.</p>
      <p sl="es">A financial framework, which you said must produce better results, has to produce better results than the current policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Above all, we need to think about the social dimension: we are talking about people and we have to ensure that they have dignity, have a sense of professionalism, are given professional recognition and have the economic capacity to survive.</p>
      <p sl="es">Of course, we must not forget about the integration of women, who represent the invisible side of the fisheries world. We must bring them to the forefront and make an extra effort for them.</p>
      <p sl="es">The reform of the fisheries policies is more than simply drawing up legislation. It means tackling an important part of the reform, from within the European Union, that is going to guarantee the sustainability of the seas, fishermen and part of the planet.</p>
      <p sl="es">As a result, we must be courageous in the face of the challenges, and being courageous means tackling a policy without any fear. We must leave our fears behind. We must tackle the situation head on and maintain the balance of the state, of the European Union and of the world.</p>

    <intervention id="4-015" speaker_id="96683" name="Carl Haglund" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, for those of us who have worked hard on this Green Paper and the report, it feels extremely good to have now got as far as plenary. First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our common fisheries policy needs to be reformed. For the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, it was important for the reform to be based on an ecosystem approach. The wording in this regard in the report is good. At the same time, we are facing a situation where serious problems need to be dealt with, like the discards, the enormous overcapacity that exists in some places and many other things besides. I am therefore pleased that we have been able to agree on measures to tackle these things in particular. Who really thinks that the EU’s discard policy is justifiable? I certainly do not.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Another important issue is the regionalisation of the common fisheries policy. Where the situation is so different in different places in Europe, it is important that decisions can be made and applied at regional level. Another welcome reform is the intention to introduce a separate approach for small-scale coastal fisheries. These are also issues that we brought up in the ALDE Group report.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As a Finn and someone who lives next to the Baltic Sea, I am also pleased about the statement relating to the possibility of taking measures to tackle oversized seal and cormorant populations, as this is one of the greatest threats to fisheries in the Baltic Sea.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I would like to mention the fisheries agreement with third countries. It is important for our policy in this regard to go hand in hand with the EU’s human rights policy. The agreement with Guinea is a good example of where Parliament voted against the agreement, and this points towards the route we should take in the future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am very happy to see how far the reform has progressed. We have a good Green Paper and I am certain that we will have a much better fisheries policy from 2013 onwards.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-016" speaker_id="96675" name="Isabella Lövin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, my eyes were opened to the EU’s common fisheries policy and its destructive consequences in 2002, when, following a majority vote in the Swedish Parliament, Sweden decided on a unilateral ban on cod fishing for a year, but was prevented from implementing it by the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Despite the fact the Sweden intended to compensate its commercial fishermen for the ban and the fact that researchers in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea had recommended a total ban on cod fishing for a number of years and despite the fact that the various cod stocks along the Swedish coast had been wiped out or reduced by between 70 and 90%, the principle of the common fisheries policy was more important. If everyone else overfishes, Sweden must overfish too, according to the Commission. In other words, exploitation was mandatory for EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The last reform of the fisheries policy was completed in 2002 and it has not proved capable of tackling the difficult problems that the fisheries industry was already facing ten years ago, namely that far too many vessels that are far too efficient are competing for far too few, and increasingly fewer, fish. The last vessels to catch bluefin tuna were subsidised by the EU as recently as 2005 in the Mediterranean. Between 2000 and 2008, EU taxpayers shelled out EUR 34 million to build and modernise tuna vessels at a time when stocks were on the verge of collapse. A similar logic is in evidence in the Baltic Sea. In recent years, the Swedish Board of Fisheries has paid out EUR 5.4 million to scrap some of the largest tuna fishing vessels – the same vessels that were built with the aid of EU money.</p>
      <p sl="sv">A radical reform of the fisheries policy is needed. We believe that all types of harmful subsidies must be stopped. EU vessels with tax-free fuel and access agreements provided by taxpayers are currently emptying African seas of vital food supplies and competing unfairly with African fishermen, while at the same time destroying ecosystems.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Ahead of today’s vote on the report on the Green Paper, I would call on all of my fellow Members to at least remove one bad paragraph from an otherwise largely excellent report. I am referring to paragraph 121, which states that the EU’s external fisheries policy should defend European fisheries interests. I do not think that it befits the EU to pursue such a policy in 2010.</p>

    <intervention id="4-017" speaker_id="96790" name="Marek Józef Gróbarczyk" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ECR Group">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, at the outset, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Patrão Neves for the effort she has put into the preparation of this report. Great determination is needed, as well as a sense of compromise, to create such a coherent document. This report is, however, only the basis for building future common fisheries policy, which requires thorough reconstruction and fundamental changes so that care for the natural environment can be reconciled with development of the historical heritage of fishing. The policy must be based on regionalisation, which will, itself, be based on the conditions prevailing in different regions. This will enable correct assessment based on opinions from within the fishing industry as well as scientific opinions, and the compromise which is adopted will ensure the fair and equal management of fishing.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The new fisheries policy must stimulate development of the industry in a Europe which is engulfed in the crisis, but it is also necessary to pay attention to the predatory industrial fishing being carried out particularly in the Baltic Sea, where healthy and valuable fish are being turned into fish meal for use on poultry and cattle farms, and, in exchange, the toxic Far East panga arrives on the tables of Europeans. This is a blow aimed at sustainable European coastal fishing, an industry which should be accorded particular care.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It also shows the necessity of establishing a rational and fair system of catches to replace the easily manipulated quota system. This is to give an equal chance to all fishermen in all countries of the European Union. The European Conservatives and Reformists endorse the report, in the hope that the current system will change.</p>

    <intervention id="4-018" speaker_id="96706" name="João Ferreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="pt">In its Green Paper, the Commission tries to establish a phased or unphased Community system of transferable fishing rights, or private property rights for access to the use of a public good, namely fish stocks.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This proposal was rejected when the last reform was carried out, but ten years on, the Commission is back in charge, and it is the one predicting the inevitable consequences of privatising stocks: the concentration of activity by groups with greater economic and financial power and the destruction of a substantial number of small-scale, coastal fisheries. It is revealing that the countries that opted for this route, such as Iceland, now want to withdraw, as they are confronted with the adverse consequences and perversities of this system.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Parliament should take a clear stance by rejecting this proposal. Incidentally, this solution is not any kind of guarantee that the sustainability of fish stocks will be protected, since the reduction and concentration of rights among a handful of operators does not necessarily mean a reduction in fishing effort, but simply the concentration of the exploitation of resources.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Protecting the sustainability of resources requires other measures, such as guaranteeing a fair return within the sector. This in turn requires intervention in the market and improved marketing in the sector, improving the first-sale price, increasing pay for work by fishermen, reducing the margins of middlemen and promoting fair distribution of added value throughout the value chain of this sector.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The reality of fisheries in the EU is complex and diverse. In these circumstances, the widely recognised importance of local government directly contradicts the institutional framework created by the Treaty of Lisbon, which sets out the conservation of marine biological resources as the sole remit of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We need management that is supported by scientific knowledge, and which takes account of the reality and specific features of each country, each fishing zone, each fleet, and the resources themselves. This means involving the fishermen in finding solutions and implementing them. This is very different from the mere decentralised implementation of a centrally defined policy.</p>

    <intervention id="4-019" speaker_id="96798" name="John Bufton" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the EFD Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to appeal to Commissioner Damanaki for sensitivity to Britain in the reworking of the common fisheries policy which seeks to include recreational sea angling in the regulation and control of sea fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thought the whole point of quotas was to prevent diminishing stocks. European fisheries policy has been so unsuccessful in achieving sustainability that 91% of fisheries are on course to be classified as overfished by 2015.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the problem is how waters are being fished, not by whom. Indiscriminate trawling and longline fishing empty our seas of marine life. But throwing back into the sea dead fish that have already been caught and are good for the table is surely the opposite of sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is sustainable fishing, however, is recreational sea angling, which is enjoyed by around a million people in the UK and which supports business thought to be worth around EUR 2 billion in tackle trade alone across the continent.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some 19 000 people are employed in some 1 300 businesses in England and Wales as a result of the recreational angling industry. Recreational sea anglers catch and remove from the sea only what they intend to eat, leaving small young fish to develop and breed, and throwing back what they do not strictly need. In some cases, they tag the fish first, contributing to conservation programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the Commission gets its way, they will be forced to land everything they catch and count their quota against the national one.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recreational sea angling supports ecologically sound self-sufficiency which, if practised by more people, would lessen the demand that currently fuels indiscriminate commercial fishing and puts whole species of marine life under threat.</p>
      <p sl="en">The common fisheries policy has always been prejudiced against the British fleet, which is currently permitted to fish only 7% of the Channel cod quota and only one fifth of the quota in our own territorial waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">Perhaps the Commissioner will see fit to favour the needs of harmless recreational fishermen in the UK in the same way as her predecessor showed open sensitivity to the needs of his own country’s fishermen when he opposed a ban on the sale of bluefin tuna, an industry that earned EUR 100 million a year for his country, Malta.</p>
      <p sl="en">The CFP has already wiped out most of what ought to have been a great renewable resource. Recreational sea anglers account for perhaps 1% of the total catch that remains. The Commission hesitates to protect a nearly endangered species, but sees fit to regulate fishing as a hobby. It just goes to show where the Commission’s interests lie.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for me and my constituents in Northern Ireland, the fishing industry and 27 years of the common fisheries policy is summed up in paragraph 138 of this report which reiterates that one of the few areas in which the CFP has been relatively successful is where Member States have had control.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ideal for us would be the scrapping of the CFP or the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from it, thus allowing Member States to take back control of their waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regretfully, we are not living in this ideal world. The reform of the CFP will inevitably result in another second best for Northern Ireland’s fishermen, a second best that has, for the past three decades, been marked by an unjustified decline of our fishing industry, and unanswered questions surrounding the state of those fish stocks on which our industry depends.</p>
      <p sl="en">And this was absolutely demonstrated by the debacle around the December Fishing Council and the decisions on quotas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst it is very much a second best, I strongly support the regionalisation of the CFP as set out by the rapporteur. I support the view that the CFP should be based on three core principles of environmental, social and economic dimensions. And my most honest hope is that we can deliver a policy that will reverse the disastrous consequences of the CFP.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I fear that radical change promised by some in this review will result in another lost opportunity for our fishing industry and our fish stocks.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, everything is at stake in this reform. If we are not courageous now, there will not be another opportunity to create a genuine fisheries policy and we will be partly responsible for its failure.</p>
      <p sl="es">The CFP has, for years, suffered increasingly justified criticism and it would be disheartening if, when we are being offered one last opportunity, this Parliament were to prove incapable of proposing alternatives to what we have criticised so many times, in particular, the obvious failure of the conservation and management system, as demonstrated by both the state of resources and the decline in the sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">I simply cannot understand any reluctance to clearly suggest alternatives, as discussed in this House in 1996, such as transferable quota systems or effort-based management, which have had such positive results and which could help to maintain the more industrial fleets at least.</p>
      <p sl="es">The report says that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution, but at the same time, it closes the door on the possibility that there might be other solutions. I do not understand the contradiction, nor do I understand why, if someone does not want to use an instrument, the solution must be to prohibit it for everyone.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is not protection of the weakest; it is fear on the part of some sectors that only see permanent subsidies as solutions.</p>
      <p sl="es">The CFP should also guarantee competitiveness in a globalised world of fisheries products. The market for these products will undoubtedly continue to grow but it seems that it will grow without us.</p>
      <p sl="es">The policies within the Union should be coherent and we must ensure that the trade policy and rules on origin, such as those that appeared in the new economic partnership agreements, do not destroy the competitiveness of Community fisheries without being anything other than mere gestures to third countries; otherwise, it is our fisheries sector that will suffer.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, consensus is a good thing when it results in progress, but not when we remain motionless in the face of problems, and we have many problems to solve.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome to all the fishermen and -women in the Chamber! Today’s vote represents a milestone for the European Parliament. For the first time since the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, we have the opportunity to express our opinions on the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP). In the next few years, our power and our responsibilities will increase significantly. This report is acceptable and I would like to thank Mrs Patrão Neves and Mrs Andrés Barea for their hard work.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have succeeded in incorporating important social democratic concerns into the report. These include specific support for small-scale fisheries. Those affected will now be included in the decision-making process. Support must be given in particular to small family businesses. Their presence in the coastal regions not only provides jobs, but also increases the attractiveness of many of these regions for tourists. Some parts of this report still need improvement and we have tabled amendments for that purpose. We social democrats want to make it clear that one of the central problems is the outstanding overcapacity. It is a fact that environmental sustainability is a fundamental prerequisite for the economic survival of fishermen. Therefore, the environment must take priority.</p>
      <p sl="de">A third important point concerns the external aspects of the CFP and the partnership agreements with third countries. We move that paragraph 121, which puts undue emphasis on the interests of European fisheries, should be deleted. We should behave outside European waters in just the same way as we do at home. This means promoting sustainability, human rights and democracy throughout the world and ensuring that the income from partnership agreements does not disappear into the coffers of corrupt dictatorships.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to make one more fundamental point. European fisheries policy is a hot potato, because it involves so many powerful national interests. It will come as no surprise that these have led to heated debates within the groups in recent weeks. Fortunately, we have all succeeded in finding effective compromises. However, when it comes to the legislative process, we must focus more closely on this issue than we have today and come up with some common European solutions. We must leave the trivial problems of national greed to the Council.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all let me welcome the Commissioner to the House in her first address to Parliament and wish her well during her term of office. Let me also congratulate our colleague, Mrs Neves for the preparation of this report.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The new common fisheries policy must have clearer, better objectives that accept ecological, economic and social principles. A radical rethink must be carried out and, of course, all stakeholders must take part.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We must manage fish stocks in a sustainable way. At the same time, however, it is important to ensure a viable and sustainable way of life for Europe’s fishermen.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I am particularly concerned about fishermen operating inshore and from small coastal islands. Such small-scale fisheries are of extreme importance to the peripheral areas where there is no alternative social employment and I am heartened this morning when I listen to the Commissioner make reference to such fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The majority of boats fishing in these areas are less than 15 metres, catching fish and catching quantities that have no significant impact on the fish stocks and, of course, many of them are fishing non-quota species. Most importantly, there is no alternative source of employment for many of those people. This is why I have tabled an amendment which calls on the Commission to specifically recognise these remote communities.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Regionalisation and the introduction of the RACs (Regional Advisory Councils) have been successful so regionalisation management structures should create many positive effects, including increased responsibility on the part of the stakeholders and the establishment of a new common fisheries policy that will be more sensitive to local concerns.</p>
      <p sl="ga">With the operation of the Lisbon Treaty following the referendum in my own country last year, the European Parliament now has greater legislative responsibility. Again, the Commissioner has recognised this and I look forward to working with her.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In conclusion, I would hope that the key provisions of this report will be included in the substantial reforms in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, our rapporteur said of the CFP that its original problems are still largely present. Well, I agree, and the 27 years of experience in Scotland of the CFP has been a bad experience. If we want to move to a system of fisheries management which works, and I think that is what we all want to do, then we must be prepared to embrace a radically different approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">The over-centralised, inflexible CFP has failed miserably and we must accept that. But we must do something about it. Conversely the Commission acknowledges that, up to now, local management within the 12-mile zone has generally been successful; there is a lesson there.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have tabled amendments for which I seek support from colleagues. I seek in these amendments to delegate real powers to Europe’s fishing nations; to encourage cooperation between fishing nations and stakeholders on a logical basis by sea basin; to encourage the incentivisation of sustainable management measures taken at national and local level and to recognise and maintain the historic rights and benefits accrued from the principle of relative stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">I firmly believe that those who have most to gain from the successful conservation of fish stocks, that is, our fishing communities and fishing nations themselves, are best placed to make real decisions about management plans and to implement them for their fisheries, working together on a regional basis. More than just failing the fishing industry and the fish stocks, the CFP has actually contributed substantially to a downturn in public opinion about the EU as a whole, and that is also at stake. If we do not get this CFP reform right …</p>

But to effect that radical change, we must not repeat past mistakes.</p>
      <p sl="en">No more micro-management from the centre, no more top-down regulation, no more one-size-fits-all approach to policy. Any reform of the CFP must include an end to the debacle of discards. It must involve the stakeholders in the day-to-day management of stocks. It must ensure fleet capacities brought into line with stock levels. We have to put sustainability and conservation at the heart of our agenda. We must end IUU fishing and ensure a decent livelihood for all of those working in the sector. If we can give real substance to the core values of the CFP to maintain jobs and to maintain fish stocks, we will have made real progress.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, a reform of our fisheries policy is long overdue. However, I would have liked it to be more ambitious – particularly as it concerns the future existence of viable fish stocks in our seas. It is extremely rare for me to say that I fully agree with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, but in this case, I have to admit that I do. In fact, their amendments are both responsible and necessary for the future of our fishing industry.</p>
      <p sl="da">My question to the Council and the Commission is one that our guests here today will surely not like, but it will be of crucial importance for the future. My question is how can we introduce an EU-wide ban on catching any fish and shellfish during their respective breeding periods? Everyone knows that every time just one cod is caught that is full of roe (in other words, fish eggs), we are catching all of the future generations of cod. This makes safeguarding stable cod stocks almost impossible, to name just one topical example.</p>
      <p sl="da">I am pleased that the new Green Paper intends to focus to a much greater extent on coastal fisheries. This will not only benefit the environment, but will also help to safeguard local jobs. It is also good that the Green Paper attaches importance to sustainable aquaculture to enable us to avoid depleting the seas around the coasts of third countries. We should, likewise, stop fishing for exotic and endangered fish species simply because sushi has become fashionable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, our party believes that preservation of fish stocks should be the responsibility of each Member State, whose fishermen would have sole access to its own country’s waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we recognise that there is a Europe-wide, indeed worldwide, problem with overfishing and unsustainable fish stocks.</p>
      <p sl="en">There must be a revision of the present policy under which fishermen must return excess and even undersized fish to the sea, even though they are dead or dying as the result of swim bladder damage by being brought too quickly to the surface.</p>
      <p sl="en">New technology must come to the rescue. For example, one of my constituents, Jeff Stockdale from Hull, a former fishermen, has invented a revolutionary pot trap that would encourage fish to enter it in order to escape from the tidal flow, but it would allow small fish to escape and larger ones to be released before being brought to the surface, if that should be necessary to avoid exceeding one’s quota.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike some, I believe that the European Parliament’s report on the Green Paper is a significant, indeed even essential, contribution to the development of the future common fisheries policy. It is a comprehensive report that addresses all aspects of this policy and, in particular, the protection of resources, a global approach to the management of fish stocks and decentralised governance. All of that seems to me to be both very relevant and very purposeful.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to express, today in this House, France’s satisfaction with regard to this contribution by Parliament, on which we have worked together, and I thank Mrs Patrão Neves for the work she has done. This report points out the need to increase scientific expertise in the fisheries sector so that the decisions that are taken are beyond dispute.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, we must conserve resources and promote sustainable fishing, but let us be careful not to stigmatise a profession that has long understood that its survival depends on its compliance with the rules. Yes, we must evolve into a market economy. However, that does not mean that we have to abandon organised means of regulation. I especially welcome the compromises that have been reached as a result of our debates in committee.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, no explicit reference is made to transferable individual rights. This type of management is regarded by some as a management tool that fulfils the environmental, economic and social objectives of the sector. That is not a view I share. A European market that enjoys rights to unregulated production is not desirable today. It would give rise to uncontrollable speculation and a concentration of individual rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, while it will certainly be crucial to implement new management methods for industrial fisheries – I agree with my colleague, Mrs Fraga Estévez, in that regard – I remain convinced that too broad an application of this system would sound the death knell for our small-scale fisheries, to which we are very committed.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Martín Fragueiro, the current common fisheries policy has failed. Most fish stocks are collapsing. Eighty-eight per cent of fish stocks are being fished beyond the maximum sustainable yield. Thirty per cent of fish stocks are outside safe biological limits, meaning that they have little chance of recovery. Cod in the North Sea, which is being fished even before its reproductive age, is a typical example. The reform under discussion is therefore absolutely necessary.</p>
      <p sl="el">Protection of fishermen depends on protection of catches. If we are to prevent European fisheries from collapsing, we must reduce fishing effort and the European fishing fleet. The ecological approach must be the driving force behind a new common fisheries policy and must be accompanied by long-term planning, participatory procedures and the application of the principle of prevention. This long-term approach to species conservation must also be applied in all our international fisheries agreements.</p>
      <p sl="el">I call on you to adopt these basic principles, so that we can develop a decentralised and participatory system, in which decisions are taken at the lowest possible level, with the participation of fishermen and respect for the needs of marine ecosystems.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, sustainability is a key concept in the Green Paper, and rightly so: sustainable in the sense of being both future-proof for fisheries and good for the environment. The objectives set by the European Commission are not new but, to date, Europe has not managed to achieve them. This further increases the urgency of the need for reform.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I support the drift of the Commission’s solution: regionalisation. More scope must be given to the fisheries sector itself, whilst paying attention to environmental aspects. Current policy goes too far, is too detailed and is ineffective.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, compliance with the rules is poor at present. The good are the victims of the bad. I am proud of the Dutch fishermen: they and their Danish counterparts are the only ones with their catch quotas in order. We must encourage the European fisheries sector to become more involved and to take more responsibility, in line with the Dutch model. I was pleased to find this in the Green Paper; it is the only way to a sustainable future for the fisheries sector.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The current fisheries policy is not working well enough; a dramatic change is needed to reverse the situation. This is the fairly strong wording with which the European Commission opens its Green Paper. This is remarkable. Not that I wish to argue with it; on the contrary.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Some say the main reason for the failure of the common fisheries policy (CFP) is not that the policy as such is wrong but that it is so poorly implemented and enforced. There are important lessons to be learned in this regard. Policy must lend itself to implementation, and so simplification is in order. That is why I am pleased with the direction the Commission is indicating: regionalisation, more involvement by the sector and, in particular, compliance with the rules.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The report on this Green Paper by my fellow Portuguese Member points out the large variations between the various fleets and fisheries; and rightly so. We cannot talk in generalised terms about the overcapacity or the overfishing or the lack of compliance. A regional, sector-specific approach calls for nuanced language in this respect. Last Saturday, in fact, I held intensive discussions with representatives of the sector, who told me that fishermen and scientists are cooperating more and more successfully. Indeed, this strikes me as an example of how things can be done. When fishermen are able to contribute their know-how and to help shape policy, this broadens the basis for the policy considerably, and will put us on the right track. Finally, I should like to offer the rapporteur sincere thanks for this excellent report.</p>

      <p sl="el">All the important things have already been said. I shall turn my attention to three points: firstly, overfishing. Overfishing is an undisputed fact. In fact, as Mr Arsenis said, it is currently estimated that 88% of stocks in European seas are threatened by overfishing, meaning that they are being fished at a level which prevents their recovery.</p>
      <p sl="el">Chronic overfishing has resulted in smaller and smaller catches for European fisheries and lost jobs. Smaller and smaller fish are being caught, often before they reach reproductive age, and they are becoming more and more difficult to locate.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, Europe catches far fewer fish today than it did 15 years ago, approximately 25% less, while fishing effort and the cost of fishing have risen. However, when taking measures, we must not overreact, as this may bring about adverse results, given that, according to the specialists, although we have overfishing, we are not talking about collapsing stocks.</p>
      <p sl="el">What we must not forget is that viability has three dimensions, which are also highlighted in the Neves report: the social dimension, the economic dimension and the ecological dimension. A fisheries policy which targets viable development must not revolve solely around fish; it must also focus on man.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fish, man, cormorants and seals are competing systems in the same ecological environment.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I must emphasise that I, like numerous other fellow Members, are insisting on more research into fisheries. It is not my insistence; it is a reality which we must address within the framework of everything said by Mr Cadec.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The second result is that, during the negotiations, our priority was to ensure that this text responds to the concerns expressed by fishermen. We have succeeded in this: the provisions relating to transferable individual quotas have been withdrawn, and support for small-scale and coastal fishing has been maintained.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third anticipated result is that the forthcoming document must result in a participative and bottom-up approach, that is to say, in consultation with all those involved in the sector. It must also incorporate those elements that are essential to the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, notably, the human and social dimension of the entire sector, which must be combined effectively with the promotion of sustainable fishing practices and with the conservation of the fish stock as part of an ecosystemic approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to add that, if we want to succeed in an ambitious reform of the common fisheries policy, then we must devote a budget to it that matches our stated ambitions.

In order to fulfil the objectives of the reform, the answer is simple: ensure a sustainable and profitable sector and guarantee supply.</p>
      <p sl="es">The other key words are regionalisation, responsibility, stability and justice: regionalisation, examining the special characteristics of each zone and type of fishing, differentiating between small-scale and industrial fishing; responsibility, focusing on good practices and previous efforts to reduce fishing capacity; stability, through long-term management plans based on increasingly reliable scientific activity; and justice, revising the COM and offering inspections and controls of third countries to promote sustainable behaviour in the sector.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the fishing sector is of fundamental significance as a source of livelihood in European coastal regions and as a source of food for the citizens of Europe. Unfortunately, the common fisheries policy, in its present form, does not meet the challenges associated with the emergence of a number of problems, such as the uncontrolled exploitation of fishing grounds or excessive fishing capacity. A complete transformation of maritime policy is essential. We are at the beginning of this process, and it should end with thorough changes to the current, ineffective European fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thank you, Mrs Patrão Neves, for your comprehensive report, which determines the essential measures on which this reform should be based. Firstly, a reduction in excess fishing capacity. This is a fundamental problem, which should be solved by the introduction and monitoring of appropriate market mechanisms. I am talking here about a system of individual transferable quotas, or ITQs. I think this is a kind of economic medicine for adapting the size of the fleet to available resources and ensuring profitability of the fishing sector. Secondly, decentralisation and a broader inclusion of interested parties and advisory bodies in the process. The aim of this is to increase the involvement of fishermen and to develop detailed regulations, which would increase the trust between fishermen and the bodies which govern fishing.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Green Paper rightly evaluates current fisheries policy, highlighting its many imperfections. Mrs Patrão Neves’ report analyses the possibilities for solving the adverse situation of the fishing industry in Europe. However, the proposals do require further discussion. If this does not take place, our Community risks voting through another version of a reform, which will not solve the problems being faced by the European fishing industry.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I want to emphasis one particular aspect of the proposed reform which is of paramount importance to the whole sector’s development. It must take into account how the situation has changed following the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 and 2007, as well as the new Member States. The existing system for carrying out research and analysis and for making decisions must take into account the new waterways and their specific features. I would like to emphasise on this point the need to focus particular attention on the Black Sea and create dedicated bodies for managing it. We must take into consideration the interests of the people living in these coastal areas, the ecological issues and the fishing industry.

      <p sl="en">Yesterday, many Members attended a seminar I organised, a presentation by the Marine Stewardship Council. I have always been rather fond of this organisation. It was set up about 10 years ago by a partnership between business and environmentalists, which, I think, is always good.

      <p sl="en">I think this gives credibility to the retailers who support the MSE. I think it gives confidence to consumers and I think that it not only puts more money in the pockets of fishermen who have got their fisheries sustainably certified, but it also gives them a sense of pride.

The Commission now has the enormous responsibility of presenting us with concrete steps in its legislative proposal that will allow the implementation of the principles contained in this report. I am certain that we will adopt the report by a large majority.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, an important part of the future of Europe is at stake in the reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">The fishing sector is a resource and a way of life in our coastal areas, and forms the basis of our canning industry and marine research. It is crucial for safety, quality and price in the supply of food to our consumers. It is also crucial for external relations and development.</p>
      <p sl="es">The reform must focus on responsible, sustainable and competitive fisheries. It must accentuate the social dimension, give priority to the ecosystem and be integrated in the marine policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is important to ensure the conservation and recovery of stocks and to revise the principle of relative stability. The management policy based on TACs and quotas must leave room for effort-based management. It is also essential to step up controls and put an end to unfair competition.</p>
      <p sl="es">The small-scale fishing fleet and the areas that are highly dependent on fisheries need to be treated differently and need greater socio-economic support. Shellfishing activities must be completely integrated into the common fisheries policy.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I think that the European common fisheries policy is important. However, it is also important for the fisheries policy to be supported by the citizens of Europe and by all of the interested parties within the fisheries sector. There is therefore no other option than to have greater regionalisation so that the responsibility for complying with the European framework and objectives is decentralised. The discarding of fish must be reduced to a minimum, but for this to be possible, the policy behind the discards must be changed. Illegal fishing must be stopped – it is very detrimental to law-abiding fishermen. There must be more stringent and uniform control in the Member States. Coastal fisheries must be enhanced to give smaller boats a special status. Out and back again the same day results in fresh fish, the fish get a good price and it is easy on the environment and on fish stocks. I hope that these elements will have a firm place in the final reform. That is what is needed.</p>

The new strategy must promote fishing at local level, and I should like to point out that aquaculture is a significant part of this, as it accounts for a considerable amount of resources and tens of thousands of jobs. Europe needs an aquaculture that is strong, sustainable and of a high quality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like, in particular, to draw your attention to shellfish breeding, which is subject to specific constraints requiring pragmatic and appropriate solutions. This type of breeding is often carried out by small-sized enterprises, which have been hit hard by the crisis. Pollution and environmental changes are resulting in an increasingly fragile and more unstable form of production. Producers are expecting Europe to provide them with substantial aid, that is to say, in the short term, with temporary financial assistance that will enable them to continue to earn a living from their production; in the medium term, with transitional aid to ensure that the species have the biological time they need to reproduce; and, in the long term …</p>

      <p sl="pl">The common fisheries policy has to reconcile ecological and environmental objectives with catch sizes, and also with matters of employment and the standard of living of fishing families. Fishing capacity should be adapted to the level of resources, levels which are established in accordance with the latest scientific and expert knowledge. Arriving at sustainable fishing quotas must take place in connection with the process of support for the fishing community in a variety of areas, such as investment, modernisation and social issues, including from a long-term perspective.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The common fisheries policy should take account of the specific conditions of different regions and seas. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the competences of the Regional Advisory Councils, which should work closely with the fisheries administrations of Member States and the European Commission.

      <p sl="es">The specific points on which there is agreement so far are the following: maintaining the current rules on access to the 12 nautical mile zone; long-term resource management; greater involvement of fisheries professionals; market incentives – such as labelling and certificates – to stimulate fishermen’s overall revenue share; use of subsidies solely as exceptional measures to reduce overcapacity; the importance of research in the fisheries policy; integration of aquaculture; the relationship between the CFP and the integrated maritime policy; and the need to maintain and enhance the European Union’s action at international level.</p>

      <p sl="en">While recreational angling constitutes just a small catch percentage of Europe’s fishing industry, it is an integral economic and social element of many parts of the EU, particularly Ireland East. Angling has a long and important heritage in the east of Ireland, with scenes of anglers at rivers such as the Slaney or on the shores of the east coast a popular depiction of Irish culture. This reputation for angling also has a vital impact on tourism in many parts of Ireland, both from within Ireland and internationally, with Tiger Woods one famous regular patron of the Liffey in County Kildare. As a result of falling stocks of fish, there is a move to impose controls on shore angling and to deduct these catches from the quotas of the commercial fishing industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">These proposals could have a serious effect on tourist earnings from angling, and also have a negative cultural impact on many parts of Ireland. It is therefore necessary for this House to recognise recreational angling in all its forms as an important stakeholder in the fishing industry, and for the reformed common fisheries policy to take its economic and social benefits into account in its White Paper.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The report on the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy has the aim of initiating a public debate in EU and Member State institutions. The fisheries policy, just like the common agricultural policy, is a strategic agenda which directly influences all citizens of the EU, and which must be resolved in accordance with the three core principles, which are the economic profitability of fishing, the preservation and maintenance of fish stocks and the maintenance of an acceptable standard of living for persons engaged in fishing. Unless there is a balance between all of these principles in the draft legislation, there will be a risk of economic decline in the coastal regions, of certain fish species being fished out or of increases in illegal fishing above the limits. In view of the fact that 88% of the fish population is fished beyond maximum sustainable levels and that up to 80% of the total catch is discarded, there is a need to set limits that will allow fish populations to regenerate, thereby increasing fish catches dramatically in the future, while maintaining sustainability. The rapporteur correctly points out that, as a result of the equilibrium between producers and buyers being disrupted through the entry of an intermediary – the retail chains – fish prices are falling, which puts the situation in the fishing sector even more at risk. The submitted report takes account of all three previously mentioned core principles of fishing and puts forward specific solutions for sustainability, and it is therefore a good start to the preservation of fishing for all of us.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I believe that we need a new common fisheries policy (CFP) regulation that is more efficient and better tailored to the situation in the respective territories. I therefore welcome the intention to focus on the principles of regionalisation and subsidiarity, thus giving greater autonomy to the Member States and allowing more flexibility for the CFP. At the same time, given that environmental challenges cause serious problems for fishery resources, I believe that it is crucial for the new CFP to allow ecologically sustainable and economically viable fishing.

In particular, I am pleased with the recommendation that any mandatory changes be introduced gradually and requiring an initial transitional period, in order to allow sufficient time for the industry, and especially individual fishermen, to cope with the extra expense in an already difficult industry. However, although I acknowledge that the report outlines the difference in treatment to be afforded to high-sea fisheries and smaller-scale fisheries, it is lamentable that any more expense be imposed upon the latter particularly. Fishing is not just an economic activity, it is both social and cultural, and the way of life of the small fisherman needs to be preserved. Their livelihood has, up until now, depended on the historic claim his local community held on its coast’s fishing rights.

      <p sl="en">It is now widely accepted that the 2002 reform of the common fisheries policy has failed miserably and the situation in the fishing industry continues to deteriorate rather than get better. The CFP has become a bureaucratic nightmare with over regulation and micro-management plaguing the industry while achieving little in the way of positive outcomes. The imminent reform of the CFP presents an opportunity to take the policy in a new direction, away from excessive bureaucracy, and deliver on all the aspects which it should – environmentally, socially and economically. The core goal of a reformed CFP must be to ensure that fishermen can earn a decent livelihood while also achieving environmental sustainability. The challenge is to formulate a common fisheries policy which maintains jobs and fish stocks at the same time. A reformed CFP should do away with centralised overregulation from Brussels and instead focus on ideas such as how stakeholders can deal with the day to day management of stocks locally.</p>

It is emphatic proof that not all projects and reforms carried out within the Union are successful. We should, therefore, draw the right conclusions with regard to both institutional and practical solutions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One of the fundamental mistakes of the 2002 reform was excessive centralisation. The diversity and specific nature of different regions of the European Union should oblige us to regionalise. The European Commission must not treat the Baltic Sea on a par with the Atlantic or the Mediterranean Sea. Regionalisation of fisheries policy should go hand in hand with specific measures relating to social and economic matters. From the point of view of the people who live in areas which are dependent on fishing, the most important course of action is economic and social diversification and restructuring, including the creation of new jobs outwith the fishing sector. The fact that it is not possible to increase catches and employment in the Baltic fishing sector should lead to the above measures being put into effect. This is something which meets social expectations and needs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Research shows that two-thirds of European fish stocks are under threat, including very well-known species such as sole, plaice and cod.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for decades now, the European Union’s common fisheries policy has controlled fishing within the Community and in the territorial waters of third countries.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Unfortunately, it is one of the EU’s most unsuccessful policy areas, and has led to a situation that could be described as a crisis, and for good reason. The situation regarding fish stocks is extremely worrying: two thirds of the EU’s commercially exploitable fish stocks have plummeted. Falling profitability and hugely depleted shoals mean that the fishing industry is in big trouble. Excessive fishing quotas and illegal fishing are wiping out fish stocks at an alarming rate.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The crisis is due to the fact that, for a long time now, there has been complete indifference to the problems that have accumulated owing to overfishing and illegal fishing. Furthermore, destructive fishing methods are also devastating the rest of the marine environment. Bottom trawling is one of the most harmful methods.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU must take the crisis in fish stocks seriously. There is also a close link here to the external perspective, because the Union imports almost a third of the fish it sells from outside. A crucial component of the new common fisheries policy will be to put the agreements we have with our fishing partners on a more sustainable basis. The key reforms must be to tackle overcapacity with respect to fishing vessels and more effective monitoring to root out illegal fishing.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The main building blocks of the reform of the fisheries policy, as proposed by the Commission in its Green Paper, must be making the ecosystem the starting point, and the precautionary principle. The main focus of the policy must be the genuinely sustainable fishing of each fish species, and to accomplish this, each nation needs to have its own management and protection strategy. If necessary, the Union must also be prepared to adopt solutions to ensure the recovery of stocks by introducing a complete ban on fishing and the trade in fish.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report on the Green Paper insists on reforms that I believe to be necessary for better implementation of this policy on a regional level, particularly decentralisation of fisheries management to take account of the specific features of each region and to link in the sustainability of the sector through the preservation of species. In Madeira, there is an urgent need to modernise boats and to promote measures to ensure the economic viability of fishing.

The causes of the accident are not yet fully known and the technical investigation has been launched in accordance with the provisions of the EU Safety Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is the responsibility of the Belgian investigation body to carry this out. It should be accomplished independently of any judicial inquiry. The objective of the technical investigation is not to apportion blame and liability, but rather to identify causes with a view to improving railway safety and the prevention of accidents.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Belgian investigation body has asked the European Railway Agency to support it in its investigation. Two investigators from the agency joined the Belgian team in charge of the investigation just a few hours after the accident occurred.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to stress that, since the causes of the accident have not yet been clarified, it is inappropriate to draw conclusions. Of course, I am prepared to clarify some issues, which were raised in the aftermath of this tragedy, and I will share with you my understanding of the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As is too often the case when rail accidents happen, remarks alleging a link between European rules or regulations and the accident are made. I would first like to be very clear on the opening-up of the market. Alongside the opening-up of the rail freight sector to competition and the establishment of requirements to separate the activities of infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, a stringent regulatory framework has been introduced governing rail safety and interoperability. We want to ensure that the high level of rail safety is maintained, while recognising the procedures and methods specific to each Member State in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Railway Agency produces reports at regular intervals on the safety of the European network and monitors the development of the situation in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indicators demonstrate that the opening up of the rail sector to competition has in no way had a negative impact on railway safety. Let me say very clearly that any proposition linking rail safety levels to the opening-up of the rail market is, in my view, just an excuse to steer the debate away from the true causes of the accident.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question of the coexistence of national and European train control systems can be put in these terms. More than 20 different national systems are used in Europe today to ensure the safe movement of trains. These systems developed at national level consist of a trackside component and an onboard component. The trackside component sends information to a computer in the train, and the computer applies the brakes when a dangerous situation is detected.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the systems to work, trains and lines must therefore be equipped with a compatible system. Levels of safety and performance of the various national automatic train protection systems are different, as are the rules concerning equipment of lines and locomotives in these national systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">The incompatibility of the different national systems poses a major problem for international trains because either locomotives have to be changed at each border or they have to be equipped with as many onboard systems as there are systems on the tracks that they will run on. There are even cases where different national systems coexist in one single country. The Thalys, for example, has to be equipped with seven different national systems to run in four countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason, a single system for use at European level has been designed and developed and is currently being installed on major international lines and trains in Europe. The system is known as ERTMS – European Rail Traffic Management System.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the timing, we can say that most of the national systems were developed in the early 1980s but their deployment is a long and costly process. In most countries, only part of the national networks and locomotives are equipped today and this partial equipment took approximately 20 years.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ERTMS specifications have been available since 2000. A number of pilot projects were carried out between 2000 and 2005. Since 2005, several ERTMS-equipped lines have been put into service. At present, 10 Member States have lines with ERTMS and there are ongoing projects in almost all Member States. In Belgium, for example, the line between Aachen and Liège is equipped, and ICT trains running on this line are equipped as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">ERTMS was created primarily with a view to promoting interoperability. That means the possibility for locomotives to cross borders, but it is also recognised as a system offering an advantage in terms of increased safety. The system is fully operational today but, due to the long time needed to install it on board trains and the long lines, existing national systems will continue to coexist with ERTMS along the lines.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third countries like Taiwan, to give just one example, have also chosen ERTMS, and not just for operability reasons. Taiwan invested in ERTMS simply because the system is the best system available on the market today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several questions were asked about comparing the situation between Member States. It is quite difficult and not very useful to establish a ranking of the Member States and make meaningful comparisons. It all depends on the choice of indicators, the reference period and the quality of the data reported. One or two serious accidents can also have a significant impact on whatever type of ranking we may have.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall data show that the Belgian performance is average. It is true, however, that Belgium lags behind the European average in terms of tracks equipped with an automatic train protection system, be it the national or the European one.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Kallas, I would like to thank you for your explanations. Against the background of the accident in Buizingen it is, of course, important for us to show respect towards the victims and also towards the investigation. For this reason, we must not jump to conclusions about the accident and, more significantly, we must not begin assigning blame.</p>
      <p sl="de">I felt that the Commission acted correctly in strongly rejecting the accusation by the Belgian National Railways that the European Rail Traffic Management System has taken too long to develop. We know that safety remains a national priority and that this will continue to be the case. At a European level, we – and this includes both the Commission and Parliament – have always regretted the fact that the rail companies do not give higher priority to safety and to interoperability between the different systems in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">After accidents have occurred, new proposals are often made in a political context. I must say that in this case, everything was in place, both the legislation and the technology. The only thing which perhaps was lacking was the will to make the technology a high priority. Since the middle of the 1990s, the technology has been available to enable the safe transition between the European system and the advanced Belgian system, in other words, the so-called TBL 1+ system. There has been no lack of time or of technical facilities.</p>
      <p sl="de">The future is what is important to me and I would like to emphasise the following points. Firstly, we must not, under any circumstances, cut back on training in the rail industry. That has not been, nor will it be, one of the EU’s obligations. The railways have highly skilled staff and this must remain the case in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we need definite, binding conversion plans from the rail companies and the countries. Leaving everything to goodwill is no longer sufficient. We need a precise timetable and we will soon have the opportunity in Parliament to find out about specific objectives.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third proposal is that passengers should also have the right to know whether the stretch of track and the rolling stock that they travel on meet the highest safety standards. This is the minimum level of information which must be made available to passengers in future. We also need to investigate how we can put in place a mandatory requirement to do this.</p>

      <p sl="nl">To begin with, speaking on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I, too, wish to express my heartfelt sympathy for the victims of the Buizingen rail disaster and their families and friends.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We do have to await the results of the investigation before drawing real, detailed conclusions, of course, but that does not change the fact that railway safety must remain a permanent area of attention at all levels, including the European level, and that we must therefore evaluate, improve, supplement and adjust safety policy on a regular basis. I should like to join my fellow Member and also you, Commissioner, in making quite clear our regret that a number of individuals with significant responsibilities in Belgium have sought to pass responsibility for the accident on to Europe or have at least given that impression. The delay in the development of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) has been cited in particular as a reason why now, in 2010, only a handful of locomotives in Belgium are equipped with the automatic stop system.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, on the other hand, let us make one thing clear, and let us be frank about this: the development of this good idea – a single signalling system to replace the 20 separate systems – has taken longer than hoped or expected. This, of course, is attributable to the technical complexity and to the fact that agreement on a standard has to be reached among a very large number of countries, namely 27, although at the time, there were a couple fewer. Of course, there are also associated budgetary consequences. Yet, as you rightly said, this has not stopped a single Member State from developing its own system or starting to use a kind of embryonic version of ERTMS at an early stage.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I take the view that we do need to look ahead now and ask ourselves how we can contribute to safer railways. I believe we can make this contribution on several fronts at European level, too. We can do so, firstly, thanks to the further development of ERTMS. Such a development plan exists. In 2009, we earmarked EUR 240 million from the budget for trans-European transport networks (TEN-T) in order to help Member States out with this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, however, and I think that this is an important task for the Commission and the European Railway Agency, we must also monitor whether existing European safety legislation is being implemented in practice in the field. I would cite the example of Directive 2004/49/EC on safety on the Community’s railways. This lays down, among other things, that a safety authority is to be established in each Member State, which must be independent from the railway undertakings and the infrastructure manager, and whose tasks include monitoring, encouraging and enforcing railway safety and developing a regulatory framework. I have the feeling, ladies and gentlemen, that this is not working particularly well in Belgium, and I think that you should organise a kind of audit to look into whether Member States do indeed have the capacity to guarantee this safety proactively in their national rail systems. That is a task I should like to entrust to you.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I, too, wish to express my sympathy for the victims on behalf of my group, and I, too, wish to await the results of the investigation, of course. I hope this is carried out as quickly as possible, but also as thoroughly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In my country, a number of questions have been raised as to the nature of Europe’s approach to the railways. I have to be honest with you: I am shocked that some people have accused us of neglecting safety. I was Parliament’s rapporteur on the Railway Safety Directive to which Mr El Khadraoui has just referred, and I am proud of the work we did back then. We told ourselves that we needed to be very demanding as regards safety in all Member States and we needed to establish a European framework for this and to lay down requirements. We got this past the Member States with very great difficulty. I note – and Mr El Khadraoui rightly mentioned this – that in some countries, unfortunately, including my own, the implementation of this directive at national level is in fact poorly organised. I hope you take another good look at this, Commissioner. Perhaps this House, too, should take another look at the directive and tighten up the framework, as Mr Grosch said. It is not true that we are neglecting safety, therefore; the reverse is true.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, the Regulation on passengers’ rights contains a paragraph we hoped would never be needed: it concerns advance payments for people killed or injured in rail accidents. I welcome the announcement by the National Railway Company of Belgium (SNCB) that it will be using this system and making advance payments. Indeed, there was a time when this would not have been so.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Some people have said that opening up the market has made the railways unsafe. I wish to contradict this in the strongest terms. It is not true, as a look at the latest European Railway Agency data, from 2008, will demonstrate. The best-performing countries in 2008 were the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, two countries that have opened up their markets.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I also think attention should be paid to the people, to the railway workers on the ground: train drivers, station staff, administrators. We should be taking another look at their situation and ensuring that safety is the prime consideration in not only their training but also the organisation of their work and the whole corporate culture. By way of conclusion, Mr President, I should like to say that we must not lose sight of the fact that the railways are still among the safest means of transport around.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, believe that last week’s tragic accident is the worst rail disaster to have hit Belgium since 2001, when I myself held the post of Minister for Mobility and Transport. Once again, of course, my thoughts are with our colleague, Claudia Candeago, and also with all the other victims of this tragedy, their loved ones, and all the grieving railway workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall refrain from drawing any conclusions, just as those who have spoken before me have done. The investigation is under way, and we shall not speculate on its results. However, it is clear that, in Belgium’s case, it is regrettable that the railways should have taken so long to equip themselves with an automatic train protection system, as some have already mentioned. When I heard, in the wake of the disaster, that, whilst budgetary reasons could not be cited, the delays in the development of European interoperability standards were being called into question as a means of explaining this accident, I found it unacceptable and I immediately felt that Europe was at the centre of groundless accusations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) does, in fact, offer companies an opportunity to invest in safety in a coordinated and interoperable manner. We must rid ourselves of the countless national standards that curb development and competitiveness, at a time when the European Train Control System (ETCS) is evolving. It is, of course, evolving, and it will continue to evolve. This is what it takes to preserve a very high level of technology. Moreover, I have no doubt that, in the next five or 10 years, there will be many more developments to come.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It must be said that such accidents, however exceptional, remind us that there is always room for improvement where safety is concerned, and I would like to make some proposals in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, as you know, Commissioner, we are currently discussing trans-European transport networks, their conditions and their criteria. I believe that, when it comes to the European networks, deployment of the ERTMS throughout Europe could actually become a priority. I also believe that, in this context, we should set deadlines concerning, in particular, the resources with which every single country and network will have to be equipped.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I believe that we must prioritise safety over liberalisation of the markets by obliging new operators running trains on various national networks to adapt a while longer to the automatic protection system that exists on these networks and thus to equip their trains with the relevant receivers and cabin equipment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I believe that the European Railway Agency could, for its part, also provide invaluable support for a more effective integration of the national safety authorities. Such integration would make it possible, for example, for the equipment to be type-approved.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The investigation into the causes of the rail accident in Buizingen has yet to be completed, and so I cannot comment on it, but I have come to the following conclusion. When there is a train crash in the United Kingdom, people are quick to attribute it to the privatisation of the railways. The Belgian railways (SNCB) receive relatively the highest subsidy in the whole of the European Union. Belgium gives 32 euro cents per passenger/kilometre to its railways. France comes second with 24 euro cents. The Netherlands gives 15 euro cents and the UK 4 euro cents. Despite all these subsidies, the SNCB still has debts of EUR 10 billion. Where does the money go?</p>
      <p sl="nl">When I look at the infrastructure of the SNCB, the neglect is striking. Everything is old and worn out. Could it be that the safety system is also neglected from time to time? Perhaps too much money is being channelled to staff pay owing to the power of the trade unions. In Belgium, the railways are a socialist domain and are badly run. Indeed, these are questions that need to be asked, as the SNCB can hardly use lack of money as an excuse!</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, when, in November, Mr Simpson declared in this House: ‘even though the European rail system is very safe and progress has been made over the last few years thanks to the liberalisation of the market’, I nearly choked. Nevertheless, he followed this up with: ‘recent fatal accidents have raised questions with regard to safety’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since the Buizingen accident, its terrible human death toll and the serious physical and psychological suffering that it has caused have served as a powerful reminder that it is high time we launched a serious debate on rail safety. Let us dismiss straight away the idea that all accidents are, by nature, unforeseeable. The main factor in the lack of safety across Europe’s rail networks is a direct consequence of the separation between the management of our rail infrastructure and the management of our rolling stock. This separation – it must be said forcefully here – has been imposed by the Commission against the better judgment of railway workers so that the rail sector can be opened up to competition. It greatly increases the likelihood of accidents. Because of this separation, the maintenance of the European rail network is being sacrificed for the sake of the highest profits. You may try to buy some time by proposing the use of the best modern-day techniques as the only option for solving the problems. Ultimately, however, it is a different rail policy that we need in Europe. If, each year, there are fewer railway workers, less maintenance, less investment and less training, it is inevitable that we will have to address the issue of accidents once again and pay mournful tributes. In order to ensure genuine rail safety, the Union has to turn the page on competition so as to open that of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, upon leaving this debate, none of us will be able to ignore our responsibilities any longer. For my part, I refuse to be a party to malicious intent. Without change …</p>

      <p sl="nl">I should like to start by simply noting that the Belgian tax burden is one of the world’s highest, yet in that ungovernable country, the taxpayers – particularly those in Flanders – obtain very little in return for their money. The rail system is a perfect illustration of this. It is hopelessly outdated and is characterised by frequent and long delays and by overcrowded carriages during peak hours.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The management of the Belgian railways (SNCB) is highly politicised and inefficient, and a typical feature of Belgian politics is that, when something goes wrong, no one is ever responsible for anything at all. In 2001, a train crash occurred in Pécrot that was similar to last week’s in Buizingen. Nine years ago, everyone thought serious action would be taken to improve the safety system; yet this did not happen. Pending the introduction of the European Train Control System (ETCS), Belgium developed its own system, but this came far too late and was extremely inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The lesson we must learn from this is that more needs to be invested in safety and that the various existing systems need to be better geared to one another. Then, if effective interoperability proves impossible to achieve, maximum encouragement must be given to the changeover to the European ETCS, as it is not healthy for a Thalys train running between Paris and Amsterdam, for example, to have no less than seven different safety systems.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the collision between two commuter trains in Brussels, which resulted in this dreadful accident, has deeply shocked all of us. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims.</p>
      <p sl="de">After disasters of this kind, people’s first response is often to find someone to blame. However, the European Union, the Commission and the safety provisions which we introduced in Directive 2004/49 must not be made into the scapegoat in this case. On the other hand, the important question is, of course, whether we should tighten up the safety provisions. The investigations into this rail accident have not yet been completed and, therefore, we cannot yet expect any clear results. The major question that we must ask ourselves is whether it would have been possible to avoid this accident. We cannot exclude human error or technical failures and therefore both of these things play a role in rail safety. All rail operators, both state-owned and private, have an obligation to provide the necessary level of safety. The national rail companies must ensure that they are complying with the appropriate safety standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not want to give any lectures from a German point of view in this situation. I simply want to say that in Germany, we have attempted to implement the directive in its entirety. Wherever there is the possibility of human error, technical systems must be able to intervene. I remember the dead man’s handle which automatically applied the brakes if the handle was not pressed for a minute. If a train passes a red stop signal, the brakes are also automatically applied. We must have systems of this kind in place. The European Train Control System must be implemented so that we have some influence over these things from the outside.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the rail disaster in Buizingen, near Brussels, has claimed 18 victims and left more than 160 injured. Obviously, our thoughts are first and foremost with the families. The causes of the accident are still unknown – an investigation is under way – and we must think about undertaking an assessment of rail safety in Europe, on a Member State-by-Member State basis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This assessment must focus, of course, on the safety systems, on the state of their application, on their interoperability and on their effectiveness. However, this assessment of the level of safety of the European rail networks must be understood in a broad sense and, in particular, must incorporate an assessment of the working conditions of railway employees, since the latter are the best guarantors of safety.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore call on the Commission to undertake an assessment of the safety of Europe’s rail networks by means of a global approach that takes the launch of the rail liberalisation process as its starting point. One thing is clear: the time has come to carry out a taboo-free assessment of the practical results of these policies aimed at liberalising and dismantling public services. What added value have they brought? Who has benefited from them? Who has suffered because of them?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The aim is to compare the implementation of the European safety and signalling standards with working conditions from the moment when this liberalisation of the rail sector within each Member States came into effect. The Commission must therefore consider the role of public services in more general terms. The Parti Socialiste – the party to which I belong – has long been calling for positive action from the European Union to protect and develop public services. This is the idea behind the introduction of a framework directive on services of general interest. The latter would guarantee public services a stable legislative framework and adequate funding in compliance with the principles of universality and equality of access.</p>

Surely he cannot disregard the fact that the Belgian railways (SNCB) receive the highest subsidy in Europe? He cannot blame liberalisation, therefore, as passenger transport has not been liberalised, nor can he come up with all kinds of other excuses.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should also point out that he speaks on behalf of the Belgian francophone Socialist Party (PS), the party that has a good deal of control over the SNCB via the trade unions. If the politicised rail system ran the railways better, these things would not happen.</p>

The investigations are under way; they must be allowed to run their course.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, there is one factor that must never be ignored, and that is the human factor. In any liberalisation – I know that you support liberalisation, I support it far less, and indeed I oppose it where public services are concerned – the human factor is overlooked. Terrible pressure is put on members of staff, who work for hours on end or, in any case, for longer periods of time and without rest. As a train driver, one is responsible for passenger safety. Therefore, I believe it is important to ask about working conditions and any changes in those conditions. I believe that this is an important point.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the appalling train crash near Halle was a dreadful tragedy for the victims, their families, work colleagues and friends. The important thing now is to draw the necessary lessons from this tragedy, to avoid future casualties. In this, it is crucial that the voice of railway workers is clearly heard and heeded in making rail travel safe for both workers and passengers.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is indeed outrageous to hear a British Tory, I take it, a Member of this Parliament, malign and slander Belgian railway workers in the course of his contribution when it is quite clear that the policies of neoliberalisation and deregulation have done enormous damage to our railway system as a public facility. There is, in fact, enormous frustration among Belgian railway workers. This was clear from spontaneous strikes among those workers in the days after this tragedy, in response to it. This is the third serious incident in Belgium in nine months.</p>
      <p sl="en">After a previous tragedy in Belgium in 2001, comprehensive safety measures were promised but have not been implemented. The reality is that workers on the Belgian railways are under continuous pressure to work longer, with journeys being extended and fewer breaks, which means less safety. Of course, the perfidious policy of the EU Commission of liberalisation and privatisation will threaten safety further. It means that the profits of major transport companies come first. It is clear that the best structure to guarantee safety is to maintain the rail infrastructure in public ownership with democratic control and necessary investment.</p>

However, it will be of little consolation to those affected – the mourning families and the seriously injured – if we continue to emphasise that the railway is the safest form of transport and that the number of accidents is very low compared with those on the roads.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, the question of the circumstances arises. How could a disaster of this kind occur? However, as has already been said, this question must be dealt with by the technical experts and later by the courts. The question we have to answer is as follows: what has gone wrong in the process of creating a common European rail market? And secondly, how can we prevent further accidents using all the means available to us? Every accident is one too many.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a former railway employee, I have experienced the changes myself. I would like to mention some of the problems which, to a certain extent, have an impact on safety. At the beginning of the 1990s, instead of introducing competition on the railways, we should first have started a process of technical harmonisation. We should have overcome all the problems that Mr Kallas mentioned in the 1990s. We should only have opened up the market to competition on the basis of technical harmonisation. The fragmentation of the companies has resulted in many players being involved in the rail system and this is a system which only functions properly when it is operated as a single entity. Therefore, in my opinion, the Member States, the rail companies, the infrastructure operators and also the Commission, which, as has already been said, introduced directives and regulations without carrying out an interim evaluation, share the responsibility for the most recent accidents. The evaluation was only completed a short time ago. The rail companies have made the mistake of choosing the wrong strategy and of waiting too long for a European system. They have constantly attempted to reduce costs, have employed staff without the necessary level of skills, as already mentioned, and they have also invested too little.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are three points that I would like to highlight. The funding must be increased immediately in order to speed up the planned modernisation programme.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The recent rail accident in Belgium, with a casualty list of 20 dead and more than 120 injured, refocuses our attention in a shocking way on the importance of rail transport safety. Unfortunately, the economic and financial crisis has exacerbated the financial difficulties facing both operators and administrators involved in the rail transport infrastructure. It is a major concern that the lack of specialist staff and financial resources for implementing the ERTMS is one of the possible causes of the accident, while thousands of rail workers are losing their jobs. I call on Member States and the Commission to take the necessary measures in order to:</p>
      <p sl="ro">1. modernise the rail infrastructure and existing rolling stock to guarantee efficient and safe rail transport,</p>
      <p sl="ro">2. give priority to the investments required for rail transport safety and security, and</p>
      <p sl="ro">3. develop new rail transport infrastructures and implement the ERTMS.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent rail disasters that have rocked Europe – in Belgium today, in Italy yesterday – oblige us to consider the flaws in the system and the measures suitable for improving the services in safety terms.</p>
      <p sl="it">For example, it is astonishing to think that the European Union launched an appropriate system for monitoring rail traffic – the ERTMS – back in 2000, and that, in spite of this, 10 years later, the system has been adopted by only a very few Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">Even today, there are more than 20 different rail safety systems on EU territory, and it is clear how this can cause problems, particularly on international stretches of line.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is true that adapting the rail infrastructure and the rolling stock of the European system will involve technical and economic assessments and tasks, which will inevitably have to be managed by companies in the sector. However, we cannot fail to observe that European legislation does not set a date by which the national lines must be adapted to the ERTMS system and that it gives the Member States the power to determine the equipment needs of their rolling stock.</p>
      <p sl="it">It would be better to impose and to set dates, to incentivise by means of investments or, better still, to withdraw investment from those who fail to adapt to the infrastructure projects or who purchase rolling stock that does not use these systems.</p>
      <p sl="it">The other argument is that interoperability and the completion of the internal market should not be slowed down. Today, we have an independent national safety agency, which should verify the adoption of the appropriate safety systems. Well, it should be stipulated that safety certificates must be obtained before operating licences can be granted.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, I would stress that, looking ahead to the prospect of a free common rail market, the European Railway Agency’s inspection powers must be strengthened at central level.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the recent rail accident in Brussels, which many Members have mentioned, the spotlight has once again been on the safety of the railways.</p>
      <p sl="it">Directive 2004/49/EC on safety of the railways in general stipulates that railway undertakings and infrastructure managers should bear the full responsibility for the safety of the system, each for their own part.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the specific case of the accident that occurred in Belgium, human error seems to have been the cause. We shall, of course, await the investigations. It would appear, however, that the train was not fitted with an automatic braking system.</p>
      <p sl="it">Is the Commission aware of which networks and which trains within the Member States are not fitted with this safety device? Moreover, does it intend to draft a legislative proposal so as to ensure that the Union’s entire network is fitted with this system?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, first of all, I would like to express my sympathy to the victims’ families. I would like to talk about something which seems to me to be very important, and which has not been said here. There is a debate here which, in many ways, is justified. I, too, have my own very clear views on the matter. I think a deregulated market is significantly better than a market dominated by state-owned firms, but I would like to talk about something which is important in the context of this discussion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This dispute is not only about whether a firm is state-owned or privately-owned; it is also about whether the market is a free market or a restricted, regulated market, which often means, in fact, that in many Member States, there is a monopoly held by a single state-owned firm. There are so many railway systems, and they are not only different in each Member State, but in many cases, different systems are in use in a single Member State, and the systems we are talking about are often a protectionist administrative barrier put up only to protect the monopoly firm in the national market. In many cases, certain equipment and locomotives are not allowed, simply to limit the possibility of a competitor from another country or a private competitor from entering the market. The consequence of this is the establishment of so many different systems and the emergence of safety problems.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If you looked at the allocation of structural funds for infrastructure projects in new Member States, you would see that in those countries, there is practically no money for railway infrastructure. The administrators who are supposed to fill in applications and apply for money are not in the least interested in this. We are dealing with a model in which many Member States do not want anything to change in their railways, so that competition coming from other countries or the private market, for example, will not be in a good position. It is then safety and competitiveness which suffer because of this.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The tragic accident in Buizingen obliges all of us – Europe included – to open an investigation. This tragedy cost the lives of 18 people, and we owe it to those victims to learn lessons from the disaster in the short term and to ensure that safety is guaranteed on Belgian and European railway lines.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As we know, and you have already said, it is not Europe’s fault that the automatic stop system has yet to be fully introduced in Belgium. Yet this does not mean that Europe is not now required to act; quite the reverse. We expressly call for the European Commission, too, to now carry out an evaluation, which must provide the answers to several very specific questions. For example, as you know, we have obliged railway companies – including private firms – to fully equip their trains with the new European Train Control System (ETCS) as of 2013, yet we already know that Europe’s railway lines will not have been equipped with that system by then.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I wish to cite two figures. At the present time, Commissioner, only 2 800 kilometres of railway in the whole of Europe has been equipped with this new European safety system. The Belgian rail network alone, with its 3 400 kilometres, is larger than that. It is clear, therefore, that we in Europe are not ready for this and that therefore our trains will be unable, or insufficiently able, to communicate with these new signalling installations. This necessitates a thorough evaluation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, we must also dare to investigate whether the forthcoming competition between railway companies has maybe increased the pressure on staff. Should we perhaps consider introducing driving hours and rest periods for train drivers at European level, as we did for lorry drivers? In short, this accident obliges the European Union to do some soul-searching and carry out an evaluation, and there must also be the readiness and political will to make adjustments if necessary.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, two locomotives were involved in this dreadful accident which were operated by the SNCB, the Belgian National Railways, on a state rail network. There is no competition on the rail passenger transport market in Belgium. Therefore, this has nothing to do with competition or with the opening up of the network. It is all about unsatisfactory safety standards. Mr Grosch has already pointed out that the technology for stopping a train automatically when it passes a red signal has been in existence for more than 20 years. The question is: why was it not installed?</p>
      <p sl="de">This also has nothing to do with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). I was the rapporteur for the ERTMS. It represents a vision of the future, but it does not absolve the Member States from the responsibility of putting in place safety measures which are already available on a national level. That is a task for the individual countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, the question we must ask is why Belgium did not invest in this safety system over the last 20 years. If they had built a motorway that was shorter by one or two kilometres, they would have had twice or three times the money needed to install these safety systems and avoid accidents like this one. This was not the first time that a train has passed a red signal. It was simply the first time that this has led to such a dreadful accident.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, of course, this discussion, now initiated by the tragic accident in Belgium, will be part of our overall discussion on railway safety and the development of transport in Europe. The Commission is preparing a White Paper on the future of transport which takes serious consideration of all safety and security aspects of all modes of transport, including railways – which is, as was mentioned many times, still one of the safest modes of transport.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also important that we now discuss the railway package – the ‘first recast’ of the railway package – and we will definitely work on this and consider it.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I would just like to make some factual remarks. The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) has been designed with the intention to have interoperability of railways. It is obviously a good system which has very serious safety elements. However, safety still remains the responsibility of Member States, whatever system is used. But the ERTMS is progressing very well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Transport TEN-T Networks: again we will discuss it soon. This particular project deals with the deployment of the traffic management system. By 2020, 20 000 kilometres of railways will use this system in Europe, including Belgium.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is ongoing; but in railways, things take time and investments are large and 85% of the TEN-T Network money is used especially to improve the railways, including the ERTMS. Of course, I would be very happy if, with the support of the European Parliament, we could increase the funding of investments to transport networks. That will be very important.</p>
      <p sl="en">But again, of course, the human factor is always relevant. And as we are talking about safety standards, there is one standard – which is the red light – that means that you must stop. That standard has existed since the 19th century. So if we are now saying that there will be a 100% sure braking system which avoids human error – it is not true. There is always some small possibility for human error. And human responsibility is very important.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to make one more remark about liberalisation and public services: these are two different things. Nobody is stopping states from offering good public services, even in the framework of liberalisation. It is allowed by European rules to provide support – it is allowed by states – and this liberalisation does not exclude good public services.</p>

      <p sl="de">The tragic train accident in Belgium has attracted public attention to safety on the railways. The safety of the rolling stock must be improved, as well as the safety of the signalling systems. There are many completely outdated goods wagons, in particular, on the railways in Europe. The accident in Italy last year demonstrated the possible consequences of this. Unfortunately the EU has so far done very little to oblige freight operators to bring their rolling stock up to an acceptable safety standard. It is important to remember that hazardous goods are also transported by rail, which could have devastating consequences in the event of an accident. Against this background, I am calling for higher safety standards on the railways.</p>

    <intervention id="4-090" speaker_id="1164" name="Bruno Gollnisch" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="fr">The tragedy that plunged Belgium into its present state of mourning undoubtedly occurred for reasons to do with the specific characteristics of that country, as many of our Flemish fellow Members have emphasised today. It will be up to the investigation to determine the extent to which those characteristics were responsible for the tragedy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, it did have one particular, fundamental cause: the liberalisation of rail transport and the separation of the management of the network from that of rail transport itself. Therefore, the network, its quality and its safety have been sacrificed for the sake of the profit of transport operators, which are finding the tolls imposed on them to be too high, just as the replacement and the modernisation of trains is being sacrificed. The timetables and frequency of services today respond to the logic of profit making, and no longer to the needs of users. Even though they are used regularly, some lines are being taken out of service because they are not profitable enough. Others are still in service when common sense suggests that they should not be. Delays are becoming the norm, including in the case of TGV services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In your liberal system, citizens who take the train have not become much-valued customers; they are still user-taxpayers who can be treated like cattle. As is the case with all the activities that you have liberalised, today we are paying more and more for a service that is becoming increasingly worse, not to say, unfortunately, dangerous.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In view of the tragic accident in Brussels, we are once again faced with the issue that Member States have not yet fully harmonised their rail safety systems, even though Directive 2004/49/EC clearly establishes common standards for safety indicators and fully meets safety requirements overall, including for infrastructure and traffic management. The major problem is actually a strictly financial issue: the service life of the railway infrastructures and rolling stock, including the signalling systems, is extremely long. In these circumstances, it would be desirable for Member States to look beyond this financial issue, in spite of the crisis, and to consider accelerating the implementation of interoperable systems, as well as invest more in the railway infrastructure and signalling systems for both the infrastructure and rolling stock.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The savings made by delaying the refurbishment and modernisation of the rolling stock and railway infrastructures can, as in this case, unfortunately result in tragic accidents where not only huge economic and financial losses were sustained, but also the loss of human lives, which is unacceptable. I would like to convey my every sympathy to the affected families during this difficult time and I hope that this kind of tragedy will never happen again.</p>

If the European Union is truly interested in Ukraine, the first step towards this should be lifting the visa requirement for Ukrainians. I hope that adoption of today’s resolution will accelerate work on bringing these ideas into being. This is why I voted for adoption of the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I had the pleasure of being an observer during the presidential elections in Ukraine, at both the first and second rounds, as, indeed, I had several years ago. I would like to say that we should treat Ukraine as a partner, and not interfere with the sympathies of the Ukrainian electorate. I consider as absolutely unnecessary the statement made in this House yesterday by one of the leaders of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, a liberal, who said that the new President will be pro-Moscow. The new President of Ukraine, on his first foreign visit since taking office, is coming to Brussels. We should assess Ukrainian politicians by what they do, and not by whatever declarations they might have made. Ukraine should be our political partner, and we should open the way for Ukraine to join the European Union. I am pleased by the statement of the new President that he will annul the decree which Mr Kalinowski spoke about, the scandalous decree which recognises as a national hero of Ukraine a man who has the blood of many thousands of Poles on his hands.</p>

It is a great pity that we could not accept the amendment which concerns a subject that is of great importance for the future of the world.

After all, more or less all European countries are suffering a huge financial and economic crisis and masses of people are losing their jobs, and the best we can come up with is to allocate ourselves substantially more resources, more staff and more costs at the taxpayer’s expense. Besides, everyone knows that these additional resources and staff members are, in fact, mainly intended to ensure that the various socialists who lost their mandates in recent elections are well looked after financially. In the past, too, this has led to other substantial increases in subsidies, including to European political parties and European political foundations.

      <p sl="pt">The part of it that relates to increasing human resources for Parliamentary committees and groups to the sum of EUR 4 million can be justified because the Treaty of Lisbon is making new legislative demands of Parliament. Increasing MEPs’ funds for hiring assistants by EUR 8 million, however, means that next year, it will not be 8 million, but 16 million, and this is clearly excessive, as in the coming year, a new increase of EUR 1 500 per month is planned for Members, which amounts to not 16, but EUR 32 million. At a time when we are seeing massive unemployment and social crisis in all our countries, moving towards increases in resources for Members is not sustainable unless, at the same time, we have the courage to cut down on the expenses and allowances to which we are entitled as Members, and which are by no means all completely justified.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I fail to understand how, for a day of travelling, an MEP can receive EUR 300 in allowances, plus a subsidy for the distance travelled and a subsidy for the time taken, provisions that are entirely tax-free. We can cut undue expenses and then debate how we can increase our means for law making.

The primary function of the Lisbon Treaty is to provide additional work and additional revenue for all the tens of thousands who are now directly or indirectly dependent on the European Union for their livelihoods. The one lot of people that we have not consulted about this are the electorates and I would love to see issues like this put before our voters to see whether they approve of our voting ourselves additional resources at such a time, when now all of them are tightening their own belts.</p>

      <p sl="en">That argument is becoming academic because the fish have effectively disappeared. Even in the time that I have been in this House, there has been a calamitous decline in what ought to have been a renewable resource.

However, the information obligations imposed by the regulation could mean that the policy interferes too much in the economy and that competition is undermined, as a result of news being spread about the projects. It is therefore important to ensure that the data that is gathered and managed safeguards the confidentiality and the activities of businesses. Analysis of this data will certainly help to ensure that best use is made of the investments. However, the analysis must be accompanied by concrete financial measures to support those works and to provide an incentive for private investment in the sector. The Marguerite Fund for infrastructure, energy and climate change must be strengthened. The initiative is valid and necessary, but this fund needs to be swelled with the EU resources that are already available in the budget and linked to forms of financing guaranteed by the European Investment Bank and/or other financial institutions, so that it can have an adequate share in the equity of the individual public-private partnerships that are in operation.</p>

It must take account of the deterioration of the energy sector in terms of supply, which can be seen both inside and outside the EU. It is also worth paying attention to crucial investment in infrastructure that manages to avoid security problems in terms of energy supply.</p>

      <p sl="it">The proposal shows the effects of the emergency gas supply situation that emerged in January 2009, when the Commission realised that the Union’s energy infrastructure was not fit for purpose. The European Commission’s aim, which Parliament fully supported, was to have a constantly updated picture of the energy infrastructure system. Today, there is great uncertainty about whether the investment projects will be carried out, and it has been made worse by the economic and financial crisis. I believe that intervention is necessary and that the lack of consistent data and information on investment projects should be remedied. Without this data, it is impossible to analyse the expected development of the Union’s infrastructure and to introduce satisfactory monitoring in view of a cross-sector approach. Moreover, Regulation (EC) No 736/96, which the proposal in question repeals, is no longer applied consistently and is incompatible with the recent developments in the energy sector. With this proposal, we have therefore strengthened the existing system, significantly improving the comparability of the information while, at the same time, reducing the associated administrative burdens. Lastly, I should like to emphasise the fact that I voted against Amendment 81 (by which the entire nuclear energy chain was to be included in the infrastructure covered by the regulation), since there are already provisions which regulate these matters in the Euratom Treaty.</p>

Even more historic, for the first time since I worked in this House, we managed to get rid of the Euratom Treaty as a legal basis although this regulation covers also transparency for investments in the nuclear sector. This has been confirmed by the positive vote on AM 30 listing nuclear fuels as a primary energy source under the scope of the regulation. For sure, we will have to fight now to maintain this victory in the upcoming tripartite negotiations with Council and COM; MS must provide, at least five years before construction starts, the amount and types of investment in energy projects. This is a really wise move towards better future energy scenarios, since the Commission will get a better idea of how the energy market is evolving; renewables, including decentralised ones, will have to be fully considered; every single mention of ‘low carbon’, the pro-nuclear Trojan horse has been deleted.</p>

      <p sl="it">The compromise resolution put to the vote in this House unfortunately contains passages that prevent me from voting in favour. The UNHCR is a political body that is subject to ‘extreme politicisation’, as is acknowledged in the text of the resolution. However, we could have – I believe – said much more, especially since we are dealing with a subject that is sensitive and important to so many of us, namely human rights. Upon reading the text, I note an unfortunate weakness – perhaps not for the politics of diplomacy, but certainly for that of values – and that is the lack of determination when criticising the well-known aspects that make the UNHCR a very controversial body. We could have, in fact, been more decisive, speaking out more strongly against Iran’s candidacy in the next Council elections. There is no specific reference to the senseless composition of a Council in which there sit too many members who are scarcely qualified to lecture on human rights, and who evidently have even fewer credentials to be able to judge or to try anyone. My vote is therefore one of abstention and of scepticism about this text: I am abstaining in the hope that Parliament will take off its diplomatic hat – it is not its job to be diplomatic – and embrace more courageously the battle for values and for human rights.</p>

It must take centre stage in this sort of initiative, all the more so nowadays, when infringements tend to be the rule under autocratic regimes which engage in ‘capitalist violence’ in order to impose their antisocial policies. The European Union must re-examine its relations with the state of Israel, taking serious account of Israel’s military operations on Palestinian territory and of attacks on the rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to eventually acquire its own homeland.

It is gratifying that the programme of the Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Trio Presidency places great emphasis, on the one hand, on following up on the implementation of the Beijing objectives, and, on the other, declares its intention to take a comprehensive approach to preventing and combating the poverty that affects women and children. These perspectives will, hopefully, also be addressed with due seriousness at the UN meeting scheduled for early March.

I particularly support the paragraph stressing that ‘sexual and reproductive health and rights are an integral part of the women’s rights agenda’. I would like to point out in this regard that, when my report on equality between women and men was adopted in 2009, the majority of MEPs supported the view that women had to have easy access to contraception and abortion.</p>

The agreement to shift the problem from December to January, the desire not to publicise the budgetary burden of the Treaty of Lisbon, and the hasty manner in which the issue was raised, without any scope to demand, where necessary, more efficient use of the resources currently available, have led to a real distortion of the facts.</p>

The monopoly friendly nature of EU policy is illustrated by the fact that 2/3 of Community funds have been channelled to big business (fishing companies, fish farms, processing), while the remaining 1/3 has been given to poor and middling fishermen to break up their boats and leave the profession. Measures to replace/improve vessels have only benefited large companies. The report, like the Green Paper, apportions equal responsibility for the reduction in fish stocks to large fishing companies and small-scale coastal fisheries. It does not differentiate between the measures needed in fisheries areas and overlooks their individual peculiarities. The EU common fisheries policy serves the ambitions of the big fishing companies that will remain to plunder the wealth of the seas and supports big business in the fish farming sector.

      <p sl="sv">We Swedish Social Democrats voted against the report on the Green Paper and the reform of the EU fisheries policy. The majority in Parliament rejected the prioritising of ecological sustainability and voted in favour of an amendment stating that our policy towards countries outside the EU should be governed by the interests of European fisheries. We find this unacceptable and therefore elected to vote ‘no’. We are also sceptical about the fact that the European Parliament wants to provide more money for the common fisheries policy – this is something that we do not wish to be involved in, unless the purpose is to make a clear change to the policy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I would like to begin by highlighting the excellent report produced by Mrs Patrão Neves. Fishing communities are currently undergoing a difficult period, marked by severe deterioration in fish stocks. This activity has an impact on the food supply for the general population and on the cohesion of the outermost regions of the European Union. For this reason, there needs to be an integrated and comprehensive approach to the reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that it is urgent and vital for the European Union to engage effectively in ensuring better conditions of economic sustainability for fishermen, within a framework that can safeguard the specific features of each region and that recognises that a different approach is required for small-scale fisheries. It is worth pointing out the recommendation of concrete measures such as the reduction in the number of middlemen in the chain between the producer and the consumer. On the other hand, this reform cannot be isolated from the sustainable use of marine resources in a technical and scientific process of assessment that has been thoroughly checked, and which will contribute to the conciliation of the sector and have a bearing on quality and food security for consumers. Within the context of changing the capacity of fisheries, I would like to emphasise the impact of modernising equipment on the professional dignity and safety of fishermen in a sector where loss of life is common.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The rejection by a majority in Parliament of the proposals that we tabled here, turning down the privatisation of fisheries resources, is indicative of the route that it is attempting to follow with the forthcoming reform of the CFP. Parliament not only fails to reject the Commission’s proposal for the creation of (private) property rights for access to use a public good to be imposed; it also opens the way for that intention to be made official. This is an option that does not safeguard the sustainability of resources and it will inevitably lead to a concentration of activity among entities with greater economic and financial power all over the EU, seriously threatening small-scale, coastal fisheries that, in the case of Portugal, represent more than 90% of the fleet.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We did note some positive points in the report, some of which corresponded with the proposals that we tabled, but we cannot fail to note that overall, the report sticks to a markedly liberal approach, and one which greatly limits the sovereignty of the Member States over their marine resources. It also fails to provide a thorough response to one of the main issues that the sector is facing: income from work. We can but point out the rejection of the proposals that we tabled, aimed at improving marketing in the sector, which would increase the remuneration for the fishermen’s work.</p>

A number of amendments tabled by myself were successful and thus, the report recognises relative stability, the need to incentivise conservation efforts and the success that has been national control within the 12-mile zone. However, the report goes on to state that historical rights should be reviewed. Fisheries management must be returned to the fishing nations; those fishing nations must not lose their historical rights. I therefore voted against a report which invites an attack on such fundamental traditional rights of access to fish stocks.</p>

      <p sl="de">A fundamental and comprehensive reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP) is to be welcomed, particularly with a view to the sustainable management of fish resources. This is to be enabled by refining and standardising the framework conditions, better controls on the part of the Member States, and simplifying the decision-making system. Even though Austria, as an inland country, is not directly concerned, the steadily growing consumption of sea fish is influencing fishing. We need practical and efficient solutions that offer the sector a basis for sufficient viability through good stock conditions, ensure supply to consumers and, at the same time, guarantee the maintenance of species diversity and safeguard the marine ecosystem as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="en">This report is a broad document that covers all the aspects of the CFP, from aquaculture to angling, from the Baltic Sea to fisheries agreements with third world countries. The Greens are happy about many of the amendments to the report that we managed to get accepted, such as fundamental principles on demands for sustainability on those that will have the right to fish, demands of environmental impact assessments on fisheries operations, the statement that the EU should not compete with local fishermen under the fisheries agreements, but only be allowed to fish from a surplus of fish, and also the motion to all EU institutions to put illegal fishing on top of the international agenda in all relevant fora, to protect the oceans as well as food security. Unfortunately, there were also some completely unacceptable and contradictory paragraphs approved in the final text, such as the objective of the external parts of the CFP is to protect and promote European fisheries interests, that ecological sustainability should not be prioritised over social and economical sustainability and that all policy areas should contribute to fulfilling the CFP’s objectives. This is why the Green group could not support the report, but abstained.</p>

      <p sl="pt">() The common fisheries policy, which was last revised in 2002, is not yet sufficient to weather the vicissitudes of this sensitive sector. For this reason, it is necessary to analyse the new factors that are affecting the sector and find new solutions to make it completely viable, particularly in economic, social and environmental terms. I therefore recommend that new measures be taken to allow the fishing sector to escape from its current perilous situation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The fisheries industry is very important in the EU. It is therefore vital that the new CFP takes account of the rational and responsible management of resources, and that it concerns itself with protecting marine resources and maintaining the way of life of those who have always earned their living from fishing. The new CFP needs to be capable of resolving productivity problems within the sector, stabilising markets and ensuring a good standard of living for families who are dependent on this sector. However, this sector should be analysed as a whole, not in sections, so that we can integrate all its problems and vicissitudes in order to resolve them to the satisfaction of all those involved, and overcome the main problems affecting it: overfishing, overcapacity, overinvestment and wastage.</p>

      <p sl="de">That fishing has a long tradition in Europe, and, one hopes, also will have in the future, is welcome. Developments in these last few years certainly indicate that working in this sector of the economy is becoming fundamentally less attractive. The reason for this is that groups of companies with their masses of fish products are pushing retail prices down so far that small fishing businesses cannot compete. As a result of these circumstances, this sector is increasingly becoming the province of workers from third countries. On account of the fact that this motion for a resolution does not sufficiently deal with this issue, I voted against it.</p>

      <p sl="en">I abstained in the final vote on the Neves Patrão report because it contained both positive and negative paragraphs. In one side, agrees that priority access should be given to those who fish in the most environmentally sustainable way, leading to fewer discards, more jobs and less energy use, and stresses that the right to fish must be based on environmental and social criteria, rather than on who caught the most fish 30 years ago. It is years of overfishing that has led to the current crisis, so it is absurd to let the same fleets continue the damage. Other positive points include making ecological sustainability the basic premise of the CFP and the recognition that EU fleets must no longer overfish in the waters of developing countries. Unfortunately, less constructive ideas are also in the report, such as a refusal to accept the destructive influence of subsidies. The report also declares the CFP to be the dominant policy in the EU, with environment and development policies being subservient to it. It is this ‘preserve the fishing industry at all costs’ attitude that has led to the destruction of the marine ecosystem and the fishing communities that depend upon it.</p>

The first concerns Amendment 3 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The FDP members voted against, because a radical devolution of fisheries policy such as proposed in the motion with the transfer of powers and responsibility to Member States and to local decision makers cannot be reconciled with the European common fisheries policy. The idea here is precisely to find common forward-looking solutions at an EU level. FDP members supported Amendment 33 because it supports the important principle of relative stability, which is important for Germans. This concerns the basis for quota allocation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European fishing industry is sailing through troubled waters: fish stocks are plummeting, 400 000 European fishermen and their families are worrying about their future and wondering about the effectiveness of the common fisheries policy (CFP) which, until now, has provided them with a safety net.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the light of the structural problems identified, namely overfishing, underinvestment, overcapacity of the fishing fleet and waste (how many tonnes of fish are discarded into the sea every day because they are not fit for consumption?), reform of the CFP must be a top priority. Clearly, any reform must take account of the individual features of the various fishing areas and avoid at all costs a one-size-fits-all management model. The fishing techniques and vessels used in the North Sea are quite different from those used in the Gulf of Gascony. That is why the reform proposed by the Commission, which is based on regionalisation and which was adopted by Parliament this afternoon, is essential.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A responsible policy must also take account of the reality as presented by the figures: the EU accounts for approximately 4.5% of world fishing production and does not aspire to become a ‘giant’ in the sector. This is yet another reason why we must opt for small-scale, innovative and sustainable fishing.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission’s Green Paper on this issue was a damning indictment and an honest recognition that the common fisheries policy has not worked. On the contrary, it has contributed to a variety of problems which continue to have economic, social and environmental impacts. Only two weeks ago, this House voted in favour of suspending international trade in bluefin tuna because of the critically low stocks – a situation which is yet another sign that our current levels of fishing are unsustainable and have serious consequences for biodiversity and the future of the fishing sector. We must recognise that a new approach is needed. A decentralised policy with more funding will allow different regions to adapt and respond to their own circumstances – something that the previous ‘top-down’ policy prevented. This should lead to better management of stocks and have a positive effect on the marine environment. I fully support the Commission’s commitment to whole-scale and fundamental reform, which has been rightly backed by the Committee on Fisheries. It is vital that we act to ensure that the European Union implements a truly sustainable fishing policy in order to protect stocks, the environment, and European jobs in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I abstained from the vote on the report on the common fisheries policy as it contains too many points that not only conflict with a number of other points in the report but also run counter to my political perspective on European fisheries policy. On the one hand, the report says that European fishing fleets may no longer overfish the waters of developing countries, but on the other, it says that the common fisheries policy always takes precedence over environmental and development policies. This position is patently at variance with the Treaty of Lisbon, Article 208 of which states that our foreign policy must not undermine the development objectives of poor countries. The policy proposed by Parliament most certainly benefits Europe, but outside European waters, Europe is championing only its own fishing fleets and not the local fish stocks and fishermen. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has therefore abstained. In addition, whilst the report does recognise that there is a serious problem of overfishing and that sustainability must form the starting point for the policy, it fails to recognise that fleet capacity and the subsidy and quota systems are at the root of this problem.
