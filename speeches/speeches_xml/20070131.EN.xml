      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome you warmly to the formal sitting with the President of Romania.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">President Băsescu, I welcome you most warmly to the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Din toată inima vă urez, domnule Preşedinte, bine aţi venit în Parlamentul European!</p>
      <a text="(Aplauze)"/>
      <p sl="de">It is an honour to welcome you to this House, President Băsescu, not for the first time, but for the first time as the president of a new Member State of our European Union, on behalf of whose citizens, whom we in this House represent, I wish once more to express my joy at the accession of your own country and at that of Bulgaria, whereby you have become members of our European family.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also again like to highlight the historic significance of the enlargement of the European Union that occurred on 1 January this year. It took over sixty years for your country to be restored to a free Europe and for our continent to be reunited.</p>
      <p sl="de">The accession of Romania and Bulgaria constituted a massive advance in that reunification process; both these accessions will enhance the political and cultural dimension of European integration and enrich both your country and the EU itself.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am reminded of the words of the ‘Hora Unirii’ sung on the occasion of the unification of the two principalities of Moldavia and Walachia in 1859, ‘Where one alone stands is no strength; where many stand, it grows’. This Romanian song expresses very well the European Union’s goal and vision, the potential and strength that we in Europe can bring together to give our continent a better future and our citizens prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="de">This being so, Romania’s accession embodies the idea of European integration, cooperation and solidarity for the benefit of all those who pool their strengths in the quest for democracy, peace, equality and tolerance.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to congratulate Romania and its people most especially on the particular advances they have achieved and the associated efforts they have sustained in order to make accession possible. Many reforms were accomplished in a relatively short period of time. These advances and triumphs must also be honoured today, but perhaps I might add, Mr President, that these reforms must also be continued, and with some determination.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament takes pride and rejoices in its 35 new Romanian Members and also in the presence of a Romanian Commissioner in our midst. From day to day, we come across new people from your country in the Commission and in the Council. We are also all looking forward to welcoming the Members that your country will be electing in its first elections to this Parliament in May.</p>
      <p sl="de">We all have to learn from one another, and that is something that we in this House are working on. Together with Romania and Bulgaria, we will press on with our dedicated efforts towards a united EU.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Bun venit României şi poporului român în Uniunea Europeană!</p>

      <p sl="ro">Preşedintele României. Stimate domnule Preşedinte,</p>
      <p sl="ro">Onoraţi membri al Parlamentului European,</p>
      <p sl="ro">Excelenţele Voastre,</p>
      <p sl="ro">Doamnelor şi Domnilor,</p>
      <p sl="ro">Este o onoare pentru mine să fiu primul preşedinte al României care, după aderarea noastră la Uniunea Europeană se adresează acestui distins for parlamentar şi, prin dumneavoastră, tuturor cetăţenilor europeni. Privilegiul este cu atât mai mare cu cât este cunoscută activitatea remarcabilă a Parlamentului în slujba construcţiei europene.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Prin poziţia sa de promotor ferm şi implicat al procesului de extindere, forul parlamentar a transmis României încă de la început un mesaj de susţinere şi de parteneriat. Numeroşi membri ai Parlamentului ne-au devenit, de-a lungul timpului, cei mai apropiaţi prieteni şi pentru aceasta le mulţumesc.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Doresc să transmit şi pe această cale felicitările mele domnului Hans-Gert Pöttering, pentru alegerea sa în funcţia de Preşedinte al Parlamentului European şi să-i doresc mult succes în activitatea viitoare. De asemenea, felicit pe toţi cei dintre dvs. care aţi fost desemnaţi în structura de conducere a Parlamentului European şi vă doresc mult succes în îndeplinirea misiunii dumneavoastră.</p>
      <p sl="ro">În acelaşi timp, îi mulţumesc domnului Josep Borrell şi îl felicit pentru impresionanta sa activitate în calitate de preşedinte al Parlamentului European. Perioada mandatului domnului Borrell a coincis cu momentele importante ale parcursului nostru european şi pentru aceasta îi suntem recunoscători.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Urez, de asemenea, succes euro-parlamentarilor români care se află la început de drum. Datoria ce le revine în calitate de reprezentanţi ai cetăţenilor europeni este una pe cât de onorantă pe atât de dificilă. Sunt pe deplin încrezător în capacitatea parlamentarilor români de a răspunde aşa cum se cuvine aşteptărilor cetăţenilor europeni, din care fac parte acum şi cetăţenii României.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Doamnelor si domnilor,</p>
      <p sl="ro">Din momentul în care s-au putut exprima liber, după decembrie 1989, românii s-au pronunţat fără echivoc pentru revenirea în familia europeană. Mesajul principal al aderării noastre a fost : „Am revenit în Europa!“</p>
      <p sl="ro">Românii au văzut în Uniunea Europeană un model de cooperare care a reuşit să faciliteze împlinirea potenţialului fiecărui cetăţean european.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Aderarea României la Uniunea Europeană coincide cu apropierea unui moment aniversar de referinţă pentru construcţia comunitară. Este vorba de marcarea, la 25 martie, a unei jumătăţi de secol de acţiune solidară în jurul unor idealuri comune : pace, libertate, toleranţă, pluralism, respect faţă de lege, unitate în diversitate, prosperitate economică, coeziune socială. Toate aceste valori definesc Uniunea Europeană şi i-au dat permanent forţa de a merge mai departe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Într-o lume în plină globalizare, Uniunea trebuie să fie mai puternică, mai eficientă, iar resursele de care va avea nevoie pentru aceasta trebuie să vină tocmai din solidaritate, din forţa politică, economică şi socială a noastră, a statelor care o compunem. Cu fiecare nou stat, Uniunea devine mai puternică, mai dinamică, mai bogată. Din această perspectivă, o Uniune de 27 de state membre nu poate fi decât un câştig atât pentru noii veniţi, cât şi pentru Uniune în ansamblu.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Distinşi membri ai Parlamentului European,</p>
      <p sl="ro">Chiar dacă am devenit un stat membru al Uniunii Europene, înţelegem din experienţa proprie a procesului de pregătire internă că aderarea nu este sinonimă cu integrarea propriu-zisă. Aş putea spune chiar că adevărata provocare acum începe. Ni s-a deschis o nouă perspectivă, depinde de noi să o valorificăm şi să o transformăm într-un succes atât pentru România, cât şi pentru proiectul european.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Vă asigur, că după 1 ianuarie 2007 nu am căzut în capcana relaxării si suntem conştienţi că procesul real al integrării noastre abia acum începe. Este un efort pe termen lung, ce trebuie făcut la noi acasă, nu numai de către instituţiile statului, dar şi de fiecare român în parte.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Integrarea noastră trebuie să vină, în primul rând, din capacitatea de a genera creştere economică, din instituţii eficiente, o justiţie credibilă, independentă şi capabilă să facă dreptate oamenilor, funcţionari necorupţi, infrastructură la standarde europene, un mediu curat. Pe scurt, un standard de viaţă pentru cetăţenii români compatibil cu cel al cetăţenilor europeni.</p>
      <p sl="ro">În mod egal, integrarea României trebuie să vină şi din capacitatea noastră de a fi solidari cu interesul general al Uniunii. De asemenea, integrarea României înseamnă capacitatea noastră de a armoniza interesul naţional cu interesul general al Uniunii, dar şi din capacitatea de ne-a aduce aportul real la competitivitatea, securitatea şi coeziunea internă a Uniunii Europene.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Dacă ne raportăm la punctul de plecare, începutul anilor `90, rezultatele sunt importante. În România de astăzi judecătorii sunt independenţi, iar miniştrii sunt responsabili pentru actele lor în exerciţiul funcţiei. Situaţia copiilor instituţionalizaţi sau a celor cu deficienţe s-a ameliorat considerabil.</p>
      <p sl="ro">S-a făcut un efort important în integrarea romilor, problemă care încă nu este rezolvată la parametri satisfăcători. România are astăzi cele mai dure legislaţii pentru declaraţiile de avere şi de interese pentru cei aflaţi în funcţii publice; în România s-a eliminat practica reeşalonării datoriilor companiilor, s-a introdus transparenţa în acordarea fondurilor publice şi s-au întărit sancţiunile penale pentru evaziune fiscală.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Cu toate acestea, România mai are mult pentru a recupera decalajul care o desparte de statele membre avansate, chiar şi faţă de actuala medie europeană. Venitul mediu pe economie este de numai 328 de euro. Infrastructura de transport este mult rămasă în urmă. Dezvoltarea rurală şi eliminarea agriculturii de subzistenţă constituie încă o mare provocare. Procentul populaţiei ocupate în agricultură este încă foarte ridicat.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Clasa de mijloc este insuficient de puternică pentru a deveni un motor puternic al societăţii. Şi lista nu se sfârşeşte aici.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Întrebarea dumneavoastră firească ar putea să fie: Ce garanţii există că România va continua reformele începute şi că va elimina aceste deficienţe? Garanţia constă în însuşi sprijinul populaţiei României şi voinţa politică a liderilor. Nu uitaţi că niciun alt obiectiv politic, altul decât aderarea la Uniunea Europeană, nu a reuşit să unească cu aceeaşi forţă în jurul lui întreaga societate românească şi să coalizeze întreg spectrul politic, ridicându-se deasupra oricăror interese de partid sau a intereselor individuale. Contez pe aceeaşi mobilizare şi pentru procesul integrării propriu-zise. Personal, în limitele prerogativelor mele constituţionale, vă asigur că acest obiectiv se va realiza. Avem această datorie politică şi morală în primul rând faţă de cetăţenii României.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Vom continua acest efort cu românii şi pentru români. Vom găsi mai mult timp şi mai multă răbdare pentru a dezbate la noi acasă implicaţiile directe ale acestui efort asupra vieţii cotidiene a cetăţenilor noştri. Îi vom familiariza mai bine cu instituţiile şi temele europene. Le vom vorbi despre avantaje dar, în acelaşi timp, va trebui să le explicăm şi situaţii care par greu de explicat. De exemplu, de ce românii nu pot avea acces pe piaţa muncii din unele state membre, chiar dacă cei mai mulţi dintre ei sunt muncitori cinstiţi.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Şi pentru că mă adresez de la cea mai înaltă tribună a democraţiei europene, aş dori să vă mărturisesc o preocupare personală pe această temă: Uniunea a reuşit să depăşească, în mod formal si instituţional, vechile diviziuni est-vest. Este o realizare istorică, o realizare a acestui secol. La nivelul cetăţenilor din unele state membre însă, persistă un deficit de cunoaştere şi ezitări în acceptarea est-europenilor ca parteneri deplini şi membri ai aceleiaşi familii. Nu doresc să generalizez, dar fenomenul există şi are efecte asupra Uniunii în ansamblu.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Noi, oamenii politici, aleşi direct de cetăţeni, avem datoria să promovăm, împreună, căi de a îmbunătăţi cunoaşterea reciprocă între cetăţenii noştri. Rezultatul va spori coeziunea internă a Uniunii, va diminua tendinţele ultra-naţionaliste sau extremiste şi va consolida Uniunea noastră de 27 de state membre. Să învăţăm din experienţa politicienilor din acele state membre care au plătit un preţ politic important pentru că nu au acordat locul cuvenit comunicării cu cetăţenii lor şi că au lăsat loc pentru îndoieli şi neînţelegeri faţă de unele evoluţii europene. Şi aici avem nevoie de sprijinul dvs. Avem nevoie de voinţa dvs. de a înţelege că naţiunile noastre, ale est-europenilor, au motive de mândrie, au oameni de excepţie, au adesea o istorie europeană bogată, au plusuri pe care le oferă Uniunii în ansamblul ei.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Doamnelor şi domnilor,</p>
      <p sl="ro">Avem convingerea că asigurarea coeziunii interne a Uniunii Europene reprezintă o premisă esenţială inclusiv pentru dotarea Uniunii cu capacitatea de a juca un rol extern corespunzător potenţialului său. Astfel, vom putea răspunde sfidărilor actuale la adresa securităţii în sens larg, fie că este vorba de securitatea energetică, migraţie ilegală, sau focarele de conflicte şi instabilitate din zonele învecinate.</p>
      <p sl="ro">România va contribui la afirmarea tot mai puternică a Uniunii Europene ca actor global. Mai ales acolo unde poate aduce o reală valoare adăugată. Şi aici, am în vedere: relaţiile cu Balcanii de Vest şi vecinătatea estică a Uniunii Europene.</p>
      <p sl="ro">În Balcanii de Vest, anul 2007 va reprezenta într-un fel „anul adevărului”. Este anul în care comunitatea internaţională va trebui să demonstreze că poate propune o soluţie viabilă pentru provincia Kosovo. Sunteţi desigur la curent cu rezervele pe care le avem faţă de impunerea din afară a unei soluţii. Cred că problemele sensibile din Balcani – Kosovo, perspectivele Bosniei şi Herţegovinei, ale Republicii Muntenegru, angajarea Serbiei pe orbita europeană, dar şi combaterea criminalităţii sau a puseurilor extremiste – îşi vor găsi rezolvarea numai într-o abordare unitară, la nivel regional.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Dificultăţile din aria Balcanilor de Vest pretind o soluţie integrată, inclusiv asigurarea unei perspective europene clare.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Perspectiva europeană oferită Republicii Moldova trebuie să fie similară cu cea pentru Balcanii de Vest. România intenţionează să explice, să susţină şi să găsească sprijin în interiorul Uniunii Europene pentru ca Republica Moldova să revină în Europa, acolo de unde a plecat în 1940 fără voinţa ei. Şi populaţia României şi populaţia Republicii Moldova au aceeaşi istorie, vorbesc aceeaşi limbă, au aceeaşi cultură, aceleaşi tradiţii şi aceleaşi aspiraţii europene. Cu siguranţă, este o obligaţie morală şi politică a României şi a românilor să lupte pentru ca familiile noastre de la est de Prut să revină acasă, în Europa.</p>
      <p sl="ro">O altă zonă care concentrează tot mai mult atenţia noastră este bazinul Mării Negre, ţinând cont că acesta nu este doar o zonă de mare perspectivă, dar şi una cu multiple riscuri şi provocări. Cred că suntem cu toţii convinşi că zona extinsă a Mării Negre oferă multe dintre răspunsurile posibile la marile întrebări legate de securitatea energetică europeană şi globală.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Vrem să dotăm regiunea cu instrumente şi mecanisme pentru controlul traficului ilicit de orice natură, pentru combaterea terorismului şi a proliferării armelor de distrugere în masă. Ne dorim ca 2007 să aducă progrese reale în soluţionarea diverselor conflicte îngheţate din regiune şi suntem deschişi la dialog cu orice partener care poate contribui la aceasta.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Vom susţine implicarea Uniunii Europene în procesele de soluţionare a conflictelor îngheţate, inclusiv sub umbrela Politicii Europene de Securitate şi Apărare. Sperăm ca, împreună cu statele vecine, să transformăm această regiune într-un model de coexistenţă paşnică.</p>
      <p sl="ro">România îşi propune să fie şi în continuare un contributor activ la consolidarea securităţii internaţionale. Vom rămâne angajaţi în proiectele promovate de Uniune în cadrul Politicii Europene de Securitate şi Apărare. În acelaşi timp, ne pronunţăm pentru un parteneriat transatlantic solid şi pentru consolidarea cooperării NATO şi Uniunea Europeană. Nu putem concepe Europa si America de Nord decât ca entităţi puternice care au obiective şi valori comune.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Stimaţi membri ai Parlamentului European,</p>
      <p sl="ro">Aşa cum am mai spus, am înţeles că integrarea deplină în Uniunea Europeană nu înseamnă numai avantaje pentru noi şi că implică, deopotrivă, responsabilităţi şi solidaritate. Şi pentru că sunt întrebat adesea care este valoarea adăugată pe care România o aduce Uniunii Europene, permiteţi-mi să mă refer la câteva aspecte: pentru o Uniune preocupată de creşterea economică şi a competitivităţii ei globale, oferim, între noile state membre, a doua piaţă ca mărime după Polonia şi importante oportunităţi pentru investiţii. România a intrat în al şaptelea an consecutiv de creştere economică, cu o rată de 8,4% pentru 2006, superioară cu mult mediei de creştere economică a Uniunii. Acest lucru ne dă încrederea că ne aflăm pe drumul cel bun, chiar dacă unele reforme mai trebuie continuate şi consolidate. Investiţiile străine directe în 2006 în România s-au cifrat la 8,5 miliarde euro, iar în cei 17 ani de reforme transformările dramatice care au avut loc au permis ca românii care au îmbrăţişat schimbarea să se apropie de standardele pentru intrarea în Uniunea Europeană. Un alt argument este că românii sunt un popor creştin, de origine latină, cu o puternică cultură europeană, un popor care a ştiut să-şi păstreze tradiţiile şi obiceiurile.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Suntem un stat cu importante conexiuni atât în sud-estul Europei, cât şi la est de graniţa externă a Uniunii. Marea Neagră se învecinează direct cu Uniunea Europeană. Este un câştig geostrategic, dar şi o garanţie suplimentară, pe care o dă România, pentru securizarea spaţiului european. Încă de la intrarea în NATO, România a devenit un furnizor de securitate şi nu un consumator de securitate.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Venim cu o tradiţie politică şi socială importantă de toleranţă şi diversitate, de protecţie a minorităţilor naţionale, de respectare şi de participare a acestora la viaţa politică, socială şi culturală a ţării. Această experienţă ne-a pregătit pentru cultura dialogului şi a parteneriatului, care sunt eminamente parte a solidarităţii în cadrul Uniunii cu 27 de membri.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Nu în ultimul rând, România aduce un suflu nou, revigorant, de susţinere a obiectivelor politice ale agendei europene într-o perioadă în care starea de spirit este relativ sceptică. În prezent, 67% dintre români declară că au încredere în Uniunea Europeană.</p>
      <p sl="ro">În plus, prin faptul că procesul de aderare a fost mai lung şi poate mai dificil, noi reprezentăm exemplul clar că se poate reuşi, în pofida oricăror dificultăţi. Că orice naţiune interesată să promoveze reforme va reuşi dacă persistă şi este consecventă idealurilor sale.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Cultura României este una europeană prin definiţie, prin natură şi prin esenţă, iar valorile europene s-au regăsit mereu în cultura românilor. Ca o recunoaştere a acestui fapt, oraşul Sibiu, alături de Luxemburg Marea Regiune, este acum Capitală Europeană culturală pentru anul 2007. Îmi face plăcere să vă invit să vizitaţi Sibiul şi vă aşteptăm pentru a celebra împreună acest an talentul, imaginaţia, diversitatea noastră şi capacitatea românilor de a trăi împreună cu minorităţile.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Doamnelor şi domnilor,</p>
      <p sl="ro">Ne-am impus ca în anul 2007 să conturăm profilul României de membru al Uniunii Europene, membru responsabil şi eficient, pe deplin cuplat la marile teme de dezbatere ale agendei europene. Din această perspectivă, permiteţi-mi să vă împărtăşesc doar câteva gânduri legate de viziunea noastră privind construcţia europeană din care acum facem parte.</p>
      <p sl="ro">În plan intern european, ne vom alătura efortului de consolidare a uniunii politice, cu instituţii puternice şi eficace, capabile de a promova, în continuare, procesul de integrare europeană.</p>
      <p sl="ro">În opinia noastră, într-o astfel de configuraţie instituţională, Comisia Europeană garantează apărarea interesului comun şi asigură respectarea regulilor convenite împreună.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Parlamentul European acţionează ca principal promotor, la nivel european, al intereselor cetăţeanului, precum şi ca un stimulent pentru consacrarea unei identităţi europene.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Dorim, totodată, o Uniune dotată cu mecanisme democratice sensibile la evoluţiile în plan intern şi internaţional, care să ofere răspunsuri aşteptate cetăţenilor europeni. Am în vedere: asigurarea spaţiului de libertate şi securitate, securitatea energetică, combaterea imigraţiei ilegale.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Un rol important în diminuarea deficitului de imagine al Uniunii Europene în ochii propriilor ei cetăţeni îl au parlamentele naţionale, cel puţin aşa vedem noi rolul Parlamentului României. Contribuţia acestora ar putea să fie axată pe consolidarea dimensiunii de comunicare şi explicare a iniţiativelor şi activităţilor Uniunii Europene. Este firesc ca cetăţenii să fie asociaţi, printr-o informare sistematică, axată în primul rând pe răspunsul la preocupările pe care le au. Din această perspectivă, parlamentele naţionale pot fi un actor important în asocierea cât mai strânsă a cetăţenilor noştri la rezolvarea provocărilor cu care se confruntă Europa, iar cooperarea între Parlamentul European şi parlamentele naţionale este o necesitate, întrucât aceste instituţii asigură, împreună, nucleul legitimităţii şi reprezentativităţii Uniunii Europene.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Stimaţi membri ai Parlamentului European,</p>
      <p sl="ro">Pentru că aderarea noastră a coincis cu preluarea mandatului Preşedinţiei germane, daţi-mi voie ca în încheiere să mă refer doar la trei dintre priorităţile anunţate: Tratatul Constituţional, securitatea rutelor energetice şi politica de vecinătate.</p>
      <p sl="ro">În ceea ce priveşte Tratatul Constituţional, doresc să asigur preşedinţia germană că va avea în România un susţinător al demersului său de revigorare a Tratatului şi de avansare a unei soluţii consensuale. (Aplauze) Avem nevoie de un tratat solid, capabil să consolideze legitimitatea acţiunii politice la nivel comunitar. Credem că deblocarea crizei constituţionale este esenţială pentru a da Europei capacitatea de a decide şi acţiona după definitivarea unui val de extindere fără precedent.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Avansarea Europei presupune ameliorarea legitimităţii democratice, a eficienţei şi transparenţei instituţionale a Uniunii. Doar în acest mod vom putea răspunde aspiraţiilor cetăţenilor noştri.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Am fost printre primii susţinători ai acordării unei atenţii mai mari dosarului energetic, înţelegând aici, alături de relaţiile cu statele producătoare, şi diversificarea, liberalizarea, conlucrarea între actorii politici şi actorii economici, investiţiile în cercetare şi dezvoltare. Soluţia la nivel european continuăm să o vedem printr-o politică energetică comună a Uniunii Europene, menită să sprijine eficienţa energetică, diversificarea resurselor şi a rutelor de transport şi liberalizarea sectorului pe tot lanţul, de la furnizor la utilizator. Ştim că un astfel de proiect nu va fi uşor de implementat. Dificultatea nu îl face, însă, mai puţin necesar.</p>
      <p sl="ro">După cum ştiţi, din punctul nostru de vedere, există o regiune cheie în politica energetică a Uniunii Europene: Marea Neagră. Cred că suntem cu toţii convinşi că zona extinsă a Mării Negre oferă multe dintre răspunsurile posibile la marile întrebări legate de securitatea energetică europeană şi globală.</p>
      <p sl="ro">În Politica Europeană de Vecinătate avem deja un vehicul important pentru propagarea valorilor şi standardelor în zonele răsăritene, de aceea trebuie să acţionăm pentru a-i da mai multă consistenţă. Salutăm şi sprijinim intenţia actualei preşedinţii de a porni pe această cale.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Doamnelor şi domnilor,</p>
      <p sl="ro">Aderarea României la Uniunea Europeană marchează nu doar un nou început, ci un nou stadiu istoric, definit prin depăşirea tarelor trecutului şi orientarea către viitor. România este conştientă că, de acum înainte, acţiunile ei practice şi obiectivele strategice vor beneficia de un instrumentar mai puternic şi mai nuanţat. Suntem hotărâţi să utilizăm acest instrumentar extins cu o deplină responsabilitate. Vom rămâne fideli principiilor şi valorilor fundamentale, ne vom asuma cu luciditate noul profil de stat membru al Uniunii Europene şi vom încerca să fructificăm interesul naţional în cel mai bun spirit de solidaritate comunitară.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Vă mulţumesc.</p>

    <intervention id="3-013" speaker_id="1253" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, the ability to speak openly is not something to be taken for granted. I am sure that you have all heard about the terrible murder, on 19 January, of the Armenian-Turkish journalist Hrant Dink, who had, over recent years, frequently drawn attention to himself with his calls for engagement with the history of the Armenians under Ottoman rule, attracting the hostility of many nationalists and being repeatedly prosecuted by the Turkish justice system on account of what he wrote and said.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I wish, on behalf of this House, to express our outrage at this crime. We acknowledge, and are glad, that the Turkish Government as a whole has expressed similar sentiments and that its determination has already resulted in the arrest of one who has admitted perpetrating the deed.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The alleged murderer – who is only 17 years of age – is evidently motivated by, among other things, nationalist sentiments and complete contempt for the opinions of others.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">According to media reports, Hrant Dink’s funeral was attended by thousands of people, and these included Mr Joost Lagendijk, representing me in his capacity as chairman of the delegation to the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, and Mrs Hélène Flautre, the chairman of our human rights sub-committee.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The overwhelming sympathy of the Turkish people and media give cause for hope that this sad event will prompt the Turkish Government to delay no longer in introducing further reforms in the area of criminal law aimed at protecting the free expression of opinion.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I will now ask you to do as we did when the great Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya was murdered and rise from your seats to honour Hrant Dink in silent remembrance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I have to talk to you about today is one of the most fundamental components of the European Union’s policy on human rights, and the many motions for a resolution tabled by the various groups in your House indicate just how live an issue this is.</p>
      <p sl="de">Taking as its basis the guidelines for the EU's policy in respect of third states and the death penalty as adopted in 1998 by its Council of Ministers, the European Union is campaigning worldwide for the abolition of the death penalty under all circumstances, and the declaration of moratoria has for some years been a consistent feature of that campaign – albeit not as its main objective, but as an intermediate stage on the way to the practice’s abolition once and for all.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union will continue its policy of protection for human rights under German Presidency and will therefore be arguing forcefully for moratoria on the death penalty and for its permanent abolition.</p>
      <p sl="de">That means that we will, on the one hand, continue to pursue the debate on the issue of principle – not only on bilateral contact but also in multilateral fora, the United Nations in particular – whilst also, on the other hand, continuing to be pro-active in approaching those countries that are at a turning point – that is to say, those in which either positive or negative trends are perceptible as regards the death penalty – and to bring influence to bear on them by means, that is, of very definite demarches in many urgent individual cases.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am aware that your House has been a constant advocate for this policy and am glad to be able to say that we have already, together, achieved a great deal. The fact that, in something like two-thirds of the world’s countries, the death penalty has been legally abolished or is in practice a dead letter is attributable to the sustained efforts of all active campaigners against the practice, and I am happy to be able to stress that active involvement in the Council Europe has played its part. Thirty-three states have now ratified the 13th additional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, the effect of which is to outlaw capital punishment even in time of war.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to mention, however, that there are still too many states – numbering 66 – that continue to carry out executions, along with some regrettably retrograde trends when it comes to the observance of moratoria. This is why it is so important that we should be unstinting in our efforts and should aim our arguments for the abolition of the death penalty at international fora and elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union submitted resolutions to this end to the Human Rights Commission from 1999 until the Commission’s dissolution in 2005, and, over that period, it proved possible to secure stable majorities in favour of them. Since that body was dissolved, we have had to seek new ways of moving the debate on the abolition of capital punishment forward, although it has to be said that, since there are no easy answers to this, our actions have to be very well thought-out if – and this is a priority – we are to avoid being obliged to retreat from positions already secured.</p>
      <p sl="de">On this line there has, up to now, been firm agreement in the European Union, but we have, up to now, refrained from putting a resolution to this effect to the UN General Assembly in view of the continued high risk of it not being supported.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead, on 19 December, at the European Union’s initiative, and for the first time ever, a unilateral declaration against the death penalty was put to the General Assembly, and it is important to note that it was supported by 85 states from all parts of the globe. Encouraging though this result is, it does also confirm that the chances of a resolution from the EU meeting with success in the General Assembly cannot as yet be seen as 100% certain.</p>
      <p sl="de">What, then, is to happen next? It is clear to all partners in the European Union that we want to continue to actively promote the cause of the campaign against capital punishment, at the United Nations and elsewhere, but I would, at the same time, like to make it clear that this is still a very difficult area, and so any campaign against the death penalty will only meet with success if the European Union’s actions are step by step and well thought-out.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our watchword should continue to be that the possibility of a new EU initiative’s failure should be excluded as far as possible, for a defeat for the European Union would be a victory for the advocates of the death penalty and hence a reversal in the fight against this inhumane mode of punishment, something that we do not want and must not allow to happen. I believe that we will also find supporters. It is for that reason that some of the principal players among the non-governmental organisations, Amnesty International being one of them, advise against precipitate action and are reminding us that insisting again on this subject being debated in the General Assembly of the United Nations could turn out to be counter-productive for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Agreement was therefore reached at the General Affairs Council of 22 January that we would first devise a well thought-out approach that would progressively enable us to present our concerns more effectively to the United Nations. The ambassadors in New York and Geneva were therefore mandated to do everything possible, and without delay, to bring forward a debate at United Nations level.</p>
      <p sl="de">It will also be necessary to draw on the experience and current estimates of the relevant NGOs as to what further steps to take in combating the death penalty at UN level.</p>
      <p sl="de">This will then enable the Presidency of the Council to make proposals in February to the EU partners as to further action. This I regard as a first and important step, and I hope that we will find others willing to support us in this course of action.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I also welcome this opportunity to exchange views on the issue of the death penalty and on the means to promote the universal abolition of this odious practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the abolition of the death penalty worldwide represents a key objective of the external human rights policy of the European Union, and I am personally committed to seeing the EU continue to play a lead role, as we have just heard, in this global effort. Since all of us here agree on the ultimate goal of our action in this field, namely universal abolition, I wish to provide some thoughts on this process of abolition and on the means to reach our common goal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, let us not forget that the experience of abolition on the European continent has been a slow, often tortuous and protracted process, which has been, for most of our Member States, driven by a combination of strong political leadership and a mature level of development of human rights protection, the rule of law and democratic institutions. With some notable exceptions, including the United States of America and Japan, the global map of abolitionist countries also closely follows that of democratic pluralism. Visionary leadership and political courage are key to abolishing the death penalty. These efforts often need to be bolstered by a dynamic and open nationwide debate to ensure that the ultimate political decision to abolish the death penalty in a country is also a permanent one.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Philippines, and to some extent Kyrgyzstan, the recent abolition of the death penalty was precisely the result both of remarkable courage on the part of the political leadership and a profound nationwide debate, which witnessed wide participation from civil society actors – which has been mentioned – and institutions. In the United States of America, there are also some encouraging trends in some states, like New Jersey and Maryland.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, it is not excluded that a country falls back into the practice of death penalty as we, unfortunately, have witnessed in Bahrain and need to fear in Peru. And in many other countries our appeals to abolish the death penalty have fallen on deaf ears until now.</p>
      <p sl="en">The execution of Saddam Hussein and his henchmen has now sparked a renewed debate on the death penalty. The horrific videos of his undignified end upset even some supporters of the death penalty. But let us not forget that every year thousands are executed, most of whom are certainly somewhat better people than Saddam and many are even innocent. Their deaths should outrage us even more!</p>
      <p sl="en">While evidently the abolition of the death penalty in any country is, to quote Robert Badinter, ‘a victory of humanity over itself’, one must remain realistic as to the influence of external actors, such as the European Union, in this process, because this process remains first and foremost a domestic one.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not to say that the European Union will sit on the fence. On the contrary, the EU has been and will remain at the very forefront of international efforts, notably at the United Nations, as was mentioned, to fight the death penalty. Last December, the EU presented a Declaration on the Death Penalty at the UN General Assembly, which received the support of a record 85 states. In line with our guidelines on the death penalty, the European Union has carried out numerous demarches on individual death penalty cases, including in countries such as the United States of America, Iran and Indonesia, and will continue to do so in the future. The EU is also the leading source of funding for abolitionist projects run by civil society, and over the past ten years, we have spent over EUR 15 million supporting such projects around the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament and civil society actors have traditionally played a crucial role in both supporting the abolitionist efforts of the European Union and in stimulating the debate on the means to enhance our policy. It is of prime importance to listen carefully to those voices when discussing possible initiatives in various international forums, as the Council is currently doing.</p>
      <p sl="en">This has certainly been illustrated most recently by the Italian proposal for a universal moratorium on the death penalty at the UN General Assembly. Without prejudging the final outcome of this process of reflection, I wish to share three observations made by abolitionist actors on the moratorium which have struck me as relevant for feeding today’s discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">While representing a key element in the EU’s strategy towards universal abolition, leading NGOs have stressed that a moratorium is not a panacea. They claim it is by essence fragile, reversible and must be followed by abolition in law. They refer to the example of Kyrgyzstan, where the regularly extended moratorium on executions has not prevented the number of prisoners on death row from increasing. I think we need moratoria that hold firm.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, some NGOs underline the fact that the moratorium is one abolitionist tool among others. I agree that, in this context, the promotion of the Second Optional Protocol providing for abolition, the support for legal counselling for death row convicts and other efforts have to be included in our toolbox. Hence, we should avoid the current discussion on the moratorium to eclipse the fact that abolition is a multi-faceted process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, when bringing the issue back to the UN General Assembly, we need to be cautious as to the possible outcome. It is paramount to secure a positive result. We need to be alive, however, to the risk of an ambiguous or even a counterproductive outcome – and the Council Presidency has alluded to it – given international divisions on this subject. Failing in such an effort could have negative consequences which will be difficult to repair. Therefore, we need to assess the situation and possible scenarios thoroughly before moving.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I wish to underline the importance of maintaining a common EU approach towards the universal abolition of the death penalty. The Commission will spare no efforts to work with the Presidency and Parliament to this end.</p>

      <p sl="es">I believe that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s words clearly indicate the model of Europe we want to see: a Europe of values.</p>
      <p sl="es">If I had briefly to paint a picture illustrating what the European dream has been over the years, I would have no hesitation in stating at this sitting, Madam President, that the idea of Europe represents a permanent call for peace, understanding, harmony and solidarity; and that, in addition to a legitimate vision of Europe, such as the Europe of financial perspectives, the Europe of the tangible, the Europe of net balance and net contributor, I believe that there is a higher vision of Europe, which is the Europe of values.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is precisely within this context and in accordance with this vision of a Europe of values that this initiative is seeking a universal moratorium on the application of the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="es">It must be of a universal nature, because fundamental rights, and the right to life in particular, must not be preached for one region, one country or one continent, but they must clearly be of a universal global nature.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must therefore celebrate the fact that, in 2005 and 2006, a whole series of countries, such as Liberia, Mexico, the Philippines and Moldova, have decided formally to abolish the death penalty. I believe that we must continue to work tirelessly to ensure that the seventy countries that still apply the death penalty join the 128 countries that no longer apply it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like to say that, if the European Union is to preserve that moral and ethical leadership that it has been exercising, it is essential that we fight to ensure that democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights, and in particular the right to life, prevail in all regions of the world, this year and over the years to come.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow and this evening's debate situate the European Parliament in that international movement that is appealing to the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution for a universal moratorium, which is a first step towards the general abolition of the death penalty from the statute books of every country.</p>
      <p sl="it">As has been said, we would like the Council of Ministers to actively commit itself to achieving this objective; the Presidency is very committed, and we hope that this point remains one of the priorities of its term of office. The same commitment has been made by the Council of Europe and the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="it">From what she has said, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner does not actually seem to me to be very convinced of the fact that, as a first step, we need to go through a moratorium. I, on the other hand, would emphasise this point, and I would ask Mrs Ferrero-Waldner: Would not going through a moratorium bring abolition any closer? I do not think so: this could therefore be a first step, not least because the European Union, in its international relations, could bring to bear the extensive relations it enjoys in the context of the neighbourhood policy, the association agreements and the strategic partnership, and, in my opinion, Europe’s political parties could also do their best within international forums to ensure that their organisations put pressure on the participating countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the aim is to banish the death penalty from the statute books of every State, an act that would, among other things, help to ensure that the United Nations enjoys a reputation for being an institution that safeguards universally recognised rights.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my speech to a statement and a note issued this morning by the German Presidency. Word for word, the note reads: ‘the German Presidency calls on the governments concerned to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty with immediate effect’. I am reading the note from the German Presidency. This is precisely our position.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think I am right in saying that Mr Barroso also issued a statement fully supporting the Italian initiative, the aim of which is to have a proposal for a moratorium drafted within the current UN General Assembly. This proposal will undoubtedly win through: as far back as 1999 there was an absolute majority in favour of a resolution, which was not tabled.</p>
      <p sl="it">Faced with the enthusiasm that we are seeing throughout the world right now for our initiative – that of the European Parliament, of the chairmen of our groups, the initiative that was pre-announced very specifically in Strasbourg by Mr Watson and other Members – I therefore do not understand – or, rather, I understand only too well – how it is possible to stall, at a time when France is taking the incredible step of highlighting the abolition of the death penalty with a change to its Constitution; when Rwanda is also doing so; and when, just yesterday, Kyrgyzstan did so. Statements are coming in from everywhere – from Syria, from Lebanon – in support of our position. I believe that, in the future, the European Parliament, like the Council of Europe before it, will lead this movement.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude my speech, Madam President, I should like to point out that, 60 years ago, there was a Rome-Berlin axis. I was 10 years old, and I remember it well. It happens today that, with the coming-together of the German Presidency, the Italian initiative and the very recent French initiatives, a new situation is emerging: I believe that it is historically important that in a certain way Berlin and Rome are now taking a definite stand, with no hypocrisy or fear of winning, because there are too many people here who are scared of winning, not losing.</p>

    <intervention id="3-034" speaker_id="4385" name="Hélène Flautre" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, last week, during the debate on the Benghazi case, we stated our total opposition to the death penalty under any circumstances. It is now important to reaffirm this principle, which is enshrined in Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Union has always advocated the abolition of the death penalty, and has even gone so far as to make it a condition of accession and a key principle of its foreign policy. Moreover, guidelines were adopted in 1998, and civil society projects are regularly funded under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. This effort has been rewarded: the number of executions in the United States has gone down, and in countries like Mexico, Liberia, the Philippines and Moldova, the death penalty has been abolished.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The same is not true everywhere, however. Some US States have extended the scope of the death penalty to other crimes apart from murder; in Singapore, a person is still automatically sentenced to death for carrying 15 grams of heroin, and China still executes more people than any other country. In addition, there are countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, which have reinstated the death penalty. Peru almost did likewise in the name of combating terrorism, but fortunately this did not happen.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Against this backdrop and ahead of the developing world congress [against the death penalty], the EU must be extra vigilant. The international groundswell of opinion in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty should be addressed within the framework of a pro-abolition policy. Ensuring the ratification of the second protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aimed at abolishing the death penalty should therefore be one of the Union’s priorities. It is crucial that France, Latvia and Poland, which have yet to ratify the protocol, do so at the earliest opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, ‘No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed. No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.’ This is what is laid down by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and this is what makes me – indeed, I believe, makes us – proud to be part of the European Union. It is the upholding of human dignity; it is realising that no one can rule another person's life and that there should be no revenge, only justice. This should be true for all courts, including military ones.</p>
      <p sl="it">Too many countries still have the death penalty, and they include not only large countries such as China, but also the most important military and democratic power – the United States – which has still not been able to leave its Wild West culture behind.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope that the Congress against the Death Penalty being held in Paris, in which we, as Parliament, will take part, will be a further step on from the moratorium on the way to abolishing the death penalty and eradicating poverty around the world. I also hope that the people who take to the streets of Paris will be a warning to all those who, even in Europe, are thinking of bringing back the death penalty. In any event, it is these street protests that will lead to the UN’s approving the moratorium in full.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, countries where capital punishment still exists do not deserve to be part of the civilised world, no matter whether these countries are Islamic, where adulterous women are stoned, the America of Bush, India, the world’s largest democracy, or Communist China. I will therefore not hesitate to back the plea for a worldwide moratorium. One judicial error, the life of one innocent, is enough to write capital punishment off as barbaric. Allow me, though, to add two observations.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Respect for life should not stop a constitutional state from giving serious offenders effective and irreducible penalties of 30 years, or lifelong imprisonment for that matter. This condition must, and indeed can, underpin the public’s consensus against the death penalty. This consensus will not come about unless our citizens, who are increasingly faced with the most brutal forms of crime, add their voice to the worldwide abolition of capital punishment.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, some opponents of capital punishment should display a certain degree of consistency. For example, on a recent friendly visit to China, which is a single-party state, the French Socialist Presidential candidate sang the praises of the efficiency of the Chinese justice system. This efficiency involves the families of the thousands of people who have been sentenced to death every year being presented with the bill for the bullets that killed the victims, but Ségolène Royal did not spare a thought for them. After all, they do not bring in the contracts, because the commercial interests of major enterprises in China must be protected, and that is when some European opponents of capital punishment go all quiet all of a sudden. If Europe wants to retain its credibility, it should exert pressure on countries such as China, whatever the political or commercial cost.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party. The execution of Saddam Hussein has put the spotlight back on the debate on the death penalty, a debate that is absolutely timely, although it must not be used for tactical purposes and, above all, it must not be a subject that is raised on and off. This is first and foremost a battle of civilisation and progress.</p>
      <p sl="it">We do not just have here an essential guarantee for individuals, a request for the inviolability of individuals to be further strengthened; we are also faced with an historic and universal need, a global milestone and focal point for 21st-century civilisation.</p>
      <p sl="it">It has been said, and I agree, that, after the abolition of slavery in previous centuries and the ban on torture, the right not to be killed following a court ruling should be another common denominator, a new and inalienable dimension of humankind that makes a community of us all. Today, this Parliament is sending out the first clear message along these lines.</p>

    <intervention id="3-038" speaker_id="28118" name="Simon Coveney" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to support the strong calls from this Parliament today – and the campaign outside Parliament – for a worldwide moratorium on executions to be established unconditionally through a resolution of the UN General Assembly.</p>
      <p sl="en">For many years, the EU has maintained as a main pillar of foreign affairs and human rights policy the objective of ending the use of the death penalty globally. We have had some success, particularly as part of our neighbourhood strategy. Today’s initiative is an ambitious attempt to raise the profile of the debate on the death penalty to a UN level and to have an impact on the 66 countries that have already been referred to that still use the death penalty. It is important to note that working towards achieving a moratorium on the death penalty should always be linked to achieving an eventual abolition through legislation, as previous speakers have pointed out.</p>
      <p sl="en">The pragmatic first step is a call for a moratorium, but we must always look at ways to promote abolition where possible. Looking at what we can do here in the EU from a policy perspective, I would urge the Council to review and update the guidelines on the death penalty, which date back to 1998, so that new elements and strategies that have developed since then can be taken into consideration. The Third World Congress on the Death Penalty, which is to be held soon in Paris, may be a good opportunity to do just that.</p>
      <p sl="en">To date, the EU’s proactive policy on the death penalty has produced some positive results. For example, recently, the success of strong EU representations in Peru to recent proposals to extend the death penalty to that country, in violation of the Peruvian Constitution and the American Convention on Human Rights, needs to be acknowledged and welcomed. The EU stance did have an impact on the Peruvian Congress in its rejection of draft legislation. So the EU has shown that it can be a key influence on national policy towards the death penalty, and we should not be afraid to use that influence.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, yesterday, Robert Wilson, of 24 years of age, was sentenced to death by a jury in New York. This is the first death sentence to be handed down in that State for 50 years.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is another tragic example of the current threat to the universal values that we are all defending here today, despite the very significant progress that has been made in countries such as Liberia, Mexico, the Philippines and Moldova.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must, however, continue to fight to ensure that others, such as China, with around two thousand official executions per year – eight thousand, according to unofficial data – join the global moratorium and suspend their executions.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must support Iranian civil society, which is rising up against the death penalty. Iran has one of the highest numbers of executions: 177 in 2006. Furthermore, it has broken the moratorium on stonings and it currently has six women sentenced to death by stoning.</p>
      <p sl="es">Above all, we appeal to the United States, a country whose decisions have an immense impact on global politics, to support the Italian initiative to establish a universal moratorium on the death penalty which will be approved – with this Parliament's support, I hope – in the United Nations General Assembly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, worldwide, 20 000 people are on death row waiting to be killed by their own governments. Sadly, over 3000 of these are in the United States. I do not single the US out because it is the worst – that is China, with 80% of executions – but because we have hope of the Americans. The great prize would be for a change of mind in the United States and the signs are there. The number of executions in the states of the US has dropped dramatically since 1999: there were 277 in that year, and 128 in 2005. Twelve states have now abolished the death penalty, not including Texas, which clocks up an unimpressive one-third of the 1100 executions in the US in the last 30 years.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the Commission and the Presidency need to be more proactive and less hesitant in seeking a moratorium and abolition worldwide through a UN General Assembly resolution. As in some other areas of human rights policy, like extraordinary rendition and war-on-terror abuses, the EU is not always as effective in putting its principles into practice as Parliament would wish.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, as we speak, all the Member States of the Union have ratified the sixth protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the abolition of the death penalty. We also nourish the hope that it will be abolished both by law and in practice in all the countries of the world – be it in times of peace or in times of war – with the result that there will be an improvement in respect for human rights and human dignity will be reinforced, as the Council and the Commission emphasised today.</p>
      <p sl="el">Allow me, however, to ask you if you were concerned about the human rights and dignity of the dictator Saddam Hussein and his fellow detainees, who became food for the entire world's voyeurs. Is this the role of the European Union as a global stability factor?</p>
      <p sl="el">What can you say about the statements by the British foreign secretary, Mrs Becket, who emphasised that Hussein simply got what he deserved and that justice was done?</p>
      <p sl="el">What are European citizens supposed to believe when they read the condemnatory statements by the Council, on the one hand, and hear the derisory comments by the ministers in it, on the other? We need to get our act together, because we are ultimately just fooling ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I must say that the arrogance of this EU knows no bounds. Not satisfied with dictating to Member States that they must not avail of the ultimate deterrent – the death penalty – it now wishes to dictate to the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Awful as the fate of the Bulgarian nurses in Libya is, and while this House should be vigorous in protesting against their situation, it does not justify us demanding a global ban on the death penalty. Wrongful imprisonment is intolerable, but it does not lead rational people to oppose all imprisonment. No, I say that if there is a fair, transparent, human rights compliant judicial system, with a reliable appeal process, then a sovereign nation state is perfectly entitled to deploy the death penalty for capital crimes, if that is the democratically expressed wish of its people. They, not we, have the right to choose what is right for them.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, I am delighted to take the floor because, among other things, I come from Tuscany where, for the first time in history, on 30 November 1786, capital punishment was abolished. I am also moved to point out that, in 1987, I, together with Amnesty International and the Italian Movement for Life, succeeded in having the death penalty of Paula Cooper, a 16-year-old black girl, commuted in the United States. She later came to thank me.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am also pleased to point out that, as an Italian Member, I proposed and achieved the legal abolition of the death penalty in the military code of war, which is the reason for my in-depth thoughts on the matter. I take an optimistic view of human history which, in spite of everything, is a struggle for goodness, a struggle that is spurred on by an ever more obvious and decisive value: the dignity of each and every human being. So great is this dignity that it cannot be graded, and thus it determines the equal status of everybody, no matter what kind of life they lead. Dignity is also indestructible: not even the hands of a criminal can wipe away the traces of dignity from the face of the very man who has committed the crime.</p>
      <p sl="it">No one can take away a person’s life and dignity, not even individual States. That is the real reason why the death penalty must be abolished. All the other practical reasons, of which I am only too aware, may meet with objections, but not this one. A Europe that seeks to base its identity not only on competition and the market, but also on dignity and human rights, cannot keep quiet.</p>
      <p sl="it">Right now, I do not want to talk about inconsistencies. The time will come when human dignity and the associated right to life extend their persuasive powers to other areas of human life where they are now sadly being overshadowed, even within our Union: the most symbolic areas of poverty and human alienation, which are to be born and to die.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, rejecting the death penalty is not a question of moral superiority, nor of lecturing anybody, nor of collective pomposity on the part of Europe. It is consistent with a basic belief in human dignity, many years' experience of the utter pointlessness of capital punishment and fear of the serious and perfectly well-documented risk of its being applied unjustly, even if in only one specific case (and there have been many of them, regrettably).</p>
      <p sl="es">Europe must apply itself to what is possible, without forgetting the ultimate objective. What is possible is to demand a moratorium courageously, throughout the world, beginning with our closest partners, without forgetting – I would insist – the ultimate objective, which would be the global abolition of the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must protest against the death penalty, but that must include the death penalty on Saddam Hussein as well as the death penalty on the person sentenced in the United States, following a trial with practically no defence, for a crime he committed when he was under-age.</p>
      <p sl="es">Those death sentences, Commissioner, must be condemned just as vigorously as the death sentence on Saddam Hussein; we must not have double standards, because if what we are advocating is to fight the death penalty, those more or less anonymous prisoners who have had practically no right to defence deserve our support even more than a criminal such as Saddam Hussein.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the political, religious and legal debate on whether or not to apply the death penalty has been under way for decades and will continue into the future. The famous writer Albert Camus spoke out against it in his time, and Robert Badinter, a former French Justice Minister, led a legal battle at European level for many years. As a rule, strong ethical arguments are adduced in heated debates of this nature, and references are made to the inalienable right to life. Horrifying statistics about the number of sentences carried out in countries such as China or India are also quoted. The largest democracy in the world, the United States, is placed in the dock. Catholics opposed to the death penalty and those in favour of it contrive to base entirely contradictory arguments on the same sources, namely the Gospels, the Catechism and Papal encyclicals. It is very difficult to justify to the families and loved ones of people, often children, who have been cruelly murdered that the death penalty should not be applied to those responsible for the crimes. At such times, people’s emotions incline them to desire a very different outcome.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I hail from a country that suffered under the iron rule of Hitler’s totalitarian Nazi regime and later under Soviet Communism. I would like to point out that use of the death penalty is a key feature of each and every dictatorship. When I look back at events in my country, Poland, during the period to which I previously referred, I see how whole legions of Poland’s finest sons and daughters were murdered, following sentences handed down by Communist kangaroo courts. Having considered both sides of the argument concerning the death penalty, I am bound to say that its abolition is essential in order to curb the madness of fanatics prepared to use the legal system to eliminate their opponents. The most the fellow citizens of these murdered heroes can do years later, once freedom has been restored, is to put up monuments in their honour.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is what I have learnt from the history of my parents’ and grandparents’ generations and also of my own. Only one of the 1 500 death sentences carried out in Poland during the Stalinist period involved a common criminal. The price of restricting the actions of dictators of various political hues may well be that, instead of being guillotined, offenders who deserve this ultimate punishment will have to spend the rest of their lives in prison, without the opportunity of parole. If that is the case, I believe it is a price worth paying, however painful it may be to do so.</p>

      <p sl="lt">‘The death penalty is the most offensive method of killing, because it is done with the approval of the community.’ These words of George Bernard Shaw, pronounced almost a century ago, are being endorsed by an ever-increasing number of people and a majority of countries. Unfortunately, the natural human right to life is still ignored by 68 countries. The death penalty is most often implemented not only in Asia, but also in the United States. The execution of Saddam Hussein, I would say, has become a display of impotence. We are now presented with an exceptional opportunity to work hand in hand with the Italian Government to seek abolition of the death penalty in every country of the world. Opposition to the death penalty is one of the values that unites EU countries; therefore, the Union’s voice carries weight. The United Nations General Assembly will, I hope, support the proposed moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty, and its abolition should be the ultimate goal. At the same time, it is essential to condemn the statements of some official representatives of the new EU countries about the possibility of legitimation of the death penalty. World public opinion needs to be channelled in the European direction.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Article 1 of Additional Protocol No VI to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms reads: ‘The death penalty shall be abolished. No one shall be condemned to such a penalty or executed’. This protocol was laid down back in 1983, and underpins the thinking and actions of the Member States of the Union. It is also the stance adopted by most Members of the Council of Europe. Essentially, these are European standards for the protection of human rights. The question as to whether the abolition of the death penalty is only relevant to Europe is a rhetorical one. Clearly, the answer is no. Every individual has but one life and that life deserves to be protected. We must therefore support a UN moratorium on the death penalty. We are aware that the death penalty is rooted in a culture of revenge and retribution from which mankind needs to break free. It is very easy to delete the death penalty from criminal codes. All that is required is the legislators’ will to do so. It will be much more difficult for us to detach ourselves from it at an emotional level, to recognise it as an unethical penalty and banish it forever from human consciousness. However, we must be aware that if we fail to do so, we shall have to go on asking ourselves whether, in the 21st century, man can continue to kill his fellow man in the name of the law.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the European Union has consistently advocated a ban on the application of the death penalty since 1998. In October 2003, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the European institutions and Member States of the Union to put pressure on the UN General Assembly to declare a moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty. The European institutions and Member States of the Union must ensure that the issue of the death penalty is dealt with again at the current UN General Assembly. Acting on behalf of the European Union, the Member States must aim at tabling a draft resolution on a general moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty, with a view to its abolition. They should garner maximum support for this resolution amongst the Member States of the UN. The European institutions and Member States of the Union should do all in their power to secure, as soon as possible, a favourable outcome in a vote at the current UN General Assembly.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the fact that broad agreement between the political party has prevailed in today's debate confirms that the European Parliament can act as the guarantor of European democratic civilisation and for the protection of human rights, human dignity and the right to life.</p>
      <p sl="el">It has been proven that the death penalty not only does not prevent crime, but also feeds hatred and violence. The civilised world cannot respond to the barbarity of a criminal act with the barbarity of death.</p>

All the Member States of the European Union should certainly ratify the voluntary UN protocol, the 13th protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. I would say, however, that the Member States should incorporate a provision abolishing the death penalty in their internal constitutional order.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, I should like to say that we should not overlook the fact that today in European society there is a large percentage of citizens who are still in favour of the death penalty and, as such, we must also work in this direction, together with the European Commission, with programmes working through democratic consultation to convince European society.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, what has become apparent from this debate is how great a consensus exists as regards what is one of the most fundamental objectives of the European Union's policy on human rights. Frequent reference was made in it to the Italian initiative, about which there must be no misunderstanding. When talking about this initiative, we are not talking about the ‘whether’ of it, or about what it is intended to achieve, but rather about the ‘how’, ‘where’, and, of course, the ‘when’ of it, in other words about the procedure rather than the substance.</p>
      <p sl="de">You, Commissioner, made that very clear earlier on. At the General Assembly on 19 December last year, a unilateral declaration was read out, and 85 states endorsed it; encouraging though that is, we must also, on the other hand, consider and bear in mind the question of whether our objective is capable of being achieved at all in view of the fact that, to date, this declaration has gained the support of only 21 out of 47 members of the new Human Rights Council in Geneva. To put it bluntly, we do not yet have a majority for it.</p>
      <p sl="de">The situation in the United Nations’ third committee is similar. As I said in my statement earlier, there are now various fronts on which we have to take the initiative. The General Affairs and Foreign Relations Council, too, has come up with a strategy for achieving the goal to which all of you, in your interventions, have referred, and, although we do not at present know when we will be able to implement it, I can assure you that we will support you in your efforts; that is something on which we, the Commission and the Presidency are agreed, for we too are endeavouring to do away with capital punishment for ever.</p>

I think there is widespread consensus in this House and between all the EU institutions on the substance of today’s debate and where we want to go, but sometimes we have to see what the next tactical step is.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to clarify that the Commission is certainly favourable to the introduction of a moratorium as an important intermediate step towards the complete abolition of the death penalty. We of course support the Italian initiative and Parliament’s motion for a resolution, but we have to see – and this is at stake – the tactical nature. How can we ensure that the planned UN General Assembly initiative will be successful? We need to ensure very good preparation. We have to reach out to all the UN members, and we need pertinent timing for the launch of the initiative of such a worldwide moratorium.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also quite active not only at UN level, but also at bilateral level; we try to do that be it in China or Peru. I have, for instance, written to the Peruvian President to express our deep concerns, and hopefully there is still a chance to block it.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-055" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Stavros Dimas" is_mep="False" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="el">Μember of the Commission. Madam President, may I start by congratulating you on your election to the office of vice-president; I am certain that you will meet all the demands and expectations of the honourable Members who supported you with their vote.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr President, never before has climate change been so prominent on the political agenda. The message from science is clear: climate change is happening. Citizens expect European Union leadership on this issue. The standard review and the Commission’s communication on post-2012 make the economic case for action. The risks of climate change far outweigh the costs of doing something about it. Following several natural events, notably the warm winter we are experiencing this year, there is a lively public debate about the threat of climate change. The European Union must use this political momentum to act. Now is the time for decisions on how to put Europe and the world on the path to a more energy-secure, low-carbon future.</p>
      <p sl="el">The urgency and scale of the climate change challenge requires Europe to further reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and convince its partners around the globe to do likewise. The European Union has the objective of limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The climate change and energy package that the Commission put on the table on 10 January provides a blueprint for a European Union strategy to meet this objective. It sketches the basic elements of a global climate agreement post-2012 and gives a clear signal on the necessary level of ambition. This will encourage the start of negotiation on a post-2012 deal. The strength of this fully integrated package is that it demonstrates that further reducing the European Union’s greenhouse gas emissions goes hand in hand with strengthening our competitiveness and the security of our energy supply. The credibility of the package is further underlined by the combination of concrete policy proposals to be adopted in 2007 or later.</p>
      <p sl="el">We had the approval of our targets, which are very important. I can just remind you that about a year ago, we did not even talk about targets. We did not even think about unilateral commitments. About 15 months ago, the European Council had used the language ‘explore’ when giving the Commission the mandate: the mandate was to explore reduction pathways of 15 to 30% with other developed countries. Now we have a target to negotiate and we are asking the European Council to give us the mandate to negotiate a 30% target with other developed countries. On top of that we have a unilateral commitment, irrespective of the agreement and until such an agreement is reached, to reduce by 20%, which will enable us to achieve the other targets which we have set regarding energy efficiency, carbon dioxide emissions and energy security.</p>
      <p sl="el">Other specific measures are also needed in order to achieve these targets. As regards the decisions that we are taking regarding the national allocation plans, I should like to point out that if we had accepted the proposed national allocation plans, the emissions trading system – which is the most important instrument to fight climate change – would have collapsed by now.</p>
      <p sl="el">We also have reductions from specific sectors: aviation has been included in the European Union emissions trading scheme and will contribute its fair share in reducing emissions; cars should also make a fair contribution towards reducing the emissions which are increasing; the transport sector, as you know, is increasing carbon dioxide emissions in the European Union tremendously, so it has to make reductions too. The automobile industry should make the vehicle technology improvements which are needed in order to deliver on what the European Council told me to go for last June: 120g per kilometre by 2012.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="el">Today I am very glad to announce to you that we have adopted the fuel quality directive. This is the way to upgrade fuel requirements so they will be cleaner, emit less carbon dioxide and be better for the environment, better for health, better for fighting climate change. By 2020 we are going to save 500 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. So, today’s decision was very important and is independent of the car proposal, which we have for next week, as the President announced today.</p>
      <p sl="el">There is a series of other measures which are needed, otherwise it is just a lot of talk. If we make declarations that we are going to cut reductions by 2020 or by 2050, and then come to the particular measures which are needed in order to achieve this, and everybody says, ‘we are not responsible; we are a special case; the others should make the reductions’, we shall never achieve these targets. We need to be determined to fight climate change. In order to do this it is not only the Commission, it is not only the Council – and I should like to thank you very much for all the support you have given us so far – it is also the national authorities, not only the ministers, the governments, but all the authorities which are responsible for dealing with climate change cases.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Commission proposes that developed countries – including the European Union – on average take on a 30% emission reduction target by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. In addition, the Commission has put forward a number of options for engaging developing countries with the aim of limiting the growth of their emissions and eventually reduce their emissions after 2020. The new targets for developed countries and tools to engage developing countries should form part of a new agreement to follow up from the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period in 2013.</p>
      <p sl="el">Obtaining such a new agreement will not be easy and will require firm European Union leadership. The Commission has proposed that the European Union demonstrate this leadership through a clear, independent commitment to achieve at least 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 compared to 1990 levels, as I said previously. This independent commitment will help us break the deadlock in international climate negotiations. It underpins our strong determination to obtain an international agreement that will enable a 30% reduction to be made by developed countries and provide a strong message to our partners. It is feasible, it is affordable and it is profitable to take ambitious action. Now is the time to move from words to action. Independent unilateral commitment is also essential to meet our competitiveness and energy efficiency and energy security objectives. It ensures continuity of the carbon market and provides incentives to make investments in low-carbon technology for beyond 2012.</p>
      <p sl="el">Under European Union leadership, discussions in the United Nations framework are now increasingly shifting to issues of importance for an agreement on action post-2012. The Nairobi Climate Conference in November, whilst not making major headline-grabbing decisions, was in fact a step forward in terms of preparing the ground for a future agreement. For example, Nairobi saw agreement among parties to the Kyoto Protocol on a comprehensive work plan to be completed by 2008 or 2009 on further commitments of industrialised countries after 2012. There was a long sought-after agreement on conducting a comprehensive review of the Kyoto Protocol in 2008 and a series of important decisions on clean development mechanisms and adaptation. These will support developing countries in adapting to climate change and encourage more clean technology projects in Africa and other poorer regions.</p>
      <p sl="el">Still, there is a large gap between talk and commitment to action. If we want an agreement within the next two to three years, the international community needs to show much more political will. Negotiations and commitments for developed countries and other contributions from developing countries need a kick start. This is precisely what the proposed 30% target and the 20% independent commitment is intended to do.</p>
      <p sl="el">I expect the Spring Council to send a strong signal on the need for determined action on climate change and the crucial link between energy policy and climate change – climate policy. I also expect the European Council to support the targets that I have just outlined to you.</p>
      <p sl="el">I hope a similar message of support for the approach proposed by the Commission will be given by the European Parliament. We need this support to strengthen political momentum behind efforts to meet the two-degree objective, and we need the European Union to practice what it preaches in order to persuade other countries to do so too – among them the United States, which is the number one emitter in the world and which provides the argument behind which fast developing countries like China, India and other emerging economies in south-east Asia and South America can hide and say, ‘if the United States, which is number one emitter, is not moving, then why should we move?’. So in this way we shall show that we practice what we preach and we shall persuade them to follow in a global agreement, because climate change is a global threat and needs a global response.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner Dimas, honourable Members, thank you very much for giving the new Presidency the opportunity to make a few comments on the subject of climate change.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to start by saying that we in the Council, in preparing the latest climate change conference, have arrived at common positions with the Commission and your House as regards the essential issues, strategies and responses to this global challenge. I believe that the only way we will have a chance of success over the coming years in negotiations that are currently proving difficult is if the European Union continues to speak with one voice and seeks to maintain its leadership role in the international negotiations on climate change. I am sure that the success of the past few years is accounted for by the European Union’s acceptance of this leadership role. Commissioner Dimas has just – and rightly – pointed out that the European Union, as well as having to set important goals for climate policy, does indeed face the question as to the extent to which it is prepared to give practical shape to these goals in the form of initiatives of its own and political practice at EU level and in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Humanity faces two challenges, and they are both truly great ones. The first great challenge to the human race is the question as to how the world – and its growing population – are to be provided with sufficient energy. Today, this planet of ours is home to 6.5 billion people, and there will, at some point, be over 9 billion of them. Today, 1.4 billion people live in industrialised regions, and the population of the industrialised nations on this planet will, in a few years and decades, reach 4 billion.</p>
      <p sl="de">If, over the next fifty years, we want to consume energy and raw materials in the same way as we have done over the last half-century, we would need two planets in order to supply the human race with enough of these resources. The first question, then, that we have to answer if we want to make headway in the international negotiations on climate protection, is just how we can manage to secure the supply of energy, not only for ourselves, but also for the developing and emerging countries that are striving for economic growth in order to improve the conditions under which their people live.</p>
      <p sl="de">If Europeans, and the other industrialised nations, do not manage to offer these countries technological answers as to how they can give their people economic growth, social security and prosperity without at the same time ruining the climate, then these countries will not join us in the search for ways of dealing with climate change.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first challenge, then, is to answer the question that is always the first to be asked of us by the developing countries at international negotiations on climate, and it is this: ‘How, then, do we supply the people – something like two billion of them – who, at present, have no access to electricity, who live in the direst poverty, and who need energy in order to improve the conditions under which they live?’ How, then, do we organise the supply of energy to this segment of the world’s population – consisting of two billion people – without at the same time upsetting the climate?</p>
      <p sl="de">The challenge, then, for regions like Europe, that are technologically advanced, is to find out what are the technologies of the future, that will make possible economic growth and make it independent of the ruination of the climate and from ever-increasing emissions of CO2? It is high-tech regions like Europe that will have to provide the answer.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second – and related – challenge for the human race is how to limit climate change and global warming. This week, we will be getting our hands on the latest data from the ‘Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’, whose scientific members are at the moment meeting in Paris to exchange data. It is already clear that what we are going to be told is that all the menacing prognostications to do with global warming are more likely to be confirmed or to turn out to be understated than that things are going to get better, and that means that we are not going to succeed in keeping global warming below 2 degrees unless we manage to do more than we have done so far in helping to reduce the output of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is already apparent to us what the consequences of that are. In my own country, Germany, the last glacier will have ceased to be by 2020. A few months ago, we launched a new rescue vessel to rescue people from shipwrecks in the North Sea. It is almost 50 metres in length. Ten or 20 years ago, a length of between 20 and 30 metres would have been quite sufficient. These are the first indications of climate change in a country that is affected by it only to a relatively small extent.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know that there will, in Germany, be more flooding, but also more recorded droughts. We, though, are a relatively wealthy and secure country. We hear about rather more serious problems when we talk to our counterparts from Spain and Portugal, countries that live in fear of real desertification, of droughts amounting to more periods of water shortages, and things become even more unsettling when we take a look and see what global warming is already doing in Africa.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the African continent today, there are already more refugees as a result of climate change than of war and civil warfare. The sort of movements of refugees that we see on the north African coast across the Mediterranean from Europe are just a hint of what is in store for us if global warming, and the destruction of living conditions in a continent like Africa, are not stopped in their tracks.</p>
      <p sl="de">I might also add that this has a lot to do with justice. For crying out loud, it is an injustice that it should be the continent of Africa, which bears no responsibility for the climate change that is currently going on, that should most have to suffer from the consequences of it, and that is what we are already seeing happening.</p>
      <p sl="de">I ask you to imagine a state of affairs in which four billion of the world’s population live in industrialised societies – two-thirds of them in Asia, by the way – and global warming begins to have an effect on the glaciers of the Himalayas, the source of 40% of Asia’s fresh water. I ask you to imagine what sort of threats the world faces when these reserves of drinkable water in Asia start to disappear; we will face the prospect of wars being fought not only for oil, but also, conceivably, of wars and civil wars being fought to gain possession of reservoirs of water.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are talking, then, about a real threat to the human race, but we must first succeed in getting these debates about the challenges to humanity out from the specialist arenas and into the forums of world leaders. In future, it will not be enough to bring together 189 environmental ministers from the United Nations and 5 000 scientists to discuss climate change at an international conference once a year; on the contrary, these issues will have to be discussed by Heads of State or Government, the UN General Assembly and the Security Council as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am also a member of the German Bundestag, in other words, of a parliament. We must succeed in getting these issues put high up on the agenda for parliamentary debates. I have to be frank and say that, when compared with the number of your House’s Members who turn up for debates on climate change, the number of their counterparts who do so in the Bundestag is more likely to be lower than higher.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should also make it our business to ensure that our constantly telling the public and our constantly reading, that this is one of the greatest challenges that the human race has to contend with, actually has the effect of making us focus our political action on it and prioritising it as part of our day-to-day work.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am convinced that the Commission’s proposals in respect of energy and climate management show not only that it has recognised this as a task, but also that it has thereby been given an historic opportunity. For the first time in the debate about energy and climate change, the Commission has made a proposal that I see as constituting an historic opportunity, in bringing together the themes of secure energy supply and the management of climate change. No longer are we debating the questions of how we are to guarantee access to energy, on the one hand, and how to safeguard our climate, on the other, in separate spheres, but instead have a package of proposals and policy instruments on the table that deals with both issues together.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have, for the first time, the opportunity to decide issues of energy policy and climate change together, at the European level, and in a coherent concept. I know that there will, over the coming weeks and months, be much discussion in the committees, the working parties and in officials' negotiations, and you know that far better than I do, for you have more experience of European decision-making processes than I do.</p>
      <p sl="de">My friend Mr Schulz – and it is worth the journey here just to have the chance of speaking before him, for normally our roles are reversed – knows, or at any rate he told me so earlier on, that there is always the risk of the political dynamic – what I would call the historic opportunity – being lost in amidst such discussions about details. What will, I believe, be the essential thing over the coming weeks and months will be that we do not, with all the necessary discussions of detail going on, miss this historic opportunity to combine Europe’s policies on energy and climate change and use them to map out the path for international debate to take. I see that as being the real task of the politicians in the Commission, Parliament, and in the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">There will of course be a number of points of detail where differences relating to national interests have to be settled, as is currently evident from the example of the motor industry, but what must be of the essence is that we should seize this historic opportunity, and I want, on behalf of the Council, to give a couple of examples to highlight what is going to be of particular importance at the spring summit of Heads of State or Government.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, the international negotiations need to have ambitious climate protection targets in mind; it is absolutely right that the Commission should set itself, as a goal for the international negotiations, a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020, a figure arrived at not by reference to what we are confident of achieving or to what is economically feasible, but solely by reference to the reductions we have to achieve by 2020 in order to keep global warming below 2 degrees. I think that is something that has to feature more prominently in day-to-day political debate, for there is often one great problem that one has to face in the debate on climate change.</p>
      <p sl="de">Back in the 1970s and 1980s, when people in my own country had problems with rubbish and waste dumps, the poisonous substances seeping out of the dumps were visible; it was because people could smell them and see them day in and day out that the politicians who dealt with day-to-day political issues got together and decided that the dumps had to be cleared up and less waste had to be added to them.</p>
      <p sl="de">The atmosphere is a dumping ground; although, nobody sees it, one does not smell it – at least not every day – and thank heaven disasters are not a daily occurrence. There is a quite considerable likelihood of the fact of this dump’s invisibility not reminding us, on a daily basis, of the need for action, and if you tell the people, your electorate, that we want to limit the temperature increase on our planet to 2 degrees, many of them will look at you in amazement and say, ‘Two degrees? That is not really very much, and it is actually very pleasant if it does not get quite so cold in Northern Europe’. In other words, it is difficult to communicate the fact that a mere two or three degrees is the difference between our present-day temperatures and the Ice Age several thousand years ago.</p>
      <p sl="de">And, if you then tell them that we have to get it all done by 2100, for there will by then be a lot of people on this planet, you will hear them say, in our parliaments and parties, ‘oh well, that is looking so far ahead; that is something for our successors to bother themselves about’.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has to be spelled out that climate change is something that is already happening and that, in essence, it is our children and grandchildren who are going to be affected by it. All of those who are of my age and currently actively involved in politics will certainly be able to live out their lives on this earth, but my 18-year old daughter will pay a heavy price if we fail to make use of the next 10 to 15 years in order to bring about real change in global warming or to stop it altogether. Protecting the climate involves a long braking distance; it lasts thirty years. It is in thirty years time that we will reap the fruits of what we do properly now, but it is our children and grandchildren who will suffer the consequences of what we get wrong.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it is important that we lay down the 2-degree target at the Spring Summit of Heads of State or Government, thus arriving at an international climate protection target of minus 30% by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has said that, if a multilateral agreement or an agreement supplementary to Kyoto is not reached with the United States, China and India, the European Union should set a unilateral target of at least 20%. Some political figures have said that they see that as a retrograde step in managing climate change; I see it as something quite different. The message we are sending out is that, even in the improbable eventuality of our not succeeding in bringing about an international agreement on climate change involving those beyond the EU’s borders, nobody in the EU should believe that that would be the end of climate protection; on the contrary, even in the eventuality – one that we neither expect nor desire – of international negotiations on climate change failing, our concern will be to commit the European Union to more climate protection and to achieve at least 20%, rather than contenting ourselves with 8%.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want the agreement to apply also to air transport, and we do of course need the European motor industry’s voluntary undertaking to be put into practice. If a voluntary undertaking naming 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre on average is not forthcoming from the European motor industry, the political fallout will not be about the question of whether or not legislation is needed at the European level; rather, it seems to me, having heard what I have heard over recent days, that we – the Commission, my government, and the overwhelming majority in the Council and this House – are agreed on the fact that European legislation is needed to secure this contribution from the European motor industry, a contribution of 120 grams per kilometre.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we will have to hammer out is whether that can be achieved through vehicle technology alone or whether we want to avail ourselves of, for example, proportionate incorporation of biofuels as a means towards that end. This is certainly, I believe, a fit subject for debate here in your House, in the Commission and at Council level, but there should be no doubt about the fact that the ultimate objective is the 120 gram target for the motor industry across the board.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we will have to make sure that everyone makes progress towards this target – large vehicles no less than medium-sized ones or small ones, and renewable energies need to be developed to a considerable degree. Speaking both for myself and for the Council, I am very keen that we should stick with the across-the-board target of 20% of the EU’s primary energy needs being met from renewable energies, and prove that we can thereby become technological leaders. These climate change objectives are ambitious, but there are also massive prospects for the European Union’s economic growth, for job creation and for education.</p>
      <p sl="de">After all, the question has to do with what is to become of Europe when China is the world’s workbench, Russia its petrol pump and Brazil its farmer – what will Europe be then? I believe that we in Europe will be the world’s engineers and technologists, the ones who take on the technological challenges and offer solutions whereby the issues of energy supply and climate change can be addressed, technological answers that many are waiting for the climate change talks and international energy policy to supply. It is in the region of Europe that innovation happens and Europe that possesses everything that is needed in order to provide these answers. I believe that what the Commission has put forward in matters of efficiency, climate protection targets and its energy action plan provides us with everything we need to face up to this challenge.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, access to energy and the handling of climate change constitute the two great challenges that the human race will have to face in the twenty-first century. That was said, not by me, but by the President of the European Council, Chancellor Merkel, here in this House a fortnight ago, and so the Commission and the Presidency are only being consistent when they prioritise the battle against climate change as part of their work programme.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has to be said, though, that it is no less important that such words be backed up by action. As the Stern report made clear, the economic damage done by uncontrolled climate change is comparable, economically speaking, only with that done in the course of the Second World War. In my electoral district, we have a tangible example of this, one that people talk about, for we experienced the storm ‘Kyrill’, which caused thousands of people to sustain serious losses, since my electoral district was at its epicentre. Although climate change cannot be blamed for every storm, the researchers are pretty certain that the accumulation of extreme meteorological occurrences can no longer be overlooked.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why our aim must be to reduce emissions by 30% by the year 2020; we should do everything possible to that end. Like many other Members of this House, I do believe that talking in terms of 20% was – to say the least – confusing, for the impression was conveyed that the 20% figure was not to be taken too seriously, yet seriously is just how we should take it.</p>
      <p sl="de">We now also have the chance to get something done about this at the international level, for in the USA, for example, the debate has undergone fundamental change in the aftermath of Katrina. After what has happened over the last few months, we have a far greater chance than in the past of doing something about it together, so, realistically, nobody should take it for granted that we will get nowhere; instead, we should do everything possible to actually get an international agreement in place.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is good that this House should be preparing a response to the Commission’s statement, but it is also good that we are not voting on it as early as tomorrow, for there is a resolution from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, in which there is much sense; even so, we still have to haggle over it if we are to be able, in Strasbourg, and with the agreement of the other committees, to be able to respond with the utmost clarity.</p>
      <p sl="de">I, for example, take the view that the Committee on Environment’s resolution’s treatment of nuclear energy is quite irrelevant and very poor; that is not fit for purpose and there is room for us to make some improvements there, but what we must do is to send out a clear signal in favour of more being done to handle climate change. According to one survey, that is what 98% of people expect Europe’s policymakers to do, and we should not disappoint them.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Liese has just said that, yesterday, we, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, adopted a very important and extremely detailed resolution. Since Mr Gabriel has gone into these details, I will not mention them. We will try to further improve this resolution in Strasbourg, with a view to the Spring European Council.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should just like to devote the few seconds available to me to supporting what I consider to be a very good starting point from Mr Gabriel’s speech, which is that we are faced with a turning point in history. I believe that, during this year and next, 2007 and 2008, it will be possible to actually say whether, politically speaking, we are going to succeed in speeding up and making a qualitative leap on this major theme that is commanding international attention. The situation is changing, not only in terms of the new data being supplied to us by the scientists in Paris, the panel, etc., but also in terms of the political and international debate: for example, a different sort of awareness is developing or may develop on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore believe that, while playing our part and introducing appropriate legislation – emissions trading, the inclusion of aviation, the reduction in CO2 emissions for cars, and all the other things in the pipeline – we need to make a big qualitative leap in political terms and create a powerful alliance among the European institutions so that they can present themselves as strongly as possible in international negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="it">We too, as Parliament, ought perhaps to do our jobs better – clearly, first and foremost, that of legislator – but we can support the Commission and Council negotiations by perhaps proposing a major international alliance of parliaments, with a view to making the fight against global warming a real priority, as the citizens are demanding.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, my group welcomes the Commission’s recent focus on energy policy and climate change, its biomass proposal of December 2005, its proposals concerning the ‘standby’ mode for electronic equipment of September 2006, its energy policy this month and today’s announcement of a fuel quality directive. We feel that together these represent an ambitious but not unachievable policy. Such a policy is essential if the Union and its Member States are to live up to their responsibility to citizens, if we are to enjoy secure energy supplies and if we are to persuade other countries to follow our example.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we had heeded the warnings of Californian scientists in the late 1970s, we could probably have prevented climate change. Now we can hope only to contain it. For that reason, Liberals and Democrats deplore the pleadings of German car manufacturers in Bild Zeitung and the attempts by some Commissioners to water down emissions targets.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">If the Japanese can make hybrid cars, if the French and the Italians can produce cars that are far more efficient, why cannot others as well?</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not often quote Konrad Adenauer in this House – I leave that to my colleagues on the right – but Adenauer was pertinent when he said ‘God placed limits on man’s reason. But not on his stupidity’.</p>
      <a text="(Laughter and applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">We will not succeed unless our citizens recognise there is a problem and start changing their habits. Do we really need electric razors or electric curling irons? Do we really need cars that go from 0 to 100 km per hour in less than six seconds if it will destroy our planet in less than six decades? There is a boast of car manufacturers that their cars do 240 km per hour. That may be so, but they emit 360g of CO2 for each kilometre. Stopping this is not hitting jobs. A Belgian Government study last year showed that cutting CO2 emissions has no overall effect on jobs, because there are new high-tech sectors which create new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not just on climate issues where new thinking is needed: we need to feed a rapidly growing world population and bring living standards up to the point where population numbers stabilise. There are many ways to do that – growing soya, for example, with the same nutritional value as beef for less than 1% of the inputs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Democracy can no longer be run by crisis management, where serious problems are left untackled until there is a crisis. Where livelihoods and the sustainability of life are at stake, we need a purposeful, proactive approach to our politics, such as that suggested by the President-in-Office today. It is not easy to change people’s habits. There is not enough emphasis in the Commission’s proposals on cutting energy use, but it is essential.</p>
      <p sl="de">HG Wells said ‘human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe’. If the Commission grasps this agenda, if it challenges the Member States rather than deferring to them, then there is hope that the Union will yet command greater support among our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, not all of you heard the Council Presidency’s impressive speech on climate change, but, just as I have, you will have heard many of its kind, and, since Mr Gabriel, my old friend from our days together in provincial politics, is given to plain speaking, I would just like to say that, if it were possible for words to halt climate change in its tracks, the problem would probably be gone by now, but I have to tell both Mr Gabriel and the Commissioner that this situation has to be assessed in terms of what is being done about it rather than of what is being said about it.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission proposal accompanying the energy package is problematic, and not only because of the 20% target and the juggling around with the initial unilateral 20% followed perhaps by 30% at the international level later; another reason why it is problematic is that the instruments to be included in this energy package are all too weak, and I have my doubts about whether they are at all capable of achieving a 20% reduction in CO2.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Gabriel, this is a package with a lot wrong with it and little right with it. For example, there is too little in it about energy efficiency and energy-saving, not enough about renewable energies, too much about coal and fossil fuels, and the optimistic attitude in it towards nuclear power is indefensible nowadays, particularly when one considers the economic disaster that Areva is inflicting on Finland, the news of which must surely make every opponent of nuclear power rejoice that the nuclear industry is ruining itself through this sort of misinvestment.</p>
      <p sl="de">Quite apart from the rights and wrongs of this, there has, as I see it, also been something over the past few days that has outdone these false instruments, something for which the German Presidency of the Council is responsible. Commissioner Dimas tried – and rightly – to lay down binding targets for CO2 reduction, and at a level that the motor industry had voluntarily announced, only to see this proper attempt torpedoed by Germany, and not with the thought in its mind of doing something about climate change or the future of the motor industry, but simply and solely with the thought of protecting that small subdivision of it – the one concerned with the production of big luxury cars, a business that goes on in Germany, and so, suddenly, they care less about climate change and only about Porsche!</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I am glad we are having this debate at the same time as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose conclusions we all look forward to, is being held in Paris. In this regard, Madam President, may I suggest that we invite Dr Pachauri, chairman of the panel, which comprises the world’s most eminent scientists dealing with this issue, to attend a public hearing in this Chamber. I met him briefly yesterday in Paris and I believe that his explanations and recommendations would be very useful in the battle ahead of us if we intend to help overcome this challenge to civilisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is the current state of play? I would personally say that we must send out a message to our citizens that is both lucid and stimulating, one that consists of one piece of bad news and two pieces of good news. The bad news is the current state of affairs. Around the world, the situation has become even worse over the past six years, and in the EU we have got off to a bad start in honouring our Kyoto commitments, which were woefully inadequate to start with. If we were to continue at this rate, we would do the planet intolerable damage not only for future generations but for our children’s generation, too. So much for the bad news, which certainly is bad.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I now turn to the first piece of good news: it is possible to reverse the trend.</p>
      <a text="(Addressing Members who are talking and not listening to him)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, if the issue of climate change only interests you in front of the media, then I feel sorry for you …</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">… because just before, when the Council and the Commission were talking about it, I counted you, and there were no more than 50 Members in the Chamber. Please do not come just to vote without knowing the background. Come and take part in the debate, or at least show some respect for those who are speaking.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Having mentioned the bad news, here is the first piece of good news that we can announce to the citizens. It is possible to reverse the trend, but this would admittedly require something akin to a revolution. The objectives of reducing emissions are well known – a reduction of 50% around the world, and thus 75% in our countries, by 2050. To achieve this will entail not only substantial increases in clean energy sources but also a new relationship as regards energy efficiency, involving a massive upsurge in the development of railways and motorways of the sea, the implementation, as mentioned by other speakers, of ambitious anti-pollution standards on car manufacturers, in spite of the pressure from Mrs Merkel, the massive construction of energy-saving houses, training in the use of more fuel-efficient technologies, international trade based much more on cooperation than competition, massive long-term investment and the adoption of the notion of the common good, in other words a number of major setbacks for liberal globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I now turn to the second piece of good news, namely the sharp increase in public awareness of these issues, including in the United States and emerging countries. This historic gamble has no chance of paying off unless that fundamental element is in place. One word of warning, however: I doubt whether the citizens would accept a Malthusian response to the problems we face. Leaving behind the preoccupation with economic productivity does not mean hampering social development. The fight against climate change will not be a smooth process.</p>

It is particularly thanks to the Al Gore campaign and Sir Nicholas Stern’s report that climate change has been in the spotlight so much in recent months. This means that now is a good time to make some solid headway. Europe must indeed take the lead in the climate debate and in the measures to be taken. What matters now is for the Commission’s recent proposals to be taken up not only by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but also by the Heads of Government of the Member States. The climate problem is so extensive that it will be necessary to keep it on the agenda for decades to come.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Since climate change, and hence global warming, cannot simply be slowed down, only rigorous steps will have an adequate effect. These will involve a shift towards carbon-free and low-carbon fuels as a necessary measure. In specific terms, this means that we need to say goodbye to fossil fuels. The European Parliament has already indicated that by 2020, Europe should have achieved a 30% reduction in CO2. The Commission, however, has proposed a 20% reduction in order to allow room for negotiations in a bid to achieve global agreement, which would then involve a 30% reduction in emissions in Europe. I should like Commissioner Dimas to explain to us why he thinks this tactic will work.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to ask you for a little more time as I was unable to speak at my normal speed.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a fairly common desire in this House, and certainly among the public, to combat climate change. However, allow me to make a remark, which will be useful in highlighting the intellectual honesty that we owe those citizens who are less acquainted with this subject: namely, when we talk about combating climate change, it is worth specifying that we are referring only to the influence that man and his activities have on the environment, an influence that, as has been scientifically proven, is far less significant than that of geophysical and astronomical determinants.</p>
      <p sl="it">True, it is useful to have an energy policy that not only is as environmentally friendly as possible but also guarantees the energy supply that is crucial to our development, something that, in Europe, with all our political independence from non-European countries, has so far been a distant prospect. I obviously agree on the emissions reduction targets, just as I do on the efforts to develop renewable energy sources. All of that is, of course, right, and the idea of encouraging people to use less-polluting vehicles seems to be a good one. Is it not the case, though, that the situation will end up as it has in Italy, where the 2007 budget law favours those who are in a position to buy new vehicles and actually condemns precisely those who are least well-off, who cannot afford to change their vehicles, to a lack of mobility and heavy costs?</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, while I am not being Sinophobic – please believe me when I say that – I would ask once again: is there any sense in all of our unilateral efforts regarding sustainability when, in one year, China and the Asian economic tigers emit as much climate-changing gas into the atmosphere as is produced in ten years by EU countries?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I rise once more in order to respond in strong terms to an attack by Mrs Harms on the German Presidency of the Council, in relation to the question as to where the German Council Presidency stands on the involvement of the motor industry in dealing with climate change.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first thing I want to say to Mrs Harms is that the Council Presidency cannot as yet have a position on this issue, since the Commission has produced no proposal, nor has there been as yet any deliberation at Council level. On the assumption that you mean the position of the German Federal Government, Mrs Harms, I suggest that there are a number of things of which you need to take note, the first of which is that your assertion that the German Federal Government is opposed to a legislative proposal and to Europe-wide legislation laying down CO2 emissions of 120 gram per kilometre is very definitely wrong. There is agreement within the German Government that, if the voluntary undertaking on the part of the European motor industry should prove ineffective, there will of course have to be European legislation with the aim of enforcing an output of 120 gram per kilometre of CO2. Secondly, though, the German Federal Government does take the view that …</p>
      <a text="(Heckling)"/>
      <p sl="de">… if the European motor industry has set itself this target for 2012, it should be taken at its word. There, too, the German Government is not taking up an opposing position.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, though, the German Federal Government is persuaded that we must achieve this 120-gram target together and through two things, the first being vehicle technology and the second, the inclusion of some biofuels.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling)"/>
      <p sl="de">I have no idea what you mean by that not working; that is something we will have to debate when the time comes, but the point I am trying to make is this: do we want – and I really would prefer it if we could carry on this debate calmly – do we want the effect of the development of the first generation of biofuels to be more competition among foodstuffs, the consequence of which has already been seen in Mexico, where maize bread, the staple food of the poorest of the poor, has become some 60% more expensive, or do we want to invest in synthetic fuels, in the second generation of biofuels? Yes or no?</p>
      <p sl="de">If that is what we want, we have to get the market interested in it. It goes without saying that the motor industry and the oil industry have an interest in developing synthetic fuels that will obviate this competition in the food sector, if we make it possible for them to achieve some of this 120-gram target by taking biofuels into account, and, while we will have to argue about the substance of that, I would ask Mrs Harms not to act as if the German Government had some sort of objection to the 120 gram target being enforced by legislation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I hope we agree on the need to achieve this target as an average taken across the whole range of motor vehicles, by reducing consumption and the output of CO2 by all motor vehicles, from the top of the range to the smaller ones, and including middle of the range models. If, though, what the European motor industry has undertaken to do has to be enforced by law, it will be done in the manner intended, that being across all classes of motor vehicles, so that an average of 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre is achieved.</p>
      <p sl="de">My fourth comment, for Mrs Harms’ benefit, is that I think there are two things that we really must not do. Perhaps she and I can agree on that if on nothing else, and what I say is also the position taken by the German Government. It would be mistaken to involve the motor industry in emissions trading in Europe, since that would have the consequence of making emissions trading even more complex, and it is already too complex as it is, so it makes sense to do this outside the emissions trading system.</p>
      <p sl="de">We might perhaps also agree that the reduction of CO2 output is a task for the future that we ought not to hand over to the private sector by saying that it is, in the final analysis, dependent on individuals’ driving habits. The challenge is a technological one, and it is one we want to face in a technological way, by changing motor vehicle technology and taking some account of the development of synthetic biofuels and of the way they are added.</p>
      <p sl="de">If your question had to do with the position of the German Government, then I hope that the answer I have given is sufficient for you. If, though, your question was directed at the Presidency of the Council – which is how I understood it – then I would be obliged if you would have the decency to allow the Presidency the chance to have at least a general debate in the Environmental Affairs Council, which it will be able to do only once the Commission has released a communication on the subject.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have to say that, if your suggestion was to be understood as a request for such a communication in order that a general debate might be made possible, then that would be the part – indeed the only part – of your speech with which I would find myself in agreement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I listened very carefully to what Minister Gabriel said, because the headlines in the Irish papers today state: ‘Germany fights EU limits on car emissions’. The papers go on to state that ‘German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged to fight “with full vigour” the plans to introduce across-the-board limits on CO2 emissions from cars …’. My two minutes does not allow me to continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">You have a big PR exercise, Minister, if what you say is accurate rather than that which the German President of the Council says. Therefore, please sort out the confusion that exists there at the moment, particularly as Chancellor Merkel’s address at the start of the German Presidency was excellent and most encouraging in this particular area, and she has guaranteed that this issue will take high priority on the summit agenda in March.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need greater political ownership of this debate. The real problem is – and I say this through the Chair to our Commissioner as well as to the Minister – that we have left it to our officials and our diplomats. Yes, Nairobi was ‘a step forward’ in preparing the ground. That is what you said. But it was a baby’s step forward, a tortuous step forward: hardly an improvement on what had been agreed in Montreal.</p>
      <p sl="en">It makes no sense for thousands of us from hundreds of countries to meet once a year, use up carbon and fly to all sorts of locations to sit and argue mainly about what should be on the agenda, then leave again after up to two weeks, only to come back 12 months later to pick up the argument about the agenda that we had left 12 months earlier! If what we say and all the reports from economists, NGOs, environmentalists and eminent scientists are right – and they are right, 99% of the community agree they right – then we must take the highest political ownership of the resolution of the problem. That is at summit level: not only at summit meetings, but also at the COPs and the MOPs and in Nairobi and wherever else we meet. We must drive it upstairs to prime-ministerial and head-of-state level throughout the 12 months of the year, and not just the annual meeting at the United Nations Convention on Climate Change or the Kyoto MOP meeting.</p>

Measures are desperately needed, for very many people have grave concerns about climate change. Tomorrow, the United Nations will be announcing that the Earth is warming up at a rate quicker than we had previously imagined. Europe must show leadership in solving the problem. That is why it is important that we really stand firm with regard to this 30% and that we do not cave in to accept 20% if the rest of the world does not join in. The fact that we rely on other countries in that manner is very disappointing, although I can see why: first of all, we have a moral duty towards the rest of the world. Since we have caused climate change, we must also resolve it. Secondly, according to the Stern report, it is far cheaper to adopt solid climate policy than to pay for subsequent costs for adjusting to global warming. Climate policy offers ample opportunity for innovation and employment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Presidency has got off to a very good start on this issue. I do not doubt the commitment of the Minister in any way at all, and was very pleased to hear the strong words from the Chancellor just the other week. But of course the rhetoric has got to be matched by the reality, and Germany has a problem. It has the problem of the national allocation plan, first of all. I realise there is a problem as regards a difference in interpretation between the Presidency and the Commission, but one way or another it does not help with you in the hot seat not having a national allocation plan approved. So Minister, please get it sorted.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then of course there is the issue today of the German car industry and the rhetoric in the various papers. I have just come from and will return to chairing a hearing on reducing CO2 emissions from motor vehicles. The clear message from many of the experts speaking is that 120 grammes per kilometre is perfectly realisable within the five-year timescale that we are talking about at a cost of a thousand euros: that is the estimate that many of those experts are putting on it. And that is a thousand euros with a quick return for car-owners because of fuel economy and savings at the petrol pump.</p>
      <p sl="en">I ask you, how often in environment debates have we heard industry coming along and saying ‘this is impossible, this is the end of our industry if you do this, European Union; this is going to cost an extravagant amount, European Parliament’? And so often we introduce the legislation and somehow the problems are dissipated, industry copes with it and we become more competitive and our position across the world is strengthened. I suspect the same thing is happening once again. Industry exaggerates, it always does.</p>
      <p sl="en">We talk about dealing with this issue of climate change. If we are looking at the real price of a car, which has come down so significantly over the past 20 or 30 years, and we are saying that to reduce emissions by 25% would cost an extra thousand euros, still leaving the real price of a car at less than it was thirty years ago, can we not bear that price? How can we look at our children and say that we were not prepared to pay just a little bit more to make such a big difference?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as I see it, one reason why we should extend this debate on cars is that it highlights the gulf between words and actions. Mr Gabriel’s proposal for combining the admixture of biofuels and the requirement for the efficiency of motor vehicles obscures the issue, for, even if I sell a car that can run on biofuels, I cannot be certain that the customer will use them in it later on, and so it is the very opposite of clear from the system you propose as to how the output is to be measured, and that gives rise to enormous problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although you talk in terms of a CO2 output of 120 grams per kilometre, what you actually want is the same as the German car manufacturers, namely 130 or 140 grams. That would be a fatal move not only for Europe but also for the world generally, for, as the target of between 60 and 100 grams must be achieved by 2020 at the latest, the figure of 120 grams can represent only an intermediate stage. I also want to thank you for your clarifications; I hope that Mrs Merkel and Mr Glos take the same view, for it has not been clear from the press over the last few days that they do. I may well not be a German, but, for me, Germany has always been one of the great leaders, for the German public give the highest priority to the protection of the environment and to dealing with climate change, and for a German Presidency, having set itself to do great things on the climate change front, to fall over the first time the economy comes under even minimal pressure is an appalling disgrace.</p>

Specific measures are needed with tangible and quantifiable results. The example of the car is a typical example. As soon as general statements move towards specific measures, the lobbies react. My opinion is that the lives of all of us and of our children weigh and count more than the automobile industry.</p>
      <p sl="el">We welcome specific measures such as a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, support for renewable sources of energy, clean fuels and new, cleaner technologies. The European Parliament is calling on the Commission and the Council to set more ambitions targets and, more importantly, to attain them.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this issue is surrounded by half-truths and misleading statements which cast doubt over the integrity of the issue and raise more questions than answers. For instance, why, outside this House at any rate, is there continual reference to carbon emissions? Carbon is a black solid; it is soot or graphite or diamonds. They should be talking about carbon dioxide which is, by the way, not a pollutant but a natural constituent of the atmosphere. Why did the director of a UK environment agency tell me they could not link global warming to climate change? If global warming is due to CO2 and the greenhouse effect, as opposed to a variation in solar activity, why was the same director unable to tell me if the greenhouse affect rises in proportion to the extra amount of CO2 or rises greatly for the same amount of CO2 – an exponential – or a lessening increase, meaning a tapering-off graph and a static effect at some time.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why does the Stern Report show a hockey stick graph for global warming – a steady rise over 2000 years – when in fact it was warmer in the 14th and 15th centuries than it is now? Why does Friends of the Earth say that incineration of waste to generate electricity produces more CO2 than conventional gas-fired generators when effectively much of the waste is bio-fuel and therefore carbon-neutral? They ignore the fact that landfill waste will produce methane, which is 12 times more potent a greenhouse gas than CO2.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, a number of experts have claimed that, apart from speculation based on short-term warnings, there is no incontrovertible scientific evidence that greenhouse gases from industrial growth lie at the root of climate change. Climate change takes millions of years and the climate will of course go on changing. I therefore do not share the view that people can change the history of the planet with their daily routine. That view is, to my mind, arrogantly anthropocentric.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Caring for the planet has little to do with emissions trading, bringing in stricter standards, enacting new legislation or investing massively in cutting emissions from existing sources of energy. A far more sensible course of action would be to invest in developing new sources of energy and nuclear energy. I strongly believe that today’s narrow-minded, anti-nuclear approach to global warming will, under the guise of combating greenhouse gases, lead us down a blind alley where both our incomes and our freedoms will be curtailed. Such an approach certainly does not amount to caring for the planet in the interests of our children.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we have a four-fold challenge in front of us: firstly, there is climate change itself and the public desire to tackle it; secondly, international involvement in the fight against climate change; thirdly, the innovation required for a change in production methods and the use of energy; and lastly, our countries’ adaptation to the inevitable effects of climate change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is tempting to ask: what is Europe actually waiting for before properly opening up the debate on nuclear power, by which I mean serious, dispassionate debate? I would call on you to hold this debate without any further delay. The option of renewable energy is admittedly a very appealing one, but we have no choice but to look at these things realistically.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us take two examples: wind energy and biofuels. The former accounts for 0.05% of the world’s energy consumption. How fast would we have to develop wind energy in order to achieve 2% annual growth in global consumption of such energy over a period of 30 years? It is impossible even to contemplate. Biofuels, on the other hand, are an interesting, media-friendly way of dealing with a problem of agricultural policy, but the possibilities offered by biofuels are limited by available agricultural space.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Dimas, you will have to convince your fellow Commissioner, Mr Verheugen, not to hinder our ambitions. Mr Gabriel, there are some battles in which we will have to support certain industries that, faced with this global threat, are leading rearguard actions. I trust that German car makers will be able to come up with the kind of positive responses that are sorely needed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What, then, are we to say to third countries? Do we tell China, for example, that it has no right to develop its economy? Not to mention the hypocrisy of Europe patting itself on the back about emissions trading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, those who indulge in alarmism will only end up destabilising public opinion. We must raise awareness and inform the public, but making people afraid serves no purpose. It is not constructive. We should try to propose workable solutions. This requires everyone to make an effort, and time is our only priority.</p>

According to one estimate, the cost of doing nothing could be as much as 20% of GNP globally. If we take action now, however, and halt climate change at two degrees, the cost will be a fraction of that. Moreover, investment in the low-emission economy will create a global market for energy-efficient technologies which is forecast to grow to a value of up to EUR 27 billion by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For Europe to be part of this technological development, the Union needs to create a viable domestic market for renewable, low-emission forms of energy.

The European Parliament must embark on a direct dialogue with the newly elected American Congress. Instead of just following the American debate in the media, it is our responsibility to take action.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The political balance in Congress has changed, and right now the door may be open for the cooperation that must take place if change is to take place. Congress has now even set up a special committee on climate change. Strength lies in the EU and the United States acting together. Only together can we influence countries such as China and India so that they too might be involved in global emissions trading. They must not firstly be allowed to pollute their own environment and ours at will just because they are developing countries, and only once they have achieved high living standards assume responsibility for the global environment.</p>

      <p sl="en">However, in my one minute I want to ask you, Commissioner Dimas, to do something very specific. There has been a lot of discussion about what is wrong today but not enough about what we need to be doing – some of the answers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to raise the issue of personal carbon allowances. It is a scheme that is growing in interest in many Member States whereby emission rights are allocated to all individuals on an equal per capita basis and then surrendered, for example when they are purchasing fossil fuels or electricity for personal use and, of course, over time those emission rights decline.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is complementary to the emissions trading scheme, but in many ways it is more equitable than much greater taxation, it has the advantage of being subject to an overall and declining cap and, crucially, it engages people on a personal level. It affects individual choices that they make, because one of the strongest disincentives to individual action is the sense that your neighbour is not doing what you are doing. Therefore, I would ask your departments to investigate what they can do to encourage the take-up of such schemes across the European Union.</p>

Global warming and the associated climate change have not been dreamt up by environmental groups: during the 20th century, the average temperature increased by more than half a degree, and we must look for a cause in the emission of greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The European Union is responsible for around 14% of these emissions, the highest per capita quota in the world. That is why the fight against climate change, which requires the help of all countries, needs none other than the most advanced countries to lead the way.</p>
      <p sl="it">The EU must therefore continue to work in the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol, which has led us to bank on technological innovation. In recent years, however, some backwards steps have been taken, particularly in relation to energy, and the recent Commission proposals have not lived up to expectations. Even though you yourself, Mr Dimas, asked for emissions to be cut by 30% compared with 1990 levels, a poor compromise was reached to reduce them by 20%, and there is no strategy in the transport sector, on alternative energy sources or on technologies for green hydrogen.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have two tasks to fulfil: one is to reduce CO2 emissions and the other is to ensure that we can meet the changes that follow climate change. They both require that we have the resources for investment, that we have the opportunities for growth and the opportunities to take care of the environment. Limits and goals are important in this, but it is just as important to take action that is compatible with economic growth and resources for investments in order to safeguard what we must do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sometimes we can look at the more practical and realistic actions. I shall mention only two. Long-truck combinations are one of the more substantial ways of reducing CO2 emissions regarding road transport. Commissioner, President-in-Office: you can do something about that as a practical action that will have a substantial result.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second task concerns energy policy. Phasing out nuclear power in the way and at a pace that is being planned in today’s Europe is a secure way of getting increased CO2 emissions. If we succeed in launching more renewable energy sources, then the phasing-out of nuclear power will reduce the gains and maybe we will get into minus with increased CO2 emissions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like the German Presidency to take the lead in a new policy. You should do that not in order to solve the greenhouse effect, as some say, but in order not to make things worse. We must at least keep the same share of energy coming from nuclear power that we have today in order not to increase CO2 emissions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need high-tech, not low-tech; we need more trade, not less trade; we need more investments, not less investments and we need more growth, not less growth. The challenge is to combine those things, and I look forward to your reply on my two certain tasks, however politically uncomfortable it might be for you.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As Kofi Annan said in Nairobi, climate change is not science fiction. It is a global problem requiring a global response from both governments and citizens. Governments must, as a matter of urgency, take effective measures, but the citizens, too, must change their routines and their lifestyles, for example, by not using their cars and by walking more, which is healthy and protects the environment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fighting climate change is a priority for the German and Portuguese Presidencies. I hope that, together, they can provide a major boost to this fight and that the EU will take the opportunity, at the next UN conference to be held in Bali during the Portuguese Presidency, to lead negotiations towards a whole new approach to the climate issue.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, thinking ahead to 2030-2050, will fossil fuels have run out? Will the ITER project have kept its promise on fusion? Given the huge growth of China and India, will energy resources be sufficient? What will the effects of growth be on the climate? We do not necessarily have all the answers to these questions, but what is clear is that we must act within the framework of a European and world strategy, because energy is a fundamental need and the phenomenon of global warming must be stopped.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome the ambitious objectives consisting of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2020, because the EU must send out a strong message that behaviour and mentalities must be changed so that innovative solutions with global impact might be found.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also welcome the measures proposed by the Commission, but they must be accompanied by political action. Accordingly, more must be done to force the Member States to take more proactive measures, for example in connection with the use of biofuels and renewable energies, and to take taxation measures to foster energy saving and to promote the energy efficiency of buildings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, without wishing to be alarmist, a European communication campaign should be launched, with the support of the media, in order to present the citizens of Europe with simple things that anyone can do to help protect the climate.

If that happens it will mean that Greenland’s ice sheet will inevitably melt and sea levels will rise by at least seven metres. It will mean that the map of Europe will be redrawn. This has to be prevented.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We have to take very urgent practical action to stop the earth from warming up any more than two degrees, which is the EU target. We need to move from rhetoric to practical deeds, however. In this context, it is hugely disappointing to see that today the European Commission has once again put off the issue of mandatory limits for carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to thank the Commission and the Council for coming here to debate this issue and the strategy to be pursued in the future.</p>
      <p sl="es">We all agree with the principle of reducing polluting emissions that underlies the proposals by the Commission and the Member States. We agree with the diagnosis, though we have certain differences in terms of the remedies to be applied and each person’s responsibilities. I am delighted to have heard something here that I believe to be essential. That is that there must be an international agreement on emissions reduction that includes everybody. Unless we achieve that, it will be difficult to find a solution if objectives are set unilaterally. Amongst other things, because, on its own, the European Union can neither reduce world emissions nor set objectives for maintaining temperatures at global level.</p>
      <p sl="es">I truly believe that our main objective must be to reach a global agreement through our efforts, of course, and also with the efforts of our industries. Like you, Commissioner, I would personally prefer a more flexible objective, to which everybody is committed, to an objective of a 30% reduction with no idea of who will sign up to it.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition to that, we must take a series of principles into account. Firstly, the countries that have historically polluted more must reduce their emissions more, and reasonable emissions limits for the future should be set for the emerging economies. Secondly, all sectors will have to face their responsibilities in accordance with their emissions, because it makes no sense to talk about electricity but not to talk about transport. Thirdly, we must also bear in mind the benefits for carbon retention of agriculture and forests, which are natural regulators of the environment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I would like to point to the importance of promoting renewable energy sources and clean forms of transport and say that it is urgent that we discuss seriously the issue of nuclear energy once and for all.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and the Minister for their personal commitment to this crucial issue and remind the House that these are the good guys! There are plenty of people in the Commission and in the Council who are going to be pushing against these in terms of where we are at. The proposals that have come forward from the Commission are indeed ambitious. However, they are not ambitious enough and they do not follow through the science. The science suggests that if we are to follow through what the ministers have already decided – that is not to go above two degrees – then you have to have a 30% cut in carbon emissions. If you follow Stern, you have to take the pain now to save later.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we want to see is world leadership. A 20% cut is not world leadership. The ministers have to follow through. If they sign up to this, they have to follow through. It is disappointing to see that the Member States are not signing up to 20% binding targets on renewables. It is disappointing that the Commission has caved in to the German car lobby, but it is good to hear the ministers say that actually we are not going to cave in to the car lobby, as some Commissioners have done – not Mr Dimas.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I agree that climate change may have catastrophic consequences for the world – and with it for Europe. If over the next ten years we do not radically turn around our current practice, if we do not change our current way of life, then this may cause enormous economic and ecological damage.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is precisely for this reason that it is in the interests of each Member State, and their moral obligation, to commit itself to the climate policy announced by the German Presidency – namely, by 2020 reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, increasing the share of renewables in the total energy mix to 20%, as well as raising the proportion of biofuel in the fuel consumed to 10%. As far as actions are concerned, I call upon the Commission to compare the operating programmes of the Member States, which are currently under assessment, with these targets. Insofar as the Commission should determine that in a particular Member State there are insufficient EU sources allocated to reaching these targets, it should make use of its powers and refuse to accept in this form the operating programme of the country in question.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is unacceptable that a few Member States should support energy efficiency and the joint European efforts made in the area of energy savings with words alone. Hungary and Poland want to devote scarcely more than 1% of the Union budget to this area, while Lithuania, for instance, is willing to devote 5.4%. It is already clear that this will not enable Hungarians and Poles to fulfil even their current EU commitments.</p>
      <p sl="hu">If we think and act responsibly, then in the next six months the third industrial revolution may begin. The goal of this industrial revolution is to stop climate change, and its result will be the creation of a low-carbon, and then a carbon-free economy.</p>

      <p sl="et">In recent days, a great deal of interesting information has come from Davos about the extent of climate change and its possible catastrophic impact. I participated in the same event 12 years ago, and I must admit that climate change was not mentioned on that occasion. Talk, however, is not enough.</p>
      <p sl="et">The melting of Greenland’s ice sheet, the Arctic ice and the Siberian permafrost have noticeably reduced the amount of ice on the Earth, which will lead to a dangerous increase in the sea level around the globe. It appears that this has helped us to understand better the dangers that we face. It is clear that the Kyoto Treaty itself as a political mechanism is insufficient – we need quicker action. This was also mentioned at Davos.</p>
      <p sl="et">We must set binding and ambitious objectives in Europe to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. The developing economies of China and India are key countries and must hold an important position in the new political mechanism. In order for them to follow us, we must first show that Europe is taking this topic seriously, and will not just limit itself to a 20% reduction.</p>

      <p sl="sk">() In dealing with such a serious issue as climate change, it is necessary for us at the European Parliament to support better communication and a more standardised procedure for identifying appropriate strategic solutions. I believe that the initiative of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety could have involved prior consultations with the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, particularly regarding the energy package of the European Commission. The draft resolution of the Committee on the Environment comes up with new binding objectives that are much more ambitious and yet we are not at all sure whether or how we will meet the goals set out in the existing proposals of the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We all know that it is time to act, since the situation in the area of climate change is indeed serious. I am not going to list those areas of the energy sector where substantial improvements can be achieved as regards CO2 emissions. Expected growth levels will, however, bring forth new ideas concerning the problem of rising demand for energy. There can be no doubt that the development of new energy-generating installations should be based on carbon-free technologies. Renewable sources, which we have so often advocated, and quite justifiably too, will scarcely be able to meet the ever-growing demand. It is therefore difficult to understand why nuclear energy, which generates virtually no CO2 emissions, still finds little support and is mentioned only vaguely in the strategies of the European Commission and the European Union in general, leaving the decisions to the discretion of Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in my one minute of speaking time, I would like to focus on three issues based on my amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety yesterday.</p>
      <p sl="en">Transport is one of the main sources of climate change; road transport uses five times more energy than train transport for the same number of passengers. The same goes for private cars on the one hand and trams and subways on the other hand. That is why public transport should be a priority for us. In a market economy, in a capitalist society, most of these fine goals could be reached by using economic and financial tools. Energy efficiency can be increased only along with a very balanced green tax system.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the longer term, Europe should have a harmonised ecological tax system, because without such a system, our common environmental policy does not have proper tools.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our developed Member States have exported their energy and natural-resource-consuming activities to less-developed countries, exporting greenhouse emissions and environmental damage as well. We must prevent such practices in the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although a lady Member has just said that political problems such as climate protection must not be talked about for too long if there is no solution to them, the opposite is also the case, in that, in politics, you have to take care that problems are not whipped up into the most important problem full stop and into something that presages the end of the world, without, at the end of the day, any solution being offered that really does amount to a change for the better.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also with a certain amount of concern that I see some recent debates being conducted in a way that loses touch with reality, with people talking about storms being caused by changes in climate, even though anyone who reads intelligent meteorology knows that that is not how it works. There are also certain questions that are simply not being asked, or not being answered, for example, why it is that, despite the worldwide increase in the amount of CO2 being generated over the past 120 years, a temperature increase of only 0.3 degrees is being recorded at most locations, and why it was that it was between 1930 and 1960 that there was the greatest increase in storms of the highest category, with a less marked increase over the last four decades? Why is it that we have no explanation for the fact that, even if all the industrialised nations were to reduce their greenhouse gas output by 30%, we would, by 2100, have done no more than delay the warming effect by six years?</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not questioning the need for us to give this problem our urgent attention; I am merely asking whether we are giving it thorough enough consideration and whether we are perhaps sometimes acting precipitately without asking the right questions. We are discussing climate change, security of supply and competitiveness, albeit without weighing up the various points, and instead considering them in terms of what the alternatives are.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why is no serious thought being given to the possibility of deriving 70% of the CO2-free electricity from nuclear power, for, if the protection of the climate is so important, surely all the alternatives have to be considered fearlessly and without ideological presuppositions, and one of those alternatives, in the future, will be nuclear energy. If we are to have this debate at all, it must be conducted on a broad basis, openly, and with the necessary time being set aside for it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I do not doubt that the topic of climate change will occupy us for a long time to come and there is going to be a long timelag between any action taken and the actual effect of turning climate change round.</p>
      <p sl="de">That makes it all the more important that we should get Europe, its policies and the legislation that goes along with them adjusted to this fact and should get something practical done about it, which will of course involve – along with the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol after 2012 – strategies for reducing CO2 emissions in individual sectors, for example, from private motor vehicles, in respect of which we must not only express concerns but also discuss opportunities. Reduced emission of CO2 from motor cars and the associated savings in fuel will have a positive effect on security of energy supply when one bears in mind the fact that road traffic accounts for all of 26.5% of the European Union’s total energy consumption.</p>
      <p sl="de">The special measures already mentioned do not involve reinventing the wheel; other states, Japan among them, have also brought in programmes for reducing the CO2 pumped out by motor cars, which involves vehicles being divided up, in ‘top runner’ programmes, into nine different weight classes and binding targets for reductions being laid down.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to agree with Mrs Doyle that the problem that we are facing is not environmental. It affects all sectors of society and we have to take a systematic and comprehensive approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">To Mr Reul I would like to say that I think we have to realise that parallel to climate change, we are also affected by the depletion of fisheries, huge and rapid deforestation, and water scarcity in many parts of the world. We have to face the fact that the lifestyles that we have developed in a world with 8 to 9 billion people goes beyond the carrying capacity of the globe, and that is why we have to take a systematic approach that brings us back onto a normal, sustainable path.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reason I asked to speak is primarily that I am very disappointed with one aspect of the energy and climate package from the Commission. You talk, Commissioner, in that package, about an energy partnership with Africa. That is good. But why not the same for China and India? I know there are technology agreements, but there is very little money to back them up. In the coming five to ten years, emissions from these countries because of expanding energy systems will totally overwhelm us unless we help them to do the right things now.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some people say ‘let China pay’. But then we disregard the historic responsibility we have for all the emissions in the past and we also disregard the fact that the Chinese need skilled people; they need technology to make it happen; they need to invest in clean technology.</p>
      <p sl="en">So my question to you and to the Minister is, why do you not think big? Why do you not establish a partnership with China and India and beef it up with financial resources so that we can really do this together aggressively? Otherwise I think what we are doing here will be rather marginal in the years to come. We have to have this dual approach, and I feel the omission of this in your energy package is conspicuous.</p>

      <p sl="el">Μember of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to start by thanking everyone who took the floor today for their very positive speeches, which illustrate the extent to which the members of the European Parliament are fully aware of the problem of climate change and this is, of course, also a reflection of public opinion, which has also become very aware of the problem.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to thank the German Presidency, especially Minister Sigmar Gabriel, for the cooperation we have enjoyed, for the way in which he spoke and for the way in which he defends environmental issues and I trust that the German Presidency will perform well and meet the expectations of European citizens and respond to the views expressed here this evening. Climate change is a global challenge and the leading role of the European Union is of decisive importance in addressing it.</p>
      <p sl="el">Today's debate has given us the chance to emphasise the importance of the forthcoming decisions due to be taken in the European Union this week and in coming weeks; these decisions are needed so that international negotiations can commence and so that we can push for an agreement at global level.</p>
      <p sl="el">We must safeguard the credibility of the European Union in the leading role which it plays at global level in addressing climate change and we must send the strongest possible message to our partners in both the developed and the developing world.</p>
      <p sl="el">We must also emphasise the importance of the decisions which need to be taken over the next few years as regards the international regime for climate change – I may come back to this matter later – in order to ensure that even greater efforts are made worldwide after the first period of commitments based on the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="el">The scientific and economic arguments in favour of taking ambitious, global action to address climate change are obvious and incontrovertible. Even greater political effort is needed in order to bring about broader and more fundamental commitments. This is precisely the Commission's objective with the package of measures on climate and energy.</p>
      <p sl="el">The next few years will be of decisive importance in shaping a global framework with the objective of ensuring that irreversible and possibly catastrophic climate change is avoided. The active participation of all of us is needed – and I have seen it here tonight with a great deal of satisfaction – in this dialogue. It is crucial that you support the strong commitment by the European Union for decisive action at both European and international level.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to answer some of the observations that were made tonight.</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, concerning targets, I must repeat that 15 months ago we were not discussing targets. The word ‘target’ was not mentioned. In the European Council Conclusions, the Council mentioned exploring reduction pathways in the range of 15 to 30% with developed countries. It did not occur to anyone to have a unilateral commitment for the European Union. Somebody mentioned that perhaps there is some confusion. I have to make it clear that we have a target, which is 30%, and this is the mandate we are asking the European Council to give to the Commission to negotiate with other developed countries. However, irrespective of this agreement and until such an agreement is reached, we have a unilateral commitment to reduce by 20% the emissions in the European Union. To underline the magnitude of this commitment, I should like to point out that it is more than twice our total obligation. I heard that there is not enough ambition and that we have not exercised leadership by setting this target. No other country in the world is so ambitious – not even California. Governor Schwarzenegger has received much praise. I have been asked why we do not have a similar target to that of Governor Schwarzenegger – a 25% target for 2021, but using 2006 as a basis. Therefore, if you do your calculations, his ambition is less than half of our 20% reduction.</p>
      <p sl="el">Therefore, let me make it clear that we are ambitious, we have to exercise leadership in the world, we have to practice what we preach and our target is really ambitious. Of course, in order to achieve what science tells us, to limit the average increase in temperature on the planet to 2°C, we need a 50% reduction by all the countries in the world by 2050. That goes for the developed countries and the developing countries – a 60-80% reduction by the developed countries and a 30% reduction by the developing countries by 2020. Someone mentioned flexibility: these targets of 20% and 30% are flexible. They are not for all the countries in the European Union, but they will be adjusted according to the burden-sharing agreement that we had a few years ago regarding the achievement of our total target. It should be a similar system.</p>
      <p sl="el">Nairobi was mentioned. Of course, Montreal was different from Nairobi. In Montreal we had a big achievement in the Montreal Action Plan. According to this plan in Nairobi we had certain priorities which were achieved. Mrs Doyle was right when she said they were not ambitious, but it was a step – a bigger or smaller step, but still a step – and the European Union achieved all the priorities it had set, especially in terms of trying to help the least-developed countries to get some of the investments with the usual cut-off and flexible mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mr Wijkman said that we were not ambitious because we do not have a partnership with China or that we have a partnership that we do not finance. The truth is that we have a European Union-China partnership and a European Union-India initiative, and both have specific objectives which will be financed by European Union funds and funds from various Member States of the European Union. Of course they are very important, because, as you said, after 2020 China, India and the other fast developing countries will emit more than all the OECD countries. Therefore it is absolutely necessary to bring them on board so that we can fight climate change together, but according to the common but differentiated principle of the United Nations Convention.</p>
      <p sl="el">I said how important it is to have the participation of China and India and the other fast developing countries. However, it is more important to have the developed countries. Our first objective should be to consider how to bring on board developed countries, like the United States, which emits 25% of the emissions in the world and has not ratified Kyoto. Public opinion in the United States is changing and we are encouraged by the signals we are getting there. However, more work is necessary. In particular, we must strengthen our emissions trading system, because a market-based instrument like this could be the best way to bring the United States on board. Some states in the USA already have an emissions trading system. In the north-east there is an emissions trading system regarding power generation. California and some other western states will be introducing them, and we will cooperate with them in order to have a similar system in order to link the systems together. So the global emissions trading system can be born from the bottom up. In order to do that we need a strong emissions trading system in the European Union, otherwise we cannot argue with them. That is why we need to have national allocation plans that really create scarcity in the market. If I had accepted all the proposed national allocation plans from the Member States, the emissions trading system would have collapsed.</p>
      <p sl="el">You, the Members of the European Parliament, with whom we had a lot of discussion about the emissions trading system, should help to persuade those Member States that have reservations about the national allocation plans. I am going to do my job and I shall assess the national allocation plans as is necessary in order to fight climate change.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is very important to determine what the basic elements are for a future regime. We have to set goals, the means by which we are going to achieve these goals and establish who will be participating in achieving these targets. I spoke about the participants – both developed and developing countries. I must now mention the targets: 2°C is the target. It is essential to keep the commitment made by the European Union. The means are: firstly, the use of the market – a global emissions trading system is necessary; secondly, we need research, technology, development of technology and deployment of technology, as Minister Gabriel mentioned. Therefore we need to make it financially interesting for the economic partners to deploy new technologies. We also need to transfer technology to developing countries and in order to do that we need finance, because without finance it will not be possible.</p>
      <p sl="el">We have the Kyoto flexible mechanism – the CDMs, the joint implementation – but we also need other funds. I am grateful to Minister Gabriel, because when I announced the adoption by the European Union of the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund, he immediately came forward with a significant contribution from Germany. Italy followed, and I hope other countries will do so, because this money is necessary in order to transfer technology to developing countries to enable those countries to be energy efficient and to make efforts in order to fight climate change.</p>
      <p sl="el">Today I heard much about biofuels and second-generation biofuels. I said that today the Commission adopted a very important piece of legislation. However, everybody looked at the cars and not at this piece of legislation. But it is very important! I would say that we would save more carbon dioxide with this directive than with the other one, without saying that cars are not important – they are very important, especially for the future. Having a new car fleet in the European Union is important for fighting climate change.</p>
      <p sl="el">Today’s adoption by the Commission of the fuel quality directive is encouraging sustainable fuels for transport, biofuels, and especially encouraging second-generation biofuels, which are friendly to the environment.</p>
      <p sl="el">On cars, my proposal still stands. My proposal is there, as it was 15 days ago. I am very happy that today the President said that next week we shall be discussing it in the College. We need clean, competitive, affordable cars that will contribute to the fight against climate change. We must protect the consumers, the workers, the public in general and, of course, fight climate change, protect our planet and protect our countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, on Davos, it was very interesting because although there were very important issues to be discussed – Iraq, the Middle East and Doha – a poll revealed that a majority of 57% of the participants who were asked said that the number one issue the world faces today is climate change, which means that the politicians who reflect public opinion have now also had responses from business leaders. The business leaders have joined politicians and public opinion and showed their determination to fight climate change. That is why I ask for your help in adopting the resolution, which would be very helpful for carrying on our proposals.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, honourable Members, there are just a few points on which I would like to enlarge. Many of you have said that we have been talking about climate change for many years without anything actually having happened, but I would ask that we should not underestimate what the Commission has come up with over the last few weeks and not make it out to be less than it is.</p>
      <p sl="de">That the Commission should, for the first time, have devised a joint strategy for securing energy supply and protecting against climate change is something I see as constituting a unique opportunity, and I would point out that, while we have, in the past, as a rule, discussed these two things separately, we now have a joint strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning to Mrs Harms among others, let me ask this: just what were the most important proposals that you criticised earlier? The first package dealt with energy efficiency. It is not just a case of the European Union being able, given increased energy efficiency by 2020, to save EUR 100 billion that are urgently needed for consumers, for investments in research, development and other things that are on our agenda, for increasing energy efficiency by 20% means that we are spared 780 million tonnes of CO2 – double the amount we wanted to save in Europe under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p sl="de">Energy efficiency does not often lend itself so well to big ideological and political debates as, for example nuclear power. Energy efficiency is often about many small issues that one has to monitor, keep an eye on, and keep on moving forward, but it does offer the greatest opportunities not only for secure energy supply but also for climate protection.</p>
      <p sl="de">I regard the Commission’s proposals on this subject as an excellent package, and would be glad if we – quite apart from all the great banner headlines – were to give at least as much thought to the issue of how we can actually implement the many individual programmes contained in this package, both as a matter of Community policy and in the policies of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the motor industry’s 120 grams of CO2 emitted per kilometre are of course part of the theme of greater energy efficiency, but, returning to your earlier question as to how it is to be ensured that a proportionate amount of biofuel is also taken into account, I can say that we are together putting the case for Europe’s oil industry to move on from the present proportion of 5.75% biofuels to be mixed in, to a substantially greater percentage. The Commission is proposing 10%, and some Member States see an even higher percentage as feasible. As I see it, 12.5% or 15% ought not to be beyond the bounds of possibility as an effective means of ensuring that, in the European Union, no oil gets on to the market and into the petrol pumps unless it contains a specified proportion of biofuels.</p>
      <p sl="de">I see that as an absolute necessity, firstly in order, in this area too, to make us less dependent on oil and gas imports, secondly to ensure that we become less affected by international price increases, and thirdly, in order to make the most important contribution to reducing the output of CO2 as a result of the fuels we consume.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second major area is, of course, that of renewable energies, so can we please not act as if it were already self-evident in the European Union that all Member States would accept as a single goal what the Commission is proposing, namely that primary energy consumption in Europe should be 20% renewable? There is a long road to travel before we get that far. What I would ask your House to do is to help us and the Commission get a majority for this target at the spring summit of the Heads of State or Government, for I regard it as one of the most important that we have to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Grossetête, who had asked me for an answer on the subject of nuclear power, is unfortunately no longer in the Chamber, so perhaps you would tell her from me that, if nuclear power accounts for 15% of Europe’s end-user energy consumption, it makes little sense to concentrate only on that 15%, for, if we did that, 85% would be unaffected.</p>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps I might add that, if you want to make yourself less dependent on oil and gas imports in order to have motor vehicles emitting less in the way of CO2, you will hardly be able to offer nuclear power as an alternative unless we in Europe can agree to drive only electric cars. I do not exactly see that happening any time soon. That is why concentrating on renewable energies, as the Commission proposes, is very definitely the right way to go. That will of course have to involve a burden-sharing arrangement, with every country in Europe having to take on a certain percentage and thus make it possible for the 20% target for primary energy consumption to be achieved by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me conclude by mentioning two areas in which we are a long way away from achieving any real breakthrough. Many of you have pointed to the emerging economies of such countries as China, India and Brazil – set to produce a great deal of emissions in the future – and argued that we need to get them on board where the reduction of CO2 is concerned, by means of undertakings that may well be voluntary, but better still mandatory, and you are right to do so, but we will not be able to do that in the absence of technological solutions that we can offer them as a means towards growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">Whether the European Union opts for 30, 20, 40 or 10 per cent is completely irrelevant; the only way we will have a chance of getting these countries on board is to offer them technologies that they can use to provide themselves with energy, that will guarantee them growth while not, at the same time, damaging the climate in the way it hitherto has been in the industrialised nations, and we are a long way away from doing that. Despite the good initiative from the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund, despite the willingness to transfer technology by way of ‘clean development mechanism’ projects under the Kyoto Protocol, that which is on offer is far from enough.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore say that, if you want to find out just how differently the European Union and the developing countries think about these things, you should go and participate in international talks from time to time.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we start talking about how to deal with climate change, our opposite numbers in the developing countries take that to mean that their former colonial masters are coming along and trying to inhibit their economic development. When we go to Brazil and talk about how to protect the rainforest – one object of that being to stop putting so much CO2 into the atmosphere, and another being to maintain the forest’s natural capacity for absorbing it – the answer we get from officials is ‘you have not yet got used to the idea that these are our rainforests; it is we who decide what happens to them, and not the old colonial states in Europe, who are again trying to tell us what to do’. That is how far we actually are from any sort of common understanding of what protecting the climate is about, and common ground on this point is very difficult to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="de">A number of you have said that we need to practise self-denial; I presume that they mean that the people of Europe have to deny themselves prosperity and other things. I do not think that they need to do that, yet all the same, we, in the industrialised states, must declare ourselves willing to return some of the benefits we have gained over the past few hundred years from our former colonies, some of the wealth we have accumulated at the cost of their poverty, to those states, not least in order to give them answers to their questions as to how they can drive forward their own economic and social development without damaging the climate.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is the sort of self-denial we are talking about – not the renunciation of prosperity for ourselves, but abandoning the idea that all the wealth we in Europe and in other industrialised states have worked to create should be kept by us for us alone.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will have to make some of this wealth available in order to fund technological developments and technology transfers, along with the things that need to be done to adapt to the climate change that is already happening. That is the second thing that the developing countries demand of the industrialised nations; before they become willing to talk with us about limiting their CO2 output while still pursuing growth, they want to see us showing ourselves willing to repair the damage already done in them by climate change and to help them to adapt to it.</p>
      <p sl="de">We now possess a fund intended to be valued at EUR 300 million – perhaps more – by 2012, with the intention of funding adaptation measures around the world. Is there anyone in this Chamber who actually believes that EUR 300 million will really be enough to get the world as a whole adjusted to climate change? That amount is approximately equivalent to the budgets of two medium-sized towns in my own country, and it is far from being enough.</p>
      <p sl="de">Those are the two questions that are put to us. We are not being asked whether we, in Europe, are willing to make cutbacks of 20%, 30% or 40%; we are being asked what we are doing to facilitate real transfers of technology to their countries in order to enable them to achieve growth while at the same time avoiding doing harm to the climate, and, secondly, what we are doing to fund adaptation in those countries to the climate change for which we are responsible. Those are the answers we have to give if we want to get China, Brazil and India – who will account for so much future output – on our side.</p>
      <p sl="de">Like Commissioner Dimas, I am convinced that America will sign up to an agreement that works; whether that agreement is called Kyoto or something else remains to be seen, but what the USA will do is participate in a functioning market, in a functioning emissions trading system, and in climate protection schemes that actually work.</p>
      <p sl="de">For as long as no answers to these questions are forthcoming from us, the Americans – no matter who is in power there – will find it easy not to sign up to binding undertakings.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make a second comment in response to the Austrian Member who said, ‘Well roared, lion!’, and to Mrs Harms, who said, ‘enough words have been bandied back and forth, now is the time for some action.’ I believe that nothing like enough has yet been said, and if Mrs Harms wants evidence of that, she only needs to look around this Chamber or at the Bundestag back home in Germany.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we are convinced that climate change really is a challenge to the human race, why, then, can we not, in the national parliaments, get those Members who speak up in debates about health service reform, the labour market, foreign policy and peacemaking, to get worked up about climate change?</p>
      <p sl="de">Why, then, have we not managed to get the Members who were in this Chamber earlier to vote to stay here and take part in this debate, to get angry about what the Commission or the Council say, to come up with their own proposals, to express their agreement or disagreement, to make criticisms or contribute to debate?</p>
      <p sl="de">We are far from having engaged the voting public to the degree to which we should have done, for if we had, there would be unanimity on these various issues in the Member States. Let us then be careful with assertions about there having been enough talking; I believe we still have some way to go before we have convinced those who need to be won over if difficult decisions are to get majority backing. It is not enough to convince the environmental policy experts, and, indeed, some of them in our Member States have yet to be won over. I am not particularly inclined to tell other people what they have to do; we have quite enough to do in my own country, and I suspect that I am not alone in thinking this.</p>

We must also look at strengthening our emissions trading scheme and seeking to extend it to other parts of the world.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The fact that we are meeting to debate climate change at exactly the same time as international experts are meeting in Paris to discuss climate change and the consequences thereof sends out a strong message.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Global warming is not a figment of the imagination of a few publicity-seeking scientists and politicians; it is a reality that we must now come to terms with.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is up to us as lawmakers to draw up rules aimed at limiting the impact of climate change. This is what the Commission's proposal to include aviation in the emissions trading scheme is designed to do, and there are other such cases. This legislation is necessary if we are to offset the impact of the dramatic rise in air transport.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must, however, pay careful attention to the way in which we decide to implement this mechanism, because this is not about undermining European airlines or holding back air transport, but about reducing the impact of air transport on climate change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, in order for our efforts to have genuine impact on CO2 emissions, I would like to see the Union also enact laws on other means of transport, not least in the car industry.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As we know, the Commission recently proposed a package of measures on energy and a number of targets on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy, thereby affirming their desire to combat climate change and to foster energy security and EU competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission has now come to this Chamber to restate these objectives and targets, highlighting an international agreement on the post-2012 framework and the target of a 30% reduction in emissions in developing countries. Accordingly, the EU must immediately undertake to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% and to implement practical, energy-specific measures.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the possibility remains open – unsurprisingly – of emissions trading, which especially affects the more economically fragile countries that do not have the money to buy emissions rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Whilst there are some welcome proposals in the area of emissions reductions and renewable energy, there is another set of proposals that would be difficult to implement given the stringent requirements placed on the different countries, knowing the opposition, that is, the USA. Most importantly, however, all of this must not be taken as an opportunity for more liberalisation and further concentration in the area of energy, and the further domination of the most powerful countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">We are speaking as though the debate is over, and the threat of catastrophic global warming is real. Yet there are many climatologists who take a different view. They believe that current changes are within the normal historic range, and that predictions of future warming are exaggerated and alarmist.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, whatever our view on climate change, energy security demands that we reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. We can no longer rely on Russia, the Middle East, Nigeria and Venezuela for energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">While we must develop renewables, and enhance energy conservation, there is only one non-carbon technology which can provide the continuous, reliable base-load power we need to drive economic growth, and that technology is nuclear.</p>

      <p sl="it">It seems strange, but precisely on the 50th anniversary of the European project, and at a time of political deadlock due to the failure of the Constitution, the difficulties in relation to enlargement and the estrangement that a section of the European population is reporting, we have the opportunity, armed as we are with far more adequate economic, technological and political instruments, to relaunch the process with practical proposals, by reviving and adapting to everyday needs the idea behind the European process: that of combining our efforts and aims to achieve a sufficiently independent and sustainable energy supply. Economic development, as well as the health of our citizens and of our environment, will depend on this, just as it did 50 years ago. Furthermore, thanks to the role that it now plays at international level, the European Union can also influence the world’s political stability and serve as an example for those fledgling economies that are booming economically but are not yet aware of the consequences that that entails.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, we now turn from such fundamentally demanding issues as energy and climate change to discuss another very important matter that has, in the past, demanded your attention here in the European Parliament, and also that of the European Union as a whole not merely on one occasion but repeatedly, and the issue to which I refer is that of the sharing of airline passengers’ personal data.</p>
      <p sl="de">As we all know, following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the United States enacted legislation according to which airlines running flights into and out of the United States must permit the US authorities electronic access to the data in their automatic reservation and processing systems, the material known as ‘passenger name records’, and, should the airlines decline to comply, they are threatened with the withdrawal of their landing rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would now like to briefly remind the House of the state of play. In May 2006, the European Court of Justice had, in response to an appeal by your House, declared null and void the Council decision on the agreement between the European Community and the USA relating to the forwarding of passenger data to the US authorities and, likewise, the Commission’s decision on the appropriateness of the data protection measures.</p>
      <p sl="de">The ECJ’s fundamental justification for its decision was the European Community’s lack of power to conclude any such agreement, since it was not within the sphere of the first pillar. It had nothing to say about the material question of whether the data was sufficiently protected.</p>
      <p sl="de">As you will be aware, negotiations with the USA on a successor agreement proved to be highly problematic, but it was nevertheless eventually possible to conclude them with an interim agreement due to expire on 3 July this year, which is on the basis of the third pillar and of the USA’s undertaking given in respect of data protection, which had already been taken as a basis to the earlier agreement between the European Community and the United States.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the beginning of January 2007, the Commission made a recommendation to the Council to the effect that it should approve the commencement of negotiations with the USA on a new passenger data agreement that should replace the present interim one. The EU’s negotiating mandate for the Council Presidency, which the Commission endorses, was today discussed by COREPER, and the prospect is that the Council will adopt a resolution on the subject and lay down negotiating guidelines in February.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is likely that the negotiations on a new passenger name record agreement will prove to be extremely difficult, since there is no evidence of any interest on the part of the United States in improving data protection. Indeed, it seems far more likely that they will claim that their undertaking in respect of data protection no longer applies. The conclusion of an agreement is, however, essential in terms of the standard of data protection that is to be guaranteed and in the interests of the European Union, for, in the absence of an agreement, the airlines would be under great pressure to pass on the passenger data in order not to risk losing their right to land in the USA.</p>
      <p sl="de">The German Presidency of the Council will, with the Commission’s support, be pressing for a legally watertight arrangement that secures the protection of data, taking the interests of the passengers and of the airlines into account and maintaining a high level of security, and I would like to stress that it is, in this, taking due account of the positions of your House as expressed in the relevant resolutions of September last year on data protection, on the combating of terrorism, and also on the defence of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">This subject also brings me to speak in response to the oral questions put to me by Mrs Berès and Mr Cavada on the subject of SWIFT. The Council wishes to thank them for their interest in this dossier, in relation to which it has already had the opportunity to answer questions from your House’s Members on various occasions. As regards my answers to these questions, I would refer the honourable Members to my statement.</p>
      <p sl="de">In December 2006, the Council informed the Members that the questions they had raised demanded careful examination; the Council is still engaged in doing this, and its inquiries have not yet been completed. In the remainder of this speech, I shall be endeavouring, on behalf of the Council, to answer the various questions put to me by Members of your House, although all the matters to which I can refer are still subject to the Council’s inquiries.</p>
      <p sl="de">In a speech in July 2006, the Finnish minister for European affairs, as the then President-in-Office of the Council, announced to the plenary that the Council was not at that time able to confirm press reports of an exchange of information between SWIFT and the American authorities. She reminded your House that finding out what had actually happened was a matter for the national authorities, and went on to state that the European Union was then, and would in future be, prepared to act if it turned out that events made legislation at the European level necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">As I have already mentioned, the Council and the Commission are currently still engaged in examining every aspect and every issue of potential relevance to this dossier, while also taking the outcomes from the data protection group into consideration. The Presidency is giving thought to how the work on this at Council level might be organised, and will, in so doing, take account of what emerges from the current investigations, but what I can tell you is that no new group has as yet been appointed with this purpose in mind.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since investigations are still ongoing, the Council is at present unable to answer the question as to whether these matters will impact Regulation 1781 of 15 November 2006 on the information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds. The Council has no knowledge of whether or not the Commission is considering submitting any proposal for the amendment of this Regulation, but I am sure that we will learn that when the Commission makes its statement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Under the Treaty, it is the Commission’s function to monitor the implementation of Community law in the Member States and to take appropriate action as and when a Member State fails to discharge its obligations under EC law.</p>
      <p sl="de">Reference has also been made to the ‘automated targeting system’, an American system affecting the transport of freight and persons within the United States and from and into them. Whether data obtained from SWIFT have been fed into this system is one of the questions currently being examined.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it stated that an international framework for combating terrorism was already in place, the data protection group was referring to the working party on fighting money laundering and the funding of terrorism and the recommendations made by it. The Council believes that good work is being done within this framework, although it has to be said that this group’s recommendations are addressed to banks and financial institutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">While I am on this subject, I would like to stress – speaking on the Council’s behalf – that SWIFT cannot be regarded as a financial institution for this working party’s purposes and that the Financial Action Task Force framework is therefore not directly applicable, except possibly to certain specific aspects. That concludes the Presidency’s statement on behalf of the Council.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I shall begin by addressing PNR. As you all know, the temporary agreement concluded in October with the United States will expire by the end of July this year, in a few months’ time. There is therefore the need to negotiate a very solid and stable legal framework which will enable the exchange of PNR data with the United States with full respect of data protection and privacy rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Presidency of the Council just said, the Commission has recommended to the Council that it authorise the Presidency, assisted by the Commission, to open negotiations on the basis of a set of negotiation directives. I am confident that these recommendations will be examined very soon. I personally strongly hope that by mid-February we will get a negotiating mandate to open this very difficult exercise.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is recommending to the Council to strive for full respect of fundamental rights, notably the right to privacy. I have said on a number of occasions that the right to privacy is for me non-negotiable. It has to be respected, fully and completely. Legal certainty is also an important element for air-carriers. It must be taken into account, as it has been from the very beginning. As I have already stressed in this Parliament several times, the Commission is committed to continuing to give due consideration to privacy on the one hand and legal security on the other, as they form key principles of this file, without forgetting the importance of preventing and fighting terrorism and related transnational crimes. The negotiations for a new agreement with the United States on PNR data are a key priority for the Commission, and for me personally, and I understand from what the Presidency of the Council just said that it shares this view. I warmly welcome the close cooperation between the Commission and the Council Presidency, which is crucial if we want to succeed, if we want to speak with one voice. On my side, of course, as usual, I will keep Parliament informed as this work progresses. You know very well that, as it was in the past, for me it will be a political commitment, though this document – for example, the negotiating recommendations – once approved will be classified as EU-restricted.</p>
      <p sl="en">The negotiations will present a real challenge for Europe. It will require imagination; it will require a lot of common effort from all the EU institutions and from the United States as well in order to reach a very robust, solid solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would like to see, for example, this Parliament, together with the United States Congress – following the political phases of this very difficult exercise – making, perhaps for the first time, a joint political commitment which would be particularly useful for the ongoing negotiations. However, it is up to you to decide.</p>
      <p sl="it">I shall now refer, ladies and gentlemen, to the SWIFT matter, which has also been addressed by the Presidency. You will recall that a few weeks ago, before the Christmas holidays, I informed the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that the SWIFT case needed to be addressed from a European perspective, and I said on that occasion that we would begin an exploratory dialogue with the US authorities in order to address both the general issue of data protection and the specific issues raised by the use of SWIFT data by the US Treasury.</p>
      <p sl="it">You will probably be aware that these informal, yet important, discussions have already begun. I am in favour of finding a European solution to addressing this issue, a European solution that ought, in my opinion, to include clear rules and precise guarantees, which the US Treasury should endorse and include in its documents. In other words, the two points at stake are, as ever, legal protection for personal data that are transferred and legal certainty for all parties concerned and, I must say, legal certainty for banks, too, for, as the Presidency has clearly highlighted, SWIFT is not a bank.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is quite clear, then, that when I talk about guarantees from the US authorities, I intend to specify in which circumstances, for what purpose and by whom these data may be known and used. I would say right away that it must be made clear that the purpose is restricted solely to terrorism investigations and thus to preventing the funding of terrorism, so that we avoid the, albeit indirect, risk of such data being misused, for example for economic espionage purposes.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is also clear that there seems to be a need for a further restriction, and that is to link the use of these data to research on specific individuals who are suspected of terrorist activity. In other words, there should be no non-specific transfers of data without suspects who warrant further investigation having first been identified.</p>
      <p sl="it">You are aware of the letter that I wrote to all of the Member States in November asking for information about the conditions under which their banks use personal data through SWIFT. Only seven Member States have so far replied to my request for clarification. This is unfortunate, and I will obviously be asking for a reason in certain cases: in the specific case of Italy, for example, it has requested more time to respond. In other cases, there has simply been no response.</p>
      <p sl="it">From the seven responses that I have actually received – although no general conclusions can be drawn from them because too few Member States have responded – it emerges that banks normally use personal data for the sole purpose of executing payment orders and that they were not informed, in such cases, of the fact that personal data are transferred to the US Treasury by SWIFT. Therefore, the general response given is simply that they are not aware of the fact that someone, namely SWIFT, transfers data after having received it from them. However, it has emerged – but you already knew this – that, in many cases, central banks had been informed precisely by the US Treasury of the transfer of data from SWIFT Europe to SWIFT United States and from SWIFT United States to the US Treasury.</p>
      <p sl="it">You are aware that actions and further investigations are being carried out by the national data protection authorities with the aim of shedding some light on the issue and of finding out whether, apart from the Belgian case, which is now well known, there are other specific cases in which national data protection authorities can open a file and thus start proceedings. Clearly, as soon as I have some information in this regard, I will pass it on to you, as I have done in the past.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is a specific question concerning the possibility of applying the Automated Targeting System to SWIFT data. On the basis of the technical explanations given to me, it would appear impossible or highly unlikely for the system in question to have been used for processing SWIFT data, for the simple reason that it is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which relates to the protection of borders and thus to the movement of people passing through the US. It was not surprising that the European Parliament asked about the application of this mechanism to PNR data. SWIFT data are in a totally different category because they come under a different administration, which is the Treasury.</p>
      <p sl="it">The question submitted also asks whether the Commission is aware of other examples of US authorities requesting data from private parties in this sector. I have no information on that, and so I cannot answer that question. There is no doubt, however, that, while the fight against the funding of terrorism is a vital instrument for preventing terrorism, this fight cannot undermine or limit a fundamental right, such as that of customers to have their personal financial data protected. As you know, one of the violations uncovered by the Belgian authorities and the European Committee for privacy protection is precisely the lack of prior information for customers, which coincides with what the banks said, since they had not been informed of these transfers either.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that there are two reasons why we need to work towards a European instrument. Firstly, we cannot limit or destroy our Euro-Atlantic collaboration in relation to the fight against terrorism: that would be a serious mistake, which I believe the European Union should avoid making. Secondly, we must also point out to our American friends that it is in everyone’s interests for fundamental rights and the protection of personal data to be scrupulously adhered to. If, by virtue of having a European instrument, we succeed in doing the same thing that we are trying to do with the PNR – even though the two issues are very different, the principle is the same – and find a European solution that prevents differences in treatment between one EU Member State and another in relation to the United States, I believe that it will be possible to strengthen the European Union’s negotiating power and to demonstrate at the same time that our aim is to strengthen the Euro-Atlantic link, not to weaken it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Enriched by the lessons of the case of passenger name records (PNR), we should be able to make quicker progress when it comes to SWIFT. I should like, if I may, Mr Gloser, to correct you on one point. I believe that this is the first time we have held a specific debate on SWIFT here in the Chamber, and this is no doubt in the normal course of things, but I do hope this debate will enable us to make progress.</p>
      <p sl="fr">SWIFT is not an undertaking that operates solely in Europe or solely between Europe and the United States. It operates everywhere. To put it simply, after September 11 the nature of relations between SWIFT and the US authorities changed beyond all recognition, and we are now seeing the consequences not only in terms of data protection for the EU but also in terms of the balance that should be struck between data protection, the fight against terrorism, the security of payment systems and protection against economic espionage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has acknowledged that there is a problem and has begun to put forward proposals. In a recent letter addressed to Mr Cavada and me, the Central Bank also recognised that the time had come to enter new phases, without going too far in the proposals. This confirmed what it had said to us at the hearing, which, unfortunately, neither the Council nor the Commission saw fit to attend. The Central Bank had told us at the hearing that it bore very little responsibility for what had happened in the case, and the letter partly confirms that view.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Reading the memorandum concluded between SWIFT and the US Treasury in April 2004, it is very clear that there was awareness of the data protection issues involved in the manner in which SWIFT transferred information to the US Treasury. Just as a train driver bears some responsibility for his train and the post office bears some responsibility for what it carries, SWIFT must bear some responsibility for the data it passes on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The key point here, following the hearing held jointly by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs last October, is the briefing of the ‘Article 29’ working group which, on 22 November 2006, clearly confirmed our concerns, namely that, in the SWIFT case, data that should manifestly not have been concealed from the US authorities had in fact been concealed and that, accordingly, the 1995 Directive had not been complied with.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should like to thank the Commissioner for taking the initiative of calling on the Member States to rectify, without delay, the issue of non-compliance with the 1995 Directive, but, as he himself also said, the results up to now have been quite poor. The European Central Bank, for its part, has heeded the lesson that it should demand customer consent. That remains a very prudent thing do.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards this last question, there are two points we must raise. The first is the nature of transatlantic relations and the manner in which data are used in something of a spirit of free, unbridled competition on the US side, and, on the European side – we have experience of this in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – sometimes with a degree of naivety.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One would like to think that these data are used solely for the purposes of combating terrorism. We dare to hope so, but we have no proof. Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if there is a message that, I believe, Parliament would like to convey to you when you hold talks with the Americans on the issue, it is that the purpose of the talks must not be to validate the current state of affairs as regards the transfer of data via SWIFT. It should be to ensure that the level of data protection and the concept of data protection itself that we have here in the EU are respected and accepted. Everything leads me to think that the task facing us in this area is a tough one, but you can count on Parliament’s unwavering support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Just one more minute, Mr President, to address the last aspect, which is the issue of the status of SWIFT. As SWIFT is a Belgian company, we are always being referred back to the Belgian State. That being said, the fact that SWIFT is a Belgian company is because we are in a legal vacuum. It is clear that SWIFT is doing a job that should really be done by a European-level body, overseen by a European supervisory body. I believe that in this area too, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you need to proceed on the basis of new information. Parliament is once again ready to discuss this matter, but we cannot accept the current state of the debate.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, there is an expression in French to describe the surreal confusion of an institution when it finds itself faced with an unexpected situation. We say that it behaves ‘comme une poule qui a trouvé un révolver [like a chicken that has found a revolver]’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Frankly, Mr Gloser, without wishing to underestimate you, the least we can say is that your position on this matter is extremely disappointing. I therefore feel entitled to remind you that your mandate is to defend European sovereignty, something of which I have seen little sign so far. As you will have appreciated, we are therefore disappointed and above all worried.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will talk firstly about PNR data. In a few month’s time, as we know, as you have said and as Mr Frattini has pointed out, the interim agreement on air passenger data will expire. We have no clear information on how it is working. I would also like to point out that when the previous agreement was annulled by the Court, it was based on an assessment of the adequacy of data protection in the United States. This is not the case with the agreement in force, however, even though this assessment is required by the protocol to Convention 108 of the Council of Europe, which is binding on the Member States and hence directly, or at least indirectly, on the European institutions. Having a dubious basis, the agreement has not so far been properly implemented, since the data transmission system that should have been in operation since 2004, the ‘push’ system, is not yet operational, and that is despite the announcements made, most notably last September.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a spirit of cooperation, I would like to ask certain questions publicly. Firstly, I wonder whether the Commission should have applied more pressure in order to ensure that the ‘push’ system was implemented by the airlines and electronic reservation centres that it monitors. Secondly, I wonder whether effective information for air passengers should have been demanded with regard to the use of their personal data for security purposes, in the same way that information campaigns have been carried out on rights in the event of delays or flight cancellations, for example.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For our part, with regard to this dossier, we are awaiting clarification from the Commission and, above all, from the US authorities on a number of points. I shall mention two of these. First of all, we do not understand why, in order to fight terrorism and organised crime, it should be necessary to have all thirty-four pieces of data listed in the PNR and not just the nineteen pieces of data that Parliament and the data protection authorities had deemed sufficient for that purpose.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, how can it be that European citizens and passengers could have been classified as dangerous for years, unbeknownst to them, without us demanding anything in return?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall now turn to the SWIFT system. This second issue is even more delicate and it concerns the American authorities' access to data relating to financial transfers. My fellow Members have already dealt with a number of points. I shall therefore just express the views of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. At stake here is the protection of our citizens’ fundamental rights and the credibility of our partnership with the United States. It is really incomprehensible that no reciprocal arrangements have been proposed in order to negotiate with a partner, even if it is a friend. Will we one day act in the same way with another partner to the east of our borders, Russia? I would therefore like to say that European sovereignty is not being respected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In agreement with the political groups, therefore, I have taken the initiative to invite the competent committees of the American Congress and I am awaiting a response.</p>
      <a text="(The President asked the speaker to conclude)"/>
      <p sl="fr">I understand perfectly well that Parliament’s timing is extremely important, and since I am confident that my colleagues will say everything else that needs to be said, I will stop there.

      <p sl="sl">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is working towards consistent compliance with the acquis communitaire and all the documents that uphold the values of European civilisation and protect the freedom and personal integrity of each individual. We are opposed to any unlawful conduct which restricts such freedoms and works against the individual.</p>

For this reason we believe that any intrusion into personal privacy should be kept to a minimum and be conducted on a legal basis.

So, please allow me to put to you the following questions:</p>
      <p sl="sl">First, I would like a detailed answer as to which data held in the SWIFT System are available to the US authorities and which data are they entitled to access on that basis?</p>
      <p sl="sl">Second, do the US authorities have access to all the transactions carried out in SWIFT branches in the USA, and can they, through these or other SWIFT branches, also gain access to transactions carried out outside the USA?</p>
      <p sl="sl">Third, I would like to ask the Commission, the Council and the European Personal Data Ombudsman whether accessing the data held in the SWIFT System represents a violation of the provisions on data protection and, consequently, an illegal intrusion into personal privacy.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Fourth, at the October hearing we did not get any convincing or sufficiently clear answers on the competence of institutions with respect to SWIFT. So I would like to ask who is actually competent to rule on the SWIFT issue and on what legal basis?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the controversy surrounding the transmission of personal and banking data by SWIFT to the US law enforcement authorities and the judgment on the EU/US agreement regarding PNR data have demonstrated the urgent need to draw up a global framework for the transmission and protection of personal data within the context of trans-Atlantic relations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe understands the United States’ increased need for security and we want to enhance our cooperation with our American partners with a view to fighting terrorism effectively. Having said that, it is also essential to deal with the protection of fundamental rights and privacy within the framework of trans-Atlantic dialogue. We are in favour of reaching a new PNR agreement, but it must be respectful of fundamental rights and provide guarantees on the protection of European citizens’ privacy. That is why we want the Commission to communicate to us the details of the proposed mandate for the negotiation of this new agreement. The European Parliament must be fully involved in this process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Could you also provide us with more information on the work of the high-level working group on the sharing and protection of data? We would also like to know about the priority proposals recently put forward by our American partners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to SWIFT, the Belgian data protection authorities and the ‘Article 29’ Working Group believe that this transmission represents a violation of the Belgian and European rules on the protection of personal data. So far, no concrete solution has been proposed to put an end to this violation. All of the actors involved agree that it is urgent that a European solution be found, a solution that is respectful of fundamental rights and which companies can implement properly. The European institutions must ensure that the payment system in the European Union, provided by SWIFT, complies with the Community legislation on data protection.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We would therefore ask the Council and the Commission what measures have been taken to resolve this problem. Are there plans to negotiate an international agreement, similar to the PNR agreement? You tell us that the Commission has held a dialogue with the American Treasury department with a view to finding a solution. Can you tell us what solutions have been studied? Furthermore, at our last debate on the same subject, you informed us, Mr Frattini, that a questionnaire would be sent to the Member States in order obtain all possible information on this transfer of information. Have you really received all of the necessary replies and how are you going to follow up on that questionnaire?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, in 2006, within the codecision procedure, Parliament adopted its Alvaro report on the regulation stipulating the personal data that must accompany transfers of funds and under what conditions. The transfer to a third country of banking data that does not have a specific link with that country clearly falls outside of the scope of the regulation and may represent a breach of the fundamental principles of data protection.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the same reason, given that the transfer of the SWIFT data does not just involve data relating to transactions between Europe and the United States, but also data relating to transactions within the European Union, it would appear to be clear that this issue belongs in the first pillar. An agreement pursuant to Articles 24 and 38 of the European Union Treaty would not be an appropriate solution. We cannot accept an agreement to legalise current violations on a case by case basis. SWIFT has no legal obligation to use a mirror site in the United States. Would it not be possible to find a solution in another country in order to move that mirror site to one that contains European data, as the ‘Article 29’ Working Group suggested?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, SWIFT, PNR, and also the Automated Targeting System, ATS, and perhaps in the future telephone data, demonstrate that the exchange of information is intensifying and the urgent need to draw up a common framework for protecting the privacy of European citizens. Do you not believe that the European Union should take a global approach to these issues, in order to establish general principles for the transmission and protection of data with our American partners.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am always very touched when I hear how attached the Council and the Commission are to involving Parliament, because it is indeed true that in the area of counter-terrorism policies, the decision-making is profoundly undemocratic because it totally excludes the European Parliament, and national parliaments are only very partially involved.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore I would have a solution to offer you, and that is not just to make solemn pledges here before the House, but to actually consult Parliament on a voluntary basis on the mandate for negotiations on PNR and SWIFT, because that would not only lend democratic legitimacy to such a mandate: it would also actually strengthen your negotiating position, because frankly, although I have a high appreciation for the officials who do the actual negotiations, I think matters of such importance should have a political mandate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I fully agree with the remarks made by Mrs Roure on the need for global standards on data protection. People who think that we are anti-American are wrong. I have actually seen how attached the Americans are to their privacy laws, which are very good, and how critical they are when the public authorities do not respect the rules on privacy. So I think we should take their critical attitude as an example.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to know if Commission and Council are aware of other categories of data being accessed by the US authorities, not only passenger data and SWIFT data, but also, for example, telecommunications records and insurance company or social security records, and if not by the US authorities, by other countries. If you are not aware of this, maybe you should start investigating.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to PNR, SWIFT and ATS, I will not repeat here all the expectations that we have of the PNR negotiating mandate. That has been said already. But I would like to know why the Commission and the Council did not bother to insist on a second joint evaluation of the implementation of the PNR agreement before agreeing on a new negotiating mandate. Would it not make sense to first evaluate how this one works and how effective it has been before we start talking about the next one?</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to know what the state of play is with regard to the switch from push to pull, which was scheduled for December 2005, then for December 2006. It is now January 2007. Where are we on this point?</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to know what the state of play is with regard to information to passengers. I have been travelling myself lately and I could not get any information on the matter.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to know on what basis the European Commission will actually be negotiating an agreement on SWIFT.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, with regard to ATS, you get a letter from the Department of Homeland Security saying, ‘Do not worry, we comply with the PNR agreement as we understand it’. I am not a lawyer, but I think that is rather a funny formulation. It does not reassure me and I would like further reassurances about profiling and data-mining. Does it take place? I should like to know about the discrepancy with regard to storage periods and about purpose limitation. What other data are being fed into this and what are the exceptions as regards the privacy act?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this extensive legal-political debate involves the fundamental issue of European sovereignty, as the chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has also rightly pointed out. Consequently, there is a factor that has not yet been referred to that should not be left out, which is the statements made by the highest US authorities; I do not think they have been challenged, but they are worth mentioning.</p>
      <p sl="it">The SWIFT system, which we are analysing in relation to European law, has certainly had the merit of cutting short some atrocious terrorist initiatives; it has made it possible to uncover or has helped to identify the perpetrators of the London bombings in July 2005; and it has at least led to the capture of key players, such as the terrorist Hambali, who seems to have been the brains behind the Bali bombing in October 2002. It should certainly also be said that the publicity surrounding this procedure has, in all likelihood, led many terrorists to give up using such methods.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the other hand, it is undeniable that, when the SWIFT society was faced with a contract involving both European law and US law, it confined itself to negotiating data protection mechanisms with the US Treasury Department without obtaining further safeguards.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is a problem that must be addressed, as is the problem of the European Central Bank’s role and responsibility. The ECB had been informed about the issue right from the start, and it played a leading role in this instrument – I shall not go into the matter of its transparency. Before the Committee on Civil Liberties, the ECB, through its president, Mr Trichet, sheltered behind the confidentiality agreement among the ten banks and also claimed that it had not been able to give SWIFT its blessing because that was not within its power.</p>
      <p sl="it">What, then, we wonder, are the powers of the ECB if it does not have power in a situation like this one? This is a very important point, and I think we will have to thoroughly re-examine the ECB and its transparency.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I still feel that we are very much running behind the facts. When it became evident that the United States collected credit card data, as well as other personal data from our passengers, it was a scandal, and we as MEPs wanted a regulation in place, and in most cases, the governments did not want anything, except that if rules were broken, they wanted this to be done quietly; eventually they were forced into a form of action. With SWIFT, we saw a repeat of past events: the government mounted a low-level investigation, which will hopefully culminate in some sort of action, and the question is indeed: are we now entirely convinced that this is it? The Commission is quite clear-cut when it says that although it is not in any event aware of any developments, it does not rule them out either. I should like a response from the Council to this. Do you consider it conceivable and what will you do now to know for certain? We are always saying that we are partners with the United States, which is true, for that is what we are, and we have a great deal of work to do. This also means, though, that you are entitled to know what your friends are getting up to. I would therefore like to find out from the Council how it intends to address the issue in order to know exactly what data are being collected of our citizens in all kinds of areas.</p>
      <p sl="nl">According to the Council, it is hard to conclude a fresh agreement, because the United States is not so keen on this data protection. There is, however, a limit to the level of blackmail we are willing to accept. You cannot say that we have to reach agreement, at any cost, if at a given moment in time, the price we need to pay is too high. It could, in fact, be quite funny, once we have sunk as low as we can, to draw the line at some point. This may imperil the landing rights, but will, at the same time mobilise quite a bit of opposition, including in the United States, because it is true that although the US administration would very much like to force this through, there is much support for our position among the parliamentarians.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Gloser, Mr Frattini, I have to say how astonished I am that, in your remarks about the PNR negotiations, you made no mention of the Automatic Targeting System (ATS).</p>
      <p sl="de">I, for my part, wonder how it can have come about that a system like ATS, which was originally designed and implemented for freight, could, for years, have been used, in conjunction with PNR data, for passengers, and this without anyone knowing.</p>
      <p sl="de">While we have been negotiating agreements with the United States in order to guarantee the protection of our citizens’ fundamental rights, a system such as this has, at the same time, been operating behind the scenes. The USA now assures us that ATS is compatible with the present, as well the previous, PNR agreements. That being said, I want to state very clearly that assurances of this kind are not enough for me. For me, it is not obvious how 40 years’ data storage using the ATS system is compatible with the PNR Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is also the fact that ATS can apparently be used for any old purpose. How, then, can this be compatible with the obligations under the PNR Agreement, whereby PNR data is only allowed to be used for the purpose of combating terrorism and other serious crimes?</p>
      <p sl="de">We have not so far received any convincing answers to any of these questions, any more than we have to the question of why the ATS system was kept secret at all. How, during the negotiations for the PNR Agreement, could the United States conceal such essential information from its partner? One would probably be justified in asking how it might be guaranteed that there are no further ATS-style systems that we simply know nothing about.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the new PNR Agreement, I should expressly like to support what my fellow Member, Mr Cavada, said, namely that the number of transferable items of information about airline passengers needs to be significantly reduced. It must be guaranteed that the US customs and border protection authorities are not just passing on data willy-nilly to any old authority involved in the fight against terrorism.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to take a stand against the black and white terms in which this debate is all too often held. It also appears, some of the time, that the United States is an enemy instead of an ally in the fight against terrorism. One may well deny it, but just about every measure that has been taken has come under fire from this House.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is, of course, the case that the SWIFT case evokes a number of justified questions, which Members from various groups have already asked. Where, for example, do you draw the line between tracking down terrorists and respecting fundamental rights? It is a question, in fact, that has also been put to the American Congress.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the final analysis, the fight against terror is largely related to risk analysis, the calculation of probability, in other words. The processing of commercial data on top of personal data pure and simple can make a useful contribution in this respect. What we must do, though, is to put guarantees in place to prevent misuse. For example, among other things, this House must monitor the functioning of the system, as well as the algorithms that are used which, moreover, have to be highly confidential; sanctions must be put in place in the case of misuse; the information obtained may be used only for the purpose of combating terrorism, and there must be a call centre where complaints from the public can be handled.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I should like to begin by saying that I see the United States of America not as an enemy but as a friend and partner in shared fights. Of course, in our shared fights we must pay particular attention to combating terrorism, but it is also important to mention that, in some of these fights, the US Administration has at times gone too far, both at internal and international levels, and I am chairing a European parliamentary committee to look into some of these excesses on the international stage.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It should also be noted that the US Congress has undergone a shift of balance, which has led the US Administration to pull back from implementing some of its more controversial plans at internal level, and I hope that this will have an effect at external level, too. This, to my mind, means that the USA is clawing back its good record of placing the emphasis on civil liberties, which is a good thing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr Frattini has reminded us that the demands of security must not undermine the values of essential freedoms and in particular data protection, and Mr Cavada rightly pointed out that the amount of data requested is excessive. Does Parliament want to know what data is involved? Who can have access to it? How can we ensure that objectives are limited and that data are not used for other purposes? With whom can they be shared? For what length of time can they be kept? Then there is the issue of the push system, as mentioned by previous speakers, and the question of people’s rights to appeal in the event of the misuse of their personal data.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Previous speakers have said that, if we in Europe offer US citizens the same level of personal data protection that we offer European citizens under the principle of reciprocity, we are legitimately entitled to claim the same, namely that European citizens in the USA should enjoy the same level of data protection as that offered to US citizens.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the debate on the PNR agreement – SWIFT and secret CIA abductions and flights unfortunately highlights a philosophical divide between America and Europe. The US Government considers that the fight against terrorism warrants any means. Europe does not. However, the recent elections in the USA now give the European Union the chance to negotiate a new PNR agreement from a different position of strength, with many more allies among the people of America and Congress itself. Let us hope it will do so.</p>
      <p sl="el">In order to achieve the objective of an agreement which protects fundamental rights, it must, inter alia:</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, insist that the USA makes an explicit undertaking to provide full and effective personal data protection, as opposed to the current, unacceptable practice of a non-binding and unsatisfactory protocol.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, restrict the number of data items currently transmitted to the USA, many of which have little to do with the legitimate objective of identifying terrorist suspects.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, ban the use of data for purposes unrelated to the fight against terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fourthly, expressly stipulate and limit the US departments which will be entitled to access data.</p>
      <p sl="el">Fifthly, ban at long last the right of direct access in the USA to airline company files. We must bring this saga to an end.</p>
      <p sl="el">Sixthly and finally, make provision for the European Commission and the European Parliament to have the facility for constant, direct and effective control of the strict application of the USA's obligations and to stop immediately any investigation that infringes the intended purpose. We have even been told by a private company, by SWIFT, that they demanded and achieved this in its negotiations with the USA. There is no excuse for twenty-seven European prime ministers to be unable to negotiate and achieve this. If they do not, it will be a question not of 'I could not' but of 'I would not' and we shall all rightly judge them at that point.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, data protection has high status in the EU. It was therefore a shock for us to learn from the media – and from the American media at that – that, despite the data protection requirements documented in all the EU Member States, SWIFT was prepared to give in to pressure from the United States and to forward data concerning European citizens to Washington. This happened without the knowledge, never mind the agreement, of the European Parliament, the national parliaments or the individuals concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">To date, we have not been able to examine the memorandum of understanding between SWIFT and the United States that forms the basis for transferring the data. We can only hope that the data has in actual fact been used only for the purposes of combating terrorism and not, for example, for economic espionage. We do not to date have any confirmation of this. We all support, and appreciate the need for, determination in fighting terrorism. However, individuals’ fundamental rights must be safeguarded. Emphatically, the fight against terrorism must not be conducted to the detriment of basic civil rights and the right to data protection.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is a particular concern of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe too, and that is why we requested a hearing on this issue. It did not surprise us that the Americans, who were also invited, stayed away from the hearing without saying why.</p>
      <p sl="de">We welcome the prompt and thorough investigation by the Belgians, who have come to the clear view that a violation of rights or, as Commissioner Frattini put it, a criminal offence has taken place. Incidentally, the people responsible at SWIFT either knew, or at least suspected and feared, this from the beginning, and they have indirectly informed us that they did so.</p>
      <p sl="de">The failure of corporate governance at SWIFT is still incomprehensible to me. The supervisory bodies were informed, but did nothing to enlighten people as to what was happening or to tell the governments about it. With the best will in the world, that is no way to treat politically mature citizens. People’s confidence in the EU as a legal community has been badly damaged. The SWIFT case is leading to an increase in Euroscepticism in the population, and it will be difficult to win back the confidence that has been lost.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would ask the Council and the Commission to conclude the careful inquiry, of which Mr Gloser has spoken, as quickly as possible and to present practical proposals as to how the rights of European citizens might be enforced in respect of the United States too. You should show people that you are not kow-towing to the United States but take the European Union seriously as a community of values and courageously defend it in relation to major partners too, and precisely because they are friends rather than enemies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European Parliament was quite right to become fully involved in monitoring the routine transfer of European Union citizens’ personal data to the United States. Control by the European Parliament is acceptable. Refusal to transfer data is not. It seems that data transfer can be justified on the grounds of the terrorist threat, posed mainly by Islamic extremists. Nonetheless, such a threat cannot be perceived and exploited as a good pretext for the uncontrolled and unrestrained restriction of citizens’ rights. We must not become extremists ourselves. We must not retreat from the front line of the war against terror under the banner of citizens’ rights. On the other hand, we need to control those who would like to control us in the interests of that war. I refer to the monitoring our flights, financial affairs and privacy. If the justifiable war against global terrorism is not to transform into a dictatorship and a war against citizens’ freedoms, it must itself be subject to strict scrutiny by the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Any future agreement must be based on the push system. The pull system is no longer acceptable, since, as is well known, the push system ought already to have been introduced in the previous agreement. The transfer of passenger data needs to be strictly limited in terms of the purposes for which such data is used. Otherwise, we cannot contemplate such a regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The future agreement must also be given full democratic legitimacy, a process that should involve the European Parliament and, if appropriate, the national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also need an annual evaluation as a necessary component of any agreement, and the evaluation reports must be publicly accessible.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very well remember the statements by Chancellor Merkel in Strasbourg, in which she rightly spoke of European values and also about our need to get across to people, and make it clear to them, what Europe’s strong points are.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Gloser, this would appear to be a case in which we should explain to people that the European Union helps them safeguard their rights. We are not concerned in this instance with the issue of combating terrorism. There is consensus in this House on that matter, and it does not need to be discussed. Where, however, do we stand, then, in this debate? We began by discussing airline passenger data, and now we come on to SWIFT. In view of the speed with which the Council debate is currently being conducted, it is to be feared that, over the next few years, we may possibly have further SWIFTs to contend with, but we still have not made further progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the meantime, we have a situation in which, under pressure from the United States, a European company signs a memorandum of understanding with the Americans, which Europeans are unable to scrutinise. Moreover, SWIFT still does not even have a registered office in the United States, but only a data bank. That is sufficient for American regulators to be able to take SWIFT to task in Belgium. This is like a running theme. There is more and more American regulation of European affairs, appropriated by the United States without we Europeans managing to adopt corresponding countermeasures and to monitor the effects of these.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore, bearing in mind that Germany does not only have the Presidency of the European Council but also chairs the G7, urge the Commission to take an active stance in this area and, as well as investigating matters, to resolve one issue: how, on the basis of our common values and while adhering to data protection requirements and safeguarding human dignity, are we to join together in combating terrorism?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, of course the reality of this is that on PNR, the Americans are setting a negotiation bar for conditions of entry into the US or into their airspace. That is the reality. They can set the bar as high as they like. We have citizens who wish to travel and businesses who want to work there. That is the reality.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reality on SWIFT is that we had an institution, not I believe the only institution, that was dealing with a conflict of jurisdictions, operating and holding data in the US and equally in the EU. It had subpoenas which it legally had to meet in the United States of America and that was where we had the conflict. SWIFT, I believe, has actually operated and negotiated an excellent memorandum of understanding.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can either come into politics to name, shame, moan and whinge, or to try and solve a problem. I came in for the latter. Therefore I believe, Commissioner Frattini, you are absolutely right. We need legal certainty for EU citizens, for EU businesses operating outside the EU and with offices outside the EU as well as within, and in which they hold data. We need a joint political commitment of Congress and this Parliament working across the transatlantic divide to fight the threat of terrorism which affects us all, and indeed we need to protect above all our fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore I welcome the joint meeting of this House and US elected representatives so that we can reach an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, this will only be achieved by decisive action at Council level, not just at Commission level. I welcome the excellent suggestion of the previous speaker of bringing this up at the G7.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and the President-in-Office for being present at this very important debate. We have heard that maintaining good cooperation with the US was crucial in our fight against terrorism. I do not deny that. I even believe that the transatlantic relationship must be reinforced because terrorism is a global phenomenon. We must join forces to fight it efficiently by exchanging information and providing our law enforcement agencies with the necessary means. Our citizens have the right to live in a safe and secure place. However, the SWIFT case is showing us again the drifts arising if we do not ensure strict safeguards when exchanging information. There is a correct balance to be struck between freedom and security, and in this case, security has once again prevailed. You cannot combat terrorism by giving up the very rights that terrorism seeks to destroy. Our high standards must not be lowered under pressure from any third country, even from our closest partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is even more important that many of the new Member States have a long history of dictatorship and mass surveillance of their population. Unfortunately, in some of these countries, there is a perception that the illicit practices of the past are still carried on. That is why Europe must remain the defender of fundamental rights, and that includes the right to privacy. On the one hand we need a framework decision on data protection in the third pillar to ensure high standards in police and judicial cooperation. We have been waiting for it for too long now. On the other hand, we must also remain vigilant and ensure that the existing instruments are properly enforced in our own countries. We must prosecute those who infringe our basic rights to privacy. We need to reassure our citizens that we want to maintain high standards in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as my colleagues have said before, this is not a debate about the shape of the transatlantic relations. Everyone in this House should know that the United States is our strongest ally in the fight against terrorism. But this does not change the fact that if we are partners it makes it easier for us to stand firm and really defend our values and our laws.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can only echo what my PPE colleagues – especially Mr Radwan – have said: in order for us to really safeguard the respect of the European regulatory framework, we need full information from the Commission and Council on the information that is delivered to the US authorities and how this information is protected by the US authorities. We have to start to negotiate and get an agreement on information exchange which is on a viable basis and which respects the EU laws. If this does not happen, we have to immediately stop delivering any kind of information to the US authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even after the ECB’s response, I am quite puzzled as to what the role and the responsibility of the ECB is in this case. The ECB itself is subject to the data privacy requirements of EU law, but it does not seem to take any responsibility for what it might have in this information exchange.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also understand that there is a clear need for the US to track down information on international bank transfers that might have a link to terrorist financing, but these details have a link to other kinds of financing. Our European businesses, especially, might be at risk if we do not act and stand firm. The information that will be given should always be in line with our legislation and protect our citizens and European businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">The national financial transfers contain such delicate information that this is really an issue which should be taken seriously by the Commission and by the Council, this Parliament and the US Congress.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council should, in my view, observe the following guidelines in its current negotiations with the United States on the transfer of airline passenger data.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, it is through a proportionate approach that an appropriate level of security will be achieved, and that approach is not apparent in the case of the current agreements. Such an approach depends – and this is my second point – on implementing compliance with normal European data protection standards, and that in my view involves changing the status quo, mainly through reducing the quantity of behaviour-related data. Where switching over to the push system is concerned, Austrian Airlines has, to my knowledge, operated this system from the beginning - successfully, too. The system involves having a clearly defined framework for using the data, a limit on the period for which the data is stored and, not least, the ability to lodge a complaint in the event of data being misused.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Gloser, you rightly said that we need legal certainty as quickly as possible for European airlines. As a politician involved in transport issues, I can only concur with that. Given that the transfer of data really is about making progress in combating terrorism, it has an international dimension, and we no doubt also need international agreements with internationally binding data protection rules. These are what we should be negotiating towards.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must always be concerned to uphold our right to freedom of movement, which can only be achieved in an open society in which people can move about freely without falling under general suspicion. It would be unacceptable to us as Members of the European Parliament if the principle of equality were to be violated and if different levels of data protection were to apply to US citizens, on the one hand, and to non-Americans, on the other. I have confidence in the determination of the German Presidency of the Council as it conducts the negotiations. I know that these will not be a simple matter.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, the fact that you have heard the same refrain right across the political groups should, I believe, give you pause for thought. The message is that we do of course need a transatlantic partnership and that we are allies in the fight against terrorism. Not only the refrain, but even the verse was the same across the board, namely that credibility, confidence and transparency are necessary where these issues are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us begin with credibility. I still remember very well how, in his last speech in this House, the Commissioner particularly praised the data protection aspects of the agreement. I do not believe that such praise is compatible with the rights that we should have from the point of view of data protection law. Where the transfer of airline passenger data is concerned, there is no duty to provide information, and the individuals concerned have no right to correct the data. What, moreover, has happened to credibility when you call the conversations you are conducting with the United States ‘negotiations’? You are standing with your back to the wall and with a pistol pointing at your chest. The United States is threatening no longer to allow aircraft to land, and none of the European Union’s institutions has the backbone to say that, in all good faith, we shall not allow ourselves to be treated like that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Credibility is undermined by our hearing again and again that Parliament is to be involved. If you are serious about that, then include us around the table and, in so doing, show us that you mean what you say.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning now to the subject of transparency, which European citizens are aware that, when they board an aircraft, 34 items of data, including information about what they have to eat and where they sit, are transferred? None do. I have discussed this very question with citizens in a broadcast. No one knows that this is what happens when he or she boards an aircraft.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the SWIFT debate very clearly fits within the wider discussion on the high-wire balancing act between the fight against terrorism on the one hand and the protection of fundamental human rights and privacy on the other. Not only, though, is there a clear dividing line between the European and American positions, we cannot even seem to agree on a common definition for terrorism. The Commissioner has indicated on this platform how he would like to develop a European instrument for the future that would meet these requirements, but that is something that cannot, of course, be done overnight. We are, indeed, left with the situation from the past and present, something about which I have quite a few questions. To this day, data are being passed on, as if there was nothing wrong, within the SWIFT dossier. The conclusions of the reports from both the Belgian privacy committee and the European Committee are clear and unanimous: the Belgian and European rules on data protection have clearly been flouted. In view of the fact that the Belgian courts have now decided not to prosecute SWIFT, and the Belgian Government cannot see any point in continuing those illegal practices, I should like to ask what Europe’s response to this is. Will the Commission now start an infringement procedure against Belgium? If so, when will this be decided? If not, what does the Commission intend to do to ensure that the European privacy rules are respected hic et nunc in all Member States, including Belgium?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, at the Council of 15 December, the SWIFT case was also raised by the Belgian Prime Minister who argued in favour of a European approach.

But I think the Commission, as well as the Council, are being as feeble about SWIFT privacy abuses as they have been over PNR over the last four years. This is European data, belonging to European citizens, made available for commercial purposes in Europe under the protection of European data protection law. But despite the persistent and insistent demands of MEPs, the EU, in the less than robust hands of the Council and Commission, has allowed a large degree of US extra-territorial jurisdiction. In any global framework for exchange of mass commercial data for security purposes, the EU must forcefully project its own laws and principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, you say that it is ‘unlikely’ that SWIFT data have been used in the automated targeting system, which is a profiling exercise assigning a risk score to each individual based on assumptions – and no doubt stereotypes – deriving from their behaviour and characteristics. But why do you not know categorically, yes or no, whether SWIFT data has been used in ATS? In relation to PNR, you accept the Department of Homeland Security’s assurance that the use of PNR data for profiling complies with the undertakings of the PNR agreement. But do you agree with the DHS assessment? Yes or no? The lack of clear answers is undermining trust, and I think that we are owed those clear answers as to the Commission’s legal evaluation.</p>

Full compliance with the fundamental rights, including privacy, there is no room for any misunderstanding here, and we will keep you to this pledge. There is, then, little point in 780 MEPs sitting where the negotiators should be; it would not work. That does, however, mean that the Council must be ambitious in its negotiations, instead of – as I now hear them doing – mainly weighing up the hazards it might meet with along the way. We assume, however, that your commitment to the negotiations is as firm as Commissioner Frattini's, because we will hold you to that as well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is about SWIFT now, and SWIFT not being a bank should not be a licence not to take privacy rules seriously or not to comply with them. The inquiry you mounted, Commissioner Frattini, is to be welcomed, but you will need to take legal measures promptly in order to fill the vacuum, because data exchange at SWIFT should also be able to stand the test of European privacy rules.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The fight against terror must also be able to look into financial transactions in this framework, because this may well lead to terrorist organisations. Something that has struck me is that many citizens have much sympathy for the difficult dilemmas we face in this context. We cannot resolve this overnight. I am, for example, quite shocked by the fact that there has not been more of a fuss made about the rules on liquids in aircraft. We should not seize this as an excuse, though. Tough negotiations are needed. The suggestion mooted by Mr Radwan to place this in a wider G7 context is something I am happy to endorse.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, none us in this House disputes the fact that there needs to be enhanced prevention of terrorism in the future. However, the issue inevitably arises of the means to be used in this connection, as well as the issue of the strategies to be adopted. Undoubtedly, international cooperation and the exchange of data are just as much a part of the process as, on the other hand, legal certainty and the necessary data protection. As all of us do in this House, I support transatlantic cooperation in this connection.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must, however, attach importance to seeing a balance maintained between security and the combating of terrorism, on the one hand, and data protection, on the other. If, moreover, it is now a question of negotiating a new agreement, then this new agreement needs to fulfil certain basic preconditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, personal data needs to be given the same level of protection as has already been achieved in the interim agreement. Secondly, the airlines must be afforded legal certainty so that the promise to switch over to a push system, enabling us to control which data is delivered to whom and at which juncture, is kept. The purpose for which the data can be used must also, of course, be laid down so that the data can only, and is only allowed to, be used for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorism. There should also in future be a duty to provide travellers with information in this connection.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would make one last point, which I do think is important. In negotiating the new agreement, added value should also be created. As soon as an act of terrorism is suspected, the US authorities should be obliged to notify the corresponding judicial and police authorities in the Member States, as well as the corresponding EU institutions, namely Europol or Eurojust. If all this is guaranteed, we shall have available to us a further instrument designed to make EU citizens more secure.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank you most sincerely for the many comments, ideas and of course – whether one likes them or not – the critical remarks. In a debate, they serve to indicate whether or not one is on the right track and whether it is possible to prevent some state of affairs that was not perhaps right in the past from arising again.</p>
      <p sl="de">Not only legal protection and legal certainty but also the issue of how we are to combat specific forms of international terrorism are, it is true, unanimously deemed to be important, but we must not in any circumstances play these off against each other. Where the two areas of PNR and SWIFT are concerned, we face different situations.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the statement by the Presidency, I again made a point of clearly emphasising cooperation and interchange with the Commission, on the basis of which we wish together to arrive at a legally certain regulation. This raises many issues to which you have also referred today, including those of how extensive the information is, what access there is to it and what controls need to be exercised by the other party. Similar issues arise too where the subject of SWIFT is concerned, and in this connection I am again happy to take up Mr Radwan’s idea. Irrespective of whether or not it is at present on the agendas of the G7 or G8 or comes within the area of relations between the European Union and the United States, it is important to address this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">There would certainly be no benefit in just moving constantly from one aspect to the next, as what is at issue here is essentially the same. We are concerned with data protection, with legal certainty and, furthermore, with the form to be taken by the transatlantic partnership, in connection with which we are of the view that partnership is not a one-way street. It is a question of working with, rather than against, each other.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need the information concerned, and relations between the European Union and the United States should be such that, in the forthcoming meetings between the two countries, it should be possible to address the issues very clearly, above all with a view to confronting the danger that some of you have described. I can do no more than say how absolutely right it is to address these issues openly. When are we to be confronted with the next case in which data is perhaps unsafely accessed? That is a point that we should like to take up. Without now going into technical details, I also say that with, specifically, SWIFT in mind. Where is the data? Is it here, and would we have the opportunity to put it in order and limit its extent without its being passed on? Or is the data possibly already available in the USA where, because of the nature of data protection there, it is very easy to access? The implication in that case, however, is that we have no influence at all.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question is, however, that of what influence the European Union has on data that is transferred and that is, as it were, ready to be called up elsewhere? Specifically where SWIFT is concerned, this is certainly a complicated procedure. All this should, however, give us the opportunity for discussing these matters in depth and for arguing how important it is for us in the European Union to stand for certain values and also to act in defence of those values. It should also give us the opportunity for arguing how essential it is to maintain the existing balance. That does not mean that we are always in agreement about the fight against international terrorism. It is just that all these matters have to be balanced out.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner Frattini did in fact make this very clear in giving precedence not only to people’s safety but also to legal protection and to the very high level of data protection such as we do in fact have in the European Union. I can only assure you that these many facets that you have discussed are also to be included for discussion in the forthcoming negotiations, and in relation not only to PNR but also, of course, to SWIFT.</p>

I have said it a thousand times and I shall say it again: we shall find a way, and that is why I welcome Mr Cavada’s idea of even organising an agreement with the US Congress to monitor the political stages of these negotiations. It is also clear that this debate has affected Euroatlantic relations, contrary to what somebody said. I am convinced that, if Europe wants to be a leader on the world political stage, it must achieve a global balance between the right – I personally consider it a duty – to pursue and investigate terrorists and the duty to protect fundamental rights, such as the privacy of personal data.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is therefore obvious that if, as the President-in-Office of the Council has just said, we want to achieve an overall balance together with the United States, we want to do so because we are convinced that Euroatlantic relations are crucial, not only with regard to Europe’s past history but, above all, with regard to its present and future history.</p>
      <p sl="it">As many of you are well aware, I have on many occasions supplied detailed answers, above all to the Committee on Civil Liberties, of course, but I address Parliament when I am invited to do so and I speak to those committees that invite me. Regarding the ‘push’ system, for instance, I announced in December that experiments with such a system for passenger name records would begin before the end of the month, and they did. The experiment was started with the US Administration’s Customs and Border Protection System and Amadeus. There is a technical point regarding requests for ad hoc data, but it is a technical problem, while the ‘push’ experiment has indeed started, as we had been promised.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to the number of data items, I was interested to hear what many of you had to say about the 34 items that are currently the subject of the PNR agreement. I can tell you quite openly that, as far as my part in the negotiations is concerned, I intend to call for the number of data items in question to be cut, but not because I subscribe to the idea that the US is asking for too many. If all 34 items were of use in pursuing terrorists, I would not be afraid to tell you that 34 items were needed. However, the really useful items are probably those 19 that have been mentioned: that is to say, a much smaller number.</p>
      <p sl="it">Believe me, though, the principle that counts as regards the data to be processed is not the number of items but rather the usefulness of the data, and it is on those grounds that I intend to take action in the negotiations. I do not mean to endorse the idea that, if we cut the 34 items down to 15, we will in any case have done a good job: we may actually have done a very bad job if some of the excluded data items could have prevented a terrorist attack. I am in no doubt about one thing: I am quite certain that the main aim is to make the system effective. Who has access to the data? What for? How many data and for how long? These are the points of an agreement that we are going to start negotiating soon, and Parliament will be kept informed, as I have already said.</p>
      <p sl="it">Ladies and gentlemen, many of you believe that passenger information is the missing factor in the PNR system. It is fair to imagine that if no consensus is reached between the two sides, no agreement will be made at the end of July. Just in my mind’s eye, I can see a very simple solution: every ticket to the United States that is purchased could come with a sheet for the passenger to sign, informing them that their data will be processed in a particular way. If that should happen – and I strongly hope that it never will – we will certainly have ensured that passengers are given information but, without an agreement at European level, passengers’ rights will be limited to the private sphere of the air carriage contract. That is an eventuality that we must avert by every possible means, which is why we must try to achieve a new European agreement. The alternative would be very simple: passengers would merely need to be asked to accept a few restrictions as part of the air carriage contract, and I believe that the majority who want to go to the United States for honest reasons would sign it. We would, however, be giving up a role for Europe that we have already played and which it is vital that we still play. That is why we need new negotiations, in part to cut down the number of data items, but in such a way that reducing the amount of data does not jeopardise the fight against terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="it">In connection with the ATS system, I have mentioned to the Committee on Civil Liberties that I have received written assurances from the United States regarding compliance with the PNR agreement. In a speech made in this Chamber, I was criticised for not having checked the veracity of this statement. Ladies and gentlemen, if I, in Brussels, had the power to investigate the behaviour of the United States, I would have powers that no authority at either European or national level has ever had or is ever likely to have. Everything is possible, apart from checking the veracity of that letter, as I was asked to do in that speech. When I receive a formal reply saying that the rules are being complied with, I have to take it at face value unless there is evidence to the contrary. That is what happens between allies, unless you have some evidence to the contrary – which I frankly do not have, and I am being absolutely honest – because otherwise we would have to open a permanent inquiry into every minute detail of the letters we receive from the United States.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mrs Roure asked me whether we can give Parliament our information on the negotiating mandate. As you know, such information is classified; nonetheless, as I said before, even though it is classified, we will find a way to keep Parliament informed, in other words a way to give you political information without violating a rule enshrined in the Treaties, whereby classified (‘EU restricted’) information cannot be published. This is the political solution that I propose: if the Treaty is amended so as to specify a mechanism by which classified acts may be communicated to Parliament, I shall apply such a rule without hesitation. It is a matter, however, of overcoming the obstacle that Parliament cannot be informed if classified material is involved. I shall keep you up to date on this.</p>
      <p sl="it">Many people have called for a framework agreement, Mr President, which I think is the right way to go. A framework agreement on data transmission is precisely what we have started working on with the Presidency: we are setting up a joint working party to deal with a number of topics relating to personal data processing – separate, therefore, from the SWIFT case and PNR, which are going on in parallel. We believe that the time has now come to conclude a Euroatlantic political agreement – a framework agreement – with the United States on personal data processing, and we intend to work on this agreement in order to specify what kinds of data can be transmitted, for what purposes and for how long.</p>
      <p sl="it">Ladies and gentlemen, there is a further point that has not been addressed in this debate, but which needs to be addressed: how can we preserve the confidentiality of the technical information that forms part of this agreement? Since it concerns investigation procedures, it would be a gift to criminals if it were revealed. Such information needs to be kept confidential. There is thus another problem, because it is obvious that we would be giving suspected terrorists a powerful tool if we revealed details about how they are monitored. Can a solution be found? I am quite sure that one can, but there needs to be political will on both sides.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to end with a final thought: none of all that justifies the specific violations of European law and the legislative failings in the SWIFT case. You may recall that, when nobody was yet talking about a European agreement, I addressed the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the need for such an agreement, because it is much better to close a legislative gap with a European rule than to leave it to the individual Member States to legislate as they please. The SWIFT case is typical: out of 27 Member States, only seven have given me a reply. That is a sign that the issue needs to be addressed at a European level.</p>
      <p sl="it">For all these reasons, therefore, I can assure you that 1) I believe that a political agreement is essential and that the legitimacy of such an agreement will be weaker if Parliament is not involved; and 2) such a political agreement should be aimed at solving the problems constructively, without pointing the finger at the United States as if it was the problem: the problem, ladies and gentlemen, is the terrorists, not the United States.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In my home region, the southern counties of the Hungarian Plains, there was a great outcry about the discovery by police of a huge amount of communal trash, 5 000 tonnes so far, probably originating in Germany. The investigation is continuing, with cooperation on the part of the Germans. But the fact is that such a quantity of garbage, and who knows how much more, is certainly missing from Germany. This cannot go unnoticed by the meticulous German public administrations. Events like this, though forbidden by EU regulations, are spreading as a result of the free movement of goods, and seriously undermine in my home region the value placed on EU membership.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Besides, some German and Austrian firms have already caused numerous scandals in Hungary by putting on the market through large chain-stores food items past their sell-by date, exploiting the thrifty shopping habits of those people in the new Member States who struggle with huge problems of livelihood.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, at this time we are saying our farewells to the late Ryszard Kapuściński, one of the greatest writers of modern times. In his reports from every corner of the world, and indeed throughout the whole of his work, Ryszard Kapuściński told the truth about the world in the second half of the 20th century and the start of the present one. His books record his testimony of the end of colonialism in the late sixties, the fall of the dictatorships in the eighties and both the bright and dark sides of the globalisation we are now experiencing.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ryszard Kapuściński was a model reporter and thinker; a journalist committed to the poor and oppressed. He was a free-thinking intellectual, unfettered by any power system. He consistently defended freedom and democracy – in Latin America, Africa, Ethiopia, Iran and Poland. His presence at the Gdańsk shipyard during the 1980 general strike demonstrated his solidarity with the Polish workers’ struggle for trade union rights and democracy. Polish and European culture are the poorer for the passing of Ryszard Kapuściński.</p>

      <p sl="cs">US military propaganda talks in terms of world terrorism, the axis of evil and the need to deliver security. In the past, it was said that 'if you want peace then prepare for war’. Perhaps the phrase should now be 'If you are preparing for war, talk about safeguarding peace.’ I fear that the Czech public has been duped into believing that the USA’s radar base on Czech territory will help protect the world from unspecified threats. I believe that the US’s military bases, including those in the Czech Republic, or wherever they may be in Europe, do not actually lead to security, but, rather, threaten the security of the Czech Republic and other European countries, exacerbate tensions, increase the need for arms and significantly worsen relations with Russia both on a political level and with regard to the energy situation. The current Czech Government is either oblivious to these risks or lacks the courage to stand up to the USA. The Czech public is aware of the danger, as, I am sure, is a large proportion of the EU population, who do not feel the need to be dragged into the USA’s bellicose plans.</p>

This report is only the beginning. It is clear, when one looks at the seniority of those involved within the police force and to whom reference was made in this report, that collusion was a political and administrative practice which was present at all levels of that police force -the RUC- and in the British Government. The big question now is what will be done with this report and what action will be taken. Despite that, Sinn Féin took a historic decision to support the new Police Service. There is now a remarkable opportunity to further advance the Peace Process in Ireland.

Mr Leinen this week levelled accusations against President Klaus of the Czech Republic in connection with his views on the European Constitution, saying that the President’s policy runs counter to the interests of his own country and its citizens. I should like to assure Mr Leinen that he is mistaken. The rejection of the Constitution in its current form is overwhelmingly in the interests of the Czech Republic, and President Klaus is doing nothing more than fulfilling his Presidential promise on the Constitution. In addition to his one-sided praise of the merits of the document, Mr Leinen ought to point out that the European Constitution will, for example, offer unauthorised and unlimited benefits for Germany, the country for which he himself is an elected representative. If Mr Leinen does not mention all aspects of the European Constitution and if he conceals its potential consequences for some countries, he will be the one whose actions are at variance with the interests of EU citizens and he, rather than the Czech President, will be the one who is holding back the process of European integration.</p>

We Hungarians are proud of the Hungarian Parliament building and we named the great square in front of it after the greatest hero of the Hungarian War of Independence, Lajos Kossuth. This square has played a decisive role in the history of Hungary for the past 100 years. This is the square that the chief of police of Budapest closed three months ago illegally and in violation of the right to assembly, in order to stop citizens from demonstrating. The Hungarian Constitution, as well as every international treaty dealing with civil liberties, forbids the unjustified restriction of such a basic right as the right to assembly. Yet in the heart of Europe, on the main square of Budapest, on Kossuth Square, it has been forbidden to voice political opinions for three months. This is unacceptable.

Europe was created on the basis of recognising the errors of the past, with a view to banishing them forever.

They could send their representatives to work at the bureaus of important Commission Member States, and that would be the extent of the small countries’ role in the European Commission. The large countries would manage the important areas and would make proper decisions. Which fields are insignificant? Perhaps Commission members from large countries could participate in them and make them significant?

As a matter of fact, the signs coming out of Albania from our colleagues in the non-violent Radical Party and the MJAFT Movement suggest that these risks still exist and that it is practically certain that the standards set by the Council of Europe and the OSCE will not be met.</p>
      <p sl="it">I hope that this House will be able to give its opinion on this subject and that the Bureau of Parliament can in any case formally voice its concern. As the European Union, we must certainly do more to ensure not only that there are official observers of the voting operations but also that there is proper, strict monitoring of the whole preparatory stage leading up to the elections and then of the election process itself. We must stop confining ourselves to being merely official observers: the future of our Europe is also at stake.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to remind the House that the European Union's strategy for achieving the objectives set in Lisbon by 2010 requires an increase in competitiveness, economic improvements and, of course, a resolution to the problem of unemployment, especially among young people.</p>
      <p sl="el">This will not be achieved unless changes are made to education systems also, unless the system is modernised, especially the higher education system. Numerous states are attempting to change it and this is really national policy. These changes are either a cause of major concern to young people or, on the contrary, leave them indifferent. Both cases are worrying for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course, there is the problem of the constitution and information relating to it. Perhaps, however, before the Constitutional Treaty, the inhabitants of Europe – especially young people – should be informed more effectively about the changes before them and for that both the European Commission and we here in Parliament have a responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Turkish Cypriots living in the northern part of Cyprus are now gradually attempting to free themselves from the stranglehold of the Turkish army of occupation. Approximately 85 000 Turkish Cypriots have, since the Turkish invasion of 1974, been living under the subordination of Turkey, decidedly imposed by the presence of 40 000 Turkish troops.</p>
      <p sl="en">After Cyprus’ succession to the EU in 2004, Turkish Cypriots are beginning to feel secure enough to start openly expressing their desire for freedom from Turkish domination. In this respect, hundreds of Turkish Cypriot university students recently held a demonstration in occupied Nicosia against the Turkish army of occupation. A few days later, a prominent Turkish Cypriot politician, Mustafa Akinci, dared to make a fierce attack on the occupation of Cyprus by Turkish troops.</p>
      <p sl="en">The struggle of Turkish Cypriots against the Turkish army of occupation of the northern part of Cyprus has begun.

      <p sl="sk">() Thirty years have passed this month since the world’s press published the text of Charter 77, a petition closely associated with protests against the communist dictatorship in the former Czechoslovakia. It was an expression of resistance against the arrogance of power and the brutality of the state security apparatus, which had no respect for freedom of religion, imprisoning all those who criticised them, and preventing young people from studying because of their own opinions or even those of their parents.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Charter 77 was associated with prominent personalities, such as Václav Havel, and even thirty years on it has lost none of its significance or relevance. It inspired the Belarusian opposition to come up with their Charter 97 initiative, signed by tens of thousands of Belarusians protesting against the Lukashenko regime. North Korean, Cuban and Burmese dissidents are also trying to make use of these tactics. Therefore let me say a few words at the European Parliament on behalf of those who have experienced a totalitarian communist regime. Signatories of Charter 77, we thank you for your courage which led to victory over fear, so that all of us can live and work in the European Union as free people today.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, every presidency tries to leave its own particular mark. Europe is organising itself formally and looking to the future. That is right and proper, but it would be a mistake to try and build a future from scratch, creating a new kind of person. The USSR tried to do so and failed dismally. Europe must take account of its history, including both its finest hours and its most terrible times. It is important to distil from historical truth values that have proved their worth and which were crucial to overcoming past crises. Prominent amongst them are Christian values in the broadest sense of the word. These constitute a key reference point for mankind. I trust the current Presidency will enable Christian values to play a leading role in Parliament’s work, to ensure a full and healthy democracy. A democracy that is not founded on profound values is bound to be weak and unfit for its purpose.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, yesterday’s Commission Green Paper on second-hand smoke asserts that comprehensive smoking bans are the best way to tackle this serious danger to health. I agree.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are nearly five million tobacco-related deaths worldwide, but governments still fail to implement tobacco control policies that are known and proven to work. Tobacco companies have seriously thwarted efforts to protect health. At this very moment, the British American Tobacco website downplays the serious risks of second-hand smoke, saying that if there is any risk it is too small to measure. Second-hand smoke causes 79 000 deaths a year in the EU; statistics show that passive smoking causes one death every working day in the hospitality sector: is that too small to measure? I think not!</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, a recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that tobacco companies had increased the nicotine hit in their cigarettes by 11% between 1995 and 2005. This study found that cigarettes had been redesigned to increase the number of puffs per unit, thereby increasing the nicotine intake of the smoker. This disturbing evidence comes as no surprise. Tobacco companies have lied consistently down the years about the danger of their products.</p>
      <p sl="en">Anything less than an outright ban would mean failing to protect those most vulnerable and exposed to serious risks, and this Parliament has a duty to promote and protect the health of our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="sl">On Wednesday, 17 January, a press conference took place in the European Parliament at which the Prime Ministers of Germany, Portugal and Slovenia presented a platform for the EU 3 Presidency for the next 18 months. Given the major, and not least the symbolic, importance of the event, the conference was attended not only by the three Prime Ministers but also by the Presidents of the European Parliament and of the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Considering the importance of this event, I was appalled to hear that the press conference took place in an entirely inadequate room which was basically too small to accommodate all those who wanted to listen to the Prime Ministers. The working conditions for the press were unacceptably poor.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Let us ask ourselves two questions. First: Do we want quality and transparency in the reporting of the work we do? And second: Do we want our work to achieve greater recognition on the part of the citizens of the EU? If we aspire to both these things, I call on those responsible to ensure that future press conferences be organised in more adequate and, above all, larger premises so that we may guarantee access to everyone. Finally, we must recognise that the press have a decisive impact on the public image of the European Union.</p>

The 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome is a good opportunity to look back over past decades, not just years. Although the European Community’s original aims related to economic problems, the creation of a common market and an economic community, life experience and the wisdom of the European leaders broadened the scope of our great European project to encompass such noble aims as human rights, democracy, freedom, solidarity and mutual aid.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The challenges we currently face lie in the area of security in the broadest sense of the term. Chief amongst them are energy security and combating harmful climate change. These problems can apparently be solved by the introduction of new technologies and innovation. We must not, however, disregard social security, food security and combating terrorism.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0450/2006) by Mrs Ries, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on promoting healthy diets and physical activity: a European dimension for the prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases (2006/2231(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-180" speaker_id="4253" name="Frédérique Ries" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like straightaway to start by thanking my fellow shadow rapporteurs, who are present: Mr Bushill-Matthews, Mrs McAvan, Mrs Evans, Mrs Sinnott and Mrs Belohorská. I must say that my contact with them has been particularly intense and fruitful since my appointment as rapporteur, nine months ago.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I quote some particularly striking figures in this report: 38% of women, 27% of men and almost five million children in the EU are obese, with between 300 000 and 400 000 new cases of obesity recorded among our youngest children each year. This is both a simple and a terrible situation. In 2000, the WHO defined obesity as the major health problem of the countries of the West. How could it be otherwise when, on average, 6% of the national healthcare budgets are devoted to all those diseases that are caused by a person’s being overweight: type 2 diabetes, breathing problems, heart problems and other kinds of problems? Over and above these figures, it is important to add and to spell out that the most worrying thing is the fact that this disease is now on the increase.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is an initial observation to be made, which we all agree on: we have not reacted in time and, when I say ‘we’, I am indeed referring to governments, to boards of health and education and indeed to us, as parents.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second observation, which is just as obvious, is that it is not easy to fight effectively against obesity and all its consequences for people’s health. That requires a global, holistic approach, which takes account of such varied factors as heredity, lifestyle and education in terms of eating a balanced and varied diet, and this from as early an age as possible. A person’s family and professional background is a crucial factor. We cannot overlook the fact that job insecurity and poverty are factors that sometimes trigger or, in any case, cause a further rise in, obesity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third observation is that we are not starting from scratch. There are currently sixty or so initiatives on the prevention of obesity and the promotion of physical activity that benefit from or warrant monitoring at European level, such as Fleurbaix and Laventie and Food Dudes, to name but two.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As has been said time and again, when it comes to this fight, Europe does not just have something to say; it has a huge contribution to make. If Europe’s aim is to provide real added value, it needs to integrate nutrition and physical activity into the other Community policies, and to do so across the board, in areas in which, fortunately, the European Union’s largest budgets are concentrated: the common agricultural policy, the seventh research framework programme and the structural funds. I am also delighted that, as part of the reform of the COM in fruit and vegetables that was launched last week by Commissioner Fischer Boel, one of the seven priorities – the seven major objectives – was to promote people’s consumption of this type of highly nutritious food.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For my part, I should like to repeat in this House, as I did in the report, that I prefer an incentive policy, price cuts, tax reductions or other kind of subsidy, to any system resembling a tax on calorific products that is of the ‘fat tax’ kind, because, ultimately, such a system would penalise the lowest income households in Europe the most.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am pleased with all of the compromises we have reached in our work on important points in this report. I will not mention them all, but I will, however, mention one or two of them. The compromise on paragraph 4, which recommends that, like the WHO, all the Member States officially recognise obesity as a chronic disease: this is a strong demand, backed by patients’ associations, which we have a duty to pass on; it is also undoubtedly the surest way of preventing certain kinds of people in our society from being stigmatised and of ensuring that healthcare systems provide a reasonable level of care. The compromise on paragraphs 16 and 17, next, which point out the importance of schools in terms of teaching children how to lead healthy lives – whether they are in the school canteen or on the sports field. The compromise on paragraph 30 lastly, on the urgent need to do as we propose and implement a simplified and harmonised form of labelling foodstuffs that are high in salt, sugar and certain fats.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to make it clear that I agree with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance when they attack foods and drinks that are too high in calories. Yes, we must stop this slightly tiresome political correctness that leads to inaction. Who can still believe and declare today that, from a nutritional point of view, there are not good foods and bad foods? The fact that there are bad foods highlights why it is also important for the European Union to get to grips with reducing people’s consumption of saturated fats – which is the subject of our paragraph 28 – as they are responsible for bad cholesterol and, by extension, for a whole host of cardiovascular diseases.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, I regret that our debates are, as I see it, far too focused on the issue of banning television advertisements for food and drinks that are high in sugar, salt and fat from being broadcast during children’s programmes. It seems to me that this debate has largely been settled by our vote on the revision of the Television without Frontiers Directive in December 2006 – very recently, then. That is the point expressed very precisely by our compromise amendment 5. For my part, too, I would have difficulty explaining to a mother the logic of a policy that bans television advertising for, for example, chocolate bars but that, on the other hand, authorises the same advertising on the Internet or on the big screen, and that is the reasoning behind our paragraph 24.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, Mr President, I am convinced that all of us here, in this House, share the same desire. Firstly, to halt this epidemic, by making discernable progress in four or five years, particularly where children are concerned. Secondly, we need to try to reverse this trend by 2015 at the latest, through ambitious policies at every level of power, including at European level. That is why we expect a great deal from you, Commissioner Kyprianou, and of the forthcoming White Paper, too, which you will be presenting to us in the spring.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would very much like to welcome Parliament’s report in response to our Green Paper and of course to congratulate Mrs Ries for her excellent work. I can easily say that I agree with her approach taken in the report and especially of course the underlining of the need to place public health at the centre of considerations right across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The challenge for all of us is to make this happen. We are talking here about a big challenge because we are referring to changes of lifestyle and that is not always an easy task. It is a long-term and constant effort and we have to insist and persist on this. It is a complex problem which requires complex solutions. The Commission did not follow the blame game because, in reality, we are all to blame for this. We saw the problem creeping up but we tended to ignore it; we always thought it was more of a problem for North America and we were ignoring the fact that it was becoming a European problem. So we all have responsibility and therefore we all have to contribute to its solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">This issue is very high on our agenda, and I can repeat here once again that obesity could easily be the most serious health threat for the European Union for the 21st century. There is no need to analyse the problems and the health concerns and harm that arise out of obesity. Even more worrying is the rising prevalence of obesity among children. The figures are really worrying: 40 million children today, increasing by 400 000 a year. This is really something of concern.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will adopt a White Paper this coming month. In developing and drafting this paper – I can call it a strategy – we will take the ideas and the views raised in the report seriously into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">For us, this approach will follow a combination of self-regulatory, voluntary and – why not? – some regulatory measures as well. In relation to regulation, I could easily refer to health claims or the review on food labelling that will be coming out soon, this year most probably. But of course we have the platform, you are aware of that, where we have concrete commitments on the part of the stakeholders. These are commitments that have to be verifiable and monitored and independent in an objective way. We will soon be issuing the second monitoring report from the platform.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report touches on many issues and many topics with which we agree, such as food reformulation, incentive schemes for self-regulation and the very sensitive issue of the advertising of foods to children. The truth is, until now we have been concentrating very much on the intake of food, on nutrition. We now aim to put more emphasis on the physical activity part, which is also a serious concern for European citizens. Member States also have a great responsibility here and I would like to highlight the reference in the report to sports in schools. This is a very important factor. It is embarrassing for me to say that in the European Union there is not enough physical activity in schools among children and teenagers. The big challenge is not only to bring it back but to make it fun again. This is an important factor. I can very briefly refer to a parent who was complaining to me that his son comes back home from school and plays basketball on the computer and does not play the real game outside in the schoolyard. This is the reality. So your reference to video games is very important, but we also have to use a more scientific, a more advanced, a more modern approach to bring fun back to physical exercise so that schoolchildren and teenagers exercise for fun. Sport should not just be for athletes and competitors, but for everybody.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have already referred to the reform of the common organisation of the markets in fruit and vegetables. We intend to promote the consumption of fruit and vegetables. This is a very important aspect, but we will also continue working on the aspect of affordability as well, because unfortunately nowadays healthy food is much more expensive than what we have come to know as junk food.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to finish here and thank the rapporteur again for her excellent work. I assure you that we will take Parliament’s views very seriously into account when we are drafting our strategy over the next few months.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I am very pleased indeed that we are now paying attention to this major problem affecting so many people, not only in Europe but also in large parts of the rest of the world. I was draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality where this issue was concerned, and I should have liked to have seen a clearer gender equality perspective in the work done on the report. I think it important for Parliament to task the Commission with further developing its gender-based strategy on excessive weight and obesity, diet and exercise, especially when it comes to collecting data and sharing best practice. We also need to devise a communications strategy for the whole Community. We must not forget that women and men are different. Women’s obesity should be investigated more carefully, especially given the discrimination within the healthcare system.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, obesity has been described by the World Health Organisation as the greatest health threat facing the West, following a radical increase in the last 30 years. In many EU countries, over half the adult population is overweight, with nearly one-third of all adults categorised as obese. There are also three million children in Europe already in the obese category, with a further 14 million considered overweight. Children have even been observed developing diseases normally associated with old age, such as Type 2 diabetes.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a major problem, it is getting worse and it affects us all. In my own country our National Audit Office has quantified the economic consequences of obesity to be around half a billion pounds annually in direct health costs, plus a further two billion pounds in wider costs to the economy. As taxpayers, we all pay for the problem, so we are all stakeholders in finding a solution. Something must clearly be done, but the issue is, who decides?</p>
      <p sl="de">This thoughtful report from Mrs Ries makes clear that it is not for the EU to decide. There can be help at EU level by sharing best practice, promoting new ideas, etc., because health promotion is an agreed EU competence. Health provision is for Member States. However, responsibility lies not just with Member State governments or food and drink manufacturers, but with parents and individuals themselves. We do not want a big nanny state or a big nanny Europe only permitting us to do what it considers good for us. We want to help people decide for themselves, and that is also why we have referred to the Television Without Frontiers Directive, calling for Member States and the Commission to develop codes of conduct regarding children’s advertising, rather than compulsory controls. For avoidance of doubt, I am referring to the revisions approved by Parliament to that directive last December.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, we should remember that calorie inputs represent only half the problem. I am delighted that the Commissioner in his opening remarks referred to the other half, which was energy output, i.e. that people of all ages should take more exercise. I am also delighted that he referred to the need for governments and others to promote competitive sports and stop selling off school playing fields.</p>
      <p sl="de">Everyone has a responsibility to address the problem. It is time that everyone faced up to it. I congratulate the Commission on its paper and particularly the rapporteur for the care and thought that she has put into this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ries, who has produced a good report and worked in a very collaborative fashion. I should also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs. We have all worked together and I think, Commissioner, you will see that we have a general consensus that something must be done. We are grateful to the Commission for putting this issue at the top of its working agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU cannot do everything. Mr Bushill-Matthews said that. Responsibility is at national level, but there are three areas where the EU could make a difference. The first has already been mentioned: food labelling. What we in the PSE Group want is mandatory back-of-pack labelling of the eight key nutrients. We do not want labelling where the industry itself decides which nutrients it is going to make consumers aware of. Many retail companies and food companies are doing this already and they want a level playing field as well. Many of them want mandatory labelling on the back of the pack, and I think it is something you should be looking at in the revision of your regulations, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="en">We want front-of-pack signposting and clear systems, and we want this to happen soon. As regards advertising, we must not play lip-service to tackling advertising to children. We have to do something real about it. In the UK something real is happening. Our regulator is now stopping advertising of foods that are high in fat, sugar or salt to children, and I think we should look for this across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a key area you could work in, Commissioner, is that of product reformulation. This week is National Salt Awareness Week in the UK. Many food manufacturers have reduced salt successfully in foods in the UK. We want to see more action on that level and we want to see more action on trans fats. Mrs Ries mentioned this. Trans fats are dangerous. They have no nutritional value. They are banned in New York. Denmark has tried to take action. We want you to stop the action against Denmark and to take action at EU level to do something about trans fats. What is the point of adding things to food which have no value?</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the written declaration that I, Mr Higgins, Mr Jørgensen and Mr Bowis have launched this week calling for the EU to act on trans fats. I hope you will look at that, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Ladies and gentlemen, we all basically agree that if we want people to change their unhealthy eating habits and lifestyles, we need to convince them that it is sensible to do so. They need to be re-educated, so to speak. What is crucial in this regard is the manner in which such information is communicated.</p>
      <p sl="sl">When considering appropriate ways in which to get this message across, we could bear in mind the experience we have gained in other areas of awareness-raising. For example, for a long time the general public ignored calls for individuals to take part in the efforts to combat climate change. But things have changed. Public information broadcasts on television have already fallen on fertile ground, but before the message hits home we will obviously need a long period of patient information-giving.</p>
      <p sl="sl">As far as the need to convince young people to abandon unhealthy eating habits is concerned, we should not underestimate the role played by parents because they also need to be re-educated. Once they are convinced that healthy eating is good for their children, they will be able to make a greater contribution themselves.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I have reports from my constituency that some parents, encouraged by our activities in the European Parliament, have obtained authorisation from a school to initiate the process of changing the external circumstances which affect the pupils’ eating habits. For example, they have removed vending machines that dispense unhealthy foods from the immediate vicinity of the school, they have started encouraging children to eat seasonal fruit at school lunches and, would you believe it, the children walk to school every day.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mrs Ries’ report deals with excess weight and obesity which constitute a major problem, especially amongst young people. It is therefore particularly important for the future of European society. Special attention should be paid to the health of children and young people and to the environment in which children spend most of their time, namely school and the home.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In many European countries, the quality of the food provided in educational institution dining halls is not what it should be. Easy access to sugary snacks and excessively sweet drinks makes it difficult to maintain a healthy diet. In addition, there is a tendency for children to be fed highly processed foods at home. One of the reasons for this is that healthy food, that is to say organic food, is expensive. The same is the case with fruit. Action should therefore be taken to increase cofinancing for organic agriculture in the Member States of the Union, especially where soft fruits are concerned. The price of fruit and vegetables would then decrease. The Commissioner referred to this earlier.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Results can only be achieved through a clear health promotion policy accompanied by specific actions. Approaching the problem simply by making declarations will create a mistaken belief that we will muddle through somehow. In fact, if the mechanisms needed to support organic food production are not put in place quickly to ensure that this type of food is widely available, European Union countries will very soon have to increase their expenditure on health protection. Appropriate action in this regard must be taken in the relevant committees, including the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, because soft fruit production is not receiving adequate support and aid from the Union’s budget.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Ries, while the Commissioner has great ambitions to protect people from passive smoking, it is regrettable that no real sense of urgency is as yet apparent in dealing with obesity.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would have liked to see more binding proposals in this Green Paper, of the kind that would have made it clear that we are embarking on a legislative process rather than appealing to industry to regulate itself. We have learned from experience in so many other spheres that these are just stalling tactics.</p>
      <p sl="de">Figures from the WHO, showing that 1.5 billion people around the world are too fat, while 800 million are suffering from hunger, thus making clear not only that the problem is a global one, but also that there is a particular problem within the European Union, where one child in every four is overweight, with 300 000 new cases occurring every year, so it really is more than high time that we took action.</p>
      <p sl="de">However good the proposals and ideas that the report contains, and which we do of course welcome, we would have liked them to include more obligations, and the Commission to have had the courage to propose banning the use of trans fatty acids in industrially produced foods. We know that trans fatty acids do harm, and I am glad that certain Member States have now summoned up the courage to ban them, but I wish the Commission had shown the same nerve in proposing a similar ban throughout the European Union, and I hope that we will be able to remedy that omission. Something else of value would be a ban on the use of toys as enticements to get children to eat junk food in fast-food restaurants and so on. It must, I think, be reiterated once more, loud and clear – and I am going to end on this point – that we really do have to do more about advertising in order to ensure that obesity and the threat of diabetes in children and young people do not get out of hand.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, we are now debating a report on an issue that concerns both the EU Member States and the rich countries of the world in general, albeit in different ways. There is no doubt that excessive weight and obesity are serious problems that have consequences not only for those directly affected but also for society in general.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The question we should ask ourselves, however, is whether this really is a problem that should be dealt with at EU level. I, for my part, do not think that it is. Why should the EU pronounce on where in the Member States schools should be located? Does this House think that people are unaware that fruit and vegetables are good for them or that exercise is important to good health? Paragraph 46 of the report expresses concern at the fall in the consumption of fruit and vegetables within the EU, and this on account of the fact that such products are expensive. That in itself gives one pause for thought, given the huge subsidies received by EU farmers via the common agricultural policy. Is the next step to demand an increase in agricultural aid? Obesity and related diseases are issues for each Member State to get to grips with in the light of the particular conditions that prevail there. Let us instead concentrate on those issues that are suited to this forum.</p>

    <intervention id="3-190" speaker_id="966" name="Jean-Claude Martinez" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ITS Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has almost 100 million fat people, unlike Darfur which only has thin people. Of course, there are 800 million children in the world at risk of dying of hunger, while we, for our part, have 14 million obese children, and the number is rising.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So what, then, can be done, not to stop them looking like figures painted by Fernando Botero, but to save 7% of our health costs each year?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, there is the option of diets. Apart from the Biafran diet, which is too dangerous, there is the Cretan one, but that requires olive oil, fruit, vegetables and white meats and, unfortunately, the overhauled common agricultural policy is destroying our olive trees and putting our market gardeners, tree growers and poultry farmers out of work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are also financial regimes, which are very effective. Indeed, obesity declines the further up the income ladder you go. At the top of the ladder, the rich are all thin. The poor need, therefore, to be made richer if they are also to be made thinner. To achieve this, however, we should need to reconsider the Maastricht austerity pact, which produces people excluded from society and, therefore, fat people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for myself, my only hope is that global warming continues. In that way, European children would get plenty of exercise travelling on their little camels to schools surrounded by sand dunes. I also hope that none of these children with sunken eyes and swollen stomachs will read Mrs Ries’s report, because there are two ways of throwing up: one is to eat too much, and the other is to read a scandalous report like this.</p>

    <intervention id="3-191" speaker_id="4282" name="Renate Sommer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Ries, whose report I found balanced from the very outset and to be one that I can, in principle, endorse.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think I am in a position to judge this, having spent three years examining the problem of increasing obesity among Europeans, particularly children, in connection with the famous – or notorious – issue of nutritional and health statements on food, which the Commissioner will not have forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="de">I see it as particularly important that an holistic approach be taken to the problem, for it is one that has to do with society as a whole; it is not an individual food or the enticing advertising for it that is causing people to be fatter and fatter and hence more and more prone to illnesses. We know that the modern lifestyle is the real problem; we do not get about enough!</p>
      <p sl="de">Is this, though, a problem that can be resolved by legislation? Generally speaking, I still have my misgivings about bans on advertising, for these simply suggest that it is the product that is bad and to be blamed for people’s suffering. The ordinary public see that as dirigisme on the part of the State, the sort of thing that puts people off Europe and leads them to reject it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Whatever became of individuals’ personal responsibility? Have they suddenly become something less than adult? What about parents’ responsibility for their children? That is something we should be insisting on! But Europeans, of course, need better education, comprehensible labelling of food, and information about a healthy lifestyle in order to be able to exercise that responsibility for themselves; after all, parents do want a good and healthy future for their children.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us not, while we on this subject, forget the European principle of subsidiarity. We cannot and must not be more than brokers of ideas between the Member States. It is no part of our function to interfere in such things as schools, which are organised on national – or, as in Germany, on regional – lines. It is a fundamental principle that coercion by force of law is misguided, that pressure produces resistance. By our policies, we must persuade people and carry them with us; that is the only way we will get anywhere.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly very much like to pay tribute to the work of our fellow Member, and I particularly support her proposals on prevention and on education, as well as on physical education of course. These proposals also emphasise the important role of school canteens, which must offer children and adolescents a balanced diet involving healthy produce.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Whenever they have been implemented in our countries, these measures have produced satisfactory results, and several studies indicate that such programmes, designed as they are to prevent obesity and to promote healthy eating, have made it possible to stabilise the obesity rate among overweight young people - a rate that, overall, is otherwise constantly increasing. The figures were pointed out just now. That is what leads me to say that we really must urge the Commission to bring such programmes into much more widespread use.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That being said, I think it necessary to point out that, confronted by this growing public health problem, we must also turn our attention to its underlying causes. The link between obesity and the social environment has been proved many times, the main reason for the link being the cost of food. A French daily newspaper published an article today entitled ‘The rich are slim’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If obesity is mainly connected with the excessive consumption of sugar and fat, with fruit and vegetables eaten in correspondingly fewer quantities, it is certainly because of the cost of the latter. Moreover, it is hard to see how, in this respect, things might improve in the future, as it is well known that the overhauled common agricultural policy will lead to sugar, and even fat, being placed on the market at 25% of previous prices – a development that would lead to their wider use in products made by the food processing industry – while the prices of fruit and vegetables will continue to rise, leaving them still far beyond the reach of the poorest people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why it would be helpful if European Union food policy could complement health policy, with foodstuffs made accessible to everyone and their prices kept down. Nor should the impact of socio-economic policy be ignored, as the choice of food tends to be determined by households’ purchasing power. While waiting, however, for our policies to be revised, we must lose no time in using our food aid programme to ensure that fruit and vegetables can be supplied to those who need them.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, until recently it was considered that excess weight and obesity were problems that mainly affected the United States. It now appears that this new disease affecting industrialised societies is also present in the European Union. As the rapporteur has pointed out, children are the worst affected.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree with all the analyses and statements made in the report. I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that one needs to have access to healthy food if one is to eat healthily. Sadly, healthy food is becoming increasingly difficult to find in the Union. Unfortunately, we have now been held hostage for many years by large agri-food businesses and have been forced to consume what they supply. These large businesses impose a certain type of food production on farmers, leading to the production of ever more food that is ever cheaper and of ever poorer quality. Farmers are encouraged, and indirectly forced, to engage in intensive agriculture. This is detrimental to the environment and to our health.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Amongst other issues, we are today debating obesity and excess weight. Meanwhile, scientists are highlighting an even more alarming situation. They believe that instead of going up, average life expectancy in Europe is going down rapidly. What is even worse is that we are all subsidising the farmers and, in the end, neither we nor they benefit sufficiently from the food produced. Part of the solution to the problems currently under discussion lies in a return to traditional organic farming which, incidentally, is GMO-free.</p>

    <intervention id="3-194" speaker_id="28334" name="Urszula Krupa" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, when attempting to prevent excess weight and chronic diseases related to obesity, priority should be given to improving the mental health of society. Psychological problems lead to overeating and also create a predisposition towards other addictions triggered by poor self-esteem and frustration, which are caused by a stressful lifestyle and frenzied efforts to achieve financial success and improve one’s material standards.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another significant factor responsible for such widespread obesity is unnatural and unhealthy food laced with preservatives and artificially prepared that is now available anywhere and everywhere, 24 hours a day. This disrupts the normal physiological sensations of hunger and satiety. Lack of physical activity due to the mechanisation of daily life also contributes to the aforementioned condition. Awareness of these and other factors should be reinforced by legal provisions. These fall within the competence of Members of Parliament and other decision-makers. It has to be said, however, that labels showing the composition and calorific values of food are not very helpful to a sick person who resorts to food in an attempt to deal with fear or depression.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Ries, and also the shadow rapporteurs, on the work they have done.</p>
      <p sl="es">This Commission initiative of drawing up a Green Paper on promoting healthy diets and physical activity, in relation to preventing obesity, has been extremely well received by all of the actors involved in the process. That reflects the many facets of the problem and the need to adopt measures that involve society as a whole. All of this is laid out very effectively in Mrs Ries's report.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this regard, I would like to point out that the European food industry participates in numerous initiatives and has made specific commitments in different areas of promoting healthy diets and lifestyles, within the framework of the European Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, launched by the European Commission in 2005.</p>
      <p sl="es">More and more such efforts are being made to offer consumers an increasingly wide and varied range of products that meet their needs. We must therefore continue to promote the industry's efforts to innovate, something which will ultimately benefit the consumer. This commitment on the part of the responsible European industry is directly linked to the promotion of healthy diets and lifestyles and is demonstrated in certain examples of self-regulation and marketing. Specifically, in Spain, the industry has signed an agreement to this end with the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs, and that agreement is working very well. It involves promoting nutritional education for consumers, healthy diets and, above all, physical activity, which are very important tools in terms of controlling obesity.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to point out, however, that there is no such thing as good foods or bad foods as such. Everything can and must be eaten. There are healthy diets and not so healthy diets. It all depends on variety. We must insist on the need to make less use of cars, remote controls, video games and so forth, and forget the idea that the whole problem can be solved by means of prohibitions and rules.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is one other thing I would like to point out. We must not demonise overweight people, because if we insist too much on this we will be faced with another problem: anorexia, which is much more serious, if that is possible, particularly for young people.</p>

Everybody also knows that over half the citizens of the European Union are struggling with obesity and excess weight. Every single Member of this House is also aware of these facts.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This being the case, a fundamental question arises. Why is it that so many enlightened individuals, elected to public office by their fellow citizens, support the development of genetically modified food? What are their reasons for giving in to pressure from lobbyists and other interested parties, who are promoting and putting products on the market that are dangerous to human beings and to the natural environment? How can it be that such enlightened individuals are tolerating and, even worse, actually creating the conditions for the globalisation of farming and putting family farms that produce healthy food out of business, whilst damaging the soil and the environment by encouraging large scale farming? Why are so many enlightened individuals acting to the detriment of so many others?</p>

    <intervention id="3-197" speaker_id="2025" name="Françoise Grossetête" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, allow me first of all to congratulate Mrs Ries, who has done a remarkable job on a particularly crucial matter, since, as has already been said, more than 27% of men and 38% of women in Europe are now considered to be overweight or obese. These people suffer psychologically because of other people’s view of them and are at risk of sometimes serious health complications.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As has been pointed out too, obesity affects more than three million children, that is to say one out of every four children in Europe. This statistic should lead us to take action, especially in view of the alarming rate of increase, with almost 400 000 new cases per year. Childhood is a stage of life in which people adopt a large proportion of their eating habits. It is therefore time for the European Union to encourage the Member States – as it is they who are competent in this matter – to take the necessary measures to promote healthy eating and regular physical exercise from childhood onwards.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As recommended by the report, it is imperative for the measures taken by the Member States to be supplemented by the provision of information to consumers and, in particular, young consumers, by which I mean the implementation – not only in the media but also in schools and, in particular, in school canteens – of campaigns to inform consumers about the problems connected with obesity and to raise their awareness of the issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report also emphasises the essential role of health professionals in detecting the risks of chronic diseases linked to obesity, for example diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases, the consequences of which are particularly serious for people who are overweight. Thanks to their privileged relationship with patients, health professionals can, moreover, help educate and inform people about the risks they run and, in that way, play a crucial role.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, one of the big problems raised here is, as previous speakers have said, the fact that people are not eating enough fruit and vegetables. We all know how essential it is to eat fruit and vegetables and, as the report indicates, people cannot eat them because they are too expensive. Let us therefore propose some practical solutions with a view to preventing this intolerable discrimination in the field of health. It is vital that the European Union support as closely as possible the practical measures taken by the Member States when it comes to health and nutrition, and this with a view considerably to reducing this growing phenomenon of obesity in Europe, particularly among children.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the problem dealt with in Mrs Ries’ report does not only affect Europe. For many years now, a number of different countries have been trying to rise to the challenge of healthy eating, physical activity and preventing obesity, excess weight and chronic diseases. Certain firms are doing well promoting miracle products to deal with obesity which actually do more harm than good. Books on various diets state that food is the best cure, whilst there is an increasing number of ‘plump’ people in our society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It seems to me that consumers are not very well informed about food and its consequences. Education, the promotion of healthy eating through the mass media and information on packaging, concerning the nutritional value of individual ingredients, should help citizens. I believe all these measures should be supplemented by testing individuals at risk of becoming obese, to show which substances in food tend to accumulate in the body and which ought to be consumed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members for the very interesting discussion. I am glad to see that we are thinking along the same lines.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all I would like to say that of course we all agree that it is an individual’s choice at the end of the day. We will not put the food on the consumer’s table, and we cannot make them eat or not eat something. But at the same time we have a responsibility to make sure that consumers can make an informed choice, which means education, that is true, but it also means making sure that the information they receive is accurate, truthful, correct and science-based with reference to health claims. I note the call for nutritional labelling. That is something we are working on.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to make sure that consumers get sufficient, understandable information so that they can make their choices. That goes for the citizens and the parents who have to make choices for their children, and they do have a responsibility to say ‘no’ every now and then. This is also an important factor, because we do not want to ban any food. I should like to make that clear. We do not want to exclude any food from the diet of the consumers. I cannot imagine a child growing up and never having an ice cream or a chocolate bar, but they do not have to have ten a day, and this is a question of moderation. This is a challenge for all of us. I also understand that advertising to children is an important issue. I think the compromise reached when we discussed the Television Without Frontiers Directive is a prudent one, but we are also working, as you know, on self-regulation within the industry to make sure that it is responsible in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have always said that it is more practical and much faster to go with self-regulation to a great extent, but we have always said in the Commission that if that does not work, then we will not hesitate to come back and take more binding measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sorry Mrs Breyer is not here, but I have to say that this Commission has been very ambitious and courageous on many issues – I am referring to tobacco and alcohol and also to raising these issues. You will remember two years ago, when I first started presenting these issues on behalf of the Commission, the reaction that came from various sides. But now we are having this debate. We are now discussing a Green Paper. It is a strategy that will formulate what the next actions are going to be.</p>
      <p sl="en">Product reformulation is a very important factor for us. We are working on and studying the issue of trans fatty acids. I can assure you that I know the situation on that. It is a challenge. We have to make sure that if they are removed, nothing worse replaces them. That is something on which we will be working closely with EFSA.</p>
      <p sl="en">The factor that we always have to remember is the social dimension, and the issue of inequality when it comes to health harm arising from obesity, because unfortunately, it does mostly affect lower-income families. That is a reality. So we have an increased responsibility to act in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion I would like to say that I thank you all again for a very interesting debate. I am looking forward to discussing with you our strategy, once it is presented, and how we can achieve practical results and make it work for the benefit of the European consumers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am not in the habit of responding to what is said by the extreme right. What I would just say, however, in response to Mr Martinez’s speech is that it is in Tartuffe, I believe, that Molière tells us that to neglect to respond at a given moment amounts to offering support. I feel obliged to respond, in this House, on behalf of the Commissioner, since Mr Martinez did, after all, use the terms ‘throw up’ and ‘scandalous’ on the subjects of the Green Paper and of the report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have been in this Parliament for seven years, and those are terms that I have never before heard used here. I do not think that this report is particularly controversial or polemical. I think it is fairly consensual, if the speeches made are anything to go by. I therefore totally refute the accusations made or, rather, the insults poured out. It is very clear that Mr Martinez views this scourge only through a North-South prism. That is his own perspective. We do in fact emphasise from the very start – and Mrs Breyer, who is no longer in the House, pointed this out – that, although there are 1 500 million people in the world who suffer from obesity, there are also 800 million who are dying of hunger. To give an example as anecdotal as that used by Mr Martinez, I would also point out that in Micronesia too, in the Samoan Islands, there are people who are obese.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would add in conclusion that, when it comes to humanitarian aid and to showing solidarity, neither I nor anyone else need take lessons from someone like Mr Martinez, given the particular corner of the political chessboard that he inhabits.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The report on promoting a healthy lifestyle points to a problem that concerns about one-third of Europe’s population.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Policies for the prevention and control of overweight, obesity and chronic illness should encompass the entire lifespan from the womb to old age.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Older persons and those with reduced mobility are more affected by being overweight due to the lack of exercise that leads to ill health. As a result, older people on occasion suffer from cumulative detriments.</p>
      <p sl="hu">A good example for this is the spread of diabetes all over the world, the treatment of which risks further complications. Older patients often become victims of reduced mobility by necessity in the course of therapy, thus facing the battle not only with their affliction but also with an added impairment to their living conditions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We know that given its aging population, Europe must put the main emphasis on prevention. But for older people we have to guarantee their right to a chance for a life of human dignity; an indispensable part of that is the right to a healthy life as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I have to point out that different Member States have different capabilities for prevention. The price of healthy living varies from State to State. At the time of setting up prevention, in the course of identifying underprivileged groups one must look at older and handicapped people and adjust the preventive/rehabilitative programmes as much as possible according to local needs.

The obesity growth rate has indeed already reached a dramatic level within the Union. The issue should therefore be addressed seriously by establishing an EU Action Plan for the promotion of healthy lifestyles. Not only have we to cope with the bad consumer habits and the lack of physical activity, but all the economic consequences have to be addressed appropriately.</p>

      <p sl="en">I want to thank Mrs Ries for her work on this report. Many important things have been said about choosing the right diet and living a more active lifestyle, so I will just mention a few of the less obvious but no less important factors in obesity.</p>
      <p sl="en">MSG, which is now in many savoury snacks and processed foods, is increasingly being linked to obesity, especially when eaten by children in their early years of development. Similarly, Aspartame, an artificial sweetener found in many sweet processed foods, is linked with appetite disturbance. Ironically, Aspartame found in many foods labelled ‘diet’ or ‘lite’ can make those who ingest it want to eat more. Both are synthetic chemicals that work by exciting the taste buds. These flavour enhancers can also dull the taste buds, making natural un-enhanced foods unattractive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lack of sleep in children and teenagers has also been identified by a major recent UK study as a primary cause of obesity because of the effect it has on hormones and on metabolism, and a secondary cause because feeling tired encourages kids to snack and discourages them from being physically active.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In connection with the discussion of the Ries report, we have already talked a great deal about the fact that obesity is the fourth leading cause of death in the European Union, and indirectly, it is the first. As a chronic illness, it represents a serious moral and financial burden not only for the person in question, but on both his or her family and all of society, and unfortunately we are seeing the number of those affected constantly increase.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Among the groups at risk, we have to pay special attention to children, since each year the number of obese children in the EU is increasing by more than 400 000. Of course it is obvious that preventive measures can be taken. But what do we mean by prevention?</p>
      <p sl="hu">• Providing society, and especially children, with information and adequate education on healthy eating</p>
      <p sl="hu">• Regular physical activity</p>
      <p sl="hu">• Screening of targeted advertising, and</p>
      <p sl="hu">• Consumer protection.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We rarely think of consumer protection, yet this is a fundamental tool of prevention. We need to ensure that food labels clearly indicate what percentage of daily nutritional requirements is consumed when eating the item.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In the case of foods with low nutritional value and yet which are high in carbohydrates – such as chocolate, sweetened drinks, and so on – it should be made clearly visible (in the manner of tobacco products) that excessive consumption of these can lead to diabetes and to heart and circulatory disease.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0405/2006) by Mrs Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on limitation periods in cross-border disputes involving injuries and fatal accidents (2006/2014(INI).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-209" speaker_id="4544" name="Diana Wallis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, in opening this discussion I would like us to imagine ourselves as one of those people we represent, perhaps off on holiday to another European country or a young person off to study somewhere else, or somebody off to a business meeting in another European capital, or even to work on a building site. All of these are simple everyday scenarios that sadly contain the potential for mishaps, for accidents involving personal injury or even death in another country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also give you some figures by way of example: in 2004 alone in Germany, just one of our 27 Member States, there were 50 000 road traffic accidents involving personal injury and a foreign national from another European country. In the UK last year, one firm of lawyers alone reported opening some 6000 files on cross-border personal injury accidents in Europe. Well, you might say, let the lawyers get on with it. But the lawyers have come to us with a problem. All legal actions are subject to a period of time within which they have to be commenced, a so-called limitation period. All good lawyers are training in their national system to observe and watch these time limits very carefully. Otherwise the whole claim is dead, finished, struck out. It is one of the nightmares of every young lawyer to miss a limitation period deadline. Of course, they all know their own, but can they be expected to know the intricacies of 27 national systems? And there are intricacies, sometimes involving differing definitions of what is a civil or criminal claim. More importantly, the time limit itself varies tremendously, between one and thirty years across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is bad enough to be an accident victim in another Member State. But then to fall a secondary victim to a technical difficulty over limitation periods which then stop any claim being made is, as we say in English, really a case of adding insult to injury. This is a real, practical and growing problem as we encourage free movement of persons. I hope that the very limited numbers I have been able to quote give an idea of the problem which in reality must be multiplied many times across the Member States of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have stated above, legal practitioners, insurers and victims alike have come to us with this problem asking that we approach you, Commissioner, to look at a range of possibilities. We know the issue is sensitive. It concerns national procedural law, so any intervention at European level should be strictly limited to the cross-border cases only.</p>
      <p sl="en">It may be that for these cases a harmonised limitation period of say four years might be considered, or maybe we should adopt clear conflict of laws rules. Whatever the shape of the ultimate solution, practitioners and claimants alike need certainty if valuable and personally critical claims are not to be in danger of being lost because of differing procedural rules that can really cause individual and family misery if things go awry.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a practical problem arising out of the use by our citizens of free movement and all that the internal market offers. On our side we should be prepared to respond with a system of European civil justice which does not, as I have said earlier, just add insult to injury.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope, Commissioner, that you will feel able to respond to this initiative which has been the subject of a good deal of positive lobbying from citizens and others towards Members during the weeks leading up to this debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">I think this report is a very interesting attempt to deal with a very difficult subject. Mrs Wallis is to be congratulated on trying to see a way into a general European solution to the differences in limitation periods as they relate, as she just said, to actions for damages for personal injury and death. This is of particular concern to citizens who have the misfortune to suffer road traffic accidents in countries other than those in which they live. But it could also apply in other matters, such as medical claims and product liability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having said that, the area of limitation is a complex matter, as the rapporteur also acknowledged. It is very closely linked to prescription, which is not dealt with in the report. Any further work on the subject would need to deal with prescription, since the majority of European legal systems solve the problem of time limits through the use of prescription rather than limitation periods. The UK system uses both.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am ready, I am open to examining this question in the future, taking into account the different legal nature of limitation and prescription, and the fact that the Treaty base proposed excludes harmonisation of internal law, which, in large measure, is what is implied by the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to be very frank in pointing out that we will also have to take into account the priorities established in our current work programme, which will also have to be integrated in line with the human resources available in the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">That said, I can see that this very new point put by the rapporteur should be left open for further discussions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the rapporteur has done excellent work with this report. There is much to applaud in this initiative. This, like our rapporteur said, is a practical solution to a practical problem. For one, it concerns one of the unfinished areas of the single market: how people’s rights travel with them when they exercise their four freedoms inside the Union. The European Parliament must point out any anomalies and invoke its Treaty rights to prompt the Commission into action. Secondly, it concerns justice and home affairs. People need as much certainty as possible about their rights and obligations in order to engage in any society. Engaging across borders in always going to be more uncertain than doing so at home but we have a duty as EU legislators to address these concerns. The mere fact that the disparate national laws do not allow for a quick uniform solution is no excuse for inaction.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament is doing its part by opening the debate today. The Commission should follow with a proposal and the Member States should assume their sovereign responsibility and enact the necessary changes, employing the passerelle clause of the Nice Treaty if needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we have to be careful how we approach this. While my group strongly supports the report of Mrs Wallis, we cannot support her amendments to it. We believe it is too early in this report to point towards overly-harmonised and specific definitions of, for example, date of knowledge, interrupted proceedings, and special rights of minors. We do not believe them to be fully consistent at this stage with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Let us first hear about the Commission’s inquiry as to what kinds of cross-border problems exist in the domain of limitation periods in cases of personal injury and then move on to the concrete definitions. For example, if the inquiry were to show that there is not such a huge discrepancy between Member States’ rules, the country of origin approach, as the report suggests, might show the way. Personally I would support this approach.</p>

      <p sl="es">I shall speak in Spanish, and this is the first speech in Spanish, but I believe that the Commissioner understands my language perfectly.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to point out that the Castilian version of the report says ‘recomendaciones destinadas a la Comisión sobre la prescripción en conflictos transfronterizos’. In other words, it does not use the phrase ‘estatuto de limitaciones’, because, according to my knowledge of Anglo-Saxon law, the expression ‘statute of limitations’, at least in Spanish, is translated as ‘prescripción’.</p>
      <p sl="es">I know that the Italians are very sharp and precise lawyers, and this issue probably deserves to be discussed in greater depth, although I agree that the origins of the two institutions differ.</p>
      <p sl="es">In any event, I believe that Mrs Wallis’s report reflects the European Parliament’s desire to push the Commission in a certain direction. Neither we nor the report are asking the Commission to present a legislative proposal quickly, but I believe that certain stages such as the one indicated in paragraph1, which states that an investigation into what is happening is needed should be carried out.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Mrs Wallis has said, there are currently thousands of people, or hundreds of thousands of people, crossing national borders, and I believe that Mr Frattini was right on another issue, and that is that we should not just focus on cross-border accidents or incidents, but on all of those cases in which, as a result of a series of situations - such as medical treatment or accommodation - a person suffers damages in one country and the problem of limitations arises in another country.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that we should extend the possibilities as far as possible and that for the moment ― and perhaps Mrs Kauppi is right ― it is probably not yet time to go into details, but the Commission should at least be aware that we elected representatives of the peoples of the European Union believe that it should adopt certain kinds of initiative in relation to this issue.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the rapporteur proposes, this kind of initiative should begin with acquiring proper knowledge of the situation, so that we have a true picture of that situation and of the possibilities available to us for legislating in this field.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Wallis for taking this initiative aimed at harmonising the rules on commencement of running time and limitation periods for claims relating to property and personal injury in cross-border disputes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Road travel has increased significantly of late, partly due to the various enlargements of the European Union, and also to people becoming more affluent and being able to travel freely. Unfortunately, this has resulted in more people being involved in road accidents. At present, under national civil systems, limitation periods vary from the very short, such as one year, to the very long, such as 30 years. This is not helpful for the protection of the injured parties, who are often unaware of the variations in limitation periods in various countries and submit claims for damages to foreign courts after the expiry of the relevant period. What happens then is that the court rejects the application and the individuals, whose health or property has been affected, are unable to assert their rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Harmonisation would help with the introduction of reliable and transparent principles, which would allow claims to be asserted by both the injured parties and by their legal representatives. As a lawyer myself, I am well aware of the situation the latter can find themselves in. That is why I fully support this initiative.</p>

    <intervention id="3-216" speaker_id="28301" name="Tadeusz Zwiefka" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Wallis very much for the work she has undertaken. In particular, I recall the special meetings she arranged for the Committee on Legal Affairs, enabling us to fully understand the task before us, which is of great significance for all European Union citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I cannot agree with the Commissioner that the simple explanation for the delay and postponement of this legislative initiative lies in the formal inability to interfere in national legal systems. Whenever I take the floor in this House, and the opportunity arises, I stress that the fundamental duty of every parliament and every institution with legislative power is to create simple legislation that is readily understandable and serves the citizens’ interests. In other words, it is incumbent on us to create legislation that makes the citizens’ lives easier.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At present, there are 27 different legal systems to deal with with regard to limitation periods for pecuniary claims related to different types of accident. It is therefore the duty of the European Parliament, the European Commission and also of the Council to find a way of rectifying the situation and creating new legislation that would make life easier. It is difficult to explain to a claimant or to a deceased person’s family that, formally, the case has long since been closed, and that all we can do is to commiserate with them because all claims submitted after the expiry of the limitation period have to be rejected.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore appeal to the European Commission and ask it to use all the means at its disposal and all its legislative competence to find a legal solution to this problem. I am firmly convinced that the individual Member States believe that this matter, which affects hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of European citizens, must be resolved quickly and appropriately. If it is our intention that European Union citizens should pursue activities that involve moving between countries, we must come up with solutions that make it easier for them to do so.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Wallis for all the work she has put into this European Parliament draft resolution.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At present, there are significant discrepancies across the territory of the European Union with regard to the time periods applicable in cross-border disputes involving injuries and fatal accidents. We must acknowledge that this is the case. As the rapporteur rightly pointed out, the problem is a complex one. It encompasses both the limitation periods and the commencement of running time. Limitations, the time period for presenting information concerning the event, the possibility of suspending or halting the course of the period, as well as the examination of evidence and the process for lodging objections concerning limitations are also involved. Major discrepancies can have undesirable consequences for accident victims, making it difficult for them to assert their rights in court. Priority must be given to guaranteeing legal certainty for all European Union citizens and making it easier for them to enjoy the freedoms laid down in the Treaties. I therefore urge the Commission to submit a draft legislative proposal to the European Parliament. The proposal should take account of the wise recommendations appended to this draft resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Wallis for an excellent and much-needed report which responds to the needs of the victims of various types of accidents. Mrs Wallis rightly highlighted that the Union is open to its citizens, who may travel and relocate without any restrictions. Unfortunately, this is associated with an increased probability of accidents. Accident victims often suffer twice over, first as a result of the accident itself and then because they are unfamiliar with the law of the country where the accident took place. Limitation periods are therefore often exceeded and it becomes impossible to assert legitimate claims. Accordingly, we should endorse the proposal before us, so that a minimum limitation period for cross-border disputes involving accidents can be established across the Union. The proposal protects the victims’ interests, and provides them with better opportunities to exercise their rights. It therefore truly deserves our support. I trust that, further to this report, the Commission will very soon table specific proposals to protect the interests of people to whom fate has been unkind.</p>

      <p sl="en">The recommendation is not intended to substitute national legislation but to take into account when proceedings involve parties who reside or are domiciled in different countries of the European Union, or a party residing or domiciled in a non-community state, or a choice between the laws of different countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is becoming essential for principles governing limitation periods to be laid down clearly in an appropriate form for claims to damages.</p>
      <p sl="en">The general limitation period which is being proposed is four years, except where the proper law of the claim provides for a longer period. This general principle may cause problems, since the national legislation may cater for a shorter period, in which case there would be a discriminatory scenario when claims for damages arise between nationals or persons domiciled in the same state and when the issue relates to parties residing or domiciled in different states.</p>
      <p sl="en">The same may be said for interruption, suspension and methods of calculating when the period limitation initiates.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having stated the above it is better to have clear regulations for cross-border disputes which at the same time differ from national legislations. Perhaps the dilemma can start to be solved if national legislation is harmonised with the proposed regulations.</p>

    <intervention id="3-222" speaker_id="4393" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0416/2006) by Věra Flasarová, on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on educational discrimination against young women and girls (2006/2135(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-223" speaker_id="28336" name="Věra Flasarová" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate having had the opportunity to draw up a report on discrimination against young women and girls regarding access to education, and I would like to thank everyone in the committee for their helpful cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Education has always been of enormous value to society. In the past, people saw access to education in the same way as access to wealth – it was a selective matter. Those without wealth or privilege faced difficulties when it came to securing an education. The situation was even worse for foreigners, immigrants, dissenters and people of other races. Women, too, had their access to education and in particular higher education hindered by prejudice and the sharply demarcated social environment in which most were obliged to move.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Archaic stereotypes that have persisted for thousands of years do not surrender easily to the needs of civilisation. They live on in people’s thoughts and behaviour even though nobody admits to them publicly. I would not wish to rummage around in anyone’s conscience, but scattered fragments from the Middle Ages, if I may put it as simplistically as that, have remained with us. If that were not the case, if our culture had deeply rooted principles of equality, we would not find ourselves having to address this problem.</p>
      <p sl="cs">My report was based on the idea that education is a lifelong process. Nevertheless, as you will no doubt agree, the best time for gaining qualifications, and for personal and career development is when one is young. It is a process that should be free from all kinds of discrimination, the worst of which are the economic restrictions affecting, in particular, the weakest sections of society. If we are not capable of eliminating the impact of the economic handicaps affecting boys and girls equally, we should at least reduce that impact as much as we can, along with those forms of discrimination that are addressed in this report.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Evidence from various EU countries has shown that at the start of the educational process, factors of gender disadvantage are scarcely apparent. School attendance is compulsory and the factors that hamper children’s development affect both genders equally. I refer in particular to handicaps such as diagnosed disorders, parental neglect and misdiagnoses, which lead to children being excluded from standard education systems. These are highly significant factors. Discrimination against young women and girls in education is nevertheless spoken of only in passing. We know that girls and young women are just as gifted and as motivated towards achieving higher education as their male counterparts. The ratio of male to female students is by and large equal. In some kinds of higher education establishment, girls are even in the majority, which reflects the social stereotypes whereby some occupations are considered typically male and others female. We often hear about systems that foster other forms of discrimination such as low wages in so-called female occupations. It can be argued that gender-specific handicaps faced by girls and young women have their roots in the dilemma over whether to start a family and raise children or whether to continue studying and develop a professional life. While young men can go on to gain further qualifications after they have finished studying – indeed it is even expected of them – young women have this dilemma to grapple with.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The modern trend among both sexes is to postpone settling down and starting a family. This is due not only to changes in lifestyle, but also to the difficulty of reconciling family and career, particularly when there are small children to care for. The world of work is enormously competitive and requires unstinting commitment. This is where women fall behind men in statistical terms. In proportion to men, the number of women reaching the upper echelons of higher education and of scientific establishments is falling. Much smaller still is the number of women taking up leadership posts. These are the manifestations of gender discrimination in the area of access to education. To an extent, however, discrimination also affects women who have already achieved a high level of education and high social positions. They cannot win, even when they have overcome all obstacles, because society still automatically associates professional success with men and looks upon women moving in this small forbidden area as intruders.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In spite of all the problems faced by successful women in the workplace and at home with the family, I view the situation with optimism. I feel that as time goes on the problem will disappear of its own accord. It still remains true, however, that unless we can find effective ways of helping young women in particular to make the link between education and career growth, on the one hand, and motherhood and the family on the other, discrimination against women regarding access to education, and all of the problems that go with it, will persist.</p>

    <intervention id="3-224" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Ján Figeľ" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Flasarová and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality on this excellent report. It represents a comprehensive and balanced overview of the problems women and young girls face in education and later in their professional life.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the fight against all forms of discrimination is a core principle of the European Union, the fight against gender discrimination has gone a step further. All Commission departments must take gender differences into account when preparing proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the field of education, there has been a positive evolution, as your report also states. In the European Union there is no discrimination in access to education for young girls, and girls often achieve better marks than boys. Nonetheless, there are serious problems in some parts of the population. The report points to vulnerable groups where gender differences may combine with other factors to exclude women and girls from the full benefit of education.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our first priority is to attend to the needs of these groups and to point to effective solutions. Our work will focus on efficiency and equity in education and training systems, because gender discrimination is a component of a wider social and cultural problem and requires wide-ranging measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2007 we will produce two major communications. The first is on pre-primary education. Early-start programmes produce short-term results, but they also build lifelong learning capacities and develop the values that reject discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second communication this year will address education and immigration. Immigration contributes to European growth and competitiveness. However, PISA results show that immigrant children tend to have lower school results. In some cultures young girls face specific handicaps.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the new Lifelong Learning Programme, equality of opportunities is a transversal priority. Its first call for proposals has just been published. The progress report on education and training 2010 for the whole decade will take another look at the benchmark on science, mathematics and technology and at the gender balance in these careers. I am happy to report that the initial target has been achieved – actually this is the only target out of five benchmarks in which we are progressing quite well in the 27 EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">My services and those of my colleague, Mr Potočnik, in research, have worked together for some time to fight gender discrimination in scientific and technical careers. This work can benefit other sectors and we will build on it.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the field of the information society, the digital divide is growing. As your report points out, women can benefit from new technology. My colleague, Mrs Reding, is leading an initiative on e-Inclusion, which takes gender issues into account, and the European Social Fund has a strong tradition in fighting gender discrimination. The regulations for the period 2007-2013 can fund actions in all the aspects pinpointed in your report. These are considerable opportunities for education and training that are provided for by the structural funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me thank you once again for your report.</p>

      <p sl="hu">One of the crucial questions concerning human resources is that of education. Discrimination in all areas is counterproductive to the development of society, but is especially so in the field of education. I would like to emphasise two aspects of this subject.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The report, which I particularly value for its balance, speaks of the most common forms of discrimination. It does not, however, mention that child poverty and the associated early school leaving create a situation that renders lifelong learning impossible, for the foundations are lacking and therefore there is nothing to build on at later stages. It is true that, according to the statistics, in EU Member Sates early school leaving is higher among boys, but we need to recognise that the reason for this is mainly poverty, which affects women more severely than men, and that this is all the more true in the case of single parents, whose significant majority is increasing. In fragmented families the risk of poverty is greater as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The other concern which the report highlights is the situation of those suffering multiple discrimination, namely women from the various minority groups. It is unquestionable that discrimination in education against national and ethnic minorities, the Roma, people living with handicaps, as well as those struggling with learning disorders such as dyslexia, dyspraxia or dyscalculia is a daily problem in most Member States. The anti-discrimination directives of the European Union makes it a condition that governments take measures aimed at achieving equality, yet in several Member States such an initiative comes up against a narrowly understood constitutional ban on discrimination. Thus we have witnessed in the case of one Member State the Constitutional Court rule unconstitutional the article of the anti-discrimination law which would have allowed for interim positive measures to be taken in the interests of equal opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is my conviction that without such interim measures, it is impossible to create equal opportunities.</p>

      <p sl="es">Of all the obstacles which are still in place and which are mentioned in the report, I would like to refer to three in particular.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, the gender-based digital divide. Jointly with the Member States and within the context of the Lisbon Strategy, the Commission must take appropriate measures to ensure that women have access to information and communication technologies and benefit from them under equal conditions, because, if Europe is to be a knowledge-based economy, information and communication technologies must play a fundamental role in our employment and competitiveness strategy and women must participate under equal conditions with men. In this regard, it is important to stress that there are fewer women in the educational, scientific and technological fields.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, like the last speaker, I wish to mention school leaving, which is higher amongst girls, and it is therefore recommended that Member States take measures to encourage girls to remain in school as long as boys and to complete their education. The necessary measures must also be taken to remove the obstacles faced by women when it comes to continuing their higher education and their life-long learning.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, in accordance with the Declaration on the Specific Characteristics of Sport adopted by the Nice Council of December 2000, I would like to emphasise the fact that more account should be taken of the social, educational and cultural functions of sport and hence the need to eliminate the discrimination suffered by women in sport as well. As we have done on other occasions, we must condemn situations such as the Wimbledon prizes, which clearly discriminate against women.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Flasarová, for her very important report on discrimination against young women and girls in the field of education. The EU Member States no longer have any legal restrictions that discriminate against girls and women when it comes to access to education. As in so many other contexts where gender equality is concerned, however, what actually happens is governed by structures other than the purely formal rules. That is why, in spite of the formal rights they have, girls and women are under-represented among those who take their studies or academic careers further. It is, then, structures and old, ingrained patterns of gender stereotyping that determine the framework for women’s and girl’s education. That is why the rapporteur rightly focuses on the need for a strategy that has to start early and that requires teachers and other staff in schools to receive training in gender equality. Increased awareness, knowledge and training pave the way for building a just society for all, irrespective of gender, class and ethnicity.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as I only have one minute to speak on the issue of discrimination against women and girls in education, I shall do so from a Polish perspective. I should like to point out that since the economic changes which took place in Poland in connection with its accession to the European Union, financial reasons have become the major contributing factor to discrimination in education.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Society is now far less cohesive, wages are low, industry has disappeared, unemployment is rife and there are no job opportunities for new graduates. All this has led to unprecedented numbers of young people having to leave their homeland and seek work abroad, a humiliating experience. The situation is aggravated by a reduction in the number of places available at state higher education institutions, although this is compensated for by places available in private establishments. However, not everyone can afford to attend the latter. In this context, any effort to investigate potential minor instances of discrimination involving girls’ access to higher education becomes a superficial approach. It amounts to creating problems where there are none. In fact, the situation of girls in Poland may be more favourable than elsewhere because Poles treat women with special respect, as a consequence of their devotion to Our Lady, which stems from their Catholic faith.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, education is a basic right that should not be undermined for any reason, be it cultural, social, material or otherwise. It is a condition essential to the future blossoming of individuals and, above all, to their economic and social integration. It is the responsibility of the Member States to eliminate all inequalities and to create the necessary conditions to enable everyone - both men and women - to have access to education and to choose their profession and the direction that their profession will take without having to face discrimination of any kind.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Regrettable though it may be that the report is rather confusingly structured, Mrs Flasarová’s report is nonetheless full of suggestions for doing more to promote equality between women and men in the field of education. I congratulate the rapporteur and hope that the adoption of the report during the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All will lend still more weight to the European Parliament’s proposals aimed at eliminating lingering stereotypes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In spite of the fact that equality between men and women now constitutes a basic principle in our societies, sexist stereotypes and prejudice towards women do still exist and are responsible for forms of segregation and discrimination that are quick to have an effect on women’s choice of studies, as well as on the length of time they spend in education. If sexist stereotypes still undeniably constitute an obstacle to women’s access to education and limit their choice of studies, the perpetuation of certain models, and in particular the preponderance of women in certain forms of training, for example in the professions of nurse and primary school teacher, also leads to an imbalance that hampers the progress of women.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, school plays a very important role in establishing and promoting equal rights for girls and boys, irrespective of their origins. Not only pupils but also teachers need to be made more aware of the importance of equality in all areas. The rapporteur rightly notes the important role of the media in shaping public perception of, and attitudes towards, the professional training and development of young women.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wanted to conclude by noting that women’s access to lifelong education is also a key factor in their contribution to the knowledge-based society, as is the possibility of less conventional qualifications acquired at various stages of life being recognised.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Doresc să o felicit pe dna Vlasarova pentru raportul realizat. Pentru a deveni cea mai dinamică şi competitivă economie bazată pe cunoaştere, este imperativ ca în Uniunea Europeană educaţia şi accesul la cunoaştere să fie prioritare. În Uniunea Europeană familiile cu venituri mici locuiesc în zone mai sărace, adesea situate departe de locul de muncă sau de instituţii educative, fapt ce adânceşte polarizarea socială şi inegalităţile dintre persoane. Statele membre trebuie să se mobilizeze pentru combaterea abandonului şcolar şi ridicarea nivelului de formare al tinerilor.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Pentru ca tot mai multe femei să aibă o activitate profesională, este necesar accesul la învăţarea continuă şi existenţa serviciilor şi infrastructurilor care să permită concilierea vieţii profesionale cu viaţa de familie, în special pentru familiile mono-parentale.</p>
      <p sl="ro">În România, noul stat membru al Uniunii Europene, 55% din absolvenţii de învăţământ superior sunt femei şi 48% din salariaţi, iar 38% din companii sunt conduse de femei. În privinţa rromilor, în România există clase de copii de origine rromă, care învaţă în limba rromani de la grădiniţă şi până la învăţământul profesional. De asemenea, există condiţii create pentru educaţia copiilor cu nevoi speciale încă de la ciclul preşcolar.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Anul 2007 este anul egalităţii de şanse, iar educaţia reprezintă elementul esenţial pentru viitorul Uniunii Europene.

      <p sl="sk">() We often come across the opinion that maternity and family are natural and even insuperable obstacles that prevent many women from gaining higher education and academic degrees, or pursuing lifelong education. Are they really obstacles? Yes, they are. However, these are obstacles resulting from our way of life and it is possible to overcome them.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am a physician and a mother. I know that studying medicine is a life-long challenge. Furthermore, I am aware of how much time and energy women dedicate to their families and children. But I also know that women can make outstanding physicians. I would like every young woman to be able to opt freely to study medicine if she feels it is her duty to heal others. I would like her to be able to decide in the full knowledge that in the future she will make a good physician and a good wife and mother at the same time. The report on the discrimination against young women and girls in the field of education deals with these issues as well. It points out the fact that the values of family and maternity should not be at odds with those of education. Maternity is the natural mission and desire of every woman. Unless we manage to harmonise the roles of women as mothers and professionals in everyday life, the European promise of equal opportunities will remain hollow.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude to my fellow MEP, Mrs Flasarová. Together with my colleagues from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, we greatly appreciate her work on this report. We unanimously supported her in the Committee on Women’s Rights, and I would like to call on the plenary to approve this report as well.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, access to education is a fundamental human right, but unfortunately it often amounts to little more than empty words. Both sexes have similar opportunities to acquire higher education, and female graduates actually outnumber their male counterparts. However, there are significantly fewer women than men at the higher levels of academic careers. Women represent only 43% of doctoral graduates and barely 15% of university professors.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is harder for women to continue in education because of their limited opportunities to access lifelong learning, and also because of their domestic commitments. The Member States should put in place a flexible adult education policy, especially in terms of adjusting course programmes to suit the needs of women on maternity leave. It is also essential to take advantage of new technologies in the field of education in order to meet women’s needs. One example would be using the Internet to facilitate distance learning.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition to this, it is important to undertake a policy assessment concerning equal access to education, on the basis of statistical data including gender breakdown. This would help to resolve the problem of continuing inequalities as regards gaining qualifications, especially in higher and adult education. In addition, the European Commission and the Member States should try to combat popular stereotypes that cause women to be discriminated against in the workplace. In particular, it should be made easier for women to gain access to decision-making roles in economic, political and scientific fields. In conclusion, I should like to thank Mrs Flasarova, the rapporteur, for a well-prepared document.</p>

      <p sl="sk">() We may attribute it to the mass media, but gender stereotypes determine in advance the roles of men and women in society. Only rarely do journalists ask successful men in their interviews, ‘How do you manage to balance your career with the need to take care of the family?’ – and certainly not as often as they ask successful women. It is considered quite normal that in most cases it is the woman who sacrifices her career and gives precedence to the family. In some cases child care is a factor that diminishes the interest of women in continuing their education. Many women interrupt their studies due to maternity, and subsequently give up the idea of further education.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is surprising that, while at the beginning of higher education programmes women outnumber men by a ratio of 59% to 41%, only 43% manage to gain a master's degree and a mere 15% achieve the level of professorship. In this context I welcome Mrs Flasarova’s report, which provides a detailed analysis of the levels of education achieved by women and their chances of placement in the labour market. At the same time the report focuses on specific elements of discrimination against young women and girls in the area of education. Education is a basic right and a key instrument of social integration. It is a recipe for dealing with poverty, especially for women coming from vulnerable social groups.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I therefore consider it important that the education programmes funded by the European Union are implemented and made use of, as they will serve to increase awareness of gender issues and of equal access to education at all levels. In conclusion, I would like to call on Member States to facilitate women’s access to education through flexible education programmes, for example, by means of computer-assisted correspondence courses, and to thus ensure the better integration of women into society.</p>

      <p sl="en">The access of Roma children throughout Europe to equal education is extremely limited, and many do not attend school at all. Those children that do go to school are systematically put into segregated schools or ‘special classes’ for the disabled, which are characterised by inferior quality of instruction and inadequate physical conditions. In some countries over 60% of Roma children are in special schools or remedial learning programmes as a result of inadequate teaching and testing methods.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Figel’ has often accentuated the fact that education is the very best strategy for integration. I believe that the EU should not only provide a basis upon which to enhance discussion of the topic, but it should also channel it towards a European strategy on Roma rights. Preventing the marginalisation of the Roma must be the goal, and the tool – education – is accessible already, yet it is not efficiently used.</p>
      <p sl="en">Segregation is a tool of disintegration and it costs the European taxpayers a lot. Especially in the light of demographic changes, the Roma could be recognised as a source of economic potential if governments were to take the steps necessary to allow Roma to realise their potential through education and access to the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The basis of European society, founded on solidarity, is access to rights, resources and services, including various forms of education, without any discrimination. Access by all segments of society to education and instruction, and the abolition of gender-based stereotyping, are preconditions for economic growth and increased competitiveness. They are also necessary to promote social integration, to help reach Europe’s demographic and competitive aims.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Education contributes to the fulfilment of people’s potential, enables them to adapt to the ever newer challenges of a knowledge-based labour market, remain marketable, avoid the danger of marginalisation and acquire useful knowledge to satisfy the continuously changing demands of the market. Women aspire to the same things, but stubborn gender stereotypes make their careers more difficult in nearly all fields, even in education.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The low level of basic training, unemployment, or else limited life choices due to various factors, may lead to the marginalisation of large groups of people, especially as regards women. For this reason, access to a variety of educational forms and opportunities plays a key role in the fight against social marginalisation, in the struggle for women’s integration in the labour force and in battling the dangers of alienation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Since investing in education and training takes a long time to pay off, governments, both local and national, have to make long-term plans while making decisions about their spending priorities. It is worth it, for it is in the service of a Europe built on solidarity and prosperity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is so hugely flattering to speak to an almost empty Chamber!</p>
      <p sl="en">The Cook Islands, the Fiji Islands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu – exotic places, fantastic places, so distant, so far away, so romantic and so on, but actually they are in need. All these countries are part of the Pacific Islands. Historically, Europe has had the strongest influence in the Pacific region through colonial rule. The end of the Second World War hastened the end of European colonialism, but the relationship continued. Through the Lomé Convention and the Cotonou Agreement, the Pacific region is now linked to us and our daily lives through the ACP.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even if the population of the Pacific Islands is small, we have to bear in mind that the Pacific Ocean itself covers nearly 30% of the planet’s surface. Their location, while bringing huge benefits to the region through fisheries and tourism, means they find themselves isolated through a tyranny of distance. However, advances in technology, air travel and infrastructure have helped to alleviate their economic circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another thing they should consider – and I am very pleased to see the Commission in full strength here – is that the English-speaking digital economy may provide another way forward for them to provide business process outsourcing and knowledge process outsourcing services to the United States and Australasia.</p>
      <p sl="en">The region shows an economic contrast, with annual GDP per capita ranging from EUR 500 to EUR 8000. This is like comparing Somalia to Bulgaria. Therefore, the strategy for the region must have a certain flexibility in order to ensure that the development assistance is channelled according to national and regional parities and to achieve maximum benefit in both the richer and poorer islands.</p>
      <p sl="en">For many Pacific islanders, agricultural products are their primary exports to international markets, supplying commodities such as sugar, copra, bananas, coconuts and palm oil. However, they face challenges such as global warming, which is a huge challenge for them. We have also given them another interesting problem: economic partnership agreements – EPAs – which they have to contend with. They tell me that they are losing revenue through their intra-regional customs union. What are they to do? Do we help them, support them? Do we create infrastructure so that they can come out of this problem? We need to think about this.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the major challenges faced by the region is the sustainable management of fisheries. Tuna is especially abundant in the Pacific, with a third of the world’s catch caught in the Pacific Islands, valued at EUR 2 billion. Are we protecting their catch? Are we making sure that the benefits of their catches go back to their people? I do not know. Maybe the Commission should look at this. I do not know exactly where their catch is going. They should not be as poor as they are if they are getting EUR 2 billion for those catches.</p>
      <p sl="en">My report stresses that any encouragement of tourism in the region must go hand-in-hand with increased local ownership of the tourist sector. I stress that in the majority of cases only the richer countries, with more developed infrastructure and more frequent air connections, attract significant numbers of tourists each year. In these cases, for the poorer countries, development assistance must continue to be used to finance infrastructure and to encourage sustainable tourism. In this regard, why have we not looked at creating a Pacific hub, a regional hub? We could create a hub, like Dubai. After all, what was Dubai? Dubai was full of sand 20 years ago! Today it is a hub for regional air transport. Sheik Maktoum and those intelligent Arabs have created something quite extraordinary. Why do we not that in the Pacific for these islanders?</p>
      <p sl="en">My report recommends that the more developed Pacific island countries should continue to deliver local processing, thereby creating more employment. They should explore the possibility of the European Investment Bank giving soft loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, to add value to their exports.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of the islands are politically fragile, as we have seen through the many military coups in Fiji. I am sick of hearing about military coups in Fiji, but they need to be able to feel that they are going to have a future as two communities together, and we need to help them with that. They must stop or we should stop the aid. That is a threat, but we need to have some sort of quid pro quo on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Provision of good governance throughout the Pacific is vital, and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals we must also achieve a certain measure of mutuality. In Papua New Guinea, for example, and the Solomon Islands, they have problems with regard to AIDS. The EU, as a major donor to the region, has an opportunity to create a strategy that will support the island countries of the Pacific in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and bringing their people to realise their full potential. Our report is just the start.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the report on EU relations with the Pacific Islands, and I especially want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Deva, on his results.</p>
      <p sl="en">When my colleague, Commissioner Michel, took the initiative to have the first ever EU strategy for our relations with the Pacific ACP States prepared, he did so because these countries are becoming increasingly important and because they are facing difficult challenges. We can benefit from closer contacts with the Pacific, as the region is of global significance and we can contribute significantly to its development. Parliament’s report clearly reflects this and it points out important avenues forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">These countries are mostly remote, relatively poor, small and have become independent fairly recently. Most have strong population growth. They have a difficult balancing act to perform between tradition and the pressures of modernity. Globalisation is an opportunity for them, but also carries risks for their cultural heritage.</p>
      <p sl="en">In many countries in the Pacific, democracy has difficult growth conditions and, at the same time, the Pacific needs high-quality governance to move forward. For this reason, your commitment to their democracies, international exposure and contacts is very important.</p>
      <p sl="en">They have significant natural resources, such as oil, gas, fish and tropical wood, as well as fantastic biodiversity. The Pacific Ocean is so important that it must be considered as a global public good. This gives the Pacific Island countries opportunities on the international scene and prospects for the future. However, climate change threatens many of the islands, even whole countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The overseas countries and territories serve as bridges between Europe and the Pacific and between our cultures. Where the Pacific countries have needs and we have comparative advantages, there we propose to assist. We have identified the ‘blue-green’ theme as the cornerstone of the focus on the sustainable management of the region’s natural resources. In addition, we have committed ourselves to a strengthened political relationship, more focused development action and more efficient aid delivery.</p>
      <p sl="en">In our communication we foresaw that the Pacific countries would face more problems in the future if a number of significant trends were not reversed. Last year alone there were serious security problems and political crises in the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga and Fiji. The problems are so difficult and severe than many of the Pacific ACP countries cannot handle them alone. For this reason we are working with our Australian and New Zealand friends and, as Mr Deva said, with stable conditions we can develop tourism further in the Pacific.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament has, of course, noticed the Council conclusions regarding the Pacific strategy, which confirmed that the EU will strengthen its partnership with this region. A number of Member States follow the Pacific closely. The EU has an important role to play in the Pacific. Your report demonstrates this very clearly and we count on your continued support and solidarity for these really extraordinary countries.</p>

      <p sl="es">I was rapporteur for the opinion issued and approved by the Committee on Fisheries. I would like to congratulate Mr Deva on the work he has done and I am delighted that the Committee on Fisheries’ proposals are going to be included in the text of the resolution, at least in part.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Pacific is one of the richest fishing grounds in the world, and the European tuna fleet has been fishing in those waters for some time thanks to the bilateral agreements signed with the countries of the region.</p>
      <p sl="es">According to the scientific studies, the level of stocks is entirely satisfactory, and European Union financial aid represents an important source of income for the countries of the region.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must therefore strengthen our relations with those countries. We have a mutual interest. We can contribute to promoting measures in those waters for the sustainable management of fisheries resources, and for EU fishermen fishing tuna it would be a very positive thing to make more progress towards creating a network of tuna agreements similar to the one already in place in the Indian Ocean, as requested by the Committee on Fisheries in its opinion.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, many thanks to the rapporteur for his hard work. A strategy to strengthen partnerships with the Pacific Islands sounds good at first encounter and inert enough not to cause any measure of suspicion or discontent. After all, the projected aim is to improve relations, mainly trade, for the mutual benefit of EU citizens and the Pacific islanders.</p>
      <p sl="de">This might be the case for the majority of the Pacific Island countries. But for a significant number there is a hidden truth in the fact that many of the Pacific Islands are not countries at all: they are 21st century colonies, and two of the colonising nations happen to be members of the EU, namely France and Britain.</p>
      <p sl="de">Take for example New Caledonia. It has an area of about 18 500 km2 and its approximately 250 000 inhabitants are recorded as being merely a ‘sui generis community’. New Caledonia is not a country but an overseas Department of France. On a much smaller scale, the Pitcairn Islands are an overseas territory of Britain administered by a governor appointed by the Queen of England.</p>
      <p sl="de">So colleagues, apart from the despicably shameful ethics of accepting that France and Britain should continue to have colonies, we seem to be content with going on to form relations with such colonies as though nothing wrong is going on. In fact, nothing about colonisation and consequent democracy deprivation is mentioned in this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, let me pose the following question. Since some of the islands are in essence parts of the aforementioned EU Member States, then in reality are France and Britain going to form relationships with themselves through this strategy partnership? Perhaps the Commissioner could enlighten us on this exciting but strange prospect.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Deva for this very important report on a strategy for a strengthened partnership between the European Union and the Pacific Islands. The European Parliament supports the European Commission’s view that a more intensive political dialogue with the Pacific Islands Forum is required. Indeed, the Forum’s leaders have adopted a new agreement establishing the Forum as an intergovernmental organisation under international law.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, we wish to emphasise that strengthening dialogue at regional level must also take account of the needs of the poorest countries in the region. The exploitation of natural resources must help to generate income for all the citizens of these island nations in the Pacific. In particular, it must help to reduce poverty. The European Parliament wishes to highlight the importance of tourism in the region, bearing in mind that the natural beauty of the Pacific islands is one of their main assets. Support for tourism in the region must go hand in hand with an increased involvement of the islanders themselves in the provision of tourist services, in order to secure the future of the tourist sector and maximise its benefits for the local economy. I would also like to point out that the report emphasises the need to support technical education and training systems in the countries of the region, within the framework of the 10th European Development Fund.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Parliament shares the European Commission’s view that political instability and conflicts can have a destructive impact on the region’s economic development, particularly as regards the loss of income from tourism and damage to economic infrastructure. We wish to draw attention to the situation in East Timor, where an outbreak of violence took place in May and June of 2006. It is to be hoped that, working in close cooperation with the international community, the Commission will be able to assist the leaders of East Timor to solve the problems underlying the crisis, taking account of the need for political stability, alleviation of poverty, social development and reconciliation between the various social groups.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament is being consulted this week about the first formal strategy for 30 years on relations between the European Union and the Pacific. This strategy is aimed at strengthening political dialogue, improving cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of development aid, more than a quarter of which is supplied by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the case of a number of vital sectors, the strategy emphasises sustainable development from both an ecological and an economic point of view. These sectors include tourism, transportation, mining, agriculture and fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the Committee on Fisheries, I had an amendment adopted to the effect that the European Union should support regional cooperation projects on the evaluation, monitoring and management of fisheries resources, conducted with third countries in the area and with the overseas countries and territories associated with the European Union: French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and Pitcairn.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am delighted that the European Union is willing to get more constructively involved in the Pacific by emphasising economic development, political stability and the sound management of resources in the immediate neighbourhood of our overseas countries and territories. Let us hope that the financial resources will match the declared ambitions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to record my support for the content of Mr Deva’s report on EU relations with the Pacific Islands entitled ‘A strategy for strengthened partnership with the Pacific Islands’. I hope this much-needed document will herald a new era in contacts between the EU and the Pacific Islands.</p>
      <p sl="pl">European countries have now been involved in the Pacific region for thirty years, and are major donors to the area. It is therefore particularly important to develop a long-term strategy. This is actually the only part of the world for which the Union has not yet developed a overarching, integrated strategy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The adoption of the document under consideration represents an excellent opportunity to create a new relationship with this region. This relationship should be both economic and political. The Pacific Islands play a very important role in stabilising the climate, and they also possess a great wealth of natural resources such as mineral deposits and fish. It would be a partnership with a region that is a world leader in tuna fishing and which accounts for one third of global catches.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My support for the aforementioned document also relates to the need to promote democracy and stability in the Pacific region and to prevent extremist ideologies from taking root there. The European Union has historical ties with these islands, and should support them in their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Adopting the Strategy for a strengthened partnership will provide us with an opportunity to set higher economic and social targets. The European Union’s involvement in these efforts could go beyond simply providing support to former colonies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Community and the Republic of Gabon have negotiated and initialled, on 28 October 2005, a Fisheries Partnership Agreement for a period of six years. The new Protocol has been in provisional application since December 2005 under a decision of the Council. On the date of its entry into force, this Agreement will repeal and replace the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Gabon on fishing off the coast of Gabon, which entered into force in December 1998.</p>
      <p sl="en">The financial contribution is fixed at EUR 860 000 per year. Of this financial contribution, 60% will allow annual financial support for defining and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in Gabon, with a view to introducing responsible and sustainable fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">This new Protocol provides fishing possibilities for 24 tuna seiners and 16 surface long-liners, with an annual reference tonnage of 11 000 tonnes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Agreement is part of an important network of EC Tuna Agreements in the Atlantic Ocean off the Western African coast.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission considers that the Agreement will give the Community and Gabon an appropriate legal and political framework for monitoring and controlling the activities of the EU fleet in the Gabonese fishing area. It also allows the Community to support the development of the sector in this country, for the mutual benefit of the parties.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the European Union and the Gabonese Republic negotiated and signed on 28 October 2005 a multiannual fisheries partnership agreement which will cover relations between the European Community and the Gabonese Republic in the fisheries sector. The partnership agreement, which is accompanied by a protocol, has been concluded for a period of six years, while the technical and financial terms governing fisheries activities entered into force back on 3 December 2005.</p>
      <p sl="el">The main objective of the partnership agreement, which goes beyond the narrow commercial framework of the previous bilateral agreement, is to develop a sustainable fisheries policy with responsible exploitation of fisheries resources, support for coastal populations and the creation of small local freezing and processing industries through general economic and scientific cooperation. One important innovative step is the monitoring of fishing vessels by satellite in order to stamp out illegal, undeclared and uncontrolled fishing.</p>
      <p sl="el">As emphasised by the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, Mr Borg, this new agreement opens up a new chapter in cooperation between the European Union and the Gabonese Republic, given that it will step up its efforts to safeguard the future of fisheries in its waters. We should emphasise that agreements such as this are particularly important, because they promote economic development and cooperation with third countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">This agreement with Gabon in the fisheries sector is another development tool being used by the European Union in order to emphasise its solidarity and intention to cooperate further with developing third countries. I therefore consider it necessary for the European Parliament, as the institution directly elected by the citizens, to be kept informed well in advance and not to be called on a year later purely and simply to ratify the decisions.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I wish to protest once again at the fact that fisheries is always dealt with in a secretive nocturnal manner; that is what is happening today once again.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to thank Mr Arnaoutakis for his wonderful report. Since it is so late, I shall be concise and stress three aspects relating to Gabon and fisheries agreements in general that I believe to be important.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must once again point to the Commission’s delay in presenting this issue to the European Parliament and point out that the European Union is going to be paying the first portion of the financial payments to Gabon at least six months late. This is unacceptable and the European Union must not cause this kind of delay, especially when it comes to third countries whose economies are so weak. I believe that we have reached an agreement with Commissioner Borg and I hope that there will be no more such delays in future.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, I would also like to stress the financial aspects of fisheries agreements in general, this specific case being one very infamous example. There are many people here ― and I regret that they are not actually the people who are most critical of the fisheries agreements ― who complain that the fisheries sector does not cooperate in, or hardly contribute to, the funding of these agreements. In fact, in this case, in the Gabon agreement, the fisheries sector is going to pay almost 20% more than the European Union pays from the Community budget. That should reassure those who say that the fisheries sector does not contribute to the funding of the agreements.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, Mr President, I would also like to put a request to the Commission relating to the agreements that we in the Committee on Fisheries have been making repeatedly: that, in the name of greater transparency, Members of this Parliament should be able to participate as observers in the joint committees that control the implementation of fisheries agreements. We have already achieved that for the regional fisheries organisations and it would be good if we could take part in the joint committees in the future. We put this request the other day to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and I hope that Commissioner Figel' will communicate this request to the European Commission, so that, amongst the three institutions, we can obtain greater participation by Members of this Parliament. If only because of the time of night we have to work, I believe that we deserve to be in those committees as observers.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0474/2006) by Danutė Budreikaitė, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies (2006/2246(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-254" speaker_id="28268" name="Danutė Budreikaitė" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="lt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all who have found the time at this late hour to discuss here in the plenary session the important question of integrating sustainability into development cooperation policy. The most important EU documents – the European Community Treaty and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy – define sustainable development as development which allows the present needs of society to be satisfied without reducing the chances of future generations to meet their needs. Sustainable development is an all-embracing EU rights principle which should have an influence on all spheres of EU policy, including the development cooperation policy.</p>
      <p sl="lt">One of the most important aims of our community is to fight poverty in the world, to pay back some old debts to developing countries, to help them climb out of the status of least-developed nations and to reach the status of developing nations, and ultimately – the level of developed nations. Developed nations know what the cost of progress and modern life is. I have in mind the environmental impact of human activity – the development of various fields of economy, especially industry. It is a huge cost that is being borne by the whole world, even though not all countries have or use the technology that contributes to the greenhouse effect, CO2 or other pollution. We are all paying, and we all would like to see the amount of pollution reduced. We direct our attention not only to our own economies, adopting appropriate solutions, but we also want developing countries to use non-polluting renewable types of energy and non-polluting technology. However, this is not so simple. The report raised some of the problems of sustainable development and offered some directions for possible solutions for developing countries – and not only for them, but also for the EU itself. Sustainable development comprises three fundamental aspects: stable economic growth, protection of the environment, and social justice and cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This means that economic issues, environmental protection issues and social issues are interrelated and reinforce each other, and their interconnection should already be in evidence at the policy formation stage. Economic issues are linked with management, human rights, democracy, regional integration and other aspects of economics and life. The financial support of the EU and other countries is necessary for their solution, as are the strengthening of developing countries’ institutional competence, the fight against corruption, new methods of helping businesses and markets to implement sustainable development, the attraction of direct foreign investment, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The environment is affected by unlawful destruction of forests, which encourages corruption and the possibility of armed conflicts; lack of access to potable water and shortcomings in sanitary conditions; pollution, especially the greenhouse effect; and the use and depletion of natural resources, which are also precursors to conflict situations. In the social sphere environmental issues are also important, such as access to potable water and sanitary conditions, access to education and health care systems, and the fight against poverty. In implementing three fundamental aspects of sustainable development, it is evident that the stimulation of economic growth and the elimination of poverty, together with ensuring the protection of the environment, are the greatest challenges to the EU development cooperation policy.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Therefore, in this policy the EU must also encourage other large economic actors, such as the United States, China and India, to contribute to the implementation of global sustainable development. When stimulating economic growth, it is essential to implement sustainable development in all sectors, to invest in non-polluting technologies, to introduce alternative energy technologies, and, most importantly, to apply entrepreneurial behaviour standards. Talking about the environment, it is important to highlight that international corporations operating in developing countries must respect the environment. A start should be made to implement a code of corporate social responsibility for European firms.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Seeking to fight the deterioration of environmental protection in developing countries, the EU should cooperate more actively with small and medium-sized firms to shape their respect for the environment. The protection of biological diversity, monitoring of the ecological state of the environment and the appropriate measures to support it are our collective debt to coming generations. In the social sphere we must try to achieve the defined millennial development goals, to encourage a sustainable consumption model, to combat diseases, and to direct more official development aid to education about health and environmental issues.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In addition, it is essential to involve the civil society, NGOs and women in finding solutions for the problems of sustainable development, and in invigorating social dialogue. As well as these three fields of sustainable development, I would also like to mention the strengthening of institutional competence as a priority side issue for all sectors. In assisting institutional, administrative and legal reforms, expansion of infrastructure systems and national financial management, the environmental, economic and social impact needs to be evaluated.</p>
      <p sl="lt">These are long-term action programmes to achieve sustainability in development cooperation policy. Already, however, the EU can take action to achieve sustainability, to solve the agricultural export subsidy issue, and to encourage the importation of products that have been produced with respect for sustainability and without contravening international agreements, invoking a migration policy to stop the brain drain from developing countries, as well as stimulating investment in developing countries, and faithfully applying 0.7% of GDP to development assistance.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I shall aim to comply with my allotted speaking time so that we can finish before midnight!</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course we welcome this report which is so focused on mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies. I am pleased to know that this report is well in tune with our own analysis of this subject. The Commission is fully committed to improving the mainstreaming of sustainability in our development cooperation. The overarching objective of this cooperation is the eradication of poverty in the context of sustainable development. We are working in the direction of most of the recommendations which are made in the report, and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Budreikaitė. I shall illustrate this only with a few examples.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we are improving the mainstreaming of environmental concerns in development policies in a variety of ways, for example by staff training, by setting up an environmental helpdesk, by systematic preparation of country and regional environmental profiles and, whenever relevant, strategic environmental assessments and environmental impact assessments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we are stepping up assistance to developing countries to adapt to climate change. We are working to enhance our alliance-building with the developing countries in the area of climate change adaptation and mitigation. Because the most immediate effect of climate change on developing countries is the incidence of extreme weather phenomena, we are also preparing a new disaster risk reduction strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we are promoting clean and renewable energy through specific projects. Another new initiative that has been well received by the international community is the global energy efficiency and renewable energy fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, we are working hard towards preventing the import of illegally sourced wood via the negotiation of voluntary partnership agreements under the forest law enforcement governance and trade initiative. Negotiations have recently started with Malaysia, Ghana and Indonesia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, we are programming resources for building capacity in developing countries to prevent illegal dumping of toxic waste and to clean stocks of solid pesticides.</p>
      <p sl="en">The efforts needed to deal with these objectives and with others also raised in the report certainly remain considerable. The European Parliament’s support in relation to the development cooperation instrument and the environment and natural resources climatic strategy will be critical, and from this point of view I want to express gratitude for your engagement and support.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can do no other than extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Budreikaitė, for a successful job of work, and for a very balanced report that does not give rise to contention.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report contains the core of what the Committee on Development wanted to say about, firstly, the challenges presented by climate change; secondly, the protection of biodiversity; thirdly the discharge of the least developed countries from their debts; fourthly the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises for the sake of improved social, environmental and economic cooperation in the countries of the South, and, fifthly, more foreign direct investment and greater diversification in exports.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report calls on the Commission to base all the Community’s development programmes on transparency and accountability, since corruption damages sustainability in the developing countries, and this House therefore advocates the introduction of independent offices to combat it, together with an adequate allocation of funds to them, and I can do no other than ask all Members of this House to endorse this report when we come to vote on it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I, too, should like to join in congratulating the rapporteur. The idea prevailed for a long time that protection of the environment and sustainable development were luxury items that could not be discussed, let alone achieved, until a society had developed to a certain level.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sustainable development has since then become one of the millennium development goals, since the effects of poor environmental conditions impact poorer people far more directly. Their living conditions are largely dependent on access to natural resources – for example, 90% of people living in absolute poverty are dependent on woods for a living. It is also the case that the developing countries are harder hit by the consequences of climate change than the industrial nations that are largely responsible for it, and so the Commission’s proposal for a Europe-wide reduction in CO2 emissions from new cars by 2012 is to be welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this report, we are again calling on the United States, but also on India and China, to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and to join with the European Union in taking responsibility for sustainable development worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="de">While the building of infrastructure can be an important factor in sustainable development, it is also important that social and environmental considerations be borne in mind, and so we urge the Commission to have an environmental impact assessment carried out on every project receiving financial support from the EU and made available to the public.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are again and again shocked by reports of the inhuman conditions under which people in developing countries have to work, and the code of practice for European businesses operating in such countries really must be made more effective. We must also play our part in ensuring that the International Labour Organisation’s core labour standards are applied.</p>
