      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank honourable Members for this opportunity to dispel some widely held misunderstandings regarding the Irish programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The S&amp;D Group’s question that gave rise to this statement raises honourable Members’ concern that certain economic policy conditions set out in the Memorandum of Understanding of the Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland are in legal conflict with Article 153(5) of the Treaty. That paragraph excludes the adoption of provisions in the field of pay under Article 153, that is, in the field of social policy. However, the Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland is not a social policy programme and is not adopted under Article 153. It is a financial assistance programme set up, together with the Irish Government, to restore domestic and external confidence and remove the harmful feedback loops between the fiscal and financial crisis. Therefore, it is grounded in Article 122(2) of the Treaty, which allows for Union financial assistance if a Member State is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond its control.</p>
      <p sl="en">The role of the MOU is to specify the economic policy conditions that serve as a benchmark for assessing the Irish policy performance during the financial assistance programme. The Member State has full ownership of these economic policy conditions and their implementation. These conditions are commitments of the Member State that are undertaken by the state itself. It is not EU action in the respective fields. Indeed, many of the conditions, such as the minimum wage reduction, were already included in the Irish Government’s national recovery plan that was published on 24 November 2010, before the start of the programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The aim of the conditions relating to labour market policy is to create jobs and to avoid long-term unemployment in Ireland amongst the most vulnerable groups. The minimum wage reduction is part of this wider package of measures and needs to be seen together with activation policies and efforts to modernise the benefit system. When evaluating the reduction in one of the highest minimum wages in the European Union – it is, for instance, the second highest in the eurozone – and although there was significant wage adjustment in the economy, with the minimum wage, in common with wages in general in Ireland, falling by 3% in real terms in 2008, followed by a rise of 0.3% in 2009, it should be noted that most of the labour market adjustments took the form of job losses. In fact, the minimum wage cut only restored the status quo prevailing before 1 January 2007, i.e. before the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other condition mentioned in the question is an independent review of sectoral collective bargaining. The motivation of the review is to discuss the fairness and efficiency of employment conditions for both employees and employers across sectors. I would like to highlight the fact that Ireland has a long-standing tradition of tripartite consultation on economic and social policy and that the successive pacts between the government and the social partners since the 1980s have been widely recognised as major factors in the success of the Irish economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The review is an opportunity for the social partners to voice opinions and shape policy, and its announcement was welcomed as such. I am fully confident that the review will be carried out by the Irish Government in a way that recognises the importance of social dialogue, includes all the social partners, and complies with Community law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the conditions in the Memorandum of Understanding with regard to structural reform are not only about the labour market. They also contain important measures to open up product markets such as overly regulated sectors and professions. These reforms could have a major effect on customer prices and productivity, which support the purchasing power of households.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would also like to thank the Commissioner. Yesterday, a new national government for recovery was voted into power in Ireland. Fine Gael and Labour are part of the PPE and S&amp;D groups respectively in this Parliament. One of the issues high up on the agenda of the new programme for government will be the renegotiation of elements of the EU/IMF programme of support to Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">At present, many Irish people fear that the conditions agreed by the then government in the EU/IMF programme of support are too stringent and place a heavy burden on ordinary citizens who have had to bear the brunt for the mistakes of the banks – both Irish and European – and the government. We should note that the new government has agreed to reverse the reduction in the minimum wage. We know, however, that recovery cannot happen without pain. Ireland went down a similar road in the 1980s. Many of the difficult conditions as laid out by the EU/IMF programme are necessary if we are to restore healthy public finances. We must prune the tree in order to allow growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the Commission’s support for an interest rate reduction as stated by Commissioner Rehn. This should come about as soon as possible and I urge the Commission to really look at this at an early date. The Commissioner emphasised that all measures are weighed up against their effect on growth, competitiveness and the sustainability of public finances in the long run. I accept that; we cannot carry the entire burden we have been asked to carry at once. The Irish people have taken their responsibilities in this matter; in fact, they have taken other people’s responsibilities as well, because we were given no alternative. What they have done is not just for Ireland but also for Europe and the eurozone in particular. We do not need the straw to break the camel’s back. Please give the Irish people the tools; we will do the job ourselves, but please do not expect the Irish people to carry a burden that they are not capable of carrying. So I ask the Commissioner to bear those comments in mind in particular in the days and weeks ahead.</p>

    <intervention id="4-009-000" speaker_id="1407" name="Stephen Hughes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, this memorandum requires an EUR 1 per hour reduction in the minimum wage in Ireland and a review, as we have heard, of the system of collective pay agreements which protect the low paid.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not believe that this interference can be justified. The Treaty requires the Commission to promote social dialogue, not undermine it. Article 152 requires respect for the autonomy of social partners, not this type of interference, and Article 153 expressly excludes EU action in the field of play. The Commission cannot pick and choose the hierarchy of articles in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">The memorandum goes on to insist on cuts in social welfare, the roll-back of key public services, and reductions in public sector employment and public sector pensions. How can those demands be justified in relation to a Treaty that requires the Union to aim to eliminate inequalities, promote a high level of employment, guarantee adequate social protection and fight against social exclusion? The only honest answer to that is that these things cannot be reconciled, and the problem is that these things have now, as a result of the Annual Growth Survey, become the general rule.</p>
      <p sl="en">The people will reject the idea of a Europe based only on austerity. They will not tolerate the far-reaching implications for social policies with lower wages, lower employment protection, weak social standards, reduced public services and the imposition of higher retirement ages. If we want to continue to swell the ranks of anti-Europeanism, then carry on, Commission. If not, please stop this nonsense now.</p>

    <intervention id="4-010-000" speaker_id="28116" name="Marian Harkin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Commissioner is telling us that the Memorandum of Understanding was drawn up under Article 122, part 2. I would like to ask the Commissioner what happens when one article of the Treaty is in direct contradiction with other articles in the Treaty; as Stephen Hughes has asked, how do we decide on the hierarchy? It is in contradiction with Article 153.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also in contradiction with Article 9, the social clause, which I have quoted many times in this Chamber when speaking about the Irish austerity package, where it says that in defining and implementing all its policies and activities, the Union shall take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment and the fight against social exclusion, etc. And what about Article 28 in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, under which workers have the rights to negotiate and conclude collective agreements and, in the cases of conflicts of interest, to take collective action to defend their interests, including strike action? Many Irish workers would see that they are in that position at the moment. How do we deal with the contradiction between the different articles in the Treaty?</p>
      <p sl="de">Another question for you, Commissioner: are you stating that the Memorandum of Understanding was entirely the responsibility of the Irish Government and that the Commission acquiesced or agreed?</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, let us assume here you have the power to do all of this – and you are telling us you have; why then was there no effort to reduce or eliminate bank bonuses? Why was there no effort to ensure that those at the top of the salary scale paid their fair share? Why is it that one euro was deducted from the minimum wage? I agree entirely with what Stephen Hughes has said: this fuels anti-European sentiment. Citizens see what is happening. They see how the Commission is working in this whole process, and what they see is that it is those on the minimum wage, those who are in collective agreements, are being hit with these austerity plans.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally my main question, Commissioner, is: who decides? Is it the Court of Justice? Who decides when articles of the Treaty are in conflict or when the Commission acts in such a way as to bring those articles into conflict with one another?</p>

    <intervention id="4-011-000" speaker_id="96726" name="Marije Cornelissen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I understand the urgency of the Commission in addressing the economic crisis and the high levels of debt which are a threat for the stability of the euro. I understand that conditions are imposed on countries that have to make use of the European Financial Stability Mechanism. However, it seems to me that the Commission is being quite selective in the measures and conditions it deems permitted in this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the one hand, nearly any measure seems legal when it comes to fiscal consolidation by cutting expenditure. As soon as Ireland made use of the rescue package, minimum wages and pension levels were the first variables to be adjusted, despite the fact that these matters explicitly are not EU competences. On the other hand, the Commission hides itself behind the lack of EU competence to leave the exceptionally low Irish corporation tax untouched, whereas increasing this could also substantially improve public revenues in Ireland. Cutting expenditure is not, after all, the only way to achieve a balanced budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand that this crisis requires exceptional measures, but why is the Commission in such a hurry to adjust minimum wages, affecting workers who earn the least, while we have to wait and see about measures that make the banking and financial sector pay? I strongly get the feeling that the Commission is interpreting the EU’s competences in a very one-sided and, dare I say it, right-wing manner. This blunt approach inspires Euro-scepticism. It seems that the EU acts firmly in the field of employment and social policy only in times of crisis, and then does so by imposing cuts in social spending and wages.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU can only regain confidence if the Commission shows the same determination in setting proper minimum social standards and social guarantees for the heavy cuts imposed on people. Yes, we do want economic governance, but we want balanced governance with both fiscal sustainability and social guarantees. If not, the vulnerable will pay the price for a mess that they are not responsible for.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rescue packages were intended to protect EU Member States from insolvency. However, they are overwhelming citizens with brutal austerity programmes and allowing the perpetrators to get off scot-free. On top of that, the Commission is now interfering in national wage policy, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Hahn, it is quite absurd and it brings tears to my eyes when I hear formal arguments like yours that this is not at all intended to be a socio-political measure. Such a position is utterly unacceptable. Wage policy is not the business of the EU. This policy on the part of the Commission is at complete odds with the idea of this European Union. The EU was never intended to be about competition in wages and social dumping. This Commission policy talks about the inflexibility of wages, which is to be reduced. It states that wages should reflect market conditions. This is like a blind man describing an elephant. People who write such things have no understanding of collective agreement systems. They interfere in free collective bargaining and reduce the much talked-about autonomy of the social partners and the social dialogue to absurdity.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make it clear that this Parliament is called on to ensure that the autonomous collective agreement policy is retained, to protect the social dialogue and to prevent the further dismantling of social security. We need measures to prevent a counterproductive austerity policy, not punitive measures.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this goes beyond Ireland. Only a month ago, I reminded the House that pensions were exclusively the competence of the Member States and here we go again using the same language of coordination and retirement-setting mechanisms. Now pensions are almost always related to earnings, so do we see here an attempt to harmonise wages? I hope not, because the Treaties also say that wages are an exclusive competence of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is all very well to say that ‘equal’ must mean equal pay, but should all workers doing the same job get the same pay across the EU? As an example, think ‘climate’: keeping a house warm near the Arctic Circle needs much more money than in Mediterranean countries. Add in winter clothing, snow clearance and all the rest and it is obvious that to pay all workers the same would leave some with more spare cash than others. Of course wages cannot be equal. The Commission’s intentions in drawing up plans to encourage Member States to introduce an EU minimum wage policy and set retirement mechanisms are going against the Treaties. I am not surprised: this is the EU at work.</p>
      <p sl="en">A harmonised wage and pensions policy is not just a dream; it is illegal. Leave it, as the Treaties demand, to the competence of elected governments like mine at Westminster and like that in Ireland.</p>

    <intervention id="4-014-000" speaker_id="4238" name="Hans-Peter Martin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ireland is a tragic historical lesson for us. At first, this country was always celebrated as the ‘showcase’ country and the model for new members of the Union, although at that time, very wrong policies were permitted and encouraged and these resulted in enormous bubbles in the property sector having to be dealt with, the banking sector being allowed to become a law unto itself and no attention being paid to preventing competitive dumping in the area of taxation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, you have the same nationality as me. We know how many Austrian writers, for example, suddenly discovered that they are Irish, because they had to pay hardly any tax there. What did the supposedly extremely pro-European forces do at that time? Absolutely nothing! They said ‘this country is a wonderful example’.</p>
      <p sl="de">All of that has now completely collapsed. This bubble has now turned out to be exactly what many people said it was all along. Once again we have a situation where – and I am not alone in thinking this – anti-European sentiment is being fanned by the fact that we are again allowing the wrong policies to be pursued, in this case by imposing this massive package on Ireland. Commissioner, you say that the Member State is committing itself to this. However, we know from our experience of World Bank and International Monetary Fund programmes – and what we are currently seeing in Ireland is not so very different from this – that in the end, these countries have no choice.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we were to take a step back and say ‘it is a shame that Ireland did not reject the Treaty of Lisbon the second time around’, then we could come to a completely different way of thinking. We would then see that, with this European construct, we are dealing with something that could be likened to a vehicle, the front of which consists of a Porsche while the back consists of a bicycle. These two things do not go together. They need to be much stronger.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we want to prevent this Europe from breaking apart, we actually need something like a Constitution for Europe. We then need clear benchmarks that actually apply to everyone. We need economic governance. This fragmentary approach – forwards, backwards, sidewards – will not work, and in the end, Commissioner, it is more likely to end in disaster than in what you, I and the vast majority of this House are working for, namely, a peaceful, functional and also united Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="4-015-000" speaker_id="105624" name="Philippe Boulland" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, for the record, with the crisis and the bursting of the housing and credit bubbles, the Irish State has had to intervene to support the banks. The Irish public deficit, the accumulated budget balance of central and local administrations and, in particular, social security administrations, was estimated at 32% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010. If the Irish Government, which is finding it difficult to refinance itself on the markets, wishes to access loans from the European Financial Stability Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Fund, it will have to meet requirements for social and fiscal change, even though these areas come under subsidiarity. In our view, there is no contradiction here. As a doctor, I would say that, in the case of fever, there is no point prescribing antipyretics indiscriminately without seeking to treat the cause. As far as the allocation of these funds is concerned, this State should get its finances in order so as to correct its excessive deficit and past mistakes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This austerity plan should improve GDP by 10% over the next four years. As with an individual, to whom a bank will make a personal loan conditional upon meeting the solvency condition without getting involved in their private lives and management, the European Union can lend to Ireland on the basis of consolidated solvency. Without interfering in their private lives, the bank will encourage an individual to negotiate, for example, an increase in salary, or to borrow elsewhere. Thus, by respecting subsidiarity, the European Union, on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding drawn up with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), considers that this solvency requires the reduction of the legal minimum wage and an adjustment of pensions, with fiscal measures nonetheless in the mix. It is up to Ireland to choose whether or not to implement these measures. It does not leave the door wide open for the European Union to interfere in areas falling within subsidiarity, making it possible, for example, to impose a European minimum wage, which would be a dangerous thing to do, but rather ensures the protection of the stability of the euro area through a mutual guarantee process. Of course, it is necessary to help Ireland, like other countries in difficulty, which also protects us, but not at any price, especially that of seeing a State unable to pay off its loans, thus weakening its citizens and citizens throughout the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">At the moment, the interpreters indicate to the President that they are unable to keep up, but the President then has the difficult task of interrupting you.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Memorandum of Understanding in relation to labour market issues is very clearly based on a simplistic economic theory that lower wages will ‘clear the market’, in other words, end unemployment. That is total and utter nonsense. It is not supported by practice on the ground. And I would draw the Commission’s attention to the Forfás review of labour cost competitiveness in Ireland, produced late last year, which says that firms generally prefer layoffs to pay cuts because they harm morale less. If you want to look at why we have had more layoffs than wage cuts in Ireland, that is the basis of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would appeal to the Commission to comply with European law and stop interfering in labour market issues in Ireland. As you say, we have a long tradition of social partnership agreements in Ireland. Indeed, they are the basis of the fact that there has been no violence on the streets in Ireland: it is because the social partners and the government have sat down and made arrangements to adjust the labour market and adjust conditions to ensure that we can have some hope of recovery from the current crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">That tradition has ensured progress in Ireland, but the programme generally is failing to do what it was intended to do, which was to assist the economy in Ireland to grow. It is not growing. In fact, it is in decline, and that programme has to be generally renegotiated. I would suggest in particular that the issues relating to the labour market have to be removed. As has already been stated, the Irish Government, of which my party is a member, has already declared that it will reverse the minimum wage cut as agreed in that programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">You may be unhappy with that, but that is going to happen. You can be certain as well that your attempt to interfere with the Registered Employment Agreements Act, which has been in place for more than 50 years, will not be interfered with, as you hope, because the current government is determined that social partnership will play its traditional role in ensuring that we have industrial peace and progress.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the tendency in the EU to increase pressure on the Member States is gathering great pace, under the pretext of the crisis, with a view to devaluing wages and increasing the exploitation of those who work, in order to ensure ever more profits and gains for the economic and financial groups, revealing all the antisocial cruelty of capitalism.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If the irrational criteria of the Stability Pact, with the proposals of so-called economic governance and the so-called competitiveness pact had not been passed, particularly the attempt to prevent wages from rising with inflation and increase the legal age for retirement, we would have even more serious attacks on labour and social rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What is already happening in this field in certain countries, such as Portugal, Greece or Ireland, and which is of the utmost seriousness, are salary cuts and pension freezes, even on the lowest pensions and those below the poverty line. In the case of Portugal, a salary cut on the national minimum wage was already planned for the beginning of this year. It was felt that EUR 500 was too much per month, and it was decided to cut this by EUR 15, despite the fact that more than 13% of female Portuguese workers receive only this amount, compared with 6% of male workers. This is a clear example of institutionalised discrimination and the effect of the so-called austerity measures that the Commission, together with the Council and the governments of our countries, is implementing, with the subsequent exacerbation of social inequality, discrimination, the devaluing of work and increased poverty, while the indulgence of financial speculation and tax havens continues. We therefore express our solidarity with the young workers and teachers who are going to protest over the forthcoming weekends, including this Saturday, 12 March, and at the large national demonstration by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP) in Lisbon on 19 March. This will continue the fight against these antisocial policies.</p>

Has the percentage of people in favour of membership of the European Union fallen? How has the general feeling towards the EU changed? Portugal shows a great many parallels with Ireland – at first, there was the great euphoria in the 1970s with the prospect of accession, then the corresponding funding.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, by setting out requirements for lower wages, the Commission has undermined the negotiating right of the social partners and both directly and indirectly affected wage formation, which is explicitly excluded from the Commission’s sphere of competence. This is nothing less than a frontal assault on the social partners’ influence and is contrary to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which includes the right to enter into collective agreements.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This is not an isolated incident restricted to Ireland, either, but is being repeated time and time again. By talking about ‘unit labour cost’ instead of wages, the Commission is attempting to circumvent the limits established by the Treaty. The European Commission has quite simply redrawn the map. It has drawn up a new map and a new set of regulations in which the Member States and the social partners now have their tasks taken away from them and, contrary to all regulations, find themselves dictated to. This is what the dispute is about and it has only just begun.</p>
      <p sl="sv">By acting in this way, the EU is moving ever further away from a democratic basis and legitimacy, which, in other contexts, are usually the keywords when we discuss the future of the EU.

      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately, we seem to perpetually meet with a deafening silence when it comes to agreements on European standards for the minimum wage, nor have I heard any proposals intended to guarantee that workers can get work which pays or that they can get full-time jobs, instead of piecework or standby contracts. I am concerned about the impact of the current discussions on ordinary people, but I am also concerned about the image of the European Union. It really does look like we only pay attention to the interests of financial institutions, to speculators and to big business.

      <p sl="el">This is the prescription which is being given consistently to every patient. One of the patients is Greece. You recently visited Greece, during an event organised by the socialist party. You saw and felt the prevailing situation and my question to you is this: did you feel that the prescription for Greece was working? I was there and I am from the socialist party currently governing the country and doing what it can to get it out of the very difficult situation caused by right-wing governments and it has had to make concessions on the question of collective agreements and I am telling you that we have not yet seen results. You say that you are doing all this for European citizens, for consumers, but, if consumers are paid lower wages, they will have nothing to spend and will not therefore help to boost growth. You know better than I that it is a vicious circle, because you insist on giving us a prescription which does nothing except destroy the workers’ dignity, a prescription which results in a lack of decent and viable jobs.

The people of Europe – the workers, the low earners and the pensioners – are really picking up the bill, and you are interpreting legislation and competences however you please.</p>
      <p sl="de">On 19 October last year, I received a response to a question that I had put to the Commission in which it was explicitly confirmed that minimum wages and wages in general are the responsibility of the Member States. The response states this very emphatically. Please read it. It is not acceptable for you to give me that kind of answer when it is a good thing for employers and then simply change direction when you believe something is good for the other side. That will make the people of Europe really very unhappy. My fellow Member has just mentioned this. You are chipping away at codetermination. You are weakening the trade unions. That is not the way out of the crisis and you are fully aware of that. Those who caused the crisis must also be the ones to pay for it.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, faced with the conditions of the economic crisis, countries are having financial difficulties implementing the commitments they have made. There is little doubt that their capacity to overcome the crisis varies and there is a need to find ways of balancing the budget and reducing the budget deficit. However, Commissioner, must we really do this at the expense of those who are worst off? Is it morally right for the European Commission to pressure governments into reducing the minimum wage, pensions or other social benefits? Commissioner, you gave your opinion on the Memorandum of Understanding with Ireland. However, I would like to remind you that you signed a similar memorandum with Latvia, where you pressed the Latvian Government to reduce pensions that were already low. Pensions in Latvia were reduced, but the Latvian Constitutional Court stated that the country’s fundamental law does not allow this and the pensions were reinstated. Thus, when taking such decisions and signing such memoranda, it is necessary to thoroughly assess both the legal and social consequences.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Hahn, the proposals that are now on the table are like putting a large rucksack on the backs of all those who are already finding things difficult enough and telling them they have to run faster with it on. How is that supposed to happen? The proposals for decentralised wage negotiations are unfair, unimaginative and they are a diversionary tactic, because it is so difficult to tax asset and financial speculation and the Heads of State or Government are not succeeding in getting genuine macro-economic coordination off the ground. In this regard, we in Parliament have already set a very different benchmark this week with our vote on the financial transactions tax.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to remind you all of the principle of the social market economy as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. My conception of the social market economy is rather different – it would not include decentralised wage negotiations, quite the opposite, in fact. Decentralised wage negotiation systems are contrary to a wage policy based on solidarity and rather than leading to the gap between rich and poor getting smaller, they will – on the contrary – result in it getting bigger. In other words, we should do the opposite.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore like to expressly repeat what my colleague, Mrs Steinruck, said – we cannot repeat it often enough: we must take more action to tackle the cause of the crisis; make those who caused the crisis pay to a greater extent; and focus on them for the resolution of these problems, including by means of legislative measures.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, in reference to the alignment of unit costs with labour and levels of productivity, I think that we ought to focus on the framework conditions and less on indicators. It is not obvious that we can achieve this alignment. Productivity depends primarily on factors such as accumulated capital stock, which is very different. The clear disparity can be seen between Romania and Germany. This is due to the difference in quality of economic policies over time. Indeed, such discrepancies cannot be made up overnight. My country has made efforts towards reforming pensions and social assistance. I would therefore like to suggest including some provisions of this kind in the competitiveness pact. I support the need for a correlation between the retirement age and demographic trends. The impact which a coherent, realistic pensions policy has on public finances needs to be taken into consideration.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I understand very well the subsidiarity principle, but I believe that pensions have ceased to be a national concern as they are the subject today of an EU-level debate. We are discussing pension systems which are unsustainable as a consequence of common challenges such as the financial crisis, as well as of an ageing population and declining birth rate. The principle of intergenerational solidarity is at risk of becoming obsolete, with citizens being forced to contribute to private pensions. However, what happens to those who no longer have enough time to contribute to such pensions? European citizens also depend on public pensions. In Romania, the gross national minimum wage is approximately EUR 160. This is why I believe that investing in private pensions or saving is just pure fantasy. I think that the European Commission needs to be more involved by proposing both a minimum EU salary and pension level. A first step towards this could be to carry out a comparative pension system analysis.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, we are here to talk about salaries and proposals on the age of retirement. These proposals are downright unfair, to say the very least. They are unfair as they insist upon routes that have already been proven, more than once, to end in failure. What is happening in Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and who knows in how many other countries as the list is endless, is different in each of these countries, but they have certain things in common. One of the things that we have in common is an unprecedented transfer of the value of work to financial capital. We cannot accept this. The other thing that we have in common is that it is the workers, retired people and pensioners who are paying for this crisis, along with a generation of workers in unstable jobs who do not have any guarantees in the society in which they live. I should therefore like to finish by saying, Mr President and Commissioner, that we cannot continue to condemn people to poverty. I sincerely hope …</p>

They spring from the fact that a social Europe is becoming overshadowed by a ‘market Europe’. All the Commission’s proposals today attack either the pay or the pension system. The feeling is that pay flexibility might help in some way. It will not: on the contrary, it will result in deflation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is very important that all legislation is bound by a permanent social clause, so that the idea of a social Europe will once again come to the fore.

Pensions have been reduced, along with the minimum tax-free amount. The people are protesting. Over this period, Latvia has lost one fifth of its population; one fifth has emigrated and is working abroad.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to express my support for Mr De Rossa. The recommendations made to Ireland by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) unfortunately reflect a tendency prevalent among our policy makers at the highest level, which is to make European workers pay for a crisis that is not of their making.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another example is the Commission’s annual growth analysis, which recommends raising the legal retirement age by linking it to life expectancy. Parliament recently expressed its disapproval on this subject in its report on the Green Paper on pensions. A further example is the proposed competitiveness pact calling for the abolition of inflation indexation of wages, including in my own country, Belgium.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Faced with this situation, I welcome the involvement of the trade unions, yesterday in Hungary, for example, or in Brussels on 29 September.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank everybody for their contributions. I can promise you that we give serious consideration to each of them. Let me first say a few words about the importance and relevance of social dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We fully recognise the importance of social dialogue and constructive industrial relations. We have continuously engaged with the social partners, both at EU level and in individual countries. For instance, Commissioner Rehn personally met with Ireland’s trade union leaders in early November, as did officials from the Commission, the ECB and the IMF when negotiating the programme in late November. They will continue to engage on the next mission in April and on subsequent occasions. By the way, contrary to some allegations, the Commission did not force Ireland to cut the minimum wage or social expenditure. These measures were already presented by the former Irish Government itself in its national recovery plan, together with other fiscal and structural measures aiming at economic stability, growth and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The legal basis of the economic policy conditions is Article 3(5) of Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 establishing a European financial stabilisation mechanism and Article 2(2) of the Council Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU on granting Union financial assistance to Ireland. Once again, both are grounded in Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The mere fact that the Memorandum of Understanding’s specific economic policy conditions touch upon various issues that are linked to social policy does not put into question the legal basis of the act. There appears to be no contradiction with Article 152 or Article 153(5). Article 152 is a general provision which does not exclude the possible need for specific measures with social consequences. Moreover, that provision does not create subjective rights for the social partners. Article 153(5) is a limit as regards the content of the measures that can be adopted under Article 153, i.e. social policy. Since the MoU is not adopted on the basis of Article 153, this limit does not apply.</p>
      <p sl="en">The provisions of Title 10, social policy, cannot be disregarded. They have to be taken into account, but it does not mean that as a consequence of Article 153(5), no measures having an effect on pay can be adopted on the basis of Article 122. The measures adopted on the basis of Article 122 for Ireland do not regulate issues. They provide for conditions linked to the granting of Union assistance. This is explicitly allowed by Article 122(2). Therefore, there is no legal problem as regards the principle of conferral.</p>
      <p sl="en">More generally, the issue of economic policy conditions is not about EU competences in the field of social policy or wages. The conditions included in the programme cover a wide range of policy areas, and for most of them, the competence lies with the Member State. The economic policy conditions of the programme are Member State commitments agreed with the EU and the IMF on the measures that the Member States will undertake in exchange for EU/IMF financing.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a final note, the Commission fully acknowledged that any financial assistance programme naturally has social consequences. However, the main goal of the specific economic policy conditions attached to such a programme is to avoid much graver social consequences by setting the country back on the path of sustained growth and job creation.</p>

In 20 of the 27 Member States, the minimum income is set by law or by national inter-sector agreement. In 11 Member States, the minimum income is between EUR 100 and 400/month, in 5 Member States, it is between EUR 550 and 950/month, and in 6 Member States, it is more than EUR 1 100/month.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters by João Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (O-000044/2011 - B7-0201/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-038-000" speaker_id="96706" name="João Ferreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, two years has passed since the Commission launched a communication in February 2009 on a Community approach to the prevention of natural and man-made disasters. The importance of this issue was outlined. Since then, various disasters have hit Europe and have had severely negative consequences for the public, the land, the economy and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In general terms, the Commission’s communication followed a proper approach, albeit an inadequate one, as was considered by Parliament. In addition, the Commission is delaying in implementing the commitments it assumed in this communication.</p>
      <p sl="pt">One example of this is its commitment to draw up a list of preventative measures to be funded by the European Union and implemented by the Member States. Two years later, and where is this list? Is the Commission going to wait for the next multiannual financial framework before presenting it? Another two years from now?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Meanwhile, in September of last year, Parliament adopted a report on this very matter. This report puts forward a set of important recommendations. It is important to say that this report was preceded by a much wider debate, not only here in Parliament, but also with a wide range of national, regional and local entities, operating in different phases of disaster management.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report also gathered a lot of experience of these catastrophes with the people who were affected by disasters over the last year. Here, I would like to mention a few of the specific points of the report, from the many that it contains. A range of actions were defined as targets for special support to the Member States, with a view to remedying situations of risk in areas such as forest management, the protection and defence of the coastline, restoring and protecting river basins, the protection and remodelling of populated areas which are particularly vulnerable to certain types of catastrophes and the maintenance of farming activities in the areas affected by depopulation and which are at risk of natural disasters.</p>
      <p sl="pt">How has the Commission included, or how is it thinking of including, these areas in the list of measures to be drawn up? The report also proposes the creation of public agricultural insurance in Europe and the institution of a system of minimum compensation to farmers affected by disasters.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I notice that this is very different from the current possibility that the Member States will subsidise insurance internally, with the CAP Health Check. What is proposed is insurance financed by Community funds on an equal footing as regards protection against disasters, for all farmers, whether they are from the Member States most in need, or whether they are from rich countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As we know, disasters are deeply unfair, and they almost always have the greatest effect on those who are least able to protect themselves, be they people or countries. If there is one area in which the tangible expression of EU solidarity and the principle of cohesion must be ensured, it is in the protection of the public, the economy and the environment, in the face of disasters.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would therefore like to ask here what the Commission is going to do to reduce the existing imbalances between the regions and the Member States in this area, in other words, helping to improve prevention in regions and Member States with a greater exposure to risk and lower economic capacity. Another area covered in the report is strengthening early warning systems in the Member States and establishing connections between the various early warning systems. Which steps have already been taken in this area? Which steps will they take next? Finally, it is worth recalling that following on from prevention, and bearing in mind the experience gained during recent disasters, it is becoming imperative to revise the regulations for the Solidarity Fund to allow for a more flexible and timely mobilisation of this instrument.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What has the Commission already done, or what is it going to do, for this review? I recall that a year ago, Madeira was struck by a major disaster which resulted in fatalities and high levels of material damage to strategic infrastructures and basic equipment. It is now one year later, and Madeira has still not received a single cent of aid at all from the EU. What will the Commission do to change this situation, when the regulation of the Solidarity Fund currently says that ‘it should help to quickly restore normal living conditions, and it should act swiftly and efficiently to help, as quickly as possible, in mobilising emergency services’? Where is this speed when, one year later, Madeira has still not received a single cent in aid from the EU?</p>
      <p sl="pt">To conclude, Mr President, once again I urge the Commission to take the broad consensus that this report attracted, when it was voted upon and discussed, as a clear sign that these recommendations, the recommendations contained in this report, are to be put into practice. Many of these recommendations were already contained in previous Parliament resolutions, but unfortunately nothing was done and the Commission bears particular responsibility for this delay.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to thank Parliament for the opportunity to exchange views on disaster prevention, and Mr Ferreira in particular for his continued interest in the subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">The disasters of last year were a salutary reminder that the EU and its Member States need to step up work on disaster prevention. We need to be ambitious. We all know that investing in disaster prevention pays off. At the same time, ensuring cost-effective and increased investment in disaster prevention is a challenge.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now assessing the effectiveness of existing EU financing instruments. We are also developing a catalogue of prevention measures that would be considered by Member States for EU funding.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our objective is to increase the impact of EU funding and to accelerate the implementation of Regional Fund support. We are also looking at innovative financing instruments, such as insurance pooling to share risks. Effective investments in disaster prevention will help to save lives, limit damages and, ultimately, save money.</p>
      <p sl="en">Actions are also under way to improve our knowledge of disasters. We have worked with the European Environment Agency on a report assessing the frequency of disasters in Europe and their impact on humans, the economies and ecosystems. We also need clear and transparent assessments of the risks we face.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 21 December last year, we issued a guidance paper on national risk assessment and mapping to encourage Member States in fostering a comprehensive risk-management culture. Developing fully-fledged risk management policies will require the involvement of all actors. The increased frequency and intensity of disasters in Europe should also provide further incentives for Member States to invest in preparedness and build up their capacity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Besides the prevention elements, it is equally important that Member States, and Europe as a whole, are able to provide the best possible response. In October last year, we outlined our policy proposal for a European disaster-response capacity. Our objective is to improve the efficiency, the coherence and the visibility of the EU’s response to disasters.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, solidarity is the right word to start with. When disasters happen – be they man-made or natural – we must stand together in Europe. That is central to European integration.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second keyword that we must mention here is speed. It is important to provide help quickly, because rapid assistance is the most effective form of assistance.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, however, I must point out that it is, first and foremost, the Member States that are responsible for protecting the population, where possible, from such disasters. We must examine how we can use European resources and also the funds that are available to us in a more efficient and more effective way. However, I should point out that many Member States call for European resources in order to conceal the fact that they are taking inadequate measures themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">What can we do at EU level? We have two major expense items: firstly, the European Regional Development Fund for which Commissioner Hahn is responsible, and secondly, the Agricultural Fund, in which regard we could make better use of the funds that are already available. Prevention is key. That is to say, very many disasters, flooding in particular, could be prevented by means of proper spatial planning. We already have a Floods Directive, in connection with which it was clear that we could actually achieve a great deal with our existing resources if we took the right measures – such as mapping, risk assessment and, as a third measure, the creation of preventative action plans.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like the Commission, in addition to the prevention measures that it has drawn up, to look, in particular, at the areas of droughts and water shortages. In these areas, we still lack an instrument like the Floods Directive, and we could do a great deal here.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the catalogue of prevention measures itself, I have to say that mainstreaming is surely crucial in this regard; in other words, that we try to take these aspects into account in other policy areas. Under the supervision of the Commission, the Member States must also draw up risk maps for all areas.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, this is a recurring debate in Parliament. Unfortunately, natural or man-made disasters are becoming increasingly frequent and devastating.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although responsibility for disaster prevention lies primarily with the Member States, the European Union can make an important contribution. There are certain Community instruments to support this disaster prevention activity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, it is important that those instruments are evaluated so that we can better identify the gaps. Moreover, the funding mechanisms also need to be improved. It has already been mentioned here, but I should like to reiterate that in the case of Madeira, there has not yet been any promise of aid, and it is clear that the victims of this catastrophe cannot remain waiting forever.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission was also asked several times to draw up Community guidelines for risk mapping. I should also like to highlight the importance of carrying out a complete inventory of the sources of information because it is only possible to proceed in an appropriate way if there is accurate information.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Some of the suggestions and proposals presented in the Ferreira report were contained in my report, which was adopted by Parliament in 2006, and the Commission has not yet given a response to many of these proposals. I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether he can report on the work done so far in connection with the creation of the European Drought Observatory, and also about the directive on forest fires.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, summers are hotter and storms are more severe. Rainfall is more erratic and we have more droughts causing life-threatening fires across our continent. Hardly a country has escaped a natural disaster in the last few years and this is not counting the man-made catastrophes such as Chernobyl and, more recently, the toxic dam in Hungary.</p>
      <p sl="de">Citizens look to their elected representatives to ensure the planning for their protection is efficient and reliable and in place. We have had many promises and reports from the Commission, yet little concrete action has been forthcoming. We have been promised progress in setting up a network of competent national services in Member States. A map of assets, that is readily available and ready to use when disaster strikes, was promised in 2009. National authorities should now be requested to put core equipment on standby, available for rapid European assistance when needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my own region, we have in Bracknell the world-renowned medium-range weather forecasting centre. Its information assists mariners, aircraft and emergency planners from a range of real-time sources around the world, but we need more than these sorts of facilities. We need to know where the trained emergency service teams are. We need to know where the emergency food supplies, the tents and the blankets are.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to know where the facilities are that will save the lives of citizens of our Union when they need them. The Commission must come forward with these plans now. Tomorrow’s disaster may be just around the corner.</p>

The prevention of natural and man-made disasters is of enormous and increasing importance, and the Commission is systematically presenting us with a number of aims for procedure and timing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, there is a very complicated problem, which I have already mentioned. The Solidarity Fund is the instrument which normally responds to these situations, but it does so after a very, very long period, from nine months to a year, and this is after a disaster. As has already been mentioned, and I shall continue to repeat this as we shall continue to repeat this for as long as it takes, in the case of Madeira, there was a massive disaster there a year ago, and it has still not received any aid.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should therefore like to stress this question anew: is it not time for the Commission to review the procedure for its own fund and funding model? How can we maintain a fund to deal with increasingly drastic exceptional situations? We do not know where it will happen, but we know that it will happen, and climate change is there to prove it. Therefore, the exception can never apply to a situation that occurs on a regular basis.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Whereas in the case of preventive measures taken against natural disasters, we must try especially to improve systems for monitoring natural phenomena – be they changes in the weather or tectonic shifts – and then to improve the mathematical models for evaluating and forecasting changes, their consequences and the related warning mechanisms or subsequent evacuation, in the area of man-made disasters, we can work much more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As we are aware of the risks of different human activities, especially commercial activities that threaten the environment, we know how to reduce in a preventive manner the risk of a possible disaster arising from the performance of any kind of risk-prone activity through good regulatory measures. A preventative regulatory framework, however, just like systems for supervision, inspection, sanctions and repression, must be comprehensive and must be implemented with complete thoroughness and emphasis.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In the interests of protecting the health and lives of our citizens, we must therefore work systematically to improve these mechanisms for protecting against disasters.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we can endorse what has been said here. Disasters have just continued to increase in number. The EU could really do a lot about this: exchange of information, support and solidarity. Here, of course, one gains added value, which is only to be expected of the Union as far as these issues are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I myself, however, would like to take advantage of this opportunity and ask the Commissioner a question. Three to four years ago, there was a huge forest fire in Russia, resulting in massive smoke damage in my own country, Finland. Many people actually suffered serious health problems caused by this smoke. At the time, the European Parliament here decided to call on the Commission to negotiate an agreement with Russia on how the EU could come to its assistance in such cases and provide the necessary help, which Russia then needed but which it did not agree to accept. I would like to know if the Commission has made any headway in this matter and implemented measures.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Disasters are not merely confined to the EU: they also occur beyond our borders, and they often have an impact on the EU’s Member States. I would like to know what progress has been made with Russia on this.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, after the ecological disaster in Hungary last October, I drew the European Commission’s attention on more than one occasion to the issue of disaster prevention in the mining industry. In the case of the mining sector, accidents can often have a cross-border impact. This is all the more reason why the European Union has a duty to ensure that every possible measure is taken to reduce the risk of accidents and to improve the speed and efficiency of the response when these accidents, nevertheless, occur.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I received confirmation from the Commission, in response to my questions, that the waste discharged into the environment from the accident in Hungary, including into the Danube, was actually toxic, even though this had initially been denied by the authorities. This is a perfectly clear example of regulations which are not being applied, a situation which must change as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is the European Commission’s duty to take urgent action in the wake of the resolution adopted last year by Parliament, calling for a ban on the use of cyanide-based technologies in mining as they pose huge cross-border threats to ecosystems.</p>

The report makes particular mention of the fact that agricultural production is vulnerable to climate phenomena such as drought, frost, hail, forest fires, floods, landslides and others. The report also contains a number of important suggestions aimed at mitigating the impact of these problems. The author has already mentioned the idea of providing some assurances for agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, last October, Hungary received expert assistance and material resources to deal with the damage caused by the red sludge disaster, yet no substantive assistance was provided. It was extremely difficult to explain to people why humanitarian assistance can be provided to citizens of countries outside of the EU, but not to EU Member States. It is obvious that the ‘polluter pays’ principle must be applied in the event of industrial disasters, but in most of these cases, these companies do not have enough money. The Commission promised to make environmental liability insurance mandatory for all companies engaged in hazardous activities. At the same time, I propose that – with adequate regulation – the Solidarity Fund should be opened up to the partial alleviation of industrial catastrophes, I emphasise, partial …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the concept of disaster prevention, particularly where our Hungarian friends are concerned, clearly deserves a great deal of attention because something went wrong when dealing with the toxic sludge disaster in Hungary last October. In its report, the Commission found there to be clear failings on the part of the local authorities, which failed to classify the hazardous wastewater and made major errors in connection with construction work on the reservoir. The Commission also found that the European Waste Catalogue – the Mining Waste Directives – had not been transposed into Hungarian law. It is therefore important for the individual Member States to incorporate European standards into their legal standards in a binding manner.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition to disaster prevention, the proper application of these European standards is also important, as is the exchange of best practice and helping the Member States to help themselves.

      <p sl="ro">To be able to counter the effects caused by these phenomena, a risk chart is required, along with a coherent plan for managing environmental factors. The preservation and extension of forested areas, as well as green belts in urban environments, must be a priority for all of us. It is vital for us to give the importance that is due to the activities of informing and educating the general public with the aim of preventing the repercussions of disasters.

      <p sl="pt">We are talking about very sensitive situations that deal with the safety of people and their property, and that often touch us all because of the loss of lives, the destruction of families, and the devastation of whole livelihoods. However, all our demonstrations matter little when compared with the tragedies, which, through the media, affect us all, and make us aware that we cannot fall behind with the work we should be doing to avoid, minimise or, better assist these situations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Commissioner, my fellow Members have highlighted this matter very well.

      <p sl="de">However, it is also the case that many disasters are simply caused by man, and in this regard, we have to say that the ‘polluter pays’ principle should be applied. To always immediately call for help from the Union is the wrong way to go. However, European solidarity is indeed called for, of course, where disasters genuinely occur as a result of force majeure, when genuine natural disasters happen. In this regard, there is no doubt that our European solidarity should start with prevention – for example, in connection with protective structures to prevent avalanches, flood defences, mapping and monitoring systems.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is much talk about buzz words here today, but the key buzz word is the first word up on the board: prevention. As the old adage says, ‘prevention is better than cure’ and certainly we have to try and prevent natural disasters based on recent trends, to get out some kind of a forecast and to put preventive actions in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need some type of a trans-European insurance mechanism, because otherwise, affected areas will not be able to afford insurance. For instance, in my own area, in the town of Clonmel, insurance has gone up sixfold because of the risk of flooding.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I want to ask how many countries can actually say that they have complied with the Commission’s recommendations, especially in relation to the Floods Directive?

Moreover, the Treaty of Lisbon has introduced a solidarity clause for the provision of assistance to Member States suffering the consequences of natural disasters.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank everyone for their wide-ranging contributions to the debate. Wherever a direct appeal has been made to the competence of my colleague, Mrs Georgieva, we will provide you with written answers, for example, with regard to the status of talks and negotiations with Russia on the question of information and monitoring.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to take this opportunity – since the European Solidarity Fund falls within my remit – to tell you that this Fund is an instrument that was created seven or eight years ago and that is not financed from the budget. Whenever a disaster occurs, a very complex procedure has to be followed – firstly, there is an assessment and then there is also the codecision of the European Parliament and the Council – which can result in delays.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the specific case of Madeira, I can tell you that within the next 14 days, we will get a signature and payment. The delay was also caused by the fact that the Member State was very late in providing a lot of the necessary information. This also needs to be taken into account. At the end of the day, we also need to be able to demonstrate, and it must also be possible to verify, what the funds have actually been used for. Nevertheless, the structure of the Solidarity Fund should also continue to be developed. Discussions to this effect are also ongoing within the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">The issue of drought assessment is – quite frankly – relatively difficult to incorporate. The situation is different with regard to technological disasters, for example. These issues need to be reassessed in the light of the experience we have gained in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards the funds provided in the area of the structural funds for example, a total of EUR 7.5 billion is available Europe-wide in the current financial period for risk prevention and corresponding environmental protection measures. Of this, around 20% has already been allocated to specific projects.</p>
      <p sl="de">As MEPs for an electoral district or Land, you know as well as I do that administrative problems often arise between regions and Member States because it is not clear who is responsible for what. In practice, that often results in delays in the implementation of projects. Overcoming these problems would be an important achievement, because it is in the interests of the people and the regions for us to actually use the money that has been made available and not to founder on account of administrative or bureaucratic problems or to allow these problems to cause delays.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to say that we actually intend to put forward a legislative proposal at the end of the year for how we can take a more focused approach with regard to the way we monitor and respond to disasters throughout Europe. I would like to thank you once again for your commitment and persistence on this matter and I would like to ask you also to continue – and I will finish by saying this – to pay such a high level of attention to implementation and to utilising the financial resources that are, in principle, available in the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In its communication of 23 February 2009 entitled ‘A Community approach on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters’, the Commission, amongst other things, undertook the task of correlating available and existing information sources on preventive measures and catastrophes. I would like to take this opportunity to note that the way the New Zealand Government handled the notification of those who are deaf and hard of hearing during its most recent catastrophe is an inspiring example that must be put into practice. At the end of 2010, the government of New Zealand published several resource materials, as well as a DVD, which prepared the affected players, the authorities and the population using sign language for a potential catastrophe. This practice saved lives as well as property. According to local civil organisations and the World Federation of the Deaf (www.wfdeaf.org), the government of Queensland and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) should be proud – in spite of the tragedies which, regrettably, still occurred – of the success achieved by their excellent preparation and cooperation, and particularly of providing live and immediate communication that reached the deaf. In light of this, I hope that the Commission will review the good practice of this non-EU Member State and popularise and promote its implementation in Member States, as well as within the scope of the application of EU resources.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the volcanic eruption last April resulted in the closure of many sectors of European air space. The crisis that ensued affected more than 10 million travellers and had serious economic repercussions. The resolution of the volcanic ash crisis left a lot to be desired due to the lack of coordination between institutions, the lack of specifications and flexibility, not to mention failure to make optimum use of the technical resources.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I said it then and I continue to maintain that it is of paramount importance for the necessary measures to be taken so that we can ensure that a new volcanic eruption will not have the same consequences. Responsibility for flight safety, which includes avoiding areas contaminated by ash, must lie with the operator and crew. Operators must be supplied with accurate data so that they can implement the best solutions. Pilots are trained to cope with exceptional air conditions and have the experience required to evaluate the risk and make decisions about redirecting the flight.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The following elements are required to make this process operate as efficiently as possible: supervision and forecasting must be improved and more money must be invested in equipment on the ground and in the air. The technical structure must be able to supply accurate data in real time and constant forecasts, which can be provided by current technology. The use of several centres for collecting and supplying this information will improve the risk evaluation and relevant flight scheduling. The role of crisis management institutions must be clarified to ensure that operators receive this information which they need for making decisions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The regulatory body must be responsible for supervision, while Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres are responsible for notifying air navigation service providers about eruptions and high-risk areas. Service providers must inform air crews about the areas at high risk of ash contamination. The parties involved must be trained in effective crisis management using simulation exercises.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that it is an absolute requirement for EASA to draw up the specifications required to clarify responsibilities and control at operational level. Achieving the Single European Sky and implementing SESAR would facilitate enormously the decision-making process and would reduce significantly the impact in the event of a crisis. I believe that these are the key points which need to be resolved so that we can ensure that we are prepared to manage such a situation successfully in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the opportunity that this oral question gives us to revisit the problems experienced by travellers and the wider aviation industry during last year’s Icelandic volcano crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">What became clear last year was that Member States and the EU as a whole had no plan for such an eventuality, the data used was incomplete, the meteorologists could not or, indeed, would not help, and everybody perfected the art of blaming someone else and adopted a policy of risk aversion rather than one of risk management.</p>
      <p sl="en">To be frank, Mr President, Member States bottled it last year. But, Mr President, that was then. What about the future? Do we have a comprehensive plan to cover the next volcanic eruption? Should this happen, will Member States coordinate at EU level in future? Crucially, will they involve the aviation industry and, particularly, airlines before they issue their advice? We have to avoid the mistakes made last year which gave us the nonsense of one country closing its airspace whilst a neighbouring country kept theirs open, leading to chaos, confusion and huge economic consequences.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally Mr President, the Icelandic volcano highlighted one major thing: it has strengthened the argument for a Single European Sky better than any politician could have done. Our role now is to develop and deliver this as a matter of urgency, even though, as usual, the Member States are back to their old habits of dragging their feet on this much-needed project.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have just spoken about natural disasters in the previous agenda item. In this case, it was a force of nature that brought air traffic to a complete standstill. Eyjafjallajökull – everyone probably knows of this volcano now – erupted last year and brought a large proportion of air traffic to a complete standstill. Incidentally, I just noticed once again during the previous speech that we have an excellent chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, because what he said is very similar to what I wanted to say. I will now try to change my speech somewhat.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was indeed chaos – Mr Simpson has already said that. As Europeans, with high-tech capabilities and with so much already coordinated, we were, in fact, helpless when it came to dealing with this disaster and finding solutions to it. We realised that there were too few agreements in place. We then set up a task force. The questions that concerned us with regard to this issue were whether the task force actually has any valid results already that could be discussed and has it published any studies? I do not know of any at least. Have all of the international experts on such volcanic eruptions actually been consulted? After all, as we already discussed here in plenary last year, there are other parts of the world where volcanic eruptions are much more frequent than in Europe and they somehow manage to have up-to-date data and to coordinate the whole situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is also something else that causes me concern. On 4 May, it was also mentioned in the Council of transport ministers that we need a linked-up European transport system. That can, of course, help in such cases. How far have we come in terms of being able to respond better in the event of a further volcanic eruption? We cannot predict this, of course. It will just happen.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one further question: do we know exactly what technology we would need to be able to deal with this situation better? In Germany, we now have appropriate devices at all weather stations that collect the data and are able to pass on this up-to-date data very quickly to the people responsible at the airlines and also to pilots so that they can decide whether or not it is safe to fly.</p>
      <p sl="de">One further point which has not been mentioned yet but which I think is important in this context is the following: this ash crisis, and the subsequent problems it posed for the air transport industry, affected 10 million passengers and, of course, also many companies. Some passengers were stranded and were unable to continue their journeys. The question therefore arises as to how things stand with regard to passengers’ rights. We have rights for air passengers, but I have the impression that, in this case, they have not always been fully utilised. Perhaps we should also revise these passenger rights once more.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are a lot of questions here. Mr Hahn, I do not know whether you will be able to answer them now, as transport is not actually your area. Otherwise, I am sure that the questions I raised in addition to the written question can be answered later. You will notice that this subject is of great concern to us. After all, the air transport industry is very important, and we therefore need a Single European Sky.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, I should not so much like to repeat what Members have said, but why are we, in fact, asking this question? Nearly a year has gone by since these events, and it is possible that they will simply be forgotten. Nevertheless, we wanted to ensure that this issue was still important to the Commission and we await the Commissioner’s action on these promised issues as a lesson from last year’s volcanic eruption. In effect, it proved that the aviation market is possibly the European Union’s domestic market to an extent unlike no other mode of transport across Europe. That, in turn, means that taking decisions, as well as their preparation, possibly requires a process that differs from that required for other modes of transport. It is a question of the absence of these data and the non-participation of the operators in the decision-making process, as well as of the fact that the decision is taken at Member State level. In principle, of course, this has its basis in law. However, even though I belong to a political group that always supports the principle of subsidiarity, on this occasion, I think that, taking into account the actual situation last year, we ought to consider on the basis of this example whether decisions should not be taken at European level to a greater extent. Passengers are also concerned that different airlines behave differently towards passengers, and to always obtain compensation from these airlines through the courts is not the easiest thing. Clearly, we should not have a situation where different airlines can emerge from this crisis in different ways, with different costs. Finally, the third point I should like to stress is the lesson that can be drawn from this crisis, namely, that in the European Union, various ‘islands’ exist, as it were, that are not connected by different modes of transport to other European Union Member States. This means that when planning the TEN-T map this year and the TEN-T budget for the next financial perspective, as well as the cohesion policy budget, we should allow for investment in other modes of transport, so that we can connect these ‘islands’ to the rest of the European Union. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Eyjafjallajökull eruption in Iceland in April 2010 had an enormous impact which required the EU to act urgently. The Commission therefore proposed immediate actions to coordinate the EU’s position and to strengthen the regulatory framework. This makes Europe a stronger partner at a global level.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is actively engaged in practical work to refine the existing volcanic ash avoidance methodologies in aviation. For example, the Commission has launched a specific call under the Seventh Framework Programme called ‘Technology support for crisis coordination for the air transport system following major disrupting events’. In parallel, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is preparing rules for air-worthiness requirements and risk assessment for safe flight in airspace with volcanic contaminants.</p>
      <p sl="en">From an operational perspective, an approach has been developed in close cooperation with the EASA. This approach reflects practices in other parts of the world. The guiding principles are as follows: first, the airline is responsible for the safety of its operations. Before operating in airspace contaminated by volcanic ash, the airline must produce a safety risk assessment and have it accepted by its supervising authority. This process must be repeated when important changes occur.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, the airline must show that the information sources it uses in its safety risk assessment are correct. It also has to show its own competence and capability to interpret such data correctly. Before starting operations, the airline must obtain from the manufacturers specific information regarding the susceptibility of the aircraft to the effects of airborne ash and the impact of such ash on its airworthiness. This must be reflected in the safety risk assessment.</p>
      <p sl="en">In dealing with disruptive events such as this, a key element is collaborative decision making between Member States and industry. To ensure comprehensive and coordinated actions, the Commission, together with Eurocontrol, established a European Aviation Crisis Coordination Cell, following the Council of Transport Ministers meeting of 4 May 2010. Since its creation, the cell has met on several occasions to develop its structures and procedures. To test and verify its timely functionality, this cell will be part of a volcano exercise planned for 13 and 14 April 2011 under the auspices of the UN’s aviation body, the ICAO.</p>
      <p sl="en">The volcanic ash crisis highlighted the crucial importance of the Single European Sky. The Commission has therefore accelerated its implementation via, for example, the adoption of the SES Performance Scheme and the associated EU-wide performance targets, the adoption of implementing rules for network management functions, the designation of the network manager, the adoption of implementing rules and guidance material for the functional airspace blocks, the nomination of the former MEP, Mr Georg Jarzembowski, as the functional airspace blocks coordinator and the expected finalisation by April 2011 of the extension of the EASA’s competence for safety regulation in the field of air traffic management.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me therefore conclude by saying that the Commission is continuing to work on these very complex and technical issues. The Commission is working together with EASA, ICAO, Member States and industry to ensure the safety of European airspace.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Hahn, I naturally consider your response to be the response of the Commission, and I also do not expect you to go into the specific questions put forward by the Committee on Transport and Tourism today.</p>
      <p sl="de">One thing was clear: more than 100 000 flights were cancelled and 300 airports and more than 10 million passengers were affected. We must learn lessons from such an event. That is also the reason for the question that we are raising today, because there was a very quick call for coordination and this was clearly not forthcoming. It is not possible to improvise coordinated action in the space of 24 hours. These are the questions that we want answers to today, and it is not only Parliament that wants these answers; the citizens of Europe want them, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first thing we want to know is has the information relating to both the effects and the location of such phenomena improved or not?</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, what role will EU bodies play in this regard in future and what powers of decision will they have? Will we continue to have 27 simultaneously existing decisions, or does the Commission already have other proposals, and to what extent will the airlines be involved here? This question has come up very often.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Crisis Committee is supposed to meet – it does meet and will also carry out tests. It would be extremely important for this Parliament and therefore also for European citizens to be informed of the results of these tests.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to coordination, it is important for this to be established outside the EU, too. We also need to agree on structures at international level, as the airspace and also certain disasters know no boundaries in this context.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another important factor as far as we are concerned is the passengers. We talk about 10 million passengers, but these 10 million passengers were not only tourists who had to or were happy to extend their holidays; there were also people who had to get home or had to get somewhere urgently. In this case, we cannot simply refer to passengers’ rights; rather, we are under obligation to work in a coordinated way and to provide alternatives and greater use of other modes of transport. For example, we need a more rapid allocation of rail routes when this is necessary. This is also not possible to improvise in the space of 24 hours. These are questions that we want to raise on behalf of citizens and passengers, too. It is not just a question of explaining their rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last but not least – and you mentioned this – the airspace blocks, or what are referred to as FABs: the proposal is to have seven instead of 27. That could work. However, I would simply venture to predict today that we will not manage to do this by 2012, because the Member States do not want it. In this regard, we must also send a very clear outward signal that a reduction in the number of airspace blocks is absolutely necessary. It can work, too. Mr Hahn, I invite you to come to Maastricht – it is not very far for you to come. There, cooperation between three or four countries in respect of the upper layer of the airspace is already in place. That is where all of the problems that the countries bring up are solved. Go there, suggest it to the Commission, and use it as a model for Europe, for the seven FABs. We will then be able to regulate this within twelve months.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as I am not a member of the Transport Committee, some Members might wonder why I am so keen to speak on this very issue. But I was, like others, a victim of the ash cloud. I was travelling to Baku and could only get back with great difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="en">This concerns all European citizens. It was an opportunity for Europe to show its added value – and we failed. I think European citizens understood that the EU was not yet prepared for taking a single action, but we have to make sure that we are ready to take a single action in the next similar case. Therefore, I think that the need for the Single European Sky project is imperative. We all agree on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although I am not a member of the Transport Committee, I would like to mention that not only a Single European Sky is needed, but also a single European infrastructure connected to this. Therefore, here in this plenary session, I would like to draw attention to the need for Galileo and for GMES – as they are potentially a great European infrastructure if we can build them – to deliver on that purpose. This is why we are working to get the budget lines for those issues, but we have to explain better to European citizens why these projects are needed.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, a little less than a year ago, three hundred airports were closed in Europe in 23 out of the 27 countries of the Union. That caused considerable financial losses and, above all, as previous speakers have pointed out, more than 10 million people, not all of whom were on tourist trips, had to postpone their journeys and find other means of transport.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This was a result of the havoc wrought by a wholly natural event, which placed us in an important context in relation to nature, and which caused unprecedented paralysis in the skies above Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is, of course, difficult to predict a volcanic eruption and, even more so, the formation of a volcanic ash cloud – more difficult, of course, than predicting a snow episode. However, the crisis caused by this cloud highlights all the shortcomings and deficiencies of air traffic management in the Union as well as the weakness and absence of a number of management tools.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the basis of these three factors, I would like to put forward three proposals for recovery: firstly, regarding imperative comodality; secondly, concerning the need for the Community method to respond to such challenges; thirdly, and naturally at the heart of our concerns, relating to the rights of passengers, which are central to our concerns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the first element, the crisis has highlighted the fact that it was absolutely crucial to strengthen comodality in European transport, since the cloud highlighted the limits not only of aviation systems at European level but, more especially, of rail travel, since countless travellers were unable to find an alternative. As demonstrated in the studies that have been carried out over the last year, one can image that, with more comodality, the scale of the crisis would not have been so huge and the paralysis would have been somewhat less.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the second element, as in the financial crisis and in the debates we are having on the Community method compared with intergovernmental operations, here, in the area of transport, intergovernmental operations or a fragmented response from 27 Member States are not what will resolve the difficulties we have encountered and which may return, but rather a genuinely Community method. That would require strengthening the competences of Eurocontrol in a Community system and, of course, as has been pointed out, completing the Single European Sky as a matter of urgency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, there are the passengers, who are at the heart and the centre of our concerns …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the Commission – something I do not often do – for very consistently placing the focus on safety, even in the face of protests from some airlines, which tried to make light of the problem because such problems have a financial impact. However, safety must remain the guiding principle for the future, too. A few improvements that we can achieve at European level are necessary, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">For example, how about improving our common measuring systems? Do we now have strategies in place for how and with what division of labour such pollution incidents can be measured so that we can issue halfway reliable statements more quickly? I know that this is extremely difficult to do, particularly on account of meteorological conditions, but I would like to know whether any progress has been made here with regard to coordination, so that we are at least taking measurements and evaluating them according to the same criteria.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, this crisis caused by the volcanic ash has shown how vulnerable our highly equipped air transport system now is – that is something that is obvious to all of us already at our airports. Under normal operating conditions, two or three delays already have a whole series of consequences, making use of the service under normal operating conditions more and more difficult, let alone if there is the additional problem of external weather events or something like a volcanic ash crisis; the situation then becomes one of utter chaos. We have no error-tolerant system, and in this area, we also need to make improvements, as a system is only as good as its ability to respond in an error-tolerant manner in relevant cases.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has also become apparent that we are facing a serious shortcoming, namely, the general lack of cooperation between rail, road and air transport. Precisely because we have insufficient cooperation, it was hardly possible to take appropriate compensatory measures on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the Single Sky, the necessity of which has become apparent here – as coordinated measures would, in any case, have been better – I would say that, as long as each Member State is convinced that it is the only one that is truly capable of controlling its own airspace efficiently and that all of the others are absolutely incapable of doing so – and I am talking here about our airspace in Central Europe – we will not make any progress in this regard. This egotism damages European cooperation and, ultimately, also the European idea. We need to be clear about that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it has been said in the debate but I will reiterate that we are all aware of the huge extent of the disruption caused by the volcanic ash cloud. As has been mentioned, over 100 000 flights were cancelled, tens of millions of business and holiday passengers were not able to travel as planned, goods and cargo were delayed or not transported at all, businesses were affected and our European carriers and airports suffered catastrophic financial losses. All in all, it cost the European airlines more than EUR 2 billion. Institutions across Europe and in Member States who were responsible for dealing with such issues were absolutely paralysed and, quite frankly, if it had not been so serious, it would have been practically laughable.</p>
      <p sl="en">In all this chaos, one thing was clear. Air transport is enormously important for the European economy and as individuals, we depend on a thriving and efficient air transport industry where safety for crew and passengers is the first prerogative. As such, I am delighted to support this oral question, not least because during our previous plenary debate on this issue, I called for the European Union to look at international best practice on dealing with volcanic ash and, more particularly, highlighted America, which has always applied a more measured approach in this regard. I certainly welcomed the fact that the Commission, in its assessment of the crisis, accepted that Europe needed to revise procedures through the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">International best practice tells us that responsibility for dealing with potential hazards related to volcanic ash must be transferred to the airline operators as part of their safety management systems. The role of the authorities is to audit the airline safety management system to ensure that it meets the required safety standards. This is the procedure applied by the US and other countries which have managed to deal with volcanic eruptions without major disruptions to air traffic.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clear and decisive joined-up leadership is essential and we need the European Aviation Safety Agency to ensure that EU Member States adapt their current procedures to guarantee that airline operators will take responsibility and be supported in making such decisions in future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, the crisis in April and May last year made it absolutely clear that as a priority, we need to push for the full implementation of the Single European Sky and SESAR. Both European industry and the taxpayer have already invested huge sums of money in these projects and, as European lawmakers, we must continue to push forward well balanced, cost-effective and structural reforms. I welcome the comments by the Commissioner today. Let us hope that we move forward now in a positive way.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, since we are again discussing today the crisis caused by volcanic ash, it would seem that this topic is still relevant and that questions remain unanswered. We understand that volcanoes do not follow any rules and we cannot exclude unforeseen circumstances. All of this is about the survival of the aviation industry, but aircraft are hampered not just by volcanoes, but also by storms, snow and similar phenomena. Understandably, it is impossible to eliminate, stop or predict everything that may happen in aviation. Clearly, aircraft safety, people’s lives and their mobility must rank among our most important considerations.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I am pleased that a comprehensive programme is being pursued by implementing the Single Sky initiative in order to modernise air traffic management. I agree with my fellow Member who said just now that a common infrastructure also needs to be established. However, while I am on the subject, I would like to say that today, we should consider and discuss the development of alternative transport. We need and must achieve greater progress in this area. This crisis had a particular impact on the European Union’s eastern Member States, which remained separated from part of Western Europe and, unlike the other European Union Member States, did not have sufficient opportunity to choose alternative modes of transport. We now know that we urgently need to establish a alternative secondary mobility system, trans-European networks, rail networks, an alternative to air transport, such as has wisely been done with regard to electricity and telecommunications networks. Therefore, given the financial perspectives, more ambitious goals need to be set when reviewing the trans-European networks. Land transport and, above all, railways should be able to replace air transport more smoothly if the latter is withdrawn. The time has come to consider specific alternatives and to implement these as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">I have been dealing over the last number of months, indeed even this week, with residual cases from individual constituents who have been affected by this particular crisis. At the time of the volcanic ash crisis, the costs were estimated to be in excess of GBP 200 million a day in UK flights alone. Therefore, in order to avoid this, we must have much greater cooperation and much more cognisance of best practice so that we have a plan in place to prevent future disruptions and such a horrendous impact on the economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have said, I have had a lot of complaints from individual constituents, most of which centred on the airlines, their treatment of these individuals and their failure to recognise their duty of care. I would ask the Commission to look at this as well.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we, of course, know about the sad stories that were heard when the ash cloud formed. Many people were unable to get to the funerals of their relatives, their children’s weddings or similar occasions. They were very personal, regrettable incidents, not to speak of the financial cost incurred through the suffering of 10 million people. As you see, nothing actually worked.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We were unable to reply that the EU had a solution to these situations, and here, the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism correctly said that this risk could not have been anticipated, it could not have been controlled, and the whole thing was more like complete chaos.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Now, the Commission should give the public the answers it wants as quickly as possible: the answers to whether we have technical solutions or whether the airlines will discover them. If there are any, what might they be? What will the rights of passengers be in the future, if the same situation arises, where people cannot fly or get home? When will there be an effective common European airspace? The answer people want, obviously, is as soon as possible, so that this cannot continue for much longer. What is the alternative plan? What means of transport are to be used? This time, people were at a loss. Others ordered taxis from Spain to Finland, paying thousands of euro in fares. This situation cannot be repeated in the future: there should be a plan in place for how people can be better served as regards these alternative arrangements.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In this connection, I wish to raise another issue mentioned here, and another natural upheaval: snow. Tens of thousands of people in December were stranded at airports in Europe when it snowed. In my own country, Finland, there is continual heavy snow and there are harsh frosts, but things work. We therefore have to get European airports to work properly too. This is not too difficult and we cannot just give up: matters should be dealt with so as to guarantee citizen’s access to justice.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the Icelandic volcano eruption, as well as the huge volumes of snow which fell last year, seriously disrupted European air traffic, with significant economic and social consequences. With the aim of avoiding such situations in the future, I would like to ask the Commission what main new regulations it has in mind for improving the legislative framework for the rights of passengers travelling by air.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In spite of the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres in London and Toulouse, which are part of an international network of nine such centres set up by the ICAO, and the specialist London centre producing volcanic ash cloud risk charts, we also need to improve the European infrastructure by introducing a system for measuring the concentration of volcanic ash clouds in real time.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Regulation (EC) No 1070/2009 on improving the performance of the European aviation system requires Member States to take the necessary measures to guarantee implementation of the functional airspace blocks by 4 December 2012.</p>

The European Union also needs to provide comodality and a system for booking and issuing tickets for European routes involving several modes of transport.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the volcanic ash crisis last year prompted the cancellation of close to 100 000 flights, resulting in absolute chaos for passengers. It is the effect that this crisis had on passengers that I wish to draw the Commission’s attention to today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over 10 million people were affected and the cancellations resulted in significant economic costs for thousands of passengers. While airports have signs and leaflets informing travellers of their rights, this is often of little use when faced with cancellations or major travel disruptions such as that caused by the ash cloud. Under EU legislation, passengers have a right to information and assistance from their airline.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, in reality, the majority of passengers whose travel has been disrupted will spend a lot of time and money chasing down information, seeking alternative tickets or compensation with airlines. This is an issue that the Commission needs be more effective on. The biggest frustration that passengers face in situations like this is trying to get information, trying to get in contact with the airlines. Although they are aware of their rights, this is of little help to them if they are stranded in an airport or on hold to an airline.</p>
      <p sl="en">While I appreciate that, at the time of the ash crisis, airlines were under unprecedented pressure to deal with thousands of passengers – and I must admit that some did admirably – in general, it is very difficult for people to get information and assistance when it is needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The travel chaos as a result of the bad weather in December 2010 further demonstrates this. Passengers require up-to-date information but they need to be able to reach the airlines in order to exercise their rights. Airlines, airport customer services and information need to be more accessible to passengers whose travel has been disrupted. It is not enough to inform European Union citizens of their passenger rights; they must be assisted in exercising them in times of travel chaos.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this was a natural disaster which had terrible consequences for many people. However, if we compare it with the floods and the simultaneous hurricane in Australia or with the earthquake in Christchurch in New Zealand, we all escaped unharmed. Safety had absolute priority, and rightly so. Commissioner Kallas made the right decision in agreement with the EU transport ministers in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">I cannot understand the criticism directed at the airlines. They clearly suffered a loss – a figure of 2 billion was mentioned. However, it is wrong to lay the responsibility as to whether or not flights go ahead at the feet of the airlines. That decision must be made at a political level. Safety must be given top priority. Imagine if an aeroplane had crashed as a result of the volcanic ash. We would have had a completely different debate, namely, how irresponsible it was to even allow one aeroplane to take off.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need a plan B, as has quite rightly been said, and the rail system is the alternative. As a result of their exemption from fuel tax, airlines receive EUR 30 billion per year from European taxpayers. This money must be invested in the rail system, at least in parts of it, so that we have an alternative in the event of this sort of disaster.</p>

However, this nonetheless shows the undoubted scale of the paralysis in which we found ourselves. Of course, the previous speakers who spoke about a certain alternative in the form of developing the rail network are right. That is obvious. In the field of aviation, the answer to this problem is definitely better coordination and strengthening of the role of the European Aviation Safety Agency. In addition, it is good that in November, the European Parliament adopted a suitable regulation on this matter. It was a step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the volcanic eruption forces us to rethink transportation priorities. The time has come to begin favouring rail in medium-distance transport up to 1 500 km, for which subsidies, taxes, and other regulatory mechanisms could be used as needed. An important consideration is that significant internal market demand is noticeable in connection with the modernisation of railroad tracks as well as the manufacturing of rolling stock, both of which could create numerous jobs. In view of check-in and airport transfer times, aeroplanes – in comparison with high-speed trains – provide a zero minimal time benefit while causing considerable carbon dioxide and noise pollution. Even though we cannot prevent volcanic eruptions, we can improve the technology used to predict them and how we evaluate the resulting situation. However, a genuine solution can only be provided by transforming transport, energy and industrial policy, because volcanic eruptions cause either no disruption, or only local disruption, to rail transport.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as many of us have said just now, the eruption of the Icelandic volcano last April was a painful illustration of the fragmentation and ineffectiveness of the European sky. Each of us in this Chamber was directly affected. Five million of our citizens were stranded with no real alternative form of transport available. One year after that exceptional event, new European measures have so far failed to materialise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, you said that a first crisis exercise, linked to volcanic ash, is scheduled for 13 and 14 April under the coordination of Eurocontrol, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), but it is essential that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) exercises real leadership to coordinate safety measures at European level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is certain that the information provided by the Visual Approach Charts (VAC) of London and Toulouse must be refined using more modern technologies. As we saw last April, however, the data may be contradictory and may lead each Member State to take decisions concerning the closure of their air space that are motivated less by information than by emotion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, the role of the EASA is vital in proposing a harmonised interpretation of the data, as well as in ensuring the centralisation and proper dissemination of the information. Beyond the information provided by the VACs, the EASA must put in place a mechanism for collecting the available data in close cooperation with the Member States, the airlines and their pilots.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This centralisation of information and the coordination of all those involved will prevent the chaos and the inconsistencies we witnessed last year. So I expect the Commission, together with the EASA, to be able to submit specific proposals in the very near future, which will be integrated fully in the implementation of the Single European Sky.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the volcanic ash cloud crisis caused huge disruption during last April and into May. As Mrs Foster said, many of us realised how dependent we are on modern air travel. Certainly when you come from where I come from, where it is impossible to get to your work unless you use the aeroplane, then that really brings it home to you. Everybody who travelled during that time probably has stories to tell, and some people were very badly affected. In addition, the economic losses airlines and other businesses suffered as a result of grounded flights and stranded passengers were substantial.</p>
      <p sl="en">People have said that this could happen again. I think this is what we have got to be prepared for, because there did seem to be an awful lot of indecision. Let me be very honest: as someone who flies every week, when I am up there at 39 000 feet, I want, above all, to be safe and secure, so I do not ever argue about security.

I do not recall a similar paralysis of air traffic in Europe ever happening before. The European Commission, under pressure from public opinion and the aviation industry, announced quick and decisive action as early as April last year. Unfortunately, the volcanic ash has settled, and the Commission’s ambitions have fallen with it. To date, a European crisis management plan for similar situations has not been drafted. It has also not been possible as yet to agree on a common position between safety experts, aircraft manufacturers, airlines and market regulators. It is, therefore, necessary to ask the following questions today: what has been done about this over the last year? If a similar volcanic eruption occurred today, would we react differently than a year ago? When will we be presented with specific measures?</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are conducting a sustained dialogue on the Single European Sky, on body and liquid scanners, and on procedures for natural disasters such as a volcanic eruption or a severe attack of winter.

The question therefore arises as to how we should deal with such situations in the future. It is, of course, first and foremost a question of the safety of those people who board an aeroplane. Of course, we must also keep in mind how we intend to deal with the financial losses. My question to the Commission is therefore – Mr Hahn, perhaps you could also pass this on to Mr Kallas – what, in specific terms, are we planning? I would argue that it is particularly important for us to take over the coordination when it comes to test flights and limit values. That is very important in order for us to know which aeroplanes can take off and when.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have another comment, Commissioner: it is extremely important – and this has already been referred to many times – to establish the Single European Sky. What does the Commission intend to do in terms of exerting pressure on the Member States to actually fulfil their obligation in this regard? After all, they have put their signatures to it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another important point, which has already been made several times today, is what happens now with regard to passengers’ rights in air transport. We have Regulation (EC) No 2061 from 2004. What does the Commission intend to do in this regard? We are aware of the problem of the financial losses suffered by the various airlines. I would also like to point out once again that we need alternatives to air transport, and by that I mean the rail system. I am also one of those who believe that we must link the large cities – Europe’s capital cities – together. In this case, too, the answer is that we need more involvement from Europe, not less.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would be pleased if the Commission would give its attention to these issues.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mr Marinescu for pressing so strongly for this debate.</p>
      <p sl="it">Almost one year on from the event, we are gathered here to discuss this delicate issue, which caused extensive damage to passengers and businesses involved in both the air sector and, lest we forget, in other industries, too.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore consider it necessary to adopt a two-pronged approach. On the one hand, enhance coordination between the authorities and stakeholders, finally addressing the reform of Eurocontrol, which is not, of course, a body reporting directly to the European institutions, but which was, in any case, crucial in the management and lack of effective management of this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">The inadequacy of purely mathematical models, which led the authorities of individual countries to an almost total shutdown of the airspace even when there was no need, has been demonstrated. In the absence of a model tested in the field and more advanced technologies, an excess of caution led to very heavy damage and inconvenience.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, we must make decisive progress towards achieving the Single European Sky, developing all the functional airspace blocks (FABs) more quickly to reduce fragmentation in the management of airspace and to ensure their more effective management. On the other hand, it is necessary to guarantee the rights of travellers. In this regard, I hope that the Commission can submit its revision of the directive on package travel as soon as possible to clarify the framework of guarantees and liability in extraordinary situations and also any changes to the regulation on passengers’ rights when extraordinary situations are protracted.</p>
      <p sl="it">It would also be necessary – other fellow Members have said the same – to launch an emergency plan to provide alternative mobility, alternative means of transport if a similar situation should arise again.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to thank the Members who spoke earlier to highlight all the shortcomings of European air transport integration in connection with the use of air space, ground structures and trade networks. I would also like to emphasise, more specifically, the non airspace-related aspects that the volcano crisis revealed; that is to say; the lack of alternative networks to air transport, in particular, rail networks, as mentioned this morning, and, above all, the lack of integrated information systems to enable passengers to quickly find information relating to available alternative forms of transport.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This accident must prompt us to work towards developing alternative, efficient and competitive modes of transport. In this regard, the review of the first rail package as well as the revival of infrastructure policies through trans-European transport networks should move in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, I call upon the Commission to give serious consideration to establishing a single information and reservation interface for all interconnected modes of transport.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Europe was not prepared for such chaos, and the institutions responsible for crisis management were not up to the task. As a result of the air traffic embargo, the airlines lost USD 400 million every day. To lost ticket sales should be added the cost of accommodation, meals and transport for passengers who were stranded at airports.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Seismic and volcanic activity are not a novelty to the world, and other volcanic eruptions are possible in the future. Unfortunately, there is no suitable medicine for such a situation. At such times, the European Union should concentrate on ensuring its citizens alternative means of transport to flying. A good solution, as part of the TEN-T network being set up in the Union, will be the creation of a common network of railway connections and concentrating on improving high-speed rail transport. This would certainly be effective in helping resolve problems of this kind. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Hahn, I am not a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism either, but I believe that it is important for all of us to learn lessons from the ash crisis. As has already been said today, ‘safety first’ must, in future, be the guiding concept when it comes to finding a solution. We need to develop the railways and we need to develop a European rail network. However, we also need a form of overall coordination for passenger and freight transport, irrespective of whether it is by air, rail or road, in the event of earthquakes, ash clouds, floods or similar disasters.</p>
      <p sl="de">National contact points, like those we are now setting up in the health sector for cross-border patient care, would seem an almost obvious solution to this – national contact points to which people of all generations can turn. The fact is that I can also see a certain intergenerational inequality at the moment in air transport. It is almost impossible these days to obtain information without the Internet. We should work together to resolve this issue, too.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as many colleagues have stated, the volcanic ash crisis caused significant air traffic disruption and economic damage in 2010, damage that is still unquantifiable. Over 10 million passengers were directly affected as 100 000 flights were cancelled across Europe. I come from Ireland, and Irish air passengers faced extreme difficulties due to this ash cloud, as Ireland does not have land crossings to mainland Europe. I had to take sea crossings and trains, taxis and cars to get here to Strasbourg, which took me over 24 hours without sleep. Of course, that is a small price to pay; we have to ensure that safety is paramount.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation did, however, highlight the overwhelming need for a common policy. I welcome the recent initiatives by Commissioner Kallas to implement the Single European Sky and to establish functional air space. I also welcome the statement here today by Commission Hahn and I fully support these measures, as volcanic ash clouds recognise no political or geographical boundaries.</p>

I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to the fact that this also had a strong effect on the dissemination of, and access to, information. Due to the communications chaos, the negative effects of the crisis were felt by disadvantaged groups such as families with small children and persons with disabilities, who were unable to react appropriately. I ask the Commission whether, after April 2010, and in a similar crisis situation, every travelling citizen will have access to adequate information in order to appropriately exercise their right to information.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their understanding, knowing that I am not familiar with this issue. Members, you are right that my colleague, Vice-President Siim Kallas, is doing an excellent job and you will receive written answers to your specific questions where necessary. Having said that, I would like to thank you for an interesting debate, particularly as, like you, I was personally affected by events in various ways. Therefore, I would like to conclude by stating the following.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last year’s volcanic ash crisis clearly highlighted the need for us to work together to find solutions to avoid a repeat of the airspace closures we witnessed. That being said – and as was the case in April last year – actions taken in this regard cannot diminish the levels of safety that the aviation industry is renowned for around the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Crisis situations are not new to the European Union and the EU response to this crisis was timely and efficient. It showed the importance of centralised European action in a widespread crisis situation. Looking specifically at the Eyjafjallajökull event, the concept, aims and objectives of the Single European Sky initiative have once again been highlighted. As recognised by the Council of Ministers, there is a need to accelerate its implementation to derive all the benefits of its application.</p>
      <p sl="en">From the Commission perspective, the focus remains on ensuring a harmonised approach and application of agreed measures to future crisis situations. This will be of benefit to all citizens in Europe. It is our intention to revise air passenger rights in 2012. Last but not least, the participation of the industry is essential in order to facilitate a coordinated decision-making process.</p>

      <p sl="en">The closure of large sectors of European air space in April and May last year due to the volcanic eruption in Iceland caused severe traffic disruption and economic damage and affected 10 million passengers directly. I believe the primary responsibility for the safety of flights rests with the operators. Therefore, they must be provided with accurate data. Pilots are trained to manage extraordinary flight conditions, the commercial airlines’ safety manuals are reviewed, overseen and confirmed by regulatory authorities, and airlines have the necessary experience of operating over volcanic areas, as is shown by their safety record. The airline operator (the pilot) should therefore be responsible for assessing the risk and ensuring the safety of flights by, for example, choosing routes or deciding if rerouting is necessary, taking into account all the information available (provision of more information and improved technical equipment on board aircraft). I hope the Commission will liaise with the appropriate authorities to ensure that in the future, they are allowed to get on with their job.</p>

      <p sl="pl">A debate was held in the European Parliament today on the volcanic ash crisis. The volcanic eruption in Iceland last year resulted in serious disruptions to air traffic over Europe. It caused major economic losses and directly affected 10 million passengers. It certainly is not in the interest of the Union to resist the forces of nature, but better prediction of the possibility of a similar crisis occurring in the future would definitely allow economic losses to be reduced and would result in greater convenience for the citizens of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">During the debate, there was discussion of matters relating to progress in the implementation of investments in technological equipment and data transfer systems for the provision of real-time weather forecasts. Questions were put to the European Commission concerning transparency of collaborative decision-making processes and better coordination of responses. Consideration was also given to the consequences of an increase in air traffic in the future and what measures should be taken to make the European Aviation Safety Agency responsible for carrying out operational changes.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The number of natural disasters has been increasing in both intensity and frequency. The recent case of the volcanic ash cloud recorded in Iceland in April and May of last year seriously affected the whole of European airspace, during which time 75% of the airport network was inactive, and led to considerable economic losses and affected around 10 million passengers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In order to prevent further disruptions to air traffic, there is an urgent need to think of crisis management measures. This means that there needs to be an investment in technological equipment on land and in the air to provide accurate information in real time. In addition, it is vital to define the role and function of the various institutions in crisis management so that there is concerted coordination, to avoid greater losses to the different players. This event shows that it is crucial to develop the integration of European airspace through the Single European Sky initiative. The continual growth of air traffic, the fragmentation of European airspace and unforeseen events such as the volcanic ash cloud show that the EU should coordinate and harmonise its air procedures so as to bring added value to the European air sector.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, before the planned vote on the resolution on media law in Hungary, I would like to draw the attention of fellow Members to the latest developments in the situation and to put forward a concrete proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Four days ago, the Hungarian Parliament adopted the amendments – all the amendments – requested by the European Commission despite the negative vote, by the way, of Hungarian Socialist and Green Members. Commissioner Kroes was present during the vote and she announced that the amended version of the law was consistent with European law and, in particular, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Yet the resolution of the left-wing groups, which will be put to the vote at midday, completely ignores these facts. The text is virtually the same as that of three weeks ago and makes no mention of the vote of the Hungarian Parliament. My question is this: is this Parliament living in the real, or an imaginary, world? Is this resolution directed against the Hungarian Government or against the European Commission, which no longer has any problem with the law?</p>

Suddenly, it now needs to be amended.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In the first place, I would like to stress our disappointment over the fact that the Commission decided from the outset to focus on just three areas in relation to the controversial Hungarian media law. We are insistent that, after the Hungarian Government and Parliament had dealt with these three areas in a relatively acceptable way, the Commission should have continued by closely monitoring the compliance of the Hungarian media law with European legislation – specifically, the Charter of Fundamental Rights in particular.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We would also like to call on the Hungarian authorities, in future amendments to the law, to engage to a greater degree with the parties involved, including civil society, because that is the only way a law can be drawn up in a truly democratic country. In this way, the contributions and recommendations will surely be stimulating, whether ours – those of the European Parliament, the Commission, or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe – or those of the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The information which I have received regarding this matter and which has been gone through here shows that the Commission made requests to Hungary, Hungary responded to them and it amended its media laws accordingly. In my opinion, that ought to have been enough. In this respect, I am of the opinion that this should not be made a political issue in this way, where the left are seemingly against the right, or whatever the situation is: the same standards must apply to everyone in this matter. If the Commission accepted this amendment by Hungary, then I accept it too. It is my view that this is a matter of basic principles and so I am afraid that I voted against this report by my own group, or its idea, because I believe that what Hungary has done is exactly what the Commission asked it to do.</p>

      <p sl="en">We might like to think about the hundreds of thousands of euro in public subsidies that we give to the European Union of Journalists; we might like to think of the tens of thousands of euro that we spend every week flying local reporters, in particular, out to Brussels and Strasbourg in order to show them a good time; and we might like to think of the way in which dozens of accredited correspondents in Brussels are getting second incomes as advisers on media issues or editors or writers on EU-funded free sheets.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I were a Hungarian, I would have serious questions about not just the media law, but the creeping autocratic tendencies of the government; but I am not a Hungarian, it is not my business.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am, however, a Member of this House, and I think the way in which we use taxpayers’ money in this nakedly propagandist way is something that ought to offend our basic principles of decency, fairness and democracy.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we are witnessing the end of one of the last long regimes of post-war history. However, Muammar al-Gaddafi has not been able to bring himself to make an honourable resignation, and in order to maintain his dictatorial rule, has declared war on his own people. By turning his guns on the citizens, he has questioned the foundations on which modern civilisation is based. He has committed a crime against humanity. We face, therefore, the obligation to support the Libyan people in their fight for freedom, democracy and fundamental human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have to take action in cooperation with the UN to restore stability in Libya and to punish those guilty of crimes, including Colonel Gaddafi. Particularly urgent is the need to ensure humanitarian aid to civilians and to give shelter to Libyan refugees. As long as 25 years ago, President Reagan’s administration tried to bring an end to Gaddafi’s rule. We must, today, take all measures permissible under international law to remove him from office, so I support Parliament’s resolution.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I voted in favour of this resolution, although I think it contains certain worrying features. Firstly, I want to say that my group met with representatives of the Libyan opposition forces this week and they said that they did not want any armed intervention by the West. This they made quite clear. I think that the EU should not be a flag waver in this affair, but should act together with the UN and the Arab countries.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Despite that, this resolution talks about humanitarian intervention, which all too often sadly means armed intervention. Parliament is actually adopting a position in favour of intervention, albeit with the use of fine rhetoric.</p>
      <p sl="fi">My other concern is this no-fly zone, which I am afraid will result in the bombing of Libya. I think that this should be a UN-led mission, with the whole Arab world, Africa and the EU acting together.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, those calling for military intervention – and a no-fly zone is, of course, a form of military intervention, requiring as it does a willingness to strike at air facilities on the ground – should remember three points. First, as we have heard, the Libyan opposition does not want foreign intervention. There are posters up all over Benghazi saying so. Second, the Gaddafi regime does want foreign intervention: it would justify the dictator’s argument that he is defending his country against foreign invaders. Third, we cannot afford it. The first ship in the area after the humanitarian crisis began was HMS Cumberland from our own country, which was in the area because she was on her way to be scrapped! And our Navy still has more reach than those of most of the other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">There might have been an argument for some direct strike against the Gaddafi regime in the 1980s when it was plainly engaged in international terrorism. It is striking that those who are now demanding some form of intervention were not in favour of such action when it would have been justifiable under the norms of international law. There is something disgusting about the spectacle of all these European leaders fawning and slobbering over this appalling regime. We have made quite enough problems for ourselves by our interventions to date. I think we have done quite enough.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I welcome the resolution, and I have therefore supported it. It is not enough, however, to adopt a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Last week in Egypt, four thousand Muslims attacked a Coptic village not far from Cairo. They burned two churches and prevented fire-fighters from entering the village. The army did not want to interfere at first. When they did finally intervene, Muslim representatives sent them away, saying that everything was in order. The 12 000 Christians living in the village were placed under a curfew.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There was a time when Europe knew who was good, who was bad and why. Thanks to the support of those good people, leaders such as Havel, Walesa and Čarnogurský were prepared for the fall of communism. Today, however, EU politicians are shaking hands with dictators and turning a blind eye to the persecution of Christians. They do not think in terms of good and evil, because pragmatism does not recognise such categories. Until this changes, we may do more harm than good to North Africa.</p>

I am especially worried about the Ashraf opposition camp, which has been under siege and under pressure since July 2009. The humanitarian situation there is intolerable.

In voting for the resolution, I express my opposition to Iran’s aggressive foreign policy, and also demand the release of political prisoners, a cessation of the persecution of human rights defenders and a commencement of cooperation with international organisations, including UN bodies.

Like them, it immediately spilled out from behind its borders and sought to replicate itself around the world; like them, it disregarded all established norms of international law, of national sovereignty, of territorial jurisdiction.</p>
      <p sl="en">What was the signature act of the revolution? It was the siege of the US Embassy. Now stop and ponder for a moment how extraordinary that was, given the precedent of relations between countries. Even in the Second World War, when mutually opposed ideologies fought to extirpate each other, diplomats were peaceably evacuated through neutral countries. If the United States were to invade Cuba tomorrow, one assumes that there would be a peaceable exchange of diplomatic personnel. What the Iranians were signalling was that their rules did not match ours; they no longer cared about the idea of state sovereignty and they have carried on as they started, sponsoring their militias from the Silk Road Khanates to the Balkans, even as far afield as Buenos Aires.</p>

Unfortunately, this human rights resolution was not well-balanced. When you read it, and especially point 19, you get the feeling that one state, Israel, is being condemned far too much and that people are trying to lay the blame here on that country.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We are all aware of the situation in the Middle East at present. Countries there are witnessing uprisings, in which thousands of innocent people have lost their lives. In this respect, this should have been a resolution on human rights, not on the Middle East. If the aim had been to find a balance here, instead of attempting to blame Israel in this biased way, mention could perhaps have been made of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier who has been deprived of human rights for 1 720 days as a prisoner of the Palestinian Arabs or Hamas.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When we produce these human rights declarations, we must aim for a balanced, fair approach.

These concerns are even more worrying given the warning issued by the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights. Based on these findings, the recommendations of this motion should be adopted, as they concern revising legislation on media based on observations by the Commission, the OSCE and the Council of Europe, and should urge the Commission to draw up a draft directive on the freedom and pluralism of the media by the end of the year in order to address the EU’s inadequate legislative framework, and thus avoid similar situations in future.</p>

Thus, the European Parliament calls on the Hungarian authorities to restore the independence of media governance and halt state interference with freedom of expression and balanced coverage.

The key requirement that ‘balanced coverage’ would not apply to websites, blogs, debates and foreign newsletters was met. The European Commission should now continually monitor the application of the law. Credit should be given to the constructive dialogue that took place between Hungary and the EU and which resulted in the legislative amendments being approved.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The foreign media and journalists working in Hungary are no longer threatened by large penalties for violating Hungarian media law, but there are ‘other legal consequences’. However, Hungarian media owners are still subject to penalties, including those which have formally transferred their headquarters to other countries in the EU in order to avoid the media law in Hungary. Although we may disagree with this amendment, it is fully within the competency of the Hungarian Parliament and EU representatives should respect it.</p>

The development and implementation of a regulatory framework for the media should respect the democratic standards for the organisation and governance of communication systems.

Excessive regulation of the media is counterproductive, as it harms real pluralism in the public domain. I call upon the Hungarian authorities to involve all interested parties in reforming media law, including the opposition parties and civil society, so that they can participate in a meaningful way in the reform of this legislation, which regulates such a fundamental aspect for the functioning of a democratic society.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Any violation of human rights is unacceptable. Yet, since the re-election of President Ahmadinejad in June 2009, we have seen an increase in such violations. Iran has the highest rate of executions per head of population in the world. The country is second to China as regards application of the death penalty by stoning in terms of the number of executions, and first on a per capita basis. It is time that Iran fulfilled its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it ratified of its own free will.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Iran, as a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has, for a long time, arrogantly ignored its commitments, in particular, by concealing its nuclear operations. If Iran wants to maintain good relations with the EU and other democratic states, it must unequivocally remove all doubts as to the purpose of its nuclear programme.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also consider the consolidation of relations between Iran and Turkey, which assures the Union that it recognises shared values in an effort to obtain EU membership, while at the same time displaying open sympathy for the Iranian regime, to be a matter of concern for the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to say that Iran holds the world record for the number of juveniles executed, and the number of executions per capita. The show trials of political opponents, and the exceptionally cruel punishment of stoning, which is used legally in Iran today, as well as other forms of cruel and inhumane torture, treatment and punishment, are characteristic of a regime which deserves robust moral condemnation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Apart from what has already been mentioned, the EU’s priorities must include steadfast insistence on the declaration of a moratorium on executions until the death penalty is abolished, a call for an end to impunity over human rights violations and, of course, no more destabilisation of the region.</p>

The EU sanctions of 26 July 2010, in line with those of the UN, were proper and necessary. The Union must pay greater attention to Iran’s nuclear policy in order to monitor developments in the field of conflict.</p>
      <p sl="it">The EU should support international diplomacy for the protection of human rights. The twin-track approach keeps the door open to dialogue, but it takes at least two to have a dialogue, and in the absence of goodwill on the part of Iran, sanctions should be strengthened and more targeted.

Since all negotiations on agreements between the EU and Iran have been on hold for years, the only way for Parliament to express a more in-depth position on this country is via an own-initiative report, which was initiated through a Green proposal. The EFD was given the task. 4 political groups (Greens, S&amp;D, ALDE and GUE) formulated joint amendments to the draft which were, to a large degree adopted, albeit by a slight majority.</p>

It is also well known that it has a narrow and self-serving conception of the declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Once again, in this report, the selective way in which various countries are mentioned is clear. Countries with which the EU maintains economic and diplomatic relations, and to which it attributes strategic importance, have been left out because of the strategic interests they serve, despite their serious violations of human rights.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think all of us have been very deeply shocked and appalled by the assassination of Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, not least because he is someone known to us in this Parliament: he has visited here, he has met many of us; but also because this is another highly symbolic killing, striking at someone who was looking for reconciliation and work across all minorities in Pakistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also add our condolences not only to his family, but also to all the families of those who have been killed in terrorist attacks in Pakistan. This week, we have seen two such attacks, which have killed and injured more people than, for example, the London bombings.</p>
      <p sl="en">The whole population is suffering, and intimidation is undermining democracy in Pakistan. We are seeing a change in the demographics of certain constituencies, for example, Quetta, as intimidation works to force people out.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our resolution is important in terms of wanting to continue and support the work, in terms of tolerance and mutual understanding. I would like to make the point that we need that in the European Union, too, where certain recent ministerial statements, in my view, have not helped that. So we expect leadership in Pakistan and in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, despite the request made by the Pakistani Minister for Religious Minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, for more protection after numerous threats, an assassin managed to murder him on 2 March. Our sympathies go out not only to his loved ones, but also to all Pakistanis who seek a more tolerant society. This is a real blow to Pakistan as well as to humanity as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why did the Pakistani authorities deny the Minister’s request for a bullet-proof official car, as well as his request that he select his own bodyguards that he trusted? By calling for reforms in the inhumane blasphemy laws, he was a human rights defender.</p>
      <p sl="en">We equally want to pay tribute to the work of Naeem Sabir Jamaldini, the coordinator of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, who was murdered on 1 March.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need practical action such as investigations, including within the government. These have to take place in line with international standards because impunity has to end. The European Union should monitor the situation and try to fund civil society through the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, over the last 10 months, the European Parliament has adopted a total of three resolutions on religious freedom in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In May 2010, we talked about this subject here in Strasbourg in the company of the Minister for Minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti. Today in Parliament, we are debating the circumstances of his death. The murder of a high-ranking state official, which took place on 2 March, means only one thing: in Pakistan, no one is safe from the radical Islamists. In danger are not only those who criticise the archaic law which prescribes a sentence of death for religious blasphemy, but also those who publicly stand up for the victims of intolerance, such as Mr Bhatti.</p>
      <p sl="pl">After 10 months, it can be seen that current European Union policy towards Pakistan is not bringing the intended effects. Therefore, I support the idea contained in our resolution of holding round-table meetings on the situation of minorities in Pakistan. I think the newly created European External Action Service must react clearly to events in Islamabad before more people become victims and before it is too late.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Shahbaz Bhatti and all his family are an astonishing example of what brave, principled, loyal people can achieve. He had only held office for six months when the Pakistani Parliament adopted a significant reform that guaranteed a 5% quota to the country’s minorities in public positions. That was just one of the numerous democratic reforms which Bhatti pushed forward and of which the Pakistani Government should be very proud.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Most significant of all is perhaps the ‘Interfaith Harmony Dialogue’, which he began at local level, and which aimed to diffuse tensions and tackle the problems that give rise to terrorism. I saw in the idea the ingredients for the Nobel Peace Prize and I hope that the work to promote human rights and democracy in Pakistan will not cease, even though extremist elements gained a temporary victory when they disposed of the country’s most strategic human rights activist. If dialogue succeeds in a country which is a centre of radical Islam, the positive effects will radiate everywhere in the world.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Only about a month ago, I met Mr Bhatti. We talked about his possible death. He was not naïve. He understood very well what bravery could lead to. I will die before too long, he said, but meanwhile I will try to change unjust legislation as much as I can. I will die, but the law will remain and it will affect the lives of millions.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am afraid the situation in Pakistan is getting worse. Attack after attack seems to be taking place and the government seems to have lost the will to intervene. Last January, Governor Taseer was assassinated, and last week, the only Christian federal minister, Mr Bhatti, was assassinated, too. The European Union and Member States are maintaining contacts with Pakistan in many ways. Cooperation is afoot as regards Afghanistan, many hundreds of millions in aid are pouring into the country for education and reconstruction and efforts are being made to foster interfaith dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, the time has come for us to put our foot down. The Pakistani education system must be reformed and the preaching of hatred for Christians to young children must be stopped. The aid for reconstruction after the flooding should be distributed fairly, and that includes to non-Muslims. That is not only in the interests of the West. If the Pakistani Government and the security services do not get the situation under control, the country will sink into the morass of extremism. There is very little time left to reverse that tide.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, there is often only so much we can achieve here in the European Parliament in our resolutions on urgent matters, but, in cases like these, where there are at least two issues concerning freedom of speech and religious freedom in countries like Pakistan, there at least two things we need to achieve to make our voice heard.</p>
      <p sl="pt">First of all, I should like to say to the defenders of tolerance in Pakistan and to the defenders of religious freedom in Pakistan that they are not alone. This is a very modest aim, but I believe that it is a first step towards some dignity and respect in the debate, and this message will reach those in Pakistan supporting religious freedom, so the first thing I should like to do is tell them that they are not alone.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The second thing I should like to do is make it very clear to the Pakistani Government that it cannot stop the extremists in Pakistan from thinking that they speak on behalf of everyone because this is the vicious circle countries often fall into when it comes to blasphemy laws, as is the case now in Pakistan, or as was the case, for example, in Indonesia. We are dealing with a minority of very vocal extremists who speak very loudly and who eventually start to believe that they are speaking on behalf of everyone because they manage to intimidate the rest of society. Consequently, in this case, if governments are not first in line to defend freedom in their own countries and fight against impunity, and if governments do not impose a bastion of dignity, the whole country will run the risk of being plagued by intolerance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Pakistani Government must therefore fully investigate Shahbaz Bhatti’s murder and must carry out investigations until conclusions have been reached as it did in the case of the Governor of Punjab. What it certainly cannot do is allow the investigations to be corrupted by the kind of practices the police and the Pakistani secret services have been using in investigations, which have destroyed investigations, including even those relating to the murder of the former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto. It is therefore vital that the Pakistani Government ensures that the extremists do not take charge of public discourse and, for our part, that we maintain our solidarity with the defenders of tolerance in the country.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Shahbaz Bhatti was killed in the name of so-called blasphemy laws by a group of fundamentalists who, as is happening more and more, used the name of God to promote their own schemes for power.</p>
      <p sl="it">With this resolution, we want to applaud and thank Shahbaz Bhatti for the example he has set us over the years. I hope so painful a sacrifice serves as a warning to the governments of the European Union and to the High Representative for Foreign Policy so that specific actions can replace the few words that have been spoken with such a lack of force to date.</p>
      <p sl="it">In fact, in recent months, the European Union, or rather the Council and the Commission, unlike Parliament, have wasted time discussing whether or not they should include the word ‘Christian’ in their weak condemnations, while Christians continue to be brutally slaughtered, often because they approached the West, even though there is nothing western about them. I therefore believe that the Commission and Council would do well to look to Parliament on this occasion.</p>

I know many colleagues in this House have met him personally and his determination to work for minority communities in Pakistan, to hold up their rights, is an example to us all. The fact is that he put his life on the line; he knew that the threats were increasing, and his bravery should be recognised. He has lost his life and we in this House have lost a friend.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what can we do? I think there are a number of important points in this resolution. Paragraph 13 about calling on the competent EU institutions to include the issue of religious tolerance in society is vitally important. I would also call on the Commission, in talks and in trade issues as well, to bring up the issue of human rights too. Paragraph 19 about the institutions and the government of Pakistan is also important, as is the call for recognition of democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that, at the end of the day, we all would like to make sure our condolences are sent and I hope the President of Parliament will send a personal letter to Shahbaz Bhatti’s mother. His funeral was last week and I think that is also important.</p>

      <p sl="de">Apart from Mr Bhatti’s murder, I would like to take up another burning human rights issue in Pakistan, namely, the situation of the Province of Balochistan. The Baloch minority continues to be persecuted and, according to Amnesty International, at least 90 Baloch activists – teachers, journalists and lawyers – have disappeared or have been murdered. Other people, such as aid workers, teachers, journalists and government officials, have also been subject to persecution and threats.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, these assassinations are, of course, intolerable, but what is more intolerable is the climate of impunity that exists, despite the increase in attacks. Unfortunately, the citizens of Pakistan and the families of the victims cannot expect much from a judicial system that is blighted by corruption, intimidation and poorly-trained investigators and prosecutors. Investigations take years and are based on discriminatory laws. The criminal dimension of the judicial system, in particular, needs to be reformed and gain real credibility both nationally and internationally.</p>
      <p sl="fr">According to a poll carried out in universities by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, young Pakistanis believe that the credibility of the judicial system is more crucial for the survival of the country than military force or the parliamentary system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union must therefore use all the necessary instruments at its disposal to strengthen judicial cooperation with Pakistan.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, one by one in Pakistan, the voices of reform and progress are being extinguished. Shahbaz Bhatti knew he was in danger, both as a Christian in a country where religious intolerance is rife, and as Minister for Minorities who fearlessly denounced his country’s draconian blasphemy laws. However, he refused to be cowed by the Islamist fanatics who threatened him with death.</p>
      <p sl="en">Only two months earlier, the Governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, had been assassinated by his own bodyguards, but Bhatti was not even provided with bodyguards and, therefore, presented the easiest of targets to the heavily armed terrorists who cut him down on his way to a cabinet meeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why was Mr Bhatti not shadowed by armed close protection officers? This is one of the many questions we must ask President Zardari. I hope he can answer. I hope the Vice-President/High Representative will press him to set more of an example in opposing the alarming radicalisation of Pakistani society.</p>
      <p sl="en">Above all, this is a human tragedy. A man of great courage and principle has lost his life and we as democrats honour his name and salute his life’s achievements today in this debate. We send our condolences to his loved ones in their hour of grief.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the provisions of Islamic Sharia law literally state that anyone who offends Islam shall be condemned to death.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I do not know what actions may be considered an insult to Islam in the Islamic world, but cases of murdering defenders of human rights and religious freedoms in Pakistan, as well as in other Islamic countries, show us that some Islamic spiritual leaders regard our civilised values, which give people a broad freedom to decide, as a threat to their faith and do not hesitate to declare, in accordance with their law, a fatwa against anyone who openly promotes adherence to human rights and civic freedoms in their territory.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Shahbaz Bhatti, a minister in the Pakistani Government, Salman Taseer, Governor of the Province of Punjab, or Sabir Jamaldini, Coordinator of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, have become for us innocent victims of the fanatical application of Islamic law. The example of these victims is supposed to terrorise not only the Pakistani people from seeking greater freedom, but also the politicians running the country from reforming the political system, so that they will continue to respect a set of rules harking back to medieval times.</p>
      <p sl="sk">However, if we do not want to bring the reformist politicians in Islamic countries into conflict with their religious authorities, we should, in my opinion, strive to find a platform for constructive dialogue with Islamic spiritual leaders regarding the peaceful coexistence of civilisations …</p>

We are talking about another murder in Pakistan which shows that, in fact, the authorities there are not in control of the situation, and this is a problem. We are not at this point saying that the President or government of Pakistan have shown ill will. Our charge is related to the fact that they are not even able to guarantee the security of people who are part of government structures but who profess a different faith from the rest of the country.

However, he was more concerned about his impression that, particularly in recent months, also in connection with the murder of Salman Taseer, the Punjab Governor, many people have shied away from the challenge of the extremists. Ministers, parliamentarians, journalists, lawyers, even human rights activists, who have always got involved before, no longer have the confidence to stand up against the challenge of these extremists.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe we must call on everyone in Pakistan to stand up against this intolerance, otherwise they will be swept aside together or individually. Sherry Rehman, that courageous politician who put forward amendments to the blasphemy law, is in particular danger.

I think that the intolerance on which the laws on punishing blasphemy are based has also led to the appalling murders of leading figures who fought for the freedom of expression and belief in Pakistan. At the same time, the incident involving Mr Bhatti has been condemned by a large section of Pakistan’s political establishment, in the media, and by people from a variety of ethnic origins and religious beliefs, which is a positive sign.

The subject of discussion was the same as the one we are talking about today – attempts at reforming the controversial blasphemy legislation. The two tragic events are closely related to each other, because the victims had worked together on behalf of national minorities in Pakistan, including religious minorities, and in defence of those who have fallen victim to the ideology of intolerance spread by the Taliban.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, the Western world can only look on at the advancing radicalisation of attitudes in the country, where not even a decade ago, Benazir Bhutto was introducing democratic reforms.

      <p sl="pl">Reports have now appeared of the next person whom the extremists have sentenced to death – Member of the Pakistani Parliament, former journalist and defender of women’s rights, religious minorities and freedom of speech, Sherry Rehman. It was she who submitted to the Pakistani Parliament a draft of amendments to legislation on punishments for blasphemy. At the next part-session, will we be condemning an attack made on her?</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I think it is important to remember that this is not the first time we have talked about Belarus in this Parliament, and from that point of view, this resolution is important insofar as it clearly condemns the arrests and imprisonment of members of the opposition and the violation of fundamental rights to which these people have been subjected.</p>
      <p sl="es">Freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of movement in countries such as Belarus should be a priority, and it is therefore necessary to call for the immediate and unconditional release of these people, who cannot be called anything other than political prisoners.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, I think it is also important to condemn – and this is what the resolution does – the use of torture in these countries, as in others, in the strongest, toughest, clearest and firmest way possible, even when this occurs in the European Union, which, unfortunately, is sometimes the case. However, in a country with which our neighbourly relations are continuing to grow, and with which we are strengthening our relationship, the use of torture as a form of treatment in prisons, especially when it is fuelled by political motivation, is something that demands our total rejection and full condemnation</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I would also like to openly condemn the sentence imposed on the young opposition activist simply for having taken part in the demonstrations on 19 September 2010. I think Parliament is right to position itself clearly against these options, and I insist that its voice must be heard.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a large number of opposition figures, including former presidential candidates but also journalists and human rights defenders, were arrested after the events of 19 December 2010 in Minsk and they have been kept in KGB detention centres ever since. There have been reports of torture and of forced confessions at the hands of the KGB. These developments fit into a larger pattern of repression and politically motivated trials against opposition activists, civil society, the media and human rights defenders that continues to this day.</p>
      <p sl="en">We urgently call upon the Belarusian authorities to allow political opposition, civil society, free expression and media pluralism. The rule of law needs to be adhered to. The credibility of the Belarusian authorities would be won if investigations carried out in line with international standards, with international experts, were to start right away. We should consider restrictive measures, including economic sanctions on Belarusian government-owned companies, but we hope this will not be necessary. We would welcome it if more countries in the international community were to join the call for such actions, because the status quo is unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Belarus is so often on our agenda and this is because we care, because we want to see a democratic Belarus where human rights are respected. I have the impression, however, that the messages that we send so often to the Belarusian authorities are not heard – neither those from the European Parliament, nor those from the European Council. The decisions of the Council have had no effect so far on the situation in Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="en">After a year of very modest progress, 19 December 2010 became a turning point for Belarus. Since then, the country has been falling into self-isolation: this can save the regime for some time, but it is at the expense of the future of the Belarusian nation. This has to be understood, and we will not stop reminding Lukashenko and his friends of it. I hope that President Lukashenko will take good note of the events in the southern neighbourhood and understand that the only responsible behaviour is democratisation and the social and economic reforms in the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">We in the European Parliament will not give up; we call for the immediate and unconditional release of all detained protestors and for the dropping of all politically motivated charges. At the same time, we still believe that Belarus has time to change; we are working together with the other five eastern neighbours to find a solution leading to democratisation and to the creation of a situation in Belarus where free and fair elections can take place at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the sincere and moving statement issued by Ales Mikhalevich nearly a fortnight ago, in which he revealed the methods of torture used by the Belarusian KGB against Alexander Lukashenko’s political opponents, caused a shock. It is shocking that in the 21st century, a European country which has begun cooperation with the European Union as part of the Eastern Partnership uses methods characteristic of Naziism and Stalinism.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Our resolution is an expression of our shock and outrage, and of our solidarity with those who are being persecuted. Today, I would like, from here, to send three messages. The first message is to Ales Mikhalevich, but also to Anatoli Labiedzka and Mikhail Statkievich, who are in prison: we admire your courage; we are with you and we will not desert you.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second message is to Alexander Lukashenko: start showing respect for the international conventions your country has ratified, including the Joint Declaration of the Prague Eastern Partnership, and stop persecuting your citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The third message is for Mrs Ashton: it is time for economic sanctions, because only in this way can we change the way that the opposition is being persecuted in Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Belarus is a country which shares a border with the European Union but which seems to be 1 000 light years removed from it. It is as if Belarus were inhabited by people who are guided by different standards. However, this is not the case. There are also Europeans living there – people who want to feel they live in a common Europe. The problem is the president of the country, who makes use of methods known from the Soviet Union of several decades ago – what President Lukashenko offers us is a singular journey into the past. Unlike Mr Vigenin, who spoke a moment ago, I think we should believe in our European voice and that Parliament and the European Union can put pressure on the Belarusian authorities so that they will respect human rights. This is a question not so much of policy but of fundamental morals and ethics. We should say to our Belarusian brothers today that they are not alone.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there have always been reports of human rights cases outside the European Union so I shall take the liberty, in this urgent debate, to begin with our vote today on the freedom of the press in Hungary, or rather in the European Union, because respect for fundamental rights in our House and respect for human rights outside the European Union are inextricably linked.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given that we have managed to discuss the problems we are facing within the European Union in a vote that divided this House and split it in two, and which has given us a lot of work over the past two months, we can now confront President Lukashenko of Belarus with our heads held high. We can tell President Lukashenko that he must stop his repression of demonstrations, his repression of opponents and his repression of the press in his own country, because he himself represents a government that thinks it has a monopoly on the right to decide what is right and what is wrong, what is balanced, what is neutral and what is objective, not only in its own assertions, but also in those of the opposition and those of the foreign press. We even saw President Lukashenko confronting the international media with profound arrogance, following the repression of the demonstrations in December.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is why I believe we can have hope that the voice of the European Parliament, the voice of the Commission and the voice of the Council will be heard in Belarus, and that we will achieve a moral authority, beyond that which we also need to preserve through our example in this House.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, during last week’s meeting of the Visegrad Group in Bratislava, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Slovakia, which is currently chairing the group, sent a clear message to President Lukashenko of Belarus. As long as there is even one political prisoner in the prisons of Belarus, the country can expect to be totally isolated in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Even today, unfortunately, three months after the presidential elections, the situation in the country is still critical. Democratically-minded people are investigated, arrested, imprisoned and held in inhumane conditions just as we have been discussing today, with no possibility of legal assistance and with no possibility of visits from family members.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore also important for the EU to adopt a tougher stance towards the last dictator in Europe. It may also be necessary to widen the scope of the economic sanctions we are applying, as all the evidence suggests that words, however tough, will not improve the situation for people in Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, this resolution is a clear signal to the Belarusian authorities that the European Union cannot and will not tolerate restrictions on the right to demonstrate, nor will it tolerate political prisoners in the country and, in particular, torture in detention facilities. Brussels is intensifying its assistance to Belarusian civil society, non-governmental organisations, the independent media and students. Furthermore, we need to abolish as a matter of urgency the expensive visas which prevent Belarusian citizens from travelling to the European Union, reduce the fee and negotiate a relaxation of the visa regime. I feel that in this situation, it would still be useful for a European Parliament delegation to travel to Belarus, despite the fact that there are obstacles, and if a whole delegation is unable to travel, then Members of the European Parliament should travel there individually in order to better understand the situation and exert some influence.</p>

      <p sl="de">Although the European Union has re-established sanctions and taken a hard line on Lukashenko’s regime, fundamental rights such as freedom of assembly and of expression are still violated and trampled upon. Furthermore, the reports on continuous mental and physical torture of political prisoners and attempts at recruiting informants to the KGB give the European Union a clear signal that Lukashenko’s regime did not get our message from the previous time.</p>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps we ought to speak up and make it even clearer that the situation in Belarus is unacceptable. I would like to ask the Commission to report on further measures that can be taken against Lukashenko’s regime.</p>

However, unfortunately, she is mistaken in saying we are unanimous on this. I would like to ask all of us here to speak with one voice, and to speak as strongly as Mr Protasiewicz, who has sent a clear signal to all those fighting for liberty and democracy in Belarus that we are with them, and who has given a clear warning to the regime in Belarus that what they are doing is unacceptable. Well, alongside that voice, which ought to be supported by everyone, there are also other opinions being expressed, and unfortunately by one of the authors of the resolution, that incidents of torture occur in Belarus just as they do in some European countries and in some of the European Union’s Member States. This is unacceptable. Mrs Ojuland is right that we are being listened to, and that it is not only we who are listening to each other, but that there is also someone else who is listening to us.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Europe’s last dictator, Lukashenko, has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for more than 16 years. The country’s media and judiciary are under his sovereign control, and he also has no hesitation in using them to crush the political opposition, as we saw in the recent fraudulent Presidential elections in December. At that time, special troops and the police, of course, violently broke up demonstrations and arrested hundreds of people, including nearly all opposition presidential candidates.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU’s demands to release political prisoners and end the violence against citizens have been totally ignored by the Lukashenko administration. It is now imperative that the EU introduces more robust economic sanctions, since Lukashenko has simply exploited the Eastern Partnership programme and all the benefits of neighbourhood policy. We cannot accept such brutal violations of human rights anywhere in the world, but least of all in the backwoods of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we do not actually have to go beyond Europe’s borders to find countries that violate fundamental rights. In Belarus, you can be indicted and go to prison merely for taking part in a protest, standing in elections, or stating your opinion. Political awareness on the part of the people and civil activism are not a burden for society: they should be something that enriches it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is difficult, however, to believe that democracy could be strengthened in Belarus merely through EU coercion. There is also a need for dialogue at grassroots level and participation in civil society. The EU should support democratic development in Belarus and continue to organise cultural and educational projects with it. The European External Action Service should actively monitor developments in Belarus and support the Belarusians so that European values might also be internalised there.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, two days ago, on 8 March, International Women’s Day, Natalia Radina was unable to enjoy this celebration because she was under house arrest. On the same day, Ales Mikhalevich celebrated his 53rd birthday in prison. The simple reason for this is that he is a free man, a man who dared to enter the presidential contest and, in a dictatorship like Belarus, the penalty for making such gestures of freedom is to have one’s movements restricted and get sent to prison. I would like to highlight two points in our resolution which I regard as extremely important. I feel that we need to support the extension of the restrictive measures imposed by the European Union by producing a list which includes the prosecutors, judges and members of the secret police involved in the recent human rights violations in Belarus. Secondly, I also believe that we must do everything we can to support civil society in this country, which can give us some hope.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Human rights were dealt a heavy blow at the time of the presidential elections in December 2010. The demonstrations organised by the opposition against election fraud were mercilessly crushed by the security forces. Those arrested include one of the presidential candidates, Ales Mikhalevich. He publicised the torture he was subjected to in prison, a fact, however, which has been denied by the authorities. Journalists close to the opposition were also targeted at the same time. In spite of the ban on making statements, they confirmed Mikhalevich’s assertions in the hope of attracting the EU’s attention to the critical situation in Belarus. The circumstances under which the arrests were made are vague, but the treatment they state they were subjected to amounts to serious human rights violations.</p>

Although I know this is not the place to be sending personal messages, I would like to say: ‘Ales, we are with you, as Mr Protasiewicz has said’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think that today, it is very important to say to the opposition that we are going to support them – and we should say this not only to the opposition. It is important to say this to those who are involved in carrying out the persecution – the prosecutors who conduct investigations as they are told to do, the judges who hand down unjust sentences, the directors of workplaces who fire people for their political activity, the rectors of universities who expel students for taking part in demonstrations – we should say to all of them: ‘We will remember.

      <p sl="ro">The arrest and detention of more than 600 civil society activists, journalists, teachers and students, the majority of presidential candidates and leaders of the democratic opposition, along with the disproportionate use of force following the demonstrations organised in protest against Lukashenko’s election, are characteristic features of a dictatorship and show deep contempt for respect for human rights. The case of Ales Mikhalevich, one of President Lukashenko’s opponents, who was tortured during his pre-trial detention, and that of journalist Natalia Radina are significant in a current situation which we are duty-bound to counteract by supporting the efforts of civil society in Belarus, the independent press and the opposition to encourage democracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the fact that in Belarus, President Lukashenko’s secret police is still called the KGB tells us all that we need to know about his mentality and methods. Twenty years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, he remains the archetypal homo sovieticus, a strong man whose addiction to power is as strong as his instincts for crushing dissent.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lukashenko used the KGB, or uses the KGB, as a political tool to silence the popular protest, including the cases of Ales Mikhalevich and Natalia Radina, that followed yet another disappointingly rigged presidential election in December last year. More than 700 people were arrested. Stories abound of opposition activists being abducted, detained extrajudicially, and then tortured mentally and psychologically by the KGB.</p>
      <p sl="en">Belarus matters to us so much because it is a European country and has become a Cuba on our own doorstep. If the EU is to have any moral force in the world with regard to promoting democracy, human rights and the rule of law, it must surely start in Europe itself, our own continent. I do not dispute the need to engage with the Lukashenko regime. An empty chair policy would be counter-productive with the EU, but we need to increase support to the opposition in Belarus and tighten EU smart sanctions on Lukashenko and his KGB cronies.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the events of the past months in Belarus clearly show how civil and political rights continue to be violated systematically by the government. The arrests of the supporters of the opposition in December reflect the way in which an attempt is being made to silence Lukashenko’s opponents using violent means.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The imprisonment of Ales Mikhalevich and six other opposition presidential candidates on the unjustifiable pretext that they had provoked violent demonstrations contravenes political rights. Similarly, the imprisonment of journalist, Natalia Radina, for more than a month makes the likelihood of free expression of opinion in Belarus an even more distant reality.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need to take seriously the accusations of inhumane treatment and torture in KGB prisons made by Mikhalevich, Radina and others, and these should be investigated by an impartial body. I want to remind Belarus of the international commitments it made by ratifying the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention against Torture, and, as a consequence, the responsibility it has towards the international community and, in particular, its own citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are concerned about the worsening situation in Belarus, which unfortunately comes as no surprise. The widespread detention and prosecution of civil society activists, including presidential candidates, in the post-election period led us to expect harsh sentences to follow. As of today, we already know of four cases where individuals have been sentenced to several years in prison. We fear that many more such sentences, involving up to 40 people who now stand accused, will follow in months to come. What is more, we have been appalled by reports of the torture and ill-treatment of people detained on political grounds, including ex-presidential candidate Mikhalevich.</p>
      <p sl="en">All these despicable events may call for an update of our EU response. The situation today is as follows: as you know, the EU reacted to the fraudulent elections of 19 December and to the subsequent repression by putting nearly 160 people on a sanction list. This was a very clear and strong message of condemnation to the authorities. At the same time, the Commission and the European External Action Service have swiftly designed new dedicated assistance tools to provide urgent support to the victims of repression, their families and civil society, up to an amount of EUR 1.7 million. This assistance is being delivered with the initial focus on providing legal assistance and counselling to victims of repression and on support to civil society organisations and civic campaigns.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also finalising a re-orientation of our mid-term assistance to Belarus to increase support to civil society. The Commission is quadrupling its aid to Belarusian civil society for the period 2011-2013 to a total of EUR 15.6 million, with particular attention given to strengthening independent media and supporting students, including by maintaining funding for the European Humanities University.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is now time to reflect on whether an additional response is needed. The High Representative issued an immediate condemnation following the first sentence on 18 February, and she recalled that political motives had no place in a legal process. The EU also strongly condemned the harsh sentences and torture allegations at the OSCE and is discussing the matter at the UN Human Rights Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the European Union will discuss whether the latest events call for a further expansion of our existing sanction list to add new names such as those responsible for issuing the latest sentences and leading the recent crackdown. The EU stands ready to consider further targeted measures in all areas of cooperation as appropriate.</p>

In fact, the fate of the ancient city of Kashgar is in the balance. A modernisation programme has slated up to 85% of the traditional old city of Kashgar for demolition. It is important to prevent the historic fortress being replaced by modern apartment blocks. If the Chinese authorities are serious about convincing us that all will be well, they have to first of all convince the native population of East Turkestan that their cultural heritage really will be respected and that the Uyghur language will be taught in schools on an equal level with the Chinese language.</p>
      <p sl="en">I call on the Chinese authorities to accept possible contributions by ICOMOS, which has impressive experience in the management of urban historic landscapes, and I ask the Chinese Government to agree to lift Kashgar to UNESCO world heritage status that will include several cultural sites along the ancient Silk Road.</p>

      <p sl="en">China has stepped up efforts to boost relations through cultural diplomacy throughout the world, but no one will be interested in a marketed, homogenised culture of a country which has such cultural diversity.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today’s debate on the rights of ethnic minorities in China comes a day after the Dalai Lama officially announced that he is resigning from his political role in Tibet. In the coming months, we should watch the development of the political situation there carefully. Today, however, we are talking about another minority group which is suffering discrimination in China – the Muslim Uyghur population. China is justifying its policy towards them by the need to fight terrorism, and for the Chinese authorities, the persecution of the Uyghur people also means the destruction of the Uyghurs’ cultural heritage. Particularly disturbing are the reports of the reconstruction of the city of Kashgar. This will, in practice, mean the destruction of its historical centre, one of the most interesting and best-preserved examples of Muslim architecture in Central Asia, which attracts more than a million tourists every year and would be eligible for inclusion on the UNESCO world heritage list if China applied for this status.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am confident that the European Union’s diplomatic service will demonstrate its effectiveness in talks with the Chinese authorities, and will remind them of the need to respect the rights of ethnic minorities and protect their cultural heritage. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is clear that Kashgar is the symbol, par excellence, of Uyghur cultural identity in the Chinese province of Xinjiang. On 27 January, I organised a conference in Brussels, where I learned of the impact which the destructive Chinese urbanisation plans are having on the Uyghur population. It is, indeed, the case that, under the guise of public security and modernisation, China wants to leave no more than 15% of the original city intact and, in fact, transform Kashgar into one huge open-air museum. I think it is high time that we responded powerfully to this, before it is too late.</p>
      <p sl="nl">After quashing the demonstrations in Urumqi in July 2009, the Chinese authorities were called upon by this House to make every effort to bring about an open, permanent and respectful dialogue with the Uyghurs and pursue a more integrated and comprehensive economic policy in their area, aimed at encouraging local involvement and, above all, protecting Uyghur cultural identity. Unfortunately, the current Chinese policy in Kashgar is proving to be quite the reverse of what was called for then. Not only the destruction of Kashgar, while denying the local population any say in the matter, but also the Chinese refusal to allow Kashgar to compete for UNESCO world heritage status, is illustrative of the way in which the Chinese Communist Party deals with cultural diversity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU’s motto is ‘Unity in diversity’. Sadly, such a sentiment does not resonate in the People’s Republic of China, whose Communist rulers are obsessed with unity, but not much thought is given to celebrating diversity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Undoubtedly, the attempt to impose Han Chinese majority culture on tiny minorities in the world’s most populous country is causing much tension and resentment. We already know about the suppression of the ancient Buddhist Tibetan culture over the last 60 years; now we see the same threat looming over the city of Kashgar in the restive province of Xinjiang.</p>
      <p sl="en">For 2 000 years, Kashgar has been a thriving city on the Silk Road with a rich, unique and flourishing central Asian culture, but now it is facing wholesale demolition and rebuilding. It is hard to escape the idea that this is Beijing’s attempt to break the will of the Uyghur separatists.</p>
      <p sl="en">I personally have no brief or sympathy for the separatist cause, some of whose supporters, I am afraid, have links to al-Qaeda, but I urge the Chinese Government to think again. The destruction of an ancient city like Kashgar would simply strengthen the resolve of all of those who would wish to foment violence against the state.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to tell you the truth, out of the three urgent debates taking place this afternoon, this really is the one in which we feel the most impotent. We have talked about Pakistan and Belarus and we then have reason to believe that the European Union has not only moral authority but also leverage or power over external authorities to try to ensure, at least, that they are on the right track.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In fact, when we talk about China, we know that this leverage is reduced because a lot of what we say in this House contradicts what the European governments in our capitals do: that is to say, what Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Merkel or politicians in my own country, Portugal, do, like Mr Sócrates, who only very recently diverted a demonstration against Chinese authorities so that the Premier, who was visiting Lisbon, did not have to come face to face with those protesting against his regime. In other words, it is Europe itself that is repeatedly participating in this dream world or fantasy world, which the Chinese leaders are creating for themselves, in which there is no opposition and in which one development model suits all, and is the same in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, or in Tibet.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, it is really difficult for the European Parliament to say what we are going to say today, which is also what is written in our resolution: we are calling for the Beijing authorities to stop committing this demographic genocide against Uyghurs; we are calling for them to preserve the cultural and ethnic diversity of the regions that make up China; and we are calling for them to preserve places of architectural or heritage value. However, the leaders of our own countries are throwing themselves into the arms of the Chinese leaders, pardoning them for everything that they have done in their country, and are giving them free rein in the name of a development model that ultimately we respect only to a very basic degree. It has therefore been demonstrated once again that moral authority begins to take shape at home and that, in any case, when we in the European Union are talking about others, we are, first and foremost, talking about ourselves, and we need to review our attitude towards China.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as has already been said, Uyghurs are not a minority but a people with an ancient Silk Road culture who gradually succumbed to Chinese rule, which was initially very relaxed. The Uyghurs are supported, in particular, by the World Uyghur Congress based in Munich, and the cultural heritage of Kashgar is supported by the Blue Shield movement, the president of which, Karl von Habsburg, was here in Strasbourg this week to provide us with information.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we are to support the Uyghurs, let us do so by means of a friendly appeal to the Chinese, because the Uyghurs are threatened with cultural ethnocide. Moreover, China, as the oldest cultural nation in the world, should clearly recognise that one of the characteristics of a cultural people is the protection of, and respect for, other cultures, particularly when it comes to small cultures in a huge empire. The Chinese only have to apply their own constitution, which states in three places that this cultural heritage must be preserved.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore like to say very clearly that we want some give and take from our Chinese partners on this issue – we want the protection of the cultural heritage of the Uyghurs.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, it is my personal view that, in this case, we must guard against one-sided judgments. There is a risk of counterproductive bias, both in relation to the situation on the ground and to the partnership between the European Union and China. The bloody violence in recent years in Xinjiang is glaring proof that resorting to force is the least satisfactory option. This is why I believe that it is our duty to encourage interethnic dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is my opinion that the European Parliament resolution must not affect the right of the Chinese authorities to defend the integrity of their country and the safety of all their citizens, especially against terrorist threats in a region where al-Qaeda is attempting to establish a presence. We must clearly encourage balanced national development from both an economic and demographic perspective.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is well known that Uyghuria is in imminent danger of becoming a second Tibet. The People’s Republic of China has announced a ‘Kashgar Dangerous House Reform’, the purpose of which is to raze 85 per cent of the Old City in Kashgar.</p>
      <p sl="de">Such philistinism must be stopped and the European Union must insist that the authorities of the People’s Republic of China do not destroy this important cultural site on the ancient Silk Road. The UN Declaration of the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, as well as the constitution of the People’s Republic of China, must be respected, even by Beijing.</p>
      <p sl="de">The People’s Republic of China is more and more exercising sinicisation of ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs and the Tibetans. It is a cultural genocide in the 21st century, which we simply cannot accept.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Chinese official circles have long found it irksome to have references to other ancient and important cultures and civilisations whose monuments are today located in Chinese territory.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Kashgar is the centre of the Muslim Uyghurs – one of the largest ethnic minorities in China. For millennia, the Chinese tried to subdue the lands of the Uyghurs, and many times they failed in their fight to subdue these lands. Even today, therefore, there is a certain aloofness in the position of the Chinese administration, and an effort to suppress any manifestation of the cultural traditions and identity that are linked to the rich cultural monuments of the Uyghurs and the city of Kashgar.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am not sure whether the official Chinese bodies are today capable of accepting the philosophy that the current Chinese state is built not only on the traditions and history of the Chinese empire, but also on the traditions and histories of other peoples. The behaviour of the Chinese towards Tibet, and towards the Uyghur monuments in Kashgar, bears witness rather to the fact that today’s China is incapable of appreciating the wealth which other peoples and other cultures have brought to its shared state.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore right to state from this place that we, in contrast to the Chinese authorities, appreciate and cherish all important cultural monuments located on the territory of the People’s Republic of China, as well as those in Tibet and in Kashgar.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Kashgar is a city of three and a half million people, a bit smaller than the population of the entire island of Ireland. It is closer to Baghdad than it is to Beijing. It is on the great trading route of the Silk Road and has some of the best preserved Islamic architecture sites, some of which are buried beneath the desert. It also has the largest mosque tomb in China and is a treasure, there is no doubt about that. However, as has been said, it is under a great threat, ostensibly because the Chinese want to redevelop the city because of its susceptibility to earthquakes. That is not acceptable to us, because we feel that a great treasure would be lost.</p>
      <p sl="en">What can we do about it? Perhaps very little, but at least highlighting it here today is important. We can, as we said, ask that it be included among the Silk Road world heritage sites. Perhaps we could also make people aware of the treasures that are there, so that the people there can preserve them into the future. It would be the world’s loss, but a bigger loss to China.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, this resolution actually concerns the preservation of an important cultural heritage and the right of minority peoples to their cultural identity. The ancient city of Kashgar is one of the best preserved Islamic cities in Central Asia. Kashgar’s rich history goes back to China’s Han Dynasty, and the city was an important staging post on the Silk Road. It linked Asia to Europe. The entire Xinjiang Region has enormous cultural significance for the entire world.</p>
      <p sl="fi">China must take action to make Kashgar a UNESCO world heritage site and preserve the area for future generations. The European External Action Service should also ensure that local strategies extend to the right to its cultural identity. The European Union’s delegation to China could also earmark funds to support the traditions of the Kashgar minorities and their cultural identity.</p>

      <p sl="en">In 2009, the Chinese Government announced an urban reconstruction programme that plans to demolish 85% of the old city of Kashgar and replace it with modern apartments. The demolition should be stopped. Urban planners should identify a development plan that preserves the old city of Kashgar. The whole Silk Road in China should be submitted for protection under UNESCO’s world heritage programme, which China joined in 1985. I call on the Commission and the Council to raise these matters with the Chinese authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, cultural heritage is crucial to preserving identity. This is clear in Europe, in China, and wherever, and the Chinese authorities know this. However, we have seen, for instance, how they have purposefully destroyed this heritage, which means this identity, in several places like Tibet, and now they are doing the same in the Uyghur places like Kashgar.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why it is so important that we once again explain our position, and we urge the Chinese Government to stop the cultural destruction threatening Kashgar’s architectural survival immediately and to carry out a comprehensive expert inquiry into culture-sensitive methods of renovation. This is not for nothing: the credibility of a government is also based on how it treats minorities. If China wants to be credible in the international sphere, it is important that minorities, such as the Uyghurs, are treated properly, adequately respectfully and in line with human standards.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Hahn, culture and identity must clearly be placed centre stage at global level. Just this week, Karl Habsburg explained to us how important it is in the search for identity for this cultural heritage not only to be available to the Uyghurs, but also for it to be a global asset. China should make a concessionary gesture in this regard. For example, we have recently entered into an agreement with the town of Wenzhou enabling direct investments to be made in dollars in future. I see an opportunity here for the focus also to be placed on this region and for people in the different cities and regions of China to have equal rights. International relations can indeed provide a great deal of help here.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, there is no respect for the fundamental rights of the ethnic minorities in China, be they Tibetans or Uyghurs. It is typical that the Chinese Communist Party refuses to support the city of Kashgar in its bid to compete for UNESCO world heritage status. In recent years, China has provided support for an international project to add cultural sites on the Silk Road to the world heritage list, but Kashgar itself has not been on that list because it is the home of one of China’s largest minorities, the Uyghurs.</p>
      <p sl="fi">On the contrary, China intends to demolish large areas of the city, claiming that it fears for the safety of the residents, but cultural, civil and human rights organisations regard this plan as a cruel attempt to crush Uyghur culture. The Chinese Communist Party must come to acknowledge the fact that the citizens of China are culturally diverse, and they must also have a right to cultural autonomy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the old centre of the city of Kashgar is in danger and, along with it, the historic symbol of the Uyghur minority in China. The policy being pursued of so-called urban reconstruction is resulting in the gradual disappearance of this group’s identity, which developed its culture around the fortress situated on the Silk Road. I believe that moving the Uyghur population from their traditional dwellings and demolishing Kashgar are measures which violate minorities’ rights. In addition, the city is regarded as the best preserved example of Islamic architecture in Central Asia. Kashgar’s streets and buildings can be restored to improve the inhabitants’ living conditions. The question is why the authorities are not investing in activities of this kind. I recommend the inclusion of the old centre in the UNESCO world heritage list as part of the Silk Road. I also appeal to the Chinese Government to stop demolishing the city and to look for alternative solutions.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, owing to its remote location, Kashgar, on China’s western border, and the Uyghurs who live there, have succeeded in preserving their ancient traditions for centuries. The city therefore attracts hundreds and thousands of tourists a year. On account of its strategic location, the Chinese administration is now trying to control the region more effectively to guarantee better access to the energy markets in Central Asia.</p>
      <p sl="fi">China does, of course, have the right to develop economically, but the rights of minority groups, fragile as they are, must be protected. It is possible to develop Kashgar in such a way that the way of life of the Uyghurs can continue to be guaranteed. The earthquake safety of buildings and the infrastructure can be improved without putting into effect plans to destroy 85% of the ancient city, with the Uyghurs being forced to move out to new residential areas and seeing their society fragment.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This reckless destruction of the ancient city should therefore be stopped, and the Uyghurs should be consulted on the development of the place where they have traditionally lived. Otherwise, their exotic, fascinating culture is in danger of being completely destroyed.</p>

I would like to remind everyone that there has already been a European Parliament resolution about this, and that we should also express our views in relation to other religious minorities which are being persecuted in the People’s Republic of China, such as the Christian minority. Catholics are facing very severe discrimination there. The Communist authorities in Beijing have appointed special ecclesiastical structures which are not recognised by the official Catholic Church. I think this very necessary and important discussion can, today, be a voice in defence of all religious minorities in China. I think that voice is greatly needed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the preservation of cultural heritage is obviously of central importance in ensuring the protection and continuation of a minority’s traditions and way of life. Moreover, the destruction of important cultural property has the potential to deal a serious blow, not only to the heritage and archaeological patrimony of the minority concerned, but to cultural heritage in general. In this light, the European Union is following with concern the redevelopment of the ancient city of Kashgar in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China. The significance of Kashgar as a centre of culture for the Uyghur minority in China cannot be overstated. Kashgar is conceived as being as important as Jerusalem is to Jews, Muslims and Christians.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Chinese Government’s 2009 White Paper on Xinjiang stated that restoration of Kashgar is necessary to protect the city from earthquakes or fire. This is a laudable aim. Civil society, both in China and internationally, has expressed considerable disquiet about the methods employed. There is serious concern that as much as 85% of the old city may be demolished. Indeed, many notable buildings, including the unique Xanliq madrasah, appear to have been destroyed already. It is also worrying that some 200 000 people may be displaced from their traditional homes and that there appears to have been little or no consultation with the residents affected.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is feared that the demolition of structures which have formed the basis of Uyghur culture for many hundreds of years may have a grave impact on the preservation of their culture in the years ahead. It is also regrettable that China has chosen not to propose Kashgar as a world heritage site despite its unique status, as this would allow UNESCO to become involved in the process of redevelopment. We understand that UNESCO has, in any event, made representations to the Chinese authorities concerning the impact of the development on Kashgar’s traditional heritage and culture. The European Union fully shares these concerns and will call on the Chinese authorities to work with UNESCO to ensure that any redevelopment of Kashgar meets international best practice in this field.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union will also call on the Chinese authorities to ensure that the inhabitants of Kashgar are fully consulted about the future of the city and that their views are taken into account.</p>
