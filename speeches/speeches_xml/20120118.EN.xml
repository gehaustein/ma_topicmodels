      <p sl="unknown">I must inform those of you who are not already aware of the fact that none of the candidates in yesterday’s Vice-Presidential ballot received an absolute majority, and so a third ballot is required this morning.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have noticed that only one-fifth of the vice-presidential candidates are women, and in order to increase their share in the candidacies I would like to withdraw my candidacy in favour of proper gender balance. I am slightly surprised that my male colleagues, for instance from Hungary, the Czech Republic, Italy and Greece, have not taken this opportunity. I am definitely withdrawing my candidacy on the condition that we seek a better gender balance and that we look for 14 colleagues who will assume their membership of the Bureau and take on board the topic of fighting against Bill Gates’ Microsoft monopoly of Internet systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thank, once more, all the colleagues for voted for me – who trusted me as an independent candidate – and I promise we will continue to make the case for proper democracy inside and outside this House.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, could you explain to a simple soul like me why, if we have 14 candidates for 14 positions, who have already been ranked by the votes that were cast for them in the second ballot last night, we have to have another ballot instead of dealing with the important business that we should be dealing with, rather than making ourselves laughing stocks by having this vote again?</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Mr Atkins, if you had been present yesterday evening you would have heard the detailed explanations. The Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament state that those who receive a qualified majority of the votes cast in the first or second ballot will be deemed to be elected as Vice-President. Because no candidate achieved this majority yesterday, we have to hold a third ballot.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The number of candidates does not exceed the number of vacant positions. I therefore propose that we should declare the candidates elected by acclamation. The precedence of the Vice-Presidents shall then be defined by the number of votes cast in their favour. Does anyone oppose this procedure? Then all 14 are now deemed elected.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I did not understand this fully. As you know, the precedence of the Vice-Presidents is determined by the number of votes they receive. So, does this mean we still have to hold a ballot, or not? This was not clear from your somewhat hurried explanation.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-011-000" speaker_id="1911" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">On account of the fact that we have the same number of candidates as positions, then, unless anyone objects, we can declare all 14 candidates elected. The precedence in the protocol, from the first Vice-President to the 14th, will be determined by the result of the ballot. In other words, we must hold a ballot either way.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, why is it that you cannot give us the result of yesterday’s ballot? I was told that we can call up this information electronically. As we are talking about transparency, I would like to know how yesterday’s vote went, because we have the right to be guided by this. We need that information.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the European Commission, distinguished leaders of the political groups, Members of the European Parliament and the European Commission, I am honoured to stand before you today to present the priorities of the Danish Presidency. One of the greatest Europeans of our age, the late Czech President Václav Havel, said: ‘For twenty years now, Europe has no longer been severed in half. I firmly believe that it will never again allow itself to be divided but, on the contrary, will provide scope and initiative for ever-deeper solidarity and cooperation’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Havel was Europe at its best: a champion of liberty and creativity; a guardian of rule of law and democracy; a driver of progress and integration; a helping hand to support the weak and vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="en">At this critical time in our history, it is our shared responsibility to fulfil Havel’s belief in Europe. We must do our part to fulfil, and to keep on advancing, Europe’s potential for peace, opportunity, freedom and prosperity. That is the challenge facing Europe as Denmark takes over the Presidency of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have been looking forward to speaking to you today as Prime Minister of Denmark but also as a former member of this great, unique Parliament.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">Every day, in the political engine room of this House, decisions are taken that form the building blocks of tomorrow’s Europe. As in any parliament, there are lines of division and heated debates – as there should be. But what makes this assembly special is the commitment to Europe and its citizens that runs through the veins of the majority of its members. You are a parliament of Europe and for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has been truly fulfilling for me to be part of the crucial work that you do here. I was honoured to serve in improving Europeans’ right of movement, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and in furthering European integration as part of the European Convention that led to the Lisbon Treaty. And it was a particular pleasure in that context – and a privilege – to be active in achieving the changes which have significantly and rightly enhanced the legislative powers of this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the coming six months, I ask for your support, your cooperation and your partnership. This will be crucial if we are to achieve real progress on the heavy agenda in front of us all.</p>
      <p sl="en">I belong to a generation that was young in the Eighties. For many it was a time of hardship, with high unemployment and limited job opportunities, especially for the young, who were also disadvantaged by cut-backs in our education systems. We were sometimes described as ‘the no-future generation’. But in Europe, we saw a path to a more prosperous and promising future. We saw leaders of vision and vigour, like Havel. And, as the years passed, Europe delivered the conditions which brought the single market, which helped to breach the Berlin Wall and promote the reunification of Germany, which produced the Maastricht Treaty and secured European enlargement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Out of the gloom and pessimism came an era of growth, progress and optimism. Europe inspired the world with a truly unique model of cooperation. This is an achievement which we must be proud of when we recall that, just a few decades ago, Europe moved from being a continent of repeated conflict and division to a Union of 27 nations based on openness, rule of law and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We, in our Union, have created an unparalleled framework for decision-making at the European level – the Community method – that enables us to raise standards of freedom, fairness in economies and societies without diminishing the diversity of cultures and communities. And the common values of solidarity, participation and inclusion form the keystone of that construction.</p>
      <p sl="en">For us they are not only noble ideals – they are practical working realities. That is why we have built a Europe with a strong social dimension. We aim at both prosperity and solidarity because we know that, in the modern world, they are not merely desirable: they are interdependent. In this century, even more than in the past, justice, care and opportunity are components of efficiency, while efficiency is the vital source of investment in justice, care and opportunity. That mixture is at the core of the European success.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">I draw very particular attention to it today not only to honour our past but – more importantly – to give confidence and guidance to our future.</p>
      <p sl="en">No one here needs to be told that Europe is in a profound economic crisis that has rocked the very foundation of our cooperation. Growth is low. Debt is high. Businesses are struggling. Jobs are being lost. Insecurity has become part of everyday life for millions of European families. And, because of the nature of the current afflictions, citizens throughout Europe are experiencing, and will experience, cutbacks and reductions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must confront the economic challenge with decisive action to restore confidence in Europe; to create a new foundation for growth and progress; to ensure the long-term viability of the European model. We owe it to all generations throughout Europe but in particular we owe it to our youth.</p>
      <p sl="en">What our youth demand of us is only fair: access to the same education and job opportunities that previous generations have enjoyed. A chance to contribute to their societies and to build a secure future. They will work for that – but they can only be sure of achieving it if we encourage and enable them to do so. If we want them to be providers for us in the future, we must be providers for them in the present. That is the contract between generations. We must honour it with determination.</p>
      <p sl="en">And we have to show the same steady resolve in ensuring robust public finances, because robust public finances are the true bulwark against short-sighted speculation. The only sustainable future for our social market economies is to embrace change and increase competitiveness. The essential basis for that is stability that fosters growth, and opportunity that maximises innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Restraint in spending is not a departure from solidarity – in present conditions, it is a precondition for dependable solidarity. I am certain that a great majority of people understand that, and are prepared to be part of it, if it is fairly applied. People are ready to make sacrifices, but they will not be sacrificed. People will accept austerity with justice, but they will resist austerity that is manifestly unequal and unfair. As leaders of Europe, we must work in that knowledge and respond to that reality.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe’s destiny is Denmark’s destiny. This has been the leitmotif for Denmark’s European engagement for decades. Forty years ago, Denmark was part of the first enlargement of the Community and our new partners trusted us with the Presidency the very same year that we became a member. Thirty years ago, Denmark held the Presidency in a period of Cold War and economic uncertainty, but also in the first period with an elected European Parliament. Twenty years ago, we held the Presidency at a time when the single market was launched. And 10 years ago, Denmark held the Presidency when the EU fulfilled its historic obligation and united Europe. Like now, these were crucial periods in the history of the European Union. In the coming six months, we will again work hard to move Europe forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">European citizens expect their political leaders to act, and rightly so. We must keep one thing in mind: democratic politics are judged by results, not by intentions. The Danish Presidency will work tirelessly during the next six months to ensure that the EU continues to produce tangible, useful results: results that benefit all Europeans, young and old, students and workers, in the North and in the South.</p>
      <p sl="en">To illustrate that, I want to highlight our key priorities. Firstly, the Danish Presidency will aim at ensuring a responsible European economy. That is the only path out of the crisis. We need to put Europe back on track so that we can ensure the prosperity and security of our citizens. This requires discipline and political will from all of us to implement and comply with the new rules of economic governance. We need a modern and responsible budget, and we must bring public deficits under control.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we will work for a more dynamic Europe. Growth in Europe must be restored and sustained. We need to stimulate long-term growth and job creation, not least for our younger generation. Modernising and developing the single market will be a key part of this effort. Looking outward, we must do more to help our companies exploit trade opportunities with the emerging economies outside Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we will work for a greener Europe. The EU has developed an ambitious policy on energy and climate issues. We are a leader on the global stage in this field but, to maintain our position and to encourage others, we need new initiatives in areas such as energy efficiency and renewable energy. Think about it: more than 20 million jobs are linked to the environment in one way or another. There is a huge potential here, but we face a real risk that high-tech research and knowledge-intensive jobs will move out of Europe to more attractive regions. The Danish Presidency will work hard to ensure that the centre of green research and green jobs stays in Europe in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, we will work for a safe Europe. In a globalised world, only a joint European effort will be truly effective. To ensure the safety and freedoms of our citizens we need to work in that area: to combat terrorism and cross-border crime; to manage our borders; to establish a well-functioning European Asylum System.</p>
      <p sl="en">Beyond our own region, the EU’s voice must be heard – and heard even more clearly – as we promote our common values and protect our interests. The Presidency will support and assist the High Representative and the European External Action Service. Budget discipline, growth and jobs, green policies, and ensuring the safety of our citizens and the voice of Europe in the world: these are our priorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to be bold and ambitious. In the middle of an economic crisis I do not expect the Danish Presidency to be easy. But I can assure you that the Presidency will not be daunted either. We are not built like that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Obviously, a Presidency cannot fulfil its ambition on its own. We need active cooperation from all stakeholders – the Member States, the European institutions and civil society. We need a European Union that is united in meeting and overcoming the challenges facing us today. Your input and your support in this Parliament will be critical in this effort.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I stand here today, as Prime Minister of Denmark, I can assure you of my personal commitment to Europe. I am a European at heart and, most of all, I am a European for my children. I know that ultimately their security, opportunity and liberty will depend upon the safety, the life chances and the freedom of their generation everywhere. The Union is the best implement for helping to spread and strengthen those conditions in our own continent and throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ultimate measure of our Union and our solidarity is not where we stand in moments of comfort. It is where we stand in moments of challenge. This is such a time. As I have stressed today, the challenge facing the EU today is basically threefold.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we need to rely on the strong rules and institutions for decision-making that are already firmly established in our Union. We are a Union based on cooperation, rule of law and democracy. During times of crisis, when tough decisions and compromises need to made, these fundamentals – our Community method – are more important than ever. Relying on our fundamental rules and procedures is not only in the interest of small Member States like Denmark. It is what sets our Union apart. It is what makes our cooperation so strong and so durable. That is in the interest of all of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we must maintain that Europe is part of the solution to the current crisis, not the problem. The path out of this crisis goes through more Europe, not less Europe. In current conditions, to be inward-looking is to be blind to reality. It is up to the leaders of Europe to show this to our citizens and to the outside world. It is the practicality of Europe that will restore faith in our European project.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we must bring Europe through to the other side of the crisis with our values intact. Fiscal restraint is crucial to stabilise our economies and restore confidence. But when the social market economic model has proven so successful for us over the decades, it must continue to be our guiding principle through and beyond the current crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no doubt that the current crisis has put the European Union to the test. The countries of the eurozone have taken on a huge responsibility in securing economic stability in our region. The Fiscal Compact will play a key role in stabilising the euro. This is also in the clear interest of the European Union. However, the crisis should not lead us astray. On the contrary, it is more evident than ever that we share a common destiny. It is of paramount importance that we work together and stand together. If we are to realise Václav Havel’s vision of cooperation and solidarity, we need to secure a Europe at work again. Together, we will do that.</p>

    <intervention id="3-020-000" speaker_id="1911" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">Having consulted with the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and because there are so many Members urgently awaiting the results of the Vice-Presidential ballot, I am going to announce the results of the ballot now. There are also procedural reasons for doing so. Parliament’s senior positions are only fully constituted after the results have been announced and accepted by Parliament. For that reason I would ask for your patience while I quickly go through this.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">All 14 candidates are deemed elected. The order I now announce is the order of precedence of the Vice-Presidents in the second half of our electoral term. In other words, the first name I read out is the first Vice-President, and so on until we reach position 14.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I will now read the results in the order of votes cast.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Number of votes cast: 672</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Invalid voting slips: 17</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Valid votes cast: 655</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The candidates have received the following votes:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Gianni PITTELLA: 319 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Miguel Angel MARTÍNEZ MARTÍNEZ: 295 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Anni PODIMATA: 281 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Alejo VIDAL-QUADRAS: 269 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Georgios PAPASTAMKOS: 248 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Roberta ANGELILLI: 246 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Othmar KARAS: 244 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Edward McMILLAN-SCOTT: 239 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Isabelle DURANT: 238 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Alexander ALVARO: 235 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Rainer WIELAND: 230 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Oldřich VLASÁK: 223 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Jacek PROTASIEWICZ: 206 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">László SURJÁN: 188 votes</p>
      <p sl="unknown">As I have already said, all candidates are deemed elected. This is also the order of precedence in which they shall perform the functions of the Vice-President in the absence of the President.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I therefore ask whether there is anyone who objects to the election of the aforementioned candidates?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This is obviously not the case. Therefore all are now deemed elected. Allow me to congratulate you all.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The composition of the new Bureau will now be made known to the Presidents of the institutions of the European Union. I would be very grateful if the chorus of congratulations could be postponed until this evening’s group meetings.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-023-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt, Honourable Members, I would like to start by thanking you, Prime Minister, for your opening address, which set out your vision for a responsible, dynamic, green and safe Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prime Minister, when we met in Brussels soon after your election in October last year, I told you of my conviction that Denmark would make a decisive contribution to our common European project. Having listened to you today, and to your inspiring remarks about your sincere commitment to European values and the Community method, I am even more convinced of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, we are all aware of the harsh economic realities in today’s European Union. In October last year, the Commission presented a five-point road map to stability and growth. We said we needed to work, at the same time, to give a decisive response to the problems in Greece; to enhance the euro area’s backstops against the crisis; to strengthen the banking system, namely through recapitalisation; to frontload stability and growth-enhancing policies; and to build more robust and integrated economic governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us be clear: without implementation of a credible response to the euro area crisis, our prospects for economic growth will not be realised.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will urge the Member States to complete what is still pending in this road map – from a lasting solution for Greece to implementation of a credible system of firewalls. While we put these instruments in place, our response cannot be only about discipline and sanctions. Yes, discipline is needed but we also need convergence. Yes, stability is indispensable, but we also need growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe needs greater convergence, solidarity and growth. More and more, our partners and international investors are asking the following question: what is Europe’s medium-term and long-term prospect for growth? It is clear that we will not overcome this crisis without a credible response to the question of growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has been saying for years what needs to be done, but – let us be frank – action by the Member States has been uneven and in many cases insufficient. If we are serious about overcoming the crisis, we must be serious about adding decisive action on growth to the decisive action already under way on financial and fiscal consolidation.</p>
      <p sl="en">So where is the growth going to come from? Since there is reduced fiscal space in most of our Member States, it will come mainly from delivering structural reforms, increasing our competitiveness and targeted investment. We must deepen the internal market; invest in priority projects, namely in innovation; get the best possible effect from funds not yet spent; and gain market access in fast-growing economies outside Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us look at the real economy and just consider, as an illustration, the following point. We have roughly 23 million people unemployed across Europe. We also have around 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises. If we create the right conditions for each SME, on average, to create one job, we could succeed in our fight against unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the answer for growth lies in our enterprises, including our small and medium-sized companies. The way to reach this goal is by having more flexible and competitive markets, less red tape and better access to finance. These are the problems that our companies, in many of our Member States, face today: they do not have access to finance. We have tabled proposals to use the Structural Funds as guarantees to finance SMEs, and also proposals for venture capital. I hope there will be swift progress with these proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also made concrete proposals to tackle youth unemployment – one of the greatest challenges we have today in Europe. We have proposed the Youth Opportunities Initiative. I hope that the informal European Council on 30 January will agree to move these concrete proposals forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Social justice is also part of the solution. Social justice is also a central element of our growth strategy because the sacrifices must be fairly distributed throughout society. Our crisis response is not credible without this element of social justice. I believe that social dialogue is crucial in this regard and I will meet with the social partners next Monday in Brussels. I hope the same approach is followed in all our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said earlier, growth in Europe must come from deepening our single market. We should release its full potential, namely through the adoption of key measures such as the framework for venture capital, updated procurement rules and a better framework for online commerce and e-payments.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also urgently reach agreement on the European patent. We have been discussing this for decades. I fully expect negotiations on this to be completed early in the Danish Presidency. I call on the three Member States – France, Germany and the United Kingdom – who are holding things up over a side issue of some offices swiftly to find a compromise. Frankly it is not acceptable that such a crucial initiative is blocked over such a trivial disagreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe needs to innovate in order to grow, and innovation is severely hampered by the current complex and expensive rules that we have been trying to overcome for decades. It is now time to make history and to score a victory for ambition, for common sense and, above all, for Europe’s innovators.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of the measures we need are already on the table in the Europe 2020 growth strategy. There will be no resolution to this crisis unless we get serious about implementing them. We have to be consistent, persevering and determined over time. The Europe 2020 strategy is not a strategy that can wait until 2020. It needs action now, and central to the strategy is sustainable growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">We share with Denmark the priority given to green growth. The Commission looks to the Danish Presidency to conclude negotiations on the energy efficiency directive that we proposed in June last year, and to move forward with the low-carbon energy road map for 2050 that we presented in December.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Danish Presidency will also oversee the second European Semester for Economic Policy Coordination. This will be the first European semester to be implemented within our new system of economic governance. We must build on the experience of the first semester to show that we are serious about the need to reform, and ready to take full account of the deep interdependence of our economies. The Commission brought forward the publication of this year’s Annual Growth Survey to allow plenty of time for the European Parliament and the Council to examine the priorities we have identified before the spring European Council. It is critical to ensure that the intelligent fiscal consolidation, growth-boosting measures and structural reforms recommended in the survey are pursued in a determined manner across the entire European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The governance aspects of the economic agenda are also likely to retain a high profile. We expect to conclude the negotiations on the new ‘fiscal compact’, discussed at the European Council last December. I am convinced that the Danish Presidency will play a constructive role as a bridge between the countries that are inside and those outside the euro area. The Commission looks to the Danish Presidency to uphold not only the principles of unity between all Member States but also the legitimate role of the European Union institutions in the negotiations on this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">You will also be charged with pushing forward the two new proposals on strengthened economic governance for the euro area, proposals the Commission put forward in November under Article 136 of the Treaty. These build on what was already agreed in the ‘six-pack’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Danish Presidency will also be leading negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework, which will be a key engine for growth and job creation in Europe over the coming years. These discussions will not be easy in the current climate, but I believe that the proposals on the table are balanced and at the same time ambitious and realistic. I am confident that you will support the Commission’s efforts to simplify the budget and to focus every euro on delivering tangible, concrete results for Europe’s citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me close by saying a few words about our ambitions for an open and safe Europe. The European Union is today a very different place from 10 years ago when Denmark last held the Presidency. At that time – and I remember well that I participated, as Prime Minister of my country, in that historic European Council in Copenhagen – Denmark chaired the negotiations that enabled 10 new Member States to join the European Union. Denmark has, in that way, shown its very significant commitment to openness.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission supports a strengthening of Europe’s voice on the global stage and the role of the High Representative and the External Action Service. I also expect Europe to play a key role in the Rio+20 negotiations, confirming our leadership role on matters of sustainable development.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the Presidency’s intention to strengthen the Schengen agreement and the common asylum system. In particular I would like to underline here my sincere appreciation of the decision taken by the Prime Minister and the new Danish Government’s commitment to full respect for the principle of free movement in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">To close, Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt, allow me to state that, in challenging times such as these, I am sure that the European Union will benefit from Denmark’s progressive and innovative attitude more than ever before. The challenges are great and the programme is extensive but, with the right responsible approach and with the support of the other European institutions, I am sure the Danish Presidency will achieve its goals. Prime Minister, I wish you the greatest of success.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, chairing the Council of Ministers of the Union at this time is not an easy task, but I am sure that, after your training as an MEP, Prime Minister, you are fully equipped for this task.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I endorse the four priorities under which you have so classically positioned your six months at the head of the Council, namely, responsibility, European dynamism, green Europe and security. I welcome these ambitions, I share them, but as everyone here knows, a Presidency never chooses its agenda, and it is the political reality of the day that will serve as your guide.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I call upon your Presidency not to be content with being a technical Presidency; yours must be a Presidency that is, above all, political, given the wide range of issues facing you and facing us. That is also why I call upon you and your Presidency to work closely with this Parliament, which you know well but which some members of your government would like to be faster and more efficient in its decision making. You know how things work in Parliament, however.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My group and I are, of course, in favour of fast, effective legislative action, and, in recent times, the markets have either taught us or forced us to work more quickly than before. However, I am also in favour of the proper functioning of democracy and transparency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am sure, Madam President, that your Presidency will be able to find its place alongside Parliament, the Commission and the European Council. Once again, I urge and I call upon you to engage in politics, because the times in which we live demand that European actors do not simply oil the wheels and build bridges, but also that they be committed and audible actors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first week of your Presidency will be dominated by negotiations on the fiscal treaty, on which opinions differ greatly within this House, both with regard to its timeliness and its methods. My group wants this Presidency to be fully involved in this negotiation and especially wants it to defend two major principles to its partners in the Council: European integration in fiscal and economic budgetary matters, of course, but also in politics and the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since this is the time for making wishes, I would add that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would be very grateful to you if you could set the first discussions on the financial perspective on the right track. This is not an easy dossier, but when things are not easy, we must have courage. Of course, the reforms we are trying to put in place on the recovery of public finances and growth will be your top priority, but the capital debate which, because of the way things are, Europe will have to hold with regard to its finances for the 2014-2020 period, should not be neglected either. I have always said that a euro used here, in Europe, with the Commission, was a whole euro. A euro used in a country recording a deficit is already no more than 30 or 40 cents towards growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Here, a euro is a whole euro. If the Danish Presidency manages to hold these debates on good foundations, that is, without taboos, especially as regards own resources, if it is able to show the Member States, as Parliament says, that money is much better spent at European level on large-scale horizontal projects than if it is divided up, you will have earned all of our respect after your Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, in view of the efficiency and courage demonstrated during presidencies held by countries which are, let us say, not as large as others, I believe that the time has come for presidencies to be ambitious, as Poland has just been, and I believe that, although your country has opted out of several common policies, such as monetary policy, you can, and indeed you must be bold in your proposals. Help Parliament to convince the Member States that the solution to our problems will come from greater convergence and greater Europeanism and that, this way, the solution will quickly become much more tangible for our fellow citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish you all the best for the next six months.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, naturally I also want to extend my official congratulations. I am aware of your great tolerance in relation to speaking time. This tolerance is something you inherited from your predecessor and I would like to thank you for it before I begin.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, this debate about Europe is being conducted against the backdrop of a difficult situation, Let us be honest: many of those who arguably have more say in determining the fate of Europe than we do in Parliament are not in fact here. I am referring to the financial markets and rating agencies. It is completely unacceptable that we should so often find ourselves the victims of the capricious enforcers of financial market developments and the ratings agencies. They are simply exploiting the weakness of Europe. The weakness of Europe is that to date we have failed to find a joint solution or have only succeeded in finding certain solutions with difficulty. This is something that the rating agencies prove to us on a daily basis: if we do not have joint solutions, then we will find ourselves making it up as we go along, which is no way to manage European policy. That is why I support everything that has already been said, including in relation to the Community method. Prime Minister, you underlined this correctly. As you rightly said, it is important that we should move away from a one-sided policy of austerity. The rating agencies leave us in no doubt here either in their most recent downgrades: a one-sided policy of austerity will not really allow the budgets to be corrected. Should we not be concerned when the Financial Times – let me emphasise: the Financial Times, a publication not known for its left-wing views – writes as follows:</p>
      <p sl="de">‘The conclusion of the fiscal treaty, which is the top priority of EU politics right now, is at best an irrelevant distraction.’ An irrelevant distraction.</p>
      <p sl="de">This really does give us food for thought. It is, however, the social problems that are the consequence of this irrelevant distraction.</p>
      <p sl="de">Prime Minister, you said it yourself: let us look at Romania’s current position. What has happened there shows that unsocial austerity policies do not work. As you quite rightly said, it is important that savings should be made. However, this cannot be at the expense of the poorest members of society. That is exactly what is happening in Romania today.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can only urge everyone to find a way back from the brink and to reinstate the primacy of the social state in Europe. Without a social state we will never get control of budgetary problems. I am not arguing against reforms, which are necessary here and there. I am arguing against the questioning of the fundamental principles of the social state we are witnessing today, however. That is when social unrest occurs, when we have massive restrictions on civil rights and when the police are the dominant power on the streets. Events in Bucharest and in other cities should really give us plenty to think about.</p>
      <p sl="de">You mentioned the education sector. The story is the same here. We recently put our weight behind the Lisbon Programme: our aim is to be the most competition-oriented and most competitive region, specifically on the basis of our education, training, science and research. What do we see happening today? Resources are being cut. Not only are they not being increased, they are actually being cut. I believe that this is extremely damaging. When you referred to the ‘no future’ generation, you should know that it has already arrived. In your programme you rightly said that we need Europe to be at work. Unfortunately, what we often witness today is a Europe of rising unemployment. Let me make an admission: my group wants to see Europe at work. We fully support your approach. This can only happen – and I would like to make this quite clear – if we link environmental concerns, the workforce and employment policy. We are absolutely against viewing these as opposites.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">That is why we shall work with all the stakeholders – including the unions – to ensure that new jobs are created, that the environment is protected and that sustainable development is guaranteed. The Danish Presidency has our unconditional support in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">You also mentioned energy efficiency. This again is an issue close to our hearts. We must become more energy-efficient. This is something we can achieve. There are plenty of good examples, we simply need to follow them. I believe that the most important thing here is that our pride should be restored. Europeans must be able to take pride in Europe. We are confronted with our problems when we travel to the US or China, for example. Things were quite different 10 years ago. I would like things to be different again after the Danish Presidency and would hope that we can once again take pride in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to close with a short comment – after all I do not wish to stretch the patience of our new President. Before my election, our group had some exemplary debates in the most positive sense. I should also like officially to thank my fellow Members, particularly Catherine Trautmann and Stephen Hughes. We are here today as a cohesive group. We remain a cohesive, able partner for our colleagues in this House and, of course, for the Presidency and for the European Commission. We all have different expectations from Europe: a social Europe, a fair Europe, a green Europe. Above all – as we shall discuss this afternoon – we want a democratic Europe. Democracy must prevail in all of our Member States. We are ready to talk, however. We aim to work together to create this Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">With this in mind I would like to congratulate you once again, Mr President, as well as all the Vice-Presidents. I believe we have made some excellent appointments to the House.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I think that the Prime Minister has one priority, namely to find a way out of the two crises we are going through at the moment – the euro crisis, and the crisis concerning European values.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that one thing is crystal clear: the half-measures that have been taken over the last two years have not worked, and all the bilateral meetings between Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy have not worked either. They only calm the markets for 24 hours, and then everything starts again. We have to say, as has already been mentioned here, that the recent decision of Standard and Poor’s has been attacked by all – or perhaps I should say most – European leaders. I am not a big fan of the rating agency either, but I think that, instead of complaining about them, the European leaders today should read their reports and the message they are giving, because what they are saying is in fact true.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was disappointed that Mr Barnier, Mr Rehn and others reacted in that way because when you see – and when you read – what Standard and Poor’s is saying, it is true. They describe the lack of political courage and unity in Europe as the main problems at the moment. They describe the misinterpretation of the crisis. They are saying that it is not only a financial crisis – a fiscal crisis – but also a trade imbalance crisis. They describe the need – maybe it was the Socialists who wrote this – to help countries that are cutting their expenditure to achieve some growth too.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Thank you for the applause for Standard and Poor’s. So they are right that the crisis is far from over and that we still need a sustainable solution. Let us be honest about this. The solution is not on the table for the moment. What we need are stability bonds, common bonds – choose whatever name you want. The German proposal for a redemption fund is also a very good idea. But if you want this crisis to be over, you have to act now.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is not just my opinion, or our opinion here; it is also the message from Italy’s Prime Minister, Mario Monti, in today’s Financial Times. He says that he is not complaining about the downgrading of the ratings: the problem is the persistent policy weakness at European level. He also says that he does not just need a pat on the back from Mrs Merkel, but a commitment regarding Eurobonds and the Eurobond market. He is right. There is no sustainable solution for Italy with today’s interest rates of six or seven percent. The only way that he can come out of this crisis is to continue with his economies and savings, but at the same time we must lower those six or seven percent interest rates on the Eurobond market. Otherwise we are asking an impossible task of Mr Monti. It is not fair to say that it is very good to continue with your austerity programmes and at the same time to continue having interest rates of six or seven percent.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point, Prime Minister, is that you have another crisis to tackle: the crisis concerning our values. Not just in Hungary: look also at what is happening in Romania today. I know that the Commission has started a number of infringement procedures. I hope that we will find a majority here in Parliament to launch the procedure based on Article 7 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">By the way, Mr President, congratulations. You will give me more time now, will you not? You are an Italian, you do that in Italy. My final question to you, Prime Minister, is very clear. The Commission is starting infringement procedures. We should be starting a procedure under Article 7 of the Treaty. My question is, what will the Council be doing over the coming days? Will you, Prime Minister, put it on the agenda of the next European Council? I think it would be a mistake if you do not do so. The core of Europe is not only about money and about the euro, but also about our liberties and our values.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, it is an honour to welcome you here today. You will no doubt be aware of the reputation that precedes you. Because you represent a red-red-green government in Denmark, my group naturally has very particular expectations from you, not just because of your political background and this refreshing new start for Denmark, but also because, with your decisively female Scandinavian way, you represent a new force in the urgent debate concerning Europe. I could imagine your charmingly sober approach to politics, which I noted in Copenhagen, is also an instrument that you could use to challenge your German opposite number in the context of crisis politics. That is precisely what we expect from you. We expect you to take another critical look at the Treaty we have been debating since the last crisis summit. We believe that this Treaty is not just a diversion from crisis politics, but also an insult to European democracy. It not only excludes the European Parliament, but also fails to take national parliaments sufficiently into account. This is quite unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also believe that, for example, the European summits that are now to take place in an informal way in the future, will be difficult from Denmark’s perspective because they shift the balance of power in the Council in an unwelcome way. So much for these difficult treaty-related technical issues. I believe that such democratic questions are of enormous significance for the continued functioning of the European Union. The substance of this Treaty has been rightly criticised by the previous speakers in this House. The completely one-sided focus on stability has not only failed to resolve the crisis, but actually made it worse and I now find it almost unbearable to hear in each plenary how we are even deeper in crisis than before the last crisis summit.</p>
      <p sl="de">This morning the World Bank hit the headlines with the news that it remains of the view that Europe is collapsing into crisis and will drag the rest of the world with it. How long can this go on?</p>
      <p sl="de">Your programme contains some elements that indicate that you want to do things differently in your capacity as the Danish President-in-Office of the Council. Go ahead. Do not wait until halfway through your Council Presidency, but rather start the debate right now. We need these investment programmes to help the economy recover now. Your ideas on climate protection, which were very well prepared by Connie Hedegaard, and your ideas on energy efficiency, could provide the stimulus for jobs in the European Union. You have no time to lose, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have already heard mention several times today of the construction of the entire financial market regulatory system. I fully agree that we must discuss the question of Eurobonds or the Redemption Fund and that this is an issue that can no longer be put off.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me also say a word on the role of the European Central Bank in this debate: it is still a huge problem that we believe that we can have a common currency and that we can defend it without having a truly jointly functioning European Central Bank or without authorising the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). This message has also been repeated like a mantra by many speakers. It has been picked up and developed by the rating agencies but has not had sufficient effect in the Council or in the key Member States to date.</p>
      <p sl="de">My plea to you, as a former colleague, as Prime Minister and as President-in-Office of the Council, is as follows: as a woman, do things better than your predecessors. Do not procrastinate, but follow your political convictions in the Council. Hungary, which is the subject of this afternoon’s debate, is an excellent example of how the Council and Commission have allowed a problem to fester, deflecting attention from it, and are now having to pay the price for the way in which the country has developed. The Commission and Council share responsibility for what happened in Hungary during the Hungarian Presidency of the Council.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Hungary is a country with major economic problems. Viktor Orbán’s government has not succeeded in finding a way out of Hungary’s difficult economic situation. Instead he has chosen the path of propagating and implementing national chauvinist strategies in Hungary in an effort to divert attention from the weaknesses of his own government’s policies. I believe that we should show solidarity with the Hungarians and with all other European Member States who are experiencing economic problems. I also believe, however, that solidarity is not something that can be ordered à la carte. All values apply equally within the European Union, not just solidarity, allowing the rest to be forgotten as Mr Orbán’s government currently wishes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me welcome Ms Thorning-Schmidt to the Chamber this morning. From a UK perspective let me congratulate her on being the first member of the Kinnock family to make it to the office of Prime Minister. It will be a great surprise to many in the UK that finally one has made it. Denmark is an historic ally and the military personnel of Denmark served with great distinction alongside personnel from my country, from France and from others in defence of the people of Libya, and we owe you a great deal of gratitude for that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the fact that Denmark is taking on the Presidency at such a crucial moment, when Europe stands on the brink of a political and economic catastrophe. My hope for the Danish Presidency is for some plain speaking. It is sometimes said that the most courageous act in politics is speaking truth unto power. The Presidency has begun well with its frank assessment of the damage that a financial transaction tax would cause to the gross domestic product of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope the Presidency will continue in this vein and tell all the leaders of the European Union that the time has come to face the truth about the eurozone and about Europe’s fundamental economic weaknesses, because the last Council was a staggering missed opportunity. Instead of facing reality, instead of tackling these problems, the Council has embarked on yet another round of introspective, institutional navel-gazing.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must never forget that we are currently in the midst of not one but two great crises. The eurozone is the most immediate problem, but we must also not lose sight of the fact that Europe faces a fundamental challenge to its international economic position. We are losing competitiveness in the global marketplace; we are falling behind more dynamic regions of the world. We are allowing bureaucracy to stifle enterprise and regulation to hamper innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we work towards Europe in 2020 we need a growth agenda which creates jobs and which encourages businesses. The European Union must focus on stimulating economic reform and developing the single market. We therefore support some of the key priorities of the Danish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the Multiannual Financial Framework, we welcome the fact that it should be viewed in the context of needing to consolidate public finances. A budget that looks to the future, and not to the past, and a budget that strives for cost-effectiveness – as suggested in the programme – is very welcome from our point of view.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need all Member States to take a similarly realistic, unrestrained view of the EU budget. We would like a budget freeze, and we want the focus on spending existing resources more efficiently and more effectively. We also look forward to the efforts of the Presidency to emphasise the need to revitalise the single market, because we share the vision of Europe as an open region for trade, an open region for investments. Economic openness is also a precondition for increased growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Much of the programme seems to use the language of the 21st century to describe tried and failed policies of the 20th century. The Presidency programme speaks of more regulation, it speaks of a responsible economy, and it speaks of effective standardisation. All of us, politicians and officials, need to remember that every additional regulation comes at a cost. This must be paid for either by consumers when buying the goods or services or by workers who lose their jobs as employment is exported overseas.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are aspects of the programme that we would deplore; we are alarmed by some of the thinking behind initiatives in the field of external relations and in the field of justice and home affairs. The Presidency should not, for instance, promote the Commission’s proposal for a common corporate tax base. It should have the courage to try and kill off such an ill-conceived and dangerous proposal. With that, let me wish the Danish Presidency well and we look forward to working constructively with them to advance the cause that we all believe in.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Danish Presidency and the Danish Government. Congratulations on having just passed your first 100 days in power as the new government in Denmark. At the elections in September, Helle Thorning-Schmidt and her allies put a clear question to the Danish people: are we to get ourselves out of the crisis by investing or by saving? Are we to overcome the crisis by creating jobs or by creating unemployment?</p>
      <p sl="da">The Danish people gave their answer by electing Ms Thorning-Schmidt as Prime Minister. The question that the Danish Prime Minister asked during the Danish elections is even more relevant in the EU as a whole because, as has already been said, the EU is experiencing the deepest crisis that it has ever faced. More than 10% of our citizens in the European Union are unemployed, with 5 million in Spain alone – which is more than the entire Danish population – and youth unemployment is catastrophic. Two thirds of EU Member States have a youth unemployment rate above 20% – in Lithuania it is over 30%, in Greece over 40% and in Spain almost 50%.</p>
      <p sl="da">Therefore, it is also disappointing to read the programme of the Danish Presidency. It could almost have been written by ‘Merkozy’. Gone are the ideas of investing our way out of the crisis and back are the demands for savings to get us out of the crisis. Honestly speaking, however, is there anyone who believes that we can overcome the current crisis by ordering cuts and reductions? The EU tried this in Greece. It did not work. The EU tried again in Greece. Still it did not work. Now we are trying for a third time in Greece, and it will still not work!</p>
      <p sl="da">The Danish Presidency’s programme bears the grand title ‘Europe at work’, but the policy that is presented will lead to more unemployment. My group believes that this is completely the wrong approach to take. I would like to finish by saying to the Danish Presidency that people in the Member States do not need more cuts dictated by Europe. They do not need euro pacts or financial treaties to reduce public services and cut wages. People in Europe need jobs to improve their shared prosperity. The Danish Presidency has six months to show us that it is part of the solution and not part of the problem.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, it has been exciting to witness such a genuine love story over the last half an hour. I can assure you that Ms Thorning-Schmidt is exactly the sort of Prime Minister that you are all longing for. She was educated at the bureaucratic academy that is the College of Europe in Bruges, taught and trained here in the European Parliament’s sacred halls and came to power purely on the basis of a whole string of lies told to her electorate in exactly the same way as the whole of the EU was established. That is certainly a President-in-Office of the Council that you can be proud of and that you will be able to embrace. I can promise you and everyone in the Commission that you will also be infatuated with Ms Thorning-Schmidt. You are yourselves the epitome of people who rule and govern without a popular mandate, without so much as a single voter ever having voted for you.</p>
      <p sl="da">At a time when more and more Danish voters are angry that they voted for Ms Thorning-Schmidt and would like to change what they did, you are certainly a model for this government, a perfect match. Where you needed to appoint puppet governments in Greece and Italy to do your bidding, Ms Thorning-Schmidt and the Danish Government will deliver everything on a silver platter. There will be no protests, no conflicts, only loyalty. What more could you ask for?</p>
      <p sl="da">In this regard, therefore, I just have one friendly, but heartfelt, appeal to make to Ms Thorning-Schmidt: come to Brussels, come to Strasbourg, spend all of your time over the next six months here in the EU institutions. I say this primarily because it will prevent your government from destroying conditions in Denmark, but then also because the damaging of effect of you being here will be minimal in relation to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="da">The EU is already a supertanker with a leak. The water has already covered the lowest decks. The other day we saw how even the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which is the instrument that is intended to rescue the whole of the euro area, was downgraded by the international credit rating agencies. Yet what is the tune that we hear being played? It is more violin playing, of course, just like on the Titanic as the water rushed in.</p>
      <p sl="da">Ms Thorning-Schmidt, welcome to the EU. Here you can get what you want. Your friends Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso and Mr Schulz are all here. Here you can mould the state that you want, but that no one else outside these walls wants. Here you decide, not the electorate. What you might have to lie about to get in Denmark, they get served on a silver platter here. This is a love story that is worth following.</p>

Therefore we can be pleased about one small thing and that is that the Danish Government’s policy has done a complete backward flip. Some ministers are in favour and others are opposed to it. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will vote in favour, even the Danish Members. Thus, we do not really know what the Danish Government thinks about this, and that is actually the best thing that we can say about the Danish Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Thank you, Mr President. Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt, I am afraid I have never in my life before heard quite so much hollow rhetoric and empty words as I have heard from you today. You seem similar to Mr Barroso, in this respect. What you said was meaningless, from start to finish, just like the stuff we are used to hearing from the Commission and Mr Barroso. Europe has been promising economic growth for fifteen years already, has it not? The Lisbon Strategy promises that Europe will be the strongest economy in the world, but what a joke that has turned out to be. In reality, European socialism has resulted in mass unemployment, bankrupt countries, economic decline and politicians who are only out to fill their own pockets.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, I wish to make an urgent appeal to you, because the Netherlands has a big problem with Europe. The Netherlands has one of the best social systems in the world and we are proud of that and, yet, Europe, European bureaucracy is working to destroy the Dutch system. What I mean is that it is unacceptable that European migrant workers should have the right to benefit from social services after spending only one year in their host country. You should have to spend at least ten years in a country before being able to avail yourself of its social services. But Europe prohibits us from imposing that condition. It is very important that the Netherlands is given scope to protect itself from all those Romanian and Bulgarian fortune hunters and keep them out of our social system, so that it can continue to exist for the benefit of Dutch people. Would you, therefore, put that at the top of your agenda, Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt?</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to start by welcoming the Danish Prime Minister here to the European Parliament. We have been looking forward to the Danish Presidency and we hope that it goes well. There are a few of us who will give it our support. Even though there have been a few speakers in a row who were not entirely satisfied, I believe that most of us here in this Chamber would agree with the Danish Presidency on the four priorities that it has set out.</p>
      <p sl="da">We have a major and obligatory task in the economic sphere with the fiscal compact, the ‘six-pack’ and, in particular, with the forthcoming budget. I do not believe that Denmark should be content to just run the office over the next six months. It is important for the whole of Europe that we have a Presidency with aspirations, a courageous Presidency that has the courage to set an agenda that can make a difference – even if this causes disagreement. Once the economic agenda is on track, I would like to see Denmark get to grips with the energy sector. There will be disagreement here, it is said, but it is essential that we find a solution.</p>
      <p sl="da">In 2011, the EU spent EUR 315 billion buying in oil for Europe, and by focusing on energy efficiency we can save a great deal of money, which can then remain within the sector. Unfortunately, we see that Europe’s enterprises and citizens are currently becoming more and more dependent on gas from Mr Putin and oil from the Middle East. If we have a more stringent directive in the area of energy efficiency, we will increase Europe’s competitiveness, our innovation and, in particular, our capacity to operate on the global markets. Last but not least, it will create a huge number of jobs for blue-collar workers – we will create the growth that we so desperately want in Europe. If there is one area in which Denmark ought to achieve its objectives in the next six months, this is it. I hope that the Presidency will take up the fight, despite the fact that there are some people who disagree. I would like to wish you luck with the Presidency and with producing sound results that will ensure green growth and green research in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Thorning-Schmidt for her very clear and very ambitious plan for the forthcoming Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="da">The four main headings – a responsible Europe, a dynamic Europe, a safe Europe and a green Europe – set a course for the EU that is absolutely the right one at this time. I believe that many Europeans feel that the EU is a bit remote, that it is something vague that goes on in Strasbourg and Brussels, but that perhaps does not have any great relevance to their everyday lives. The reality, however, is quite different. This could not be further from the truth. The decisions that are taken in these buildings have enormous consequences for people’s everyday lives from Amsterdam to Athens, from Cyprus to Copenhagen. When we talk about a responsible and dynamic Europe what we are talking about is the need to create growth and jobs, but we of course have to do so at a time that also demands frugality. This is a difficult balance to find. It is something quite different – in fact it is the complete opposite of what Mr Messerschmidt and Mr Søndergaard said. Mr Messerschmidt spoke of ‘the perfect match’ and ‘love affairs’ – in this regard, I have to say that the far left and the far right are united in their criticism of Europe and are sending out a message to the effect that countries, like Greece for example, that are not able to make cuts themselves should be left to their own devices. This is obviously something that has an impact, not because they are right, but because it shows how damaging it is if we do not stand together in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="da">A green Europe is another vision. This is a vision that holds that, at a time of crisis, we must not neglect the environment – on the contrary in fact! By doing something good for the environment and for the climate we can also create jobs and growth. Take the Energy Efficiency Directive, for example. Here we say that if, in Europe, we reduce our CO2 emissions internally by 25% – we can do that by being 20% more energy efficient than we are today – we can create 2 million jobs. That means jobs for 2 million Europeans who do not currently have one. That is where we can make a difference. That is where we can make the EU visible. That is where we can demonstrate that when we stand together across borders we can make a difference for the better.</p>
      <p sl="da">A safe Europe relates to the fact that cross-border crime and terrorism are things that cause concern and create insecurity. Here, too, we can make a difference if we work together across borders. Overall, this is a far-sighted, down-to-earth and very ambitious Presidency programme. I wish you every success.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the Prime Minister to where it all started for her.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to address the Prime Minister in English, as I intend to compliment her and her government, and the last time I complimented Commissioner Reding in this plenary, it was translated as criticism. Therefore, as the Prime Minister is not used to me complimenting her, I want to avoid any misunderstandings, because the message is also for this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to compliment the Danish Government on three things. I want to compliment you on having listened to this House in drawing up your priorities, and on sticking to what is already on the table. This makes for a Presidency programme which is ambitious yet pragmatic. It shows that you have clearly understood your role as an honest broker. And finally, you and your ministers have done your homework and have been extremely industrious, with a high number of preliminary talks with Parliament. Thank you for that. I am sure you will get the support you have asked for today.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, before the Prime Minister gets carried away by all these compliments, I had better ask a few critical questions. Firstly, how will the Prime Minister navigate the emerging minefield of new intergovernmental agreements and avoid European disunity? Secondly, what is the Danish position on a ‘Tobin tax’, which – according to the Commission’s latest figures – could cost around 130 000 jobs? Lastly, we are currently discussing family reunification rules and the Commission’s Green Paper. Now that Parliament’s President, Mr Schulz, has withdrawn his earlier critique of the 24-year rule, will the Prime Minister seize this opportunity to start working for an EU-wide 24-year rule? Those are my questions.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt, thank you very much on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for your excellent speech. I would like to start by saying that I think it is refreshing to see a strong and visionary woman at the head of Europe, a Europe in which there are a great many dusty, grey suits. I think that we are in need of a breath of fresh air, and I believe that you are able to provide that. The most important thing as far as I am concerned is the fact that the Danish Presidency is to a large extent making it a priority to find a common European solution to the crisis. It involves focusing hard on creating green growth, sustainable growth and new green jobs. That is what millions of European citizens who are currently out of work need. My own generation, the young people in Europe, is the hardest hit, and I am pleased that you have taken up the question of solidarity between generations here today. I think the Danish Presidency could even go a step further and ensure that we set the halving of youth unemployment as a new 2020 objective and that we work towards providing a European youth guarantee to ensure jobs and education here during the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, I would like to say that it is vital for us all to recognise that cuts alone will not solve the crisis. Cuts have been on the agenda for a long time, and for a long time it has been about giving each other a haircut. Now it is time to kick start our economy, to create new jobs and to ensure that our crisis solutions are fair. Following your speech today, I have very high expectations that the Danish Presidency will succeed in this task.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, welcome Prime Minister. There are major challenges ahead of the Danish Presidency over the next six months. Among other things, it is expected that the Danish Presidency will focus on reforming the EU’s energy consumption. This is a huge challenge, as the Member States all have such different needs. I hope the Presidency will support the development of completely new renewable energy initiatives. Wind, water and solar energy are quite simply not enough.</p>
      <p sl="da">Denmark has taken over the Presidency during a grim period. The economic crisis is having major consequences for the people of Europe, who are already being hit hard by unemployment, which is something we are hearing from all sides today, particularly among young people. We can change this if we strengthen the small and medium-sized enterprises, which are suffering very difficult conditions right now. As you said yourself, it is time to kick start growth. I do not expect the Presidency to spend time making amendments to the Treaties that do not have the support of the people. The crisis must not be used as an excuse for more EU bureaucracy. The time should instead be spent on tangible results, realism, increased competitiveness and strengthening the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="da">Other important matters also need urgent attention, as we are hearing from our fellow Members. The reforms of the fisheries policy and agricultural policy are matters that are on the table right now. At a time of financial deficit and demands for national savings, it would be appropriate for the EU to demand one base for this Parliament and to make substantial cuts in both agricultural and fisheries subsidies. We know that, in their current form, these two areas do not work as they are supposed to, but they nevertheless cost citizens dearly. We need to stop paying for initiatives that do not have the desired effect.</p>
      <p sl="da">I am pleased to hear that the Presidency will work in a targeted and realistic way to enable European citizens to regain confidence in their future in our part of the world.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have experienced four years now of harsh austerity across Europe and the results are perfectly clear: a downward spiral is being forced on Ireland, Portugal and Greece; millions are now facing misery, with parents in Greece giving up their children because they cannot afford to feed them; and the economy of the EU as a whole faces the potential for a recession in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">Both the Prime Minister and Mr Barroso spoke about growth but, when you read the programme, it is clear that what we have here is business as usual – talking about growth while implementing austerity – and there is obviously a particular emphasis within the programme on the implementation of economic governance. Economic governance pure and simple is a method of institutionalising austerity at the expense of democracy across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results; and that is precisely what we have here. Is it insanity or is it simply a means of ensuring that the bondholders get their pound of flesh at the expense of working people?</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, can I ask about the attitude of the Danish Presidency and the Commission as to the prospect of a referendum in Ireland on the austerity treaty, which goes even further in institutionalising and enshrining austerity? Will you respect the legal and political right of the Irish people to a referendum and to vote freely without a campaign of fear or blackmail?</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Prime Minister, I wish you every success in your Presidency over the next six months. I should like to make two specific proposals as an addendum or improvement to the Commission’s current policy. In the energy sector, your Presidency could take the initiative of inventorising all existing energy sources in Europe. We need to know what energy sources the European Union has at its disposal and which of our investments in the energy sector are not realistic; for example, we have photovoltaics in countries where there is no sunshine. We therefore need to inventorise existing energy sources.</p>
      <p sl="el">My second proposal is that an initiative should be taken in the employment sector. Yesterday’s Wall Street Journal had a piece on the mass exodus of labour from the European Union. We need to examine this change in the fabric of the labour market in the European Union.</p>

That has not always been welcomed by other governments or by the European Union itself.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Your country also took a brave position in response to the ‘cartoon crisis’, as it has been dubbed, in defending the rights to free speech and freedom of the press in the face of Islamist intolerance. Although you represent a different majority government, Prime Minister, I hope you will defend the right of Member States to pursue their own asylum and immigration policies, because it seems to be the case at present that, because of a lack of external border controls, we are having to deal with both a Schengen crisis and a euro crisis.</p>

This is something quite new for us from a Danish perspective and we shall do all we can actively to support you in this programme, both in implementing the individual measures – for example in relation to the regulation of the financial markets – as well as your efforts to make the Community method a success as the yardstick for European policy, rather than the intergovernmental method – this is something you expressly emphasised. We will be with you all the way, Prime Minister, if you seize this initiative.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one thing I would like to add: please guide Denmark back from its eurosceptic stance. Denmark has an opt-out clause in the euro area. You have the opportunity not only to stabilise the euro, but also to reverse current Danish opinion and to take an active step in favour of the euro.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one other thing I would like to add: we will support your programme. However, I read several times in the preliminary notices that you wish to make a move in Turkey’s direction. You did not mention this today. Prime Minister, please do us a favour during your six months holding the Presidency and, in view of the forthcoming Presidency, persuade Turkey to drop its opposition to Cyprus, which will hold the Presidency after you. This would be a real success in relation to Turkey.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Prime Minister, I would like to start by thanking you. Immediately upon entering office, you reversed the snap decision of the previous regime to reintroduce border controls between Denmark and Germany and Denmark and Sweden. I believe this was a very good decision. My group favours an open Europe. This was good news for those citizens living in the border regions. It was also good news for business, particularly the transport companies on either side of the border. Thank you for what is a really positive step.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my second point I find myself agreeing with Mr Langen: please defend the Community method. You have already seen what happens when we revert to the intergovernmental patterns of the 19th century and the attitudes associated with them. At least this is what has been reported in the media in relation to what Mr Sarkozy had to say to you. If this is the new tone we can expect from the intergovernmental method, then this is another argument in favour of the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one important point to make, however. In setting out your priorities for the Presidency of the Council you state that you want the European Union to have a strong, consistent external profile. I believe it would be good if you could use the opportunity afforded by this Council Presidency to initiate a debate on whether you really wish to maintain your opt-out from the Common Security and Defence Policy. It is strange that every country except Denmark is a member of the European Defence Agency. I would be extremely grateful if you could take advantage of this opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, my group, together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is pursuing a procedure against Hungary under Article 7(1) of the Treaty. It is then up to the Council, however, to make any recommendations. Article 7(1) only provides for recommendations. I would encourage you: place this on the agenda and organise the necessary four-fifths majority of Member States. This is the only way we will make any progress with regard to Hungary.</p>

Today, however, I want to address one issue which I think is crucial in relation to getting investment in the short term, and it concerns the European Investment Bank. In December 2008, 27 heads of state decided that in 2009 the lending capacity of the EIB should be raised from EUR 55 billion to EUR 80 billion. That meant in 2009 that there was EUR 25 billion more concrete investment in wind and other projects as well as corporate bonds, which saved part of the European car industry. Today we are in the same credit crunch, yet for next year the EIB has reduced its lending capacity to EUR 60 billion. Why, at this very moment, are we cutting back EUR 20 billion in the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, why is the EIB not using what Mr Draghi has provided as a lifeline for the private banks? Private banks now have EUR 500 billion at 1%, and they are parking it overnight in the European Central Bank and not investing it in the real economy. So, why is the EIB not able to lend EUR 80 billion at 1% in 2012 and invest in the European economy? Is that not the single quickest investment stimulus we can get during your Presidency?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Prime Minister is taking on the Presidency of the EU at a time when unacceptable behaviour threatens democratic principles. Such behaviour has become endemic and institutionalised in the European Union.

With a possible new treaty on the way, the EU apparatchiks are desperately looking for a new way to include all 27 countries without the need for a referendum. So much for democracy. No wonder people across Europe are rioting. The message is there for all to see, but the EU turns its head away.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prime Minister, you again hold the Presidency at a decisive moment: the possible demise of the euro. At a time of crisis and uncertainty the EU is looking to the Danish Presidency for a strong lead. How telling it is that a country from outside the eurozone is taking the helm.

      <p sl="it">What does this mean? In my view a more responsible Europe is first and foremost a Europe that is aware of the risk it is running. Today the biggest obstacle to this is the European leadership. It is not the euro that is in danger. In the euro area there are countries that have accepted the currency, but not the sense of political leadership. The worst situation is the immobility of our leadership in the continent. This is particularly true for countries in trouble that are in dire need of being driven by the force of the colossus that is Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Ms Thorning-Schmidt, welcome to the European Union divided between the Member States that can find loans at low interest rates and those that can only find them at high rates. In times of crisis, selfishness and a lack of solidarity emerge. Let us reverse this trend by harmonising austerity with solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am rapporteur for the revision of the Maternity Leave Directive, which the European Parliament adopted in October 2010. To date, despite the efforts of the Polish Presidency, the Council has not responded to Parliament’s proposal. Parliament is ready for and interested in dialogue with the Council and the Commission, so as to find an appropriate solution to this situation, which serves European families and is in line with the Europe 2020 strategy’s targets. This is an important issue, all the more so because Europe is facing a serious demographic problem that limits economic growth and jeopardises the sustainability of social security. I should like to see this file closed during the Danish Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I do not wish to address the empty words we have heard from Mr Barroso and the Prime Minister. They do not add much to the political debate. However, I take exception to the agitation against Hungary in this House. Parliament is not alone in this – when we see how the Commission has acted against Hungary then it is evident that its manoeuvres have taken on an aspect of blackmail.</p>
      <p sl="de">As an Austrian, I am reminded of the way the European Union imposed stupid sanctions against Austria in 2000, leaving itself with egg on its face. The accusations are unjust and simply incorrect. Mr Orbán’s government has proven time and time again that it is democratic. It was elected by two-thirds of the Hungarian electorate and is democratically legitimised. It has also repeatedly shown in the past, during its Council Presidency, that it is a reliable partner, not only within the European Union, but also within NATO.</p>
      <p sl="de">Hungary cannot be dealt with in this way. Those who believe that this agitation will succeed in returning the socialists, liberals, old-style Marxists or even neo-Marxists to power are simply fooling themselves. This defamation of the Hungarian Government …</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President of the Commission, let us start by talking about economic and financial subjects; you have stated, Prime Minister, that Denmark did not envisage being involved in the economic integration of the euro area. Could you reassure us of the swift implementation of legislative proposals on derivatives and the two regulations which must accompany the overhaul of the Stability and Growth Pact? We really do need these texts. Majorities – particularly a political majority – are forming on the tax on financial transactions; could you give us your exact political position on this matter?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Next, I should like to draw your attention to trade policy. It is the Council that gives the Commission the mandate to negotiate on the Union’s behalf. It is a competence of the Union, and we, the European Parliament, have a new political competence to approve treaties on trade. I should like to draw your attention to the need to avoid being naïve and the need to apply the principle of reciprocity; for example, will proposals on negotiations with Mercosur be exchanged at the end of your Presidency? I would advise you to be very careful.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, with regard to growth, when President Van Rompuy came to tell us about the last European Council, I proposed holding a special European Council entirely dedicated to growth. You are a Member of the European Council, with a special position. President Schulz wishes to be invited to the European Council; will you support us on the presence of our President at the European Council and on the need to have a true European Council dedicated entirely to growth?</p>

      <p sl="es">Prime Minister, we are celebrating the decisions adopted during the last Council, but it is my hope and wish that they do not remain mere words, but that they also become actions and come to fruition as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must send a solid message to the markets. Up to now, they have been very welcoming of the measures. Furthermore, there is a sense of eagerness for cooperation and a spirit of willingness, both of which we will continue to have great need of over the coming months.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must maintain and continue to consolidate our efforts in favour of stability and continue to put our trust in austerity measures, but these must be accompanied by other measures to generate growth and, therefore, employment.</p>
      <p sl="es">We cannot recover from this crisis through austerity measures alone. We need to bring reforms to fruition, not just debate them. Spain is showing that it is fully committed to this idea. That is why we are supporting the structural reforms that must be implemented by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Central Bank, for its part, has demonstrated courage when taking decisions, but it must show greater commitment through more active participation in the secondary debt markets.

      <p sl="fi">Presidents generally set so many priorities that, ultimately, nothing is a priority. The same applies to European years, which often vanish, with no traces of them remaining. At present, the Union is celebrating the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations. This is also a particularly crucial issue from the point of view of the economy. Prolonging careers and safeguarding the durability of pension systems are issues of human dignity, but they are also very important matters for the economy. That is because it is an inescapable fact that ageism has now reached new levels in the European Union and in all the Member States, on account of this present economic recession. There are, of course, shining examples of active ageing in our midst: Jacques Delors, Helmut Schmidt and others. Make this a priority.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Prime Minister, you are taking over the helm of Europe in difficult times, but you are one who is hardened to difficulties. Allow me to translate what my Socialist fellow Member was proposing: if you put Hungary in your sights, your programme will succeed. I, however, do not share this opinion. I am very pleased to see that your presidency programme reflects the same intention that the Hungarian Presidency had set as its objective just one year ago, namely the intention to create the second pillar of the economic union by coordinating economic policies on a Europe-wide scale. Well, now is your chance to launch this process in a responsible manner.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As a Hungarian MEP, I am perfectly aware what it is like to work with dedication towards common policies while being outside the euro area. A prominent part of your programme is the strict monitoring of every constituent of economic governance. This task does indeed call for a clear head and rational thinking, but above all else, it calls for considerate behaviour. It requires considerate behaviour primarily in that the realisation of these new mechanisms should not be viewed solely in terms of figures.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I therefore ask you to look for similarities in Member States over the course of your work instead of seeking to separate them into well-performing and less well-performing countries, and to look for the efforts to which all Member States committed themselves upon their accession. In this I wish you wisdom, patience and perseverance. I wish you success in steering the boat of the European Union over the upcoming six months.</p>

Just a few reasons: we have to preserve the unity of Europe when the eurozone crisis is trying to tear us apart. We have to constantly fight against the extremists and the Eurosceptics, and let me underline that citizens are not happy about the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are going to start to apply the ‘six-pack’ and take some painful decisions. There are serious doubts about the prevalence of democratic principles in some of the Member States, including a state I know well. However, I am not completely dejected. We have heard a coherent, elaborate Presidency programme for a responsible, dynamic green and safe Europe. As a mother of two, you place special attention on youth, as I do. I am, therefore, confident that the Commission will keep its determination to do this job, and make sure that our common European values are respected everywhere.</p>

      <p sl="de">This Council Presidency is focusing on two main areas. It has set itself the goal of leading a responsible Europe. A responsible Europe must be a democratic Europe. If Europe is to be democratic, the European Parliament must be involved in every decision at a European level. During the Danish Presidency nothing must be decided without the participation of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">A responsible Europe must be united and not divided. Perhaps it is a good thing that you are not in the euro area, because there attempts are currently being made to separate some countries from the others. All the measures which are taken in response to the crisis must be community measures and must prepare for the next stage of integration, which involves establishing an economic and social union and a political union.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second area which you will be focusing on is regulating the financial markets. I would like to ask you to work together with us in Parliament to overcome the individual interests quickly and to implement the necessary measures to improve capital structure and liquidity while preserving the structure of the European economy.</p>

At a time when we risk a division in Europe in the process of deciding how to achieve financial stability, it is very important that the Presidency be able do whatever is needed in order to take care of the entire European Union and to bind Member States together. The process of the internal market, and of launching a new wave of reform for the internal market, is one of the most important ways of binding Europe together, and also of regaining economic strength and dynamism. I hope this will be a core item on the Danish Presidency agenda.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the next European Presidency truly faces many challenges, including the euro crisis, and the Multiannual Financial Framework. It is, however, very important, at the same time, to pay attention to energy issues, which are playing an increasingly important role in geopolitics. Specifically, the development of a common European Union foreign policy on energy should be encouraged.</p>
      <p sl="lv">At the moment we have legislation that provides that in the European Union supply systems operators are separate from suppliers and from producers. At the same time we know that there are Member States that are concluding cooperation agreements with third countries which allocate exclusive rights to use the infrastructure, thus preventing competition and running counter to the interests of the European Union’s residents.</p>

It is not just a throw-away line, it is a phrase that makes a commitment to strengthen Europe and to offer total support; to make sure, as she said at the end, that the Community method prevails.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore find ourselves in a very difficult situation – and mine is not empty rhetoric – as we are facing a halt in the EU development process. This has been superseded not by amendment of the treaty, as some Members have claimed, but by an agreement between the intergovernmental Member States. We have come to a standstill and are facing very difficult times, which I do not believe will lead to the possibility of development. With the intergovernmental agreement there is neither growth nor development. Therefore the commitment of the Danish Presidency is to prevent all this from happening.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, last Friday – 13 January 2012 – Standard and Poor’s told markets in the world that EU leaders had been incompetent in responding to the crisis. They have not stopped but rather they have fuelled speculation against the euro. S&amp;P stressed that EU systemic tensions and euro problems were due to the growing divergence of competitiveness among core EU Member States and the so-called ‘periphery’. Solidarity has been an empty word in measures to counter these structural imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rating agencies have now come to agree with the progressive left that the punitive austerity obsessing Mrs Merkel’s government and other neo-liberal governments in Europe is not reducing debt anywhere but merely bringing recession, mass unemployment, fiscal and social injustice and rebellion to European streets.</p>
      <p sl="en">A financial transaction tax is indeed a very good beginning but it is not enough. We absolutely need to move towards fiscal harmonisation. Take the case of Portugal, where 19 out of the 20 top stock-exchange-listed companies have moved fiscal domicile into the Netherlands and Luxembourg, not just to avoid paying higher taxes at home but to skip declaring the proceeds of investment in other world markets. How can they compete in this fiscal jungle in the EU?</p>

What is the Council doing to call Hungary to account? There is a legal and constitutional crisis in Hungary which is a real threat to European values of liberal democracy.

Only six months remain for this to be done. Let us remind ourselves that a similar priority was found in the programmes of the Belgian, Hungarian and Polish Presidencies, not to mention the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="pl">All the citizens of the European Union have an interest in this objective being achieved at last. Looking however at the efforts of previous presidencies and the continued accumulation of economic problems we can be almost certain that the next presidency is going to have to include a similar priority in its agenda. The Danish Presidency is also going to tackle the budget for 2014-2020. So it is extremely important that it maintain the very important Cohesion Fund, thanks to which the Union’s new Member States from Central and Eastern Europe can develop. In the point about a green Europe, Denmark assumes, on the one hand, sustainable economic growth, and, on the other hand, still wants to push through EU climate packages. In the opinion of many experts, these two courses of action are mutually exclusive.</p>

      <p sl="da">I have just one point that I would like to put to the Prime Minister. It concerns Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which relates to good administration. Citizens in Europe have been granted the right to good administration, and this in fact concerns the institutions here. Therefore it is something that should be taken seriously. However, if we do not have any proper legislation on good administration, the Commission will not employ it of its own free will. I have many reasons to believe that. Only if there is a push from a country holding the Presidency that for a long time has put transparency and citizen participation at the top of the agenda, only if there is a push from us will Article 41 be converted into good administration and there will be a chance that the Commission will take seriously the clear right that is now embodied in the Charter.</p>

Of course, when it is presented like this, the equation can certainly not be proven, but it shows that we must work together to give our citizens a taste for business, a taste for entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this regard, I should like to welcome the European Commission’s proposal on social entrepreneurship. This is a sector which will eventually represent a turnover of EUR 100 billion within the European Union, and account for 3% to 7.5% of the EU workforce.

      <p sl="fr">During the last six months, Parliament adopted a report on the fight against poverty. All of us here today are aware that the phenomenon is becoming increasingly serious in Europe with the different austerity measures in place in various Member States, whereby the report stated that such measures cannot undermine employment and social protection.</p>

The report recommends – and I quote – ‘pressing ahead with, and providing increased funding for, European programmes which can contribute to various aspects of the fight against social exclusion and poverty’. How do you see this recommendation being implemented through negotiations on the future Multiannual Financial Framework?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the European Commission, leaders of the political groups, Honourable Members of this House, thank you very much for your remarks. It has been a real pleasure to take part in this lively debate that we have had today.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I take away from the debate today is a clear conviction that, yes, not all of us agree – I will come back to that – but also a solid and robust confirmation that we have support for the Danish Presidency programme and I thank you for that. We will do everything we can to live up to this support.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many topics have been raised. Time is limited, but allow me to address a few of the issues that you have raised. Mr Barroso and Mr Daul raised the question of the MFF. We will be very serious in dealing with this during the Danish Presidency. I can assure you that it will be a top priority for the Danish Presidency to get as far as we can in terms of the Multiannual Financial Framework. We will do that with the purpose of modernising our financial perspective and in such a way that we can use our common resources to create new jobs and new growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context let me also make a remark on the financial transaction tax, which has been raised by Mr Callanan and others. I want to raise this to avoid any misunderstandings. The Danish Presidency will handle this dossier in a loyal and professional manner and as an honest broker. I am tempted also to draw attention to the wider agenda of the Financial Regulation, which we will intend to strengthen in our Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many have raised the question of Hungary, namely Mr Verhofstadt, Ms Harms and Mr Moraes. As everyone knows, there is a debate on Hungary taking place in the plenary later this afternoon. Let me be brief: the Commission plays a vital role as a guardian of our Treaties. They have found grounds for initiating an infringement procedure on at least three counts against Hungary. We must, of course, take that very seriously.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are in full support of the way the Commission has handled this crisis. They have used what everyone is talking about today, the rules that we have, the Treaties and – let us be clear – the Community method. We are behind the Commission in this. All Member States are under the obligation to abide by our laws. That is an integral part of the way we do things in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many have addressed the debt crisis. The downgrading of a number of European Member States underlines the need for European answers in this crisis but, before everyone decides that this is a crisis of Europe, I would like to remind this House that the reason why we have a debt crisis in the European Union is because Member States have not watched their own budgets. This is at the core of why we have a problem. We need to focus on European solutions, but let us not forget that the reason why we have an economic crisis is because the Member States did not abide by our rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">This takes me to the downgrading of some of the Member States. Mr Verhofstadt referred to the wording and quoted, I believe, Standard and Poor’s. I have also noted what Standard and Poor’s are saying, because they were specifically referring to the lack of growth and employment perspectives in the European Member States when they downgraded the countries. What they said was not said by a Social Democrat or the European Left. Standard and Poor’s said that austerity also has to be followed up by growth initiatives.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">That brings me to the discussion about growth and employment. Many have touched upon that – Mr Swoboda, Ms Harms, Mr Søndergaard, Ms Turunen, Mr Bendtsen, Mr Johansson and many other speakers. Let me state very clearly that the European economies must consolidate. They need to do that and, for that reason, the Danish Presidency and Denmark will support the fiscal compact.</p>
      <p sl="en">But let me also be very clear that it is not enough to focus on consolidation alone. We have to give a push in the right direction to growth and employment. Young people all across Europe are expecting that from us. We need to create European jobs now. I agree with the speakers who have suggested we go back to one of the biggest successes that the European Union have had over the years: the single market. It is the internal market that has created growth and employment. That is why we want to finalise the work of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore the President of the European Council and I have agreed not to forget the issue of growth and employment. That is why we have agreed that at our meeting on 30 January 2012 we will emphasise this point and make sure that, not only do we discuss consolidation, but we also discuss growth and employment. This is what we want to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of you have mentioned the Energy Efficiency Directive. Mr Turmes mentioned this as rapporteur and I appreciate that. I can only repeat and stress to you that, if we want to see clear results on the green agenda, we must make haste. This is an opportunity. We have a European Parliament that wants to do that and we have a Presidency that wants to focus on that. Let us make it happen over the next six months. We can only do that if we all cooperate.</p>

      <p sl="en">I know that if citizens across Europe are listening to this debate, they will look at us and ask what is this Community method? What do they mean by the Community method? I will state today that it is still worth defending because what the Community method really means is that Europe is no longer ruled by the strongest, but that Europe is now ruled by law and democracy. Friends, that is worth defending.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">It is worth defending not only for the smaller Member States but for all of us. The Community method and European unity must be an overarching goal for our endeavour. With your help, dear former colleagues, friends, honourable Members of the European Parliament, let us make it happen, let us work together and let us produce some tangible, real results for our European citizens. I am convinced that we can do that. If we do, we will also create a path out of the European crisis to a more prosperous future.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would firstly like to congratulate Denmark on taking over the EU Presidency from Poland and to wish it great success. Indeed, a number of challenges await Denmark, which are particularly important for the future of the European Union. These include the practical implementation of the European project for a reinforced economic union and further negotiations on the EU’s new Multiannual Financial Framework (2014-2020). Pushing these negotiations forward will be a major challenge for Denmark. Given that 2012 is the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, I am delighted that Denmark intends to focus on increasing employment among older people. I welcome the fact that by discussing not just current but future employment problems, in its programme Denmark is talking not only about older people but also about the young and their preparation for future labour market needs. Particular attention is also paid to reducing early school leaving. It is nevertheless disappointing that the Presidency’s programme fails to mention issues of major importance to people such as the Maternity Leave and Anti-Discrimination Directives that have been deadlocked for over a year. I have already consulted the Danish Presidency about the future of both legal acts, and about when the Member States are planning to reach a common solution in order to adopt these important Directives as soon as possible, therefore it would be very interesting to hear what specific actions the Presidency intends to take regarding these two issues.</p>

That the Danish Government take their commitments during this period seriously is, I presume, fully understood.

      <p sl="pt">The role of the rotating presidency today is, in practice, very limited. Moreover, this has been one of the blows struck by the Treaty of Lisbon to the – never realised – principle of equality between the Member States of this EU. The programme of the Danish Presidency, as were the work of previous presidencies, is illustrative of who is in charge of the EU and determines its course: the Franco-German directorate, ever more dominated by Germany, which always acts in defence of its major companies and financial institutions. This is clear from reading this Presidency’s priorities, which include deepening the internal market by moving it into areas like public procurement, energy and knowledge, with the express intention of turning knowledge into a business; the deregulation and liberalisation of international trade; the participation of older people in the labour market; and, of course, so-called austerity, in relation to which quick implementation of the decisions included in so-called economic governance, the Euro Plus Pact, and the most recent intergovernmental treaty – which seeks to enshrine austerity in constitutions and constitutes a dangerous attack on democracy – are advocated. These are policies of continuing with what has brought us to economic and social disaster; the splashes of green and socialism that the new Danish Government of the Social Democrats is seeking to give the programme are not enough to conceal them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Looking at the text of the Danish Presidency programme, I think it will be of high quality and has the capacity to succeed. Denmark is giving up its role as chair of the euro area stabilisation negotiations. On the one hand, this is understandable—it is not a member of the monetary union. Modesty on the part of the Danish representatives may, however, be unnecessary. The situation in the euro area affects the whole of Europe, and a neutral moderator of the negotiations would certainly be no bad thing. We must accept the decision, however, and focus on equally important points such as the efforts to restore economic growth and create jobs. I must nevertheless say that I was not pleased by all of the points in the Presidency programme. Although the text of the programme does not mention the financial transaction tax, the Danish minister for the economy has already stated that she does not support the tax. This is an especially unfortunate decision. Now is the time to take an unambiguous position in the area of regulation of the financial sector. Now is the time to make it clear who is responsible for the crisis and who is avoiding contributing to its costs. If, in the Presidency programme, there is a chapter ‘Responsible Europe’ with a subheading ‘Strengthened financial regulation and supervision’ but such an important proposal is missing, then it does not seem to me to be particularly credible. Despite that, I will keep my fingers crossed that my Danish colleagues see through this difficult period for the EU with honour.</p>

However, seeing the energy with which your government is working, I am sure you will be able to complete it. At a time of crisis, Europe has to be dynamic and responsible. The decisions made at the European Council on 9 December 2011 must now be put into effect, to strengthen financial policy and secure economic stability in the Member States. We must continue efforts to create a more certain situation in financial markets, to strengthen competitiveness in the EU market and also to create a greener Europe which is safer for all its citizens.</p>

Substantive negotiations regarding the European Union’s budget for 2014–2020 will commence during the Danish Presidency. I expect the Presidency to achieve acceptable compromises and to involve the European Parliament in the preparation of decisions. I hope that Denmark will pay special attention to the implementation of the European Roma strategy and the evaluation of the reports submitted under that strategy. I trust that Denmark will support the Schengen membership of Bulgaria and Romania, and will carry on with the enlargement process.

Notwithstanding the extreme economic situation, I hope that by the end of the six-month term of the Presidency we will see a stronger Europe. The Danish Presidency deserves special praise for keeping a clear head during the attacks levelled at Hungary. In doing so it also demonstrated that it supports a fair debate based on facts. Indeed, the Presidency recognised that it is the European idea which suffers the most from this hysterical series of attacks against Hungary. With their campaign of baseless accusations all that the left-wing political forces achieve is a Europe-wide strengthening of radical parties. I would also like to comment on the Presidency’s energy programme. I noted with satisfaction that besides short-term crisis management measures the development of a green economy and the implementation of a single energy market continue to be among the most important objectives. I hope that based on Denmark’s experience and expertise we will see significant progress in both areas over the course of the Presidency. One of the most significant reports of these six months will concern the Energy Efficiency Directive. An early conclusion of this matter is in the interest of us all. However, true success will only be achieved if the Directive sets out solutions that work in real life as well. High-sounding objectives have thus far often turned out to be failures. This time we must therefore take concrete steps towards the achievement of our 20% energy efficiency target.</p>

Filling this post of extraordinary responsibility for the seventh time now, your country has exceptional experience in this field, which also represents a guarantee. As we know, Europe is going through a very difficult period, and it is perhaps more important than ever for the EU-27 that the new Presidency is successful. Reading through your programme I was satisfied to note that you intend to take your future measures with a view to ensuring a responsible, dynamic, green and safe Europe. I believe that these values serve the development of the entire European region. A more responsible economic policy, the preservation of economic stability, the enhancement of growth, job creation, a more efficient use of renewable energy sources, examination of the issues of asylum policy – and the list could go on – are all current and pressing matters these days. Allow me to also make a few remarks in my own field of expertise, which includes industry, research and energy. I have to agree with the position that we must work on creating a more effective internal energy policy which would result in intensified competition between supply companies, which in turn would reduce consumer prices. Furthermore, it is important for the EU to not be completely vulnerable to countries with immense raw material reserves. I am convinced that the key to Europe’s future success lies in research and development, the creation of new technologies, and their practical application. We must support all initiatives that serve the successful achievement of these goals.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Danish Presidency faces a hugely difficult task, which stems principally from the fact that the European Union still finds itself in a profound crisis. The crisis concerns not just the budgetary situation of the Member States, but is above all about the identity of the EU. We are facing a period in which the future of the united Europe will be decided. It is becoming increasingly evident that the new international agreement on strengthening economic union which is in preparation may lead not just to a deepening of the divide between the euro area and the other countries, but also to a weakening of the EU institutions. Therefore, the Danish Presidency should concentrate above all on defending the cohesion of the Union, its character as a community and the principles of solidarity. The fact that Copenhagen does not intend to adopt the common currency in the immediate future may be seen to be worrying. Furthermore, the previous government was a supporter of reducing the EU budget. However, I hope this will not affect the stance of our Danish friends. I am an optimist and I believe that during the Presidency they will be able to represent the interests of all the Member States. My optimism is based primarily on the memory of how superbly they coped with finalisation of the accession negotiations before what is known as the great enlargement. It seems, therefore, that at such a difficult moment the responsibility of holding the Presidency of the Council could not have fallen to a more suitable country. It is well known not only for its openness to the arguments of the other side and a culture of compromise, but also for its ability to make use of these qualities in practice.</p>

      <p sl="en">In the well-prepared presidency programme there is almost no reference to the regional policy. True, several items in the programme have regional dimension. However, one expects a vision of the increasing role of the EU macro regional strategies, such as the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR). The Polish presidency has been active on this issue and its input requires continuation. The EUSBSR is a unique opportunity to implement plans for stronger Europe, concretely in the Baltic Sea region which is a dynamic area and least affected by current euro crisis. We expect from the Danish presidency a clear agenda and better coordination of the EUSBSR projects presented by eight member states around the Baltic Sea. I welcome Danish emphasis on creating a genuine digital single market. To boost cross-border business making, especially in e-commerce, one has to reduce decisively legislative and administrative barriers. This is a must if the EU is serious about reviving its economies and restoring its competitiveness on global markets. Lastly, cyber security is not once mentioned in the Danish programme. One looks forward to concrete plans on strengthening cyber security which is still lagging dramatically behind the technical development of threats.</p>

      <p sl="ro">You have a great responsibility during these six months. You must achieve as much progress as possible on the negotiations on the budget and important common European policies. The normal way to draft a budget is to identify the needs, assess the possibilities and then distribute resources. I have noticed that a different approach was adopted during the last conciliation proceedings for the annual budgets: the resources were determined and then distributed in a fairly random manner. I have understood that your proposal for tackling these negotiations is to go round gathering views on the size of national contributions at the end of January and to come back again to the proposals for the budgetary chapters, including for European policies, only in the course of the month. Although we are going through a financial crisis at the moment, I believe that this approach is not beneficial to the EU. If this information is true, I ask you to return and conduct the negotiations on the budget and European policies (CAP, cohesion, transport and research) as quickly as possible, simultaneously and in close connection with each other. Please do not forget that the Commission’s proposals on own resources must also be discussed in parallel. A possible agreement on own resources would ease the tension on the size of the national contribution.</p>

Economic measures are essential to restoring citizens’ confidence in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, as a Romanian, I am going to mention a particular theme of the Presidency of the Council, specifically the Schengen system. As President Barroso also said, total respect for the right of free movement in the EU is a priority. Given the delays in making a decision, I call on Denmark to find a solution for admitting Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area this spring. The experts have reiterated their conclusions that both states have fulfilled all the technical criteria for accession.

      <p sl="de">Denmark, a country which is critical both of the euro and of Europe, is now taking the helm. At the EU Summit in December, Denmark was accused by the French President of being an outsider and a new, small Member State. It is clear that this Council Presidency, in the same way as its recent predecessors, will be overshadowed by the debt crisis. In this situation, healthy criticism of Europe may well be just the right approach to enable mediation between the euro countries and the non-euro countries and to allow the necessary steps, including the introduction of a core European monetary agreement, to be taken. We must hope that the scepticism shown by Denmark with regard to the removal of border controls when the Schengen Agreement was extended will result in the Commission not making the imposition of border controls more difficult without good reason and, therefore, not further restricting national sovereignty. When it comes to making the decision on Serbian accession status at the EU Summit in March, hopefully Denmark will abolish the double standards that have been in place until now and introduce fair treatment for Serbia. Ultimately, it is totally inappropriate for the EU to demand that Serbia recognises Kosovo when not all of its own Member States have done so. In addition, it is high time that the negotiations with Turkey on EU accession are turned into negotiations on a privileged partnership.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Food scarcity is a real problem. The trend for falling food prices has ended. The period of abundance is also over, and we are now faced with shortages. Many of the agricultural priorities are important and welcome. However, we need to find the most appropriate correlation between these objectives and the need to increase productivity. We cannot tinker with the stability of the population’s food supply.

Copenhagen has shown that economic survival without the euro is possible and that not all critics of the euro area are automatically enemies of Europe. Its opposition to Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area was a sovereign decision on behalf of its own population. The EU could benefit from this approach. However, what do we have to fear? As a non-member of the euro area, Copenhagen will not be able to do much about the euro crisis. Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy will continue to go it alone and to push through their own ideas. In addition, many people want to make more progress in the accession negotiations with Turkey.

      <p sl="ro">We are in obvious need of unity to ensure not only Europe’s economic future, but also the political viability of the European project. Secondly, as has been emphasised by representatives of the Danish Government on different occasions, Denmark regards the freedom of movement as one of the EU’s major achievements. The intention announced recently by the Danish authorities to work towards removing the political obstacles hampering Romania and Bulgaria from joining the Schengen area must be welcomed. I therefore hope that the Danish Presidency will give vital impetus to the expansion of the Schengen area and that this will apply as soon as possible with regard to Romania and Bulgaria.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The Danish Presidency promises to be a difficult time. It is already encountering challenges simply on account of the turbulent recession and economic crisis in Europe. During its Presidency, Denmark is keen to be seen as the prime mover in a greener future for European energy. This is an important issue. Unfortunately, Denmark will probably hit a reef early on during its maiden voyage. Policy and the public will inevitably set their sights on remedying the economic situation. Denmark, as a country with an opt-out from the euro, will be in an awkward situation when there are debates on subjects such as citizenship, defence policy or legal and internal affairs. Denmark is not involved in such discussions.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We left the year 2011 with no solution to the economic crisis. Furthermore, an even more serious political crisis started. A stable economic union now has to be established outside the EU, with no right of initiative on the part of the Commission or democratic control on the part of the European Parliament. There is nothing wrong with the programme for the Danish Presidency. Its four priorities for sustainable growth are aimed at a more responsible, more dynamic, greener and safer Europe.

However, we are also aware that as was the case with Poland, the fact that Denmark is not a member of the euro area may prove to be a hindrance. An equally important challenge facing the Danish Presidency is the need to agree key elements of the future budgetary framework for 2014-2020. There is no doubt that the negotiations will be very difficult. Our expectation is that Denmark will be able to find a compromise among the Member States which guarantees provision of funding at the appropriate level for every EU policy. I believe that the words being repeated by Danish politicians – a budget for the future – mean focussing the budget on meeting new challenges in particular areas, and not a radical redistribution or cuts. Personally, I am convinced that Denmark will manage to confront the challenges and fulfil the expectations we are placing in her. It should be reiterated that it was in fact during the Danish Presidency in the second half of 2002 that it was possible to complete the difficult accession negotiations with the group of 10 states of the New Europe, including Poland. I hope that today Denmark is capable of achieving similar successes in the area of budget negotiations and the fight against the debt crisis.</p>

The momentum of European integration must not dissipate because of existing problems, and in this regard, too, the ambitious programme of the Danish Presidency represents a significant message: Europe must continue to pay attention to the expansion of the single market and the promotion of sustainable growth. I wish the Danish Presidency all the best, and I hope that six months from now we will be able to discuss the progress made in the priority areas identified.</p>

      <p sl="en">A small country with big goals. This is one way of characterising the priorities of the Danish Presidency. Europe has considerable problems at present. Economic, ecological, demographic, employment and other problems. Responsibility of Member States for their economies and budgets is priority number one, but it is also crucial for the fulfilment of other priorities. At present, however, cooperation within the EU institutional triangle, that is to say the Commission, Parliament and the Council, must be a priority if we want to address the problems of the European Union. However, experience so far shows a mutual non-acceptance. Typically, the Commission and Parliament will agree, but the Council will say no, because the individual representatives of the Member States first defend their own national interests, and then common, Europe-wide interests. Denmark therefore faces a big challenge, to try to achieve what its predecessors have failed to. That is, the mutual respect and cooperation of all Member States and European institutions to the benefit of all citizens.</p>

      <p sl="el">I should like to wish Denmark good luck in its Presidency of the Council of the European Union at this turning point in its history and to welcome the commitment shown by the Danish Government to the European vision. Without doubt, the Presidency will have to deal with numerous challenges during its six months in office, the main one being to promote negotiations on the forthcoming Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2010, so that agreement can be reached by the end of 2012. During negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework, one important parameter will be to adopt the legislative package on cohesion policy post-2013, which will help to safeguard a more competitive EU, via more targeted investments, and will be based on solidarity between the Member States. We trust that, under the Danish Presidency, maximum progress will be made with these negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I should like to say that I am most satisfied that the Presidency has made civil protection one of the main parameters of a secure EU and I welcome the Presidency’s intention to hold talks in this direction to strengthen the capacity to deal with disasters and protect the vital infrastructures of the EU.</p>

First of all, the Danish Government is headed by a woman and, secondly, she is a member of the right party. Given that 2012 is the ‘European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations’, I welcome the initiative by the Danish Presidency to encourage older people to join the labour market. The call for increased gender equality will also have a positive impact on labour markets throughout Europe. This is something that is urgently needed, in particular in the light of the demographic change which is underway in Europe. The younger generation has also not been forgotten. The focus will be on young people who leave the education system too early. The European Parliament has shown what it can do in this respect. During the negotiations on the so-called six-pack, we ensured that collective bargaining autonomy was protected as part of all the measures involved. The European Parliament will take this approach in many areas in future. We finally need to solve the problem of fiscal policy. Also, the regulation of the financial markets must remain high on the agenda. The European Parliament will work together with the Danish Presidency under the leadership of the social democratic Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt to resolve these issues.</p>

However, I would like to draw the Danish Presidency’s attention to the fact that there are still obstacles hampering the progress of European integration which can be lifted immediately if there is political will from Member States. In this regard, I should stress that there are Member States maintaining barriers preventing the free movement of labour from Romania and Bulgaria, just as there is a single Member State blocking both countries’ entry into the Schengen area. I firmly believe that the Danish Presidency will take action to remove these obstacles hampering the progress of European integration.</p>

It is our duty to give today’s young people the chance to enjoy education and health-care systems of the same quality, as well as the opportunity to contribute to the development of society, just like previous generations. In many European states hospitals and schools are being closed, the employment rate has declined alarmingly, and people are anxious about their future. Being overly concerned with austerity measures, Member State governments have forgotten their obligations to their citizens. Nowadays, the main challenge we are facing is how to save Social Europe and kick-start the engine of economic growth and social development.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Danish Presidency, which began on 1 January and runs until 30 June, is founded on four premises: a responsible, dynamic, green and secure Europe. On the basis of these, the Danish Government is intending to solve the current economic crisis by working towards sustainable economic growth capable of creating jobs and wealth in the European continent; towards a Europe that is disciplined in financial terms, that exploits its full economic potential and that makes renewable energy central to the debate; towards a Europe that is, above all, safe for Europeans. We can make out on the horizon that its task will not be easy, but the ambition of this programme demonstrates the commitment of this Member State that, while it is not in the euro area, is emphasising its commitment to the future intergovernmental agreement, which is key if short-, medium- and long-term measures for combating the sovereign debt crisis are to be established. As such, in the committees of which I am member, I should like to emphasise the objective of continuing with the reforms to cohesion policy and the high priority given to the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 and, in the area of transport, the reference to the Connecting Europe Facility as an engine for realising a true single market.</p>

They are to be welcomed, because they show that despite the huge crisis in which the Union has found itself, Denmark is enthusiastic about its role. However, what has happened at the very beginning of the Danish Presidency is not to be welcomed, particularly Denmark’s role in the most important of current negotiations – the negotiations on the fiscal compact. The Presidency should look after the interest of the entire Union, and should oppose any kind of divisions within the Union which would be caused if the agreement of all the Member States were not secured. Therefore I think the Presidency should work for a fiscal compact which is as inclusive and as community-oriented as possible.</p>

The economic crisis, which we are still trying to overcome, has shown us that we cannot base European policy on stopgap solutions to our problems. Therefore it is crucial to accomplish the priorities of the Danish Presidency for a dynamic and responsible EU economy, and they should become permanent priorities for every successive presidency. Only by strengthening cooperation in a spirit of solidarity can we build a single, truly common, effective and innovative market, which will be able to maintain its global position not just for several years, but for several decades. However, this requires choosing a difficult route and setting ourselves ambitious political, economic and social objectives, which none of the Member States can achieve on their own. This enormous effort must be made at all levels, from the teaching and development of children and young people, through social organisations and businesses and all the people involved in their operation, to people and organisations working in the international arena, because only in this way can we be effective in working together to give permanent strength to the foundations of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sk">According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, citizens want the Union to tackle two problems in particular. The first is coordination of the economies of the individual Member States. Citizens feel threatened by the crisis and expect concerted action at European level. The Danish Presidency has set realistic goals in this area. Their ambition is to be consistent and implement the measures agreed by the Council and subsequently this Parliament. Citizens want coordination, however, not centralisation. That is why I warmly welcome the fact that the Danish Presidency of the Council rejects the introduction of a European tax on financial transactions. Citizens consider the second major priority to be tackling poverty and social exclusion. Here, Denmark could build on the results of the Hungarian Presidency in the social sphere and the promotion of solidarity between the generations. Improving conditions for the family, which forms the basic social network, should be one of the top priorities of European countries during a crisis. Paradoxically, however, it was during the European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations that the family ceased to be a political priority.</p>

      <p sl="pt">At a time when we are witnessing the entrenchment of the power of the Franco-German directorate, ever more dominated by Germany, in imposing polices on the European Union, the role of the rotating presidencies is fairly limited, and the Danish Presidency is no exception. It is so true that this presidency in no way breaks with the capitalist model of the European Union – as no other has done – that the priorities set out in its programme leave no room for doubt: deepening the internal market; the deregulation and liberalisation of international trade; the ‘stealth’ increase in the retirement age; the support for implementation of the decisions of so-called economic governance, the Euro Plus Pact, and the intergovernmental treaty; and, not to forget, what is called combating terrorism, with all the security measures that this concept entails. This is essentially a presidency that confirms the path of austerity and of withdrawing social, economic and political rights that the European Union has been imposing. Instead, the necessary path of breaking with capitalism in order to combat its crisis involves combating measures that increase exploitation and the accumulation of capital, the promotion of jobs with rights, trade rules based on complementarity rather than competitiveness, and the promotion of social rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank you and your predecessor and also the group chairs for the restraint that has been shown so far during the negotiations. It is obvious that some members of the Council have not taken a particularly friendly approach during all the phases. However, we have the impression, after the most recent session last Thursday and on the basis of what we have heard, that things could be moving in the right direction. Nevertheless, in the light of the previous period it is, of course, difficult for us to believe that this will be the case and, therefore, we are waiting for the next draft, which should be ready tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make it clear on behalf of my group and I believe also on behalf of the two Members who will be speaking next that this agreement is not our first choice. It would be better if everything had been included in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) from the start. My second point is that this agreement must not result in a divided Europe. For this reason, it must be drafted in such a way that the 26 countries that want to be involved can be involved. My third point is that the rights of the European Parliament and the European Union institutions must be protected and that any implementation which is transferred into legislation must follow the regulations of the TFEU and the ordinary legislative procedure, so that we do not end up with two legal bases within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, we must make it clear that austerity measures alone will not resolve the problems. Growth and structural change are needed as well. This is also the position of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to say that we must follow the rules in Protocol 1 of the Treaty concerning cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament. We have a joint obligation in this area which we must fulfil on the basis of common rules. As the agreement will rightly expire in five years at the latest and will be transferred into the TFEU – the position of the European Parliament on this has been accepted – we should ensure that there will be no new institutions which make this transfer process more difficult. The European Union institutions are the only valid ones. All the parties to the agreement which are in the euro, which want to join the euro and which will be joining the euro must be present at the Euro Summit. We do not want any divisions here. All 26 Member States must have the same rights. We want a unified Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Brok reminded us, this Parliament has adopted a critical approach to the new international agreement, which is reflected in the resolution we are about to approve.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have given the reasons for our criticism on several occasions. At an institutional level we believe that the tools provided by the treaties would have made it possible to avoid the damage of an intergovernmental agreement and to strengthen governance and budgetary discipline in the euro area whilst remaining within the legal framework of the EU. It is a paradox that even before the ink on the ‘six-pack’ has dried, some Member States already want to amend it by intergovernmental means, introducing some elements that they had not asked for before, indeed in some cases that they had actually opposed. This is a step backwards and not forwards along the road to fiscal union.</p>
      <p sl="it">On a political level we believe the economic slant of this agreement is dangerously unilateral, because without concrete measures to strengthen growth and solidarity the EU will not emerge from the crisis and the very objective of stability will not be achieved. We nevertheless felt that we had a duty to become active and constructively involved in limiting the damage to the edifice of the EU, defending the primacy of the Community method and Parliament’s prerogatives, and emphasising the necessity and urgency of shared management of sovereign debt.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is extremely significant from a political point of view that the four pro-European groups have defined a shared platform of amendments along these lines.</p>
      <p sl="it">Now we are waiting for the fourth draft of the agreement. It is clear that if not even the smallest points, on which there was agreement, are faithfully carried over into the text, Parliament will have recourse to all the tools at its disposal in order to oppose the agreement. However it is also clear that only a significant correction in approach, on an institutional and economic level, will be able to eliminate the reasons for our criticism and our determination to build a real European economic government based on the Community method and focusing on stability, growth and solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, what we are doing is a very dangerous exercise. We are working on this treaty and my fear is that it could be used in future by the Council and the Member States as a way of tackling a number of problems outside the acquis communautaire, outside the secondary legislation and outside the normal Treaty provisions. We agreed with the negotiators – and this is also reflected in today’s resolution – to limit everything as much as possible to the so-called ‘golden rule’. If we go beyond that then we are in fact destroying the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have three objectives. First of all there must be no double standards; we cannot accept that in the future in Europe. The Stability Pact is based on the Treaty and the secondary legislation, but the stability and growth policy is based on this treaty. This is unacceptable. There has to be one standard in the European Union and the eurozone, not two.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same applies to the excessive deficit procedure. In future, if we are not able to amend this treaty, there will be two types of excessive deficit procedure: one on the deficit criterion and another with other rules on the debt criterion. Again double standards, that is my big fear.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we have to have a binding provision in the treaty that this new treaty must comply with the provisions of existing treaties within at least five years, if possible within three. This must be a binding provision for the contracting parties.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, we have to secure the role of the European Parliament so that Parliament and the President of the Parliament are able to participate in euro summits. These are informal summits and, as such, Parliament must be represented at them. Having said that, I am not sure that if we improve the treaty we can back the treaty. That is another discussion and another decision which we will have to take in the coming weeks.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I should like to say two things about this treaty. Firstly, it is completely useless. We do not need this treaty. This is not a treaty; it is an intergovernmental agreement which is only there, according to those who invented it, to reassure the markets by demanding the integration into national constitutions of what is called the debt brake or the golden rule into national legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All of the markets tell us that they are not interested anyway. We are therefore in the middle of establishing an intergovernmental agreement which does not interest the markets today because they want a policy design of the European economy for tomorrow. This treaty will not guarantee this policy design.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are asking the Member States who sign this treaty to say, for example, that we need a road map for the Commission on a tax on financial transactions. We are asking for a road map on redemption funds, on Eurobonds. We will not have this in the treaty. In the opinion of our group, with this agreement – you see, I always say ‘treaty’ although it is an agreement –, we are wasting time by trying to improve something which is useless anyway. We are intelligent, we will improve it, but this is not the necessary response to the financial and economic crisis that Europe is currently experiencing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament needs to be clear. If it does not take legislative initiatives to ask that what needs to be done is done, it will not itself be doing what must be done to avert the crisis today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Not on all of what he said, obviously, but certainly the bit about the uselessness of this treaty because, while it might well succeed in solving the next crisis – and it may well have prevented this crisis if it had been part of the original Treaty on Monetary Union – it was not and is not going to do anything to solve the immediate difficulties. What is worse, if anything, is that the European Council diverted valuable political energy and resources away from facing the reality of the crisis. In the aftermath, what we have seen from many quarters is an attempt to make scapegoats out of those who neither caused the problem nor have the power to implement a solution. Perhaps this is in order to distract attention from the glaring failure of the summit.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also agree completely with the Finnish Foreign Minister who said earlier this week that this whole contract is at best unnecessary and at worse harmful, and that Finland has reason to oppose the entire treaty. Congratulations to him for speaking the truth for a change.</p>
      <p sl="en">But furthermore, let me say a word about the attacks that we have seen in this Parliament, and from the Commission, on the ratings agency. It is a little bit like blaming the weather forecasters for the rain in Brussels – and when the Commission announces that it intends not to tackle the problem but rather to regulate the way in which it is reported, then I know we really are in serious trouble!</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us speak plainly, because the recommended medicine for many of the eurozone members at the heart of the crisis will kill the patient long before it can possibly achieve a cure. They are being asked to make ultimately futile gestures, and not to pursue serious solutions, because their debts in many cases are simply unsustainable and their fundamental uncompetitiveness is not being addressed by any of these measures. The obligations of continued eurozone membership are strangling the prospects of economic growth for a generation.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the medium term they need substantial economic reform; in the short term, frankly, they need devaluation. The proponents of this treaty are, in my view, deluding themselves and attempting to delude the rest of us.</p>

It will probably succeed in getting in adopted. On the other hand, it will not succeed in achieving the goal of the treaty, namely to ensure stability with regard to the euro. It will certainly not succeed in overcoming the crisis that the EU is currently experiencing. This treaty will damage Europe. It is the wrong medicine and the wrong method. It is the wrong medicine because we will obviously not create growth and prosperity by making cuts and savings. It will merely lead to a deeper crisis and more unemployment. If you do not believe us when we say this, you can ask Standard &amp; Poor’s, for example. However, it is also the wrong method, because yet again it will increase integration in the EU without asking the people. Even the European Parliament has not had any real influence – even though we have been allowed to appoint three or four people to take part in the discussions. Ordinarily, we are the ones who, on paper, should represent the citizens of the EU.</p>

It is with regret that we find that the Heads of State or Government in the EU have chosen a different way.

      <p sl="en">But I must acknowledge that you have lost absolutely nothing when it comes to your powers of deception. No, that is still very much on course. It was Nick Clegg who gave us the clue – a man who, I suspect, is rather more popular here than he is back home these days. Clegg was asked whether there should be a referendum on the forthcoming treaty. He said there was no need for that because it was all going to be ‘folded into’ the existing treaties. I thought, ‘What the dickens is he talking about?’ Well, now I have learnt. Mr Cohn-Bendit made it clear: it is to be the ‘Community method’. It is to be legislation where you know you have a majority in this Parliament and you know, under qualified majority in the Council, you can get everything through.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why are you doing it this way? It is simple, is it not? – it is to avoid referendums. Because you know that if a treaty was put to Ireland and many other countries, the answer would be ‘no’. The peoples of Europe do not want this sado-monetarist package. The peoples of Europe, particularly in the case of the South, need to get out of the euro, to have devaluation and a chance to re-establish themselves again. You are denying them that chance and, by pushing the ‘Community method’, you are destroying democracy in Europe. I hope you are all very proud of yourselves.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, at the most recent summit on the crisis in the monetary union, the Heads of State or Government obviously agreed that the crisis represented an opportunity to turn the monetary union into what was allegedly intended by the founders of the euro when they introduced the common currency, in other words, a fiscal and economic union.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the precursor to this, the European semester, which involves Brussels monitoring the national budgets, is likely to degenerate very quickly into what is simply a bureaucratic method of planning that lacks any real content and merely pays lip service to the idea. In the light of the current crisis, it may be necessary to put in place strong leadership in Europe. However, this must not result in the Germans and the French taking control.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important that we comply with the EU Treaties. This means in particular that we must also protect the rights of the smaller Member States. They must not be crushed by the centralist juggernaut in Brussels and they must not be pushed to the wall by the large Member States in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead of constantly transferring authority to Brussels and moving ahead with EU centralisation, which has itself contributed to the debt crisis, we must finally learn the right lessons from the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead of more centralisation and more centralism, we need to return to an association of states with equal rights which can follow their own economic and budgetary policies. We must take a new approach and this is why we may have to put on the agenda the division of the euro area and the establishment of a core hard monetary union. Otherwise, we undoubtedly run the risk of the healthy national economies in the euro area being affected by the debt crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today we are discussing this international agreement as part – and only as a specific part – of a wide-ranging and comprehensive approach for stronger discipline, increased convergence and reinforced coordination and governance, particularly in the euro area. If we want to ensure the viability of our common currency, and if we want to prevent in future the kind of crisis Europe is experiencing today, this is fundamental.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also keep in mind that this agreement is an essential element of a larger package of action to respond to the sovereign debt crisis, including a strengthened and anticipated European Stability Mechanism, which is urgently needed for the stability and coherence of the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has always considered that these new norms should be enshrined in the current treaties, in the Lisbon Treaty. For the reasons you all know, because unanimity between all Member States was not possible, that could not happen. The Heads of State and Government therefore took the decision to proceed with this international agreement or, as some prefer to say, international treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission left no ambiguity about the priority being an agreement that respects a certain number of principles, namely: the primacy of European Union law, the necessity of democratic accountability, the importance of the European institutions and the need to integrate the agreement into the current European treaties. These principles are, I believe, shared by the European Parliament. The Parliament and Commission delegations to the negotiations are standing firmly together in defence of those principles. Working in close cooperation, our delegations to the negotiations are achieving important progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">First: together, we are firmly opposing attempts to develop new institutional set-ups. Instead, we have enshrined the principle that the European institutions will act on the basis of the EU Treaties, not as simple representatives of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second: together, we are rejecting drafting that could have established parallel intergovernmental coordination of economic policy outside the European Union framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third: together, we are insisting on language acknowledging the need for the European Union secondary legislation to implement key elements of the package agreed at the last European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourth: together, we are proposing to include a strong integration clause in the draft which requires that, within five years at the most, the necessary steps are taken to integrate the substance of the agreement into the legal framework of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, only last week the Commission was concerned by some choices made in the latest draft which could only lead to irritation and to division. As a result, at the meeting of the Working Group last Thursday, the Commission tabled amendments to ensure that the text is institutionally acceptable. They largely coincide with key points made by the delegates of this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are insisting, first, on a correct clause safeguarding primacy of EU law and its full application, in particular that of EU procedures whenever the adoption of secondary law is required.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, that the Member States express their readiness to support a Commission proposal that will strengthen the ‘six-pack’ by introducing, for euro area Member States, a new range of medium-term objectives in line with the limits of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, that the text reflects an adequate openness of euro summits to all Member States and recognises the position of the President of this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, that cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament must operate within the European Union Treaties in accordance with Protocol No 1, avoiding any impression that a number of competing assemblies at European level will emerge over time, thus weakening the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission delegation will continue to participate constructively but vigilantly in this process. We remain confident that reasonable solutions can be found. The principles we are defending are the principles of democracy and accountability. They are the principles on which the European Union is founded and they reflect the right and proper role of the institutions. They are the principles that insist on the integrity of the entire European Union and all its Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The euro area must be strengthened, yes, but not at the expense of the wider Union. The introduction of parallel structures would embed divisions that could jeopardise the Union and also jeopardise the single market and therefore the future viability of the euro itself. As we believe in the euro, and as we believe that the euro should be the currency of the whole European Union, we must not introduce new governance and structures that would lead to a split with Member States that intend to join it in the future. All Member States who agree with these principles should be associated with our position and I am very grateful to this House, and in particular to the European Parliament delegation, for its support in working for this common goal.</p>
      <p sl="en">This agreement, if these rules are respected, can be an important tool in building a solid stability and growth agenda based on the Europe 2020 strategy, and also on the road map presented by the Commission. Noting that, from a legal point of view, this is an intergovernmental agreement, I hope that all Member States understand that politically, for its successful ratification and implementation, it needs the support of the European institutions, namely the European Commission, the European Central Bank and of course this European Parliament.</p>

Yet, this agreement is aimed at creating a ‘Fiscal Stability Union’ both to reduce debt and to strengthen financial stability in the euro area. No longer able to live beyond their means, the Member States must bring their budgets into line as quickly as possible. Fiscal discipline is the golden rule. I am convinced that this agreement represents a decisive step in European integration, and I have therefore voted against this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this joint motion for a resolution, since, through it, the European Parliament is arguing with a single voice that EU law in its current form is sufficient to respond adequately to the economic crisis. This should be done on the basis of the Community method, since – it cannot be said often enough – the EU is a political project founded on common values, on strong common institutions and on respect for common rules, meaning that any agreement between the Member States should be based on solidarity. I would also stress the importance of leading role played by the national parliaments and the European Parliament in setting out and monitoring all the measures that have been adopted to combat the crisis, because that will mean we have economic governance that is better coordinated and more effective.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for this motion for a resolution because it sends out a strong signal from the European Parliament regarding the principles which must provide the basis for drawing up an international agreement on a Fiscal Stability Union. In order to ensure that this new treaty has a positive impact and helps strengthen economic governance, it is vital to avoid divisions within the European Union, both between Member States and between institutions. In this regard, I think that the provisions concerning the attendance of all the states party to the future agreement at Euro Summit meetings are of paramount importance. At the same time, I should point out the need to increase Parliament’s involvement in the aspects relating to European economic governance as a guarantee of democratic control in this area. I should mention that measures aimed at guaranteeing growth and competitiveness are vital to ensuring a genuine, lasting economic recovery. I too call on Europe’s leaders to assume their specific commitments in this area.</p>

    <intervention id="3-141-937" speaker_id="5956" name="Regina Bastos" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="pt">The current draft of the agreement has raised a number of questions about its effectiveness in the European Parliament. Firstly, the objectives pursued in this agreement could be achieved more effectively by using the Community method. Secondly, the Member States express their desire to increase fiscal discipline in this text, but the crisis will not be overcome with just measures in this area. There is a need to ensure that the governments of the Member States will adopt measures promoting economic recovery and competitiveness, and that they will table proposals for the creation of a bailout fund, for the issue of project bonds, for a financial transaction tax and for stability bonds.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would emphasise that this agreement should be compatible with EU legislation, and that democratic responsibility should also be respected by increasing the participation of the European Parliament and the national parliaments. For the above reasons, I voted for the European Parliament’s position on the draft international agreement on a Fiscal Stability Union that the Member States want to adopt following the European Council of December 2011.</p>

    <intervention id="3-142-000" speaker_id="4507" name="Bastiaan Belder" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="nl">I do not support the motion for a resolution on the draft agreement, because it refers to evolution towards an economic and budgetary union. While agreements are necessary to greatly increase the competitive ethos of weak Member States, talking of an economic and budgetary union is taking things a step further. In addition, the European Parliament has called for a roadmap for Eurobonds. I can support that even less. This reduces the incentive for budgetary discipline, because it allows countries in difficulty to continue financing themselves at too low an interest rate. In Greece, interest rates that are too low have contributed to an influx of money which has proved impossible to repay, because of a lack of competitive ethos. That is why I am not in favour of the Eurobond. Moreover, it would be very expensive for countries that are currently able to lend at a low rate because of their strong budgetary discipline.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Incidentally, I welcome the new agreement which is intended to help strengthen budgetary discipline. This is a step in the right direction, for two reasons: in their national laws, participating countries will commit themselves to balancing their budgets or producing a surplus and, eventually, the discipline will be tightened, thanks to a standard of 0.5% of gross domestic product for the budget deficit in the medium term.</p>

      <p sl="fr">What I would like to say today about the new treaty, which must from now on be called the intergovernmental treaty under negotiation, goes further than mere doubts. We do not need a new treaty, especially not this one. Let us use the one we have. Of course, we must concentrate on debt but we must go beyond budgetary austerity: in a previous resolution, Parliament asked for a road map including a plan for growth, investment and employment to be put in place. This is what we should work towards. Unfortunately, Parliament was not taken into consideration in these negotiations. What legitimacy would an agreement negotiated during this period of deep crisis for the EU have without full collaboration with the European Parliament and also the national parliaments?</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted against the joint motion for a resolution on the conclusions of the Council at the beginning of January because the essential vision of the text reflects a pro-European stance that embraces the Community method, which is, however, largely responsible for the current crisis. The Community method means a gradual and progressive centralisation of powers in Brussels; it means taking increasingly important and invasive decisions passing over people’s heads; and it means less democracy, given the composition of the Commission in particular, a non-elected body made up of high-level bureaucrats who every day take decisions affecting the lives of half a billion people in Europe. Today we do not need more Europe, we need a Europe that is more flexible, more democratic and closer to the people, exactly the opposite of what we read in this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The planned fiscal agreement (treaty) decided on at the last Council meeting comprises a mixture of proposals which attempt to resolve a crisis triggered by the lack of some of the measures proposed prior to its occurrence. Unfortunately, the provisions on containing public deficits are not strong enough to resolve the current crisis which is evident through an increased lack of confidence in the bonds issued by EU Member States. I think that this stalemate can only by overcome by measures for stimulating economic growth, targeted primarily at SMEs (for instance, by partially subsidising the interest levied on bank loans). An excessive public deficit must obviously be avoided. However, any new deviation is unrealistic, which makes me think what good these constraints are now.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Otherwise, I believe that Member States must retain total control over their tax rate and that competition between them in this area cannot be damaging, just as competition between companies benefits consumers. On the subject of a financial transaction tax, the example of Hungary speaks for itself regarding the impact: a fall in capital exposure to this country and a reduction in lending activity, which is also expected to be the impact across the whole EU, albeit perhaps at a slower rate than in Hungary’s case.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We all agree that urgent and bold measures need to be taken to tackle the economic and sovereign debt crisis largely caused by the euro area’s structural weaknesses. What is actually needed is sound governance of the euro area and a greater degree of budgetary discipline at Member State level. However, I am not aware whether, in its current form, the intergovernmental agreement addresses this essential requirement. I have some reservations regarding this new treaty which risks duplicating regulations and creating a split between the euro area and the remaining Member States without actually being needed at all. The structural deficit criterion of 0.5% of GDP can be included very well in the Stability and Growth Pact which is directly applicable in Member States. On the other hand, to ensure the democratic legitimacy of the decisions implementing the agreement’s provisions, the ideal solution would be for them to be adopted using the Community method, thereby remaining consistent with existing European law. Last but not least, I think that the provisions concerning fiscal union are vague at the moment and that too much emphasis is placed on austerity without offsetting this with some measures aimed at stimulating economic recovery and returning to economic growth, which is needed so much in order to defuse social tensions.</p>

I voted against today’s joint resolution by the political parties (Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance). Despite the fact that it expresses doubts about the need for the Treaty, the resolution avoids highlighting its basic drawbacks and criticising the policies being applied at European level. The ‘Treaty’ basically institutionalises austerity policies, reduces the quality of life for the majority of European citizens, increases inequalities between the Member States and creates a multi-speed Europe. Its main concern is fiscal prudence at any cost (for example wage, pension and benefit cuts), without in any way limiting the catastrophic profiteering of financial markets and credit rating agencies. Furthermore, the provisions of the ‘Treaty’ undermine the democratic rights of Europeans by minimising their facility to exercise an alternative economic and fiscal policy via their elected governments. The GUE/NGL Group highlighted the above issues and the need for extensive public consultation (for example referenda) on possible changes in an alternative motion for a resolution.</p>

This stance is a good demonstration of the relevance of the resolution’s content, as well as of the extreme importance of the issues tackled. This is, firstly, because of the importance given to absolute respect for democratic accountability by ‘strengthening the involvement of both the European Parliament and the national parliaments, at their respective levels, in all aspects of European economic coordination and governance’, as can be read in the resolution and, obviously, in the European Treaties. It is also, however, because of the focus given to ‘a Union of both stability and sustainable growth’; that is, it emphasises the need to promote, starting with the fiscal discipline that must be the indisputable foundation of the future agreement, measures whose purpose is growth that is sustainable over the long term. This will enable greater convergence between the Member States, make our economy more competitive and, obviously, create jobs. Finally, it is also because it introduces concrete measures, of which I would stress the issuing of project bonds, a financial transaction tax and a roadmap to stability.</p>

I therefore voted for this joint motion for a resolution and I hope the European Union, as guardian of the Treaties in the European Union, will do all it can to ensure that they are scrupulously observed and that they will contribute to the implementation of the Community method, so as to transform the monetary union into a true economic and fiscal union.</p>

The emphasis given to reservations about or disagreements with how the agreement was reached does not obscure the acceptance of its intolerable content.

      <p sl="sk">The European Union finds itself in what is probably the deepest crisis in its history. Under pressure from Germany, European leaders have agreed on a new treaty to tighten fiscal discipline in the euro area and deepen economic integration. These steps should help to solve the debt crisis. The form of the new treaty, agreed at the European summit, was vetoed by the United Kingdom, however, which sought concessions in exchange for supporting the changes to existing EU treaties. Bypassing the British veto, leading EU representatives, led by France and Germany, are promoting a new treaty outside the legal framework of the EU. The crisis in the monetary union is a result of macroeconomic imbalances. It was not caused by irresponsible management, and if we are insufficiently aware of this fact, then the recipes based on this logic will not work either, of course. France and Germany basically announced their own decision without consulting the standard methods or the other Member States. If the EU is to work on this principle, and if the Franco-German proposal is to be promoted from the institutional perspective, in my opinion in an absolutely undemocratic manner and contrary to the fundamental values of the Union, then the democratic legitimacy of the process is really questionable in this case. I firmly believe that if we sacrifice democracy in favour of the power games of the strongest European nations, it will literally be civilisation that loses.</p>

      <p sl="en">The ECR Group would like to express its support to the Member States involved in developing the intergovernmental treaty. The intergovernmental approach is one that we should fully support. It is right that democratically elected governments are free to enter into such agreements. We delude ourselves if we think that the European Parliament is the only institution with a democratic mandate. The community method that so many in the European Parliament adore is a time-consuming process and not one that is well suited to resolving the current crisis. The Parliament is not only wrong about the process of this agreement, but also the content. The introduction of a financial transaction tax will do nothing to solve the current crisis. Indeed, the Commission’s own impact assessment demonstrates that its introduction will make all our constituents poorer. The solution to this crisis is not, as many in this house believe, more Europe.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Though with varying degrees of intensity and using different arguments, everyone who spoke during the brief debate prior to the vote criticised the fiscal pact. This resolution’s main grievance lies with the European Parliament being ignored, and it also stresses Parliament’s concerns that the fiscal pact could serve as a basis for the creation of a ‘two-speed’ Europe, therefore seeing a necessity for all agreements over the next five years to be incorporated into EU law. According to the resolution, we need not only austerity measures, but also the promotion of economic growth, the levying of taxes on financial transactions, and bonds to alleviate the present shortage of funds. Personally I am missing from this draft, which has been recast several times now and still does not represent a final version, guarantees that would ensure that in the implementation of its measures the European Union will follow the EU method of decision-making which ensures democratic transparency and accountability. For these reasons I consider all points of this motion for a resolution important, and gave them my full support.</p>

The problem is not whether the new so-called ‘fiscal’ treaty is purely intergovernmental or whether it conforms to the Community method. It is another straightjacket for national policies, a new bar in the prison which the European Union is increasingly resembling. It is aimed at speeding up the process of keeping tabs on budgets, which already appears in the ‘six pack’, and sanctuarising it. Of course, it is also aimed at reassuring international finance, an objective which has become the be all and end all.</p>

      <p sl="en">At several recent summits, and again at the December European Council meeting, Member States have tried to address the present crisis with intergovernmental approaches, which merely patch-up the patient. Given the profound nature of Europe’s current difficulties, comprehensive, concerted action at EU level is the only real cure. Better involving national parliaments and the European Parliament in these decisions could also help to improve the democratic accountability of these decisions and improve their credibility for citizens. The specific policy proposals that emerged from the summit are also disappointing. While fiscal discipline is a necessary part of a stable and sustainable economy, it cannot alone bring about a return to growth. The EU should pursue a holistic response focusing on reforging a stronger, better-integrated European Single Market through the removal of the many remaining ‘gaps’, which would both offer consumers better protection and improve competitiveness, thus fostering growth and job creation.</p>

What is needed is to tackle the root causes of the crisis by calling neo-liberal policies into question; to denounce the restrictive austerity mechanism which will be applied to current and future governments of Member States and therefore to European citizens – thereby removing any possibility of budgetary choice for the future –; to underline the ultra-technocracy coming into play in the agreement, which will in fact widen the gap between the European institutions and European citizens and aggravate the European democratic crisis; and finally, to recall that the draft agreement will institutionalise a Europe of double standards, the Member States who are part of the agreement and those who are not.</p>

The legal status of the agreement within the framework of the existing system of EU law must be clearly defined. It is important to ensure that this agreement does not conflict with the EU Treaties, and it must be incorporated within the EU Treaties as quickly as possible, thus maintaining EU unity. Parallel institutions should not be created that might give rise to competition between the EU-27 and the Member States that will be parties to this intergovernmental agreement. In view of the fact that many EU Member States, when joining the EU, undertook to introduce the euro and have not yet done so, an opportunity should be provided for these states to choose when the agreement shall be binding upon them, either after they have fully joined the euro area or earlier. In implementing the European Commission’s proposals for eliminating excessive budget deficits the principle of a voluntary commitment to comply with them should be retained, and support for them should not be mandatory. Similarly, an accurate explanation is needed of the qualified majority of votes required to reject the Commission’s proposals.</p>

I reiterate the EP call to the Council that the agreement must be in conformity with EU law, in particular as regards the figures in the Stability and Growth Pact, following EU legal procedures and excluding any double standards. Democratic accountability must be guaranteed by strengthening the involvement of both the European Parliament and the national parliaments, at their respective levels, in all aspects of European economic coordination and governance. The most important concern is not to split the EU 27. The non-euro zone members need to participate in the meetings of 17.

This denial of democracy is even more intolerable as it puts the very future of the European project at stake, swapping European solidarity for calls for austerity from the European Central Bank and the Commission. The surveillance and sanctioning mechanisms provided for are a way of bringing States’ economic policy to heel, preventing them from restarting their economies through consumption and investment. The Union must, on the contrary, completely overhaul its economic foundations and move towards a new pact of social progress which puts human beings as its priority. A European Central Bank, at the service of the people, must be the instrument for this ambition by rewarding creators of wealth and public goods with investments in education, training, research, infrastructure and public services.</p>

The crisis is bigger than the euro. It is a crisis affecting the whole of the economic system on which the EU is based, and these proposals will not solve the fundamental problems with this system. At best they can simply defer the problems to sometime in the future. Growth-promoting measures based on borrowed money will result in a constant spiral of increased borrowing, increased interest payments and thus an even greater requirement for growth in order to pay the interest and create jobs.

Signing and ratifying the agreement in the form proposed will lead to the emergence of an alternative legal order, whose relation with European law in many areas remains undefined. Unresolved issues include those concerning the primacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the competences of the other European institutions. Another unresolved but important issue is the question of insufficient democratic legitimacy, because democratic legitimacy can be achieved only by greater involvement of the European Parliament and the national parliaments. From the point of view of economic governance, it should however be noted that most of the provisions of the proposed intergovernmental agreement can be put into effect more quickly and effectively by using the Community method and the Stability and Growth Pact, which was amended in December. The approach followed by the Community method also makes it possible for countries which are not part of the euro area to be included in the decision-making process, and this in turn allows the need for additional EU institutions to be avoided. In relation to this, notice should be taken of the European Parliament’s proposal that all parties to the agreement, including both present and future members of the euro area, should have the right to participate in Euro Group summits, because it should be remembered that the euro area does not operate on an opt-in basis, and the countries which do not belong to the euro area are the subject of what is only a temporary derogation.

      <p sl="fi">I am amazed at the efforts that are being made in the chambers and corridors of Brussels to modify the economic agreement that was so grandly launched at the summit in December. The agreement, however, is becoming totally meaningless as regards the current crisis. Its name has already been changed several times along the way.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I have to correct my fellow Member: Finland has not as yet adopted an official position on the economic agreement. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Tuomioja, and not Prime Minister Katainen, made his position known earlier in the week, and suggested that Finland should boycott the agreement. The biggest problem in Finland was seen to be that the agreement might clash with the constitution. Talks on the agreement, however, are still continuing. In the end, I do not believe that the United Kingdom will be the only Member State to remain outside the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is certainly not the content of the agreement that presents the greatest problem. The content is a very welcome addition to the rules on finance and budgetary discipline that were agreed back in the 1990s, rules which not even the biggest countries in the EU have been able to, bothered to or wanted to keep to. The problem is the bypassing of the parliamentary system. Europe’s only directly elected institution, the European Parliament, has been completely ignored in the attempts to find a solution to the economic crisis. In my opinion, the European Parliament should not be disregarded. Perhaps, after this, we will be able to concentrate on the issue itself, that is, remedying the current economic situation and restoring the confidence of the public and the markets.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. As our Co-Chairman, Mr Cohn-Bendit, stated during the debate, I feel that the proposed intergovernmental agreement has created more questions than it answers in terms of responding to the euro crisis. The agreement is useless and is not needed for the EU to be equipped with tools to deal with the financial and sovereign debt crises, as the drafting process for this agreement and the markets’ response have underlined. The draft agreement, with its one-dimensional focus on fiscal contraction, fails to deliver a convincing economic response to the immediate crisis. We will only draw a line under this crisis through a comprehensive response. This means accompanying measures on fiscal restraint with measures to guarantee the long-term economic viability of the euro area and its members. More specifically, it implies providing an effective firewall in the short-run and introducing eurobonds, a financial transaction tax and a meaningful sustainable growth and employment strategy as soon as possible.</p>

I find it inappropriate to criticise the efforts made by the German Chancellor and the French President to achieve genuine economic governance through an agreement that will lead to the rapid adoption of some courageous measures. Instead, we should welcome the fact that a political will is emerging within the countries of the euro area to go further and faster to integrate their economies and to put the Stability and Growth Pact into practice. We should nonetheless take care not to create a two-track legal system, and to make sure we bring on board the States that have not yet adopted the euro. Lastly, we must match this budgetary stability policy with a strong policy for sustainable growth and employment, to ensure that we do not get stuck in a downward spiral of recession. The Structural Funds will be a vital instrument from this point of view.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The agreement on a Fiscal Stability Union will give rise to parallel structures, which causes us concern on account of the problems that this could create, such as insufficient democratic control, legal uncertainty and a proliferation of supranational structures. Quick decisions taken over people’s heads without establishing a basis for them or debating them in Parliament or with the people will not relieve the crisis. Instead they will increase the gap between the people and their politicians. However, despite the fact that we agree with some of the criticism of the international agreement put forward in the resolution, we cannot support the resolution as a whole, as we cannot support the solutions that are proposed, such as closer economic convergence, stability bonds and a fiscal union. The crisis is bigger than the euro. It is a crisis affecting the whole of the economic system on which the EU is based, and these proposals will not solve the fundamental problems with this system. At best they can simply defer the problems to sometime in the future. Growth-promoting measures based on borrowed money will result in a constant spiral of increased borrowing, increased interest payments and thus an even greater requirement for growth in order to pay the interest and create jobs. This will inevitably lead to recurring crises and collapses, with the collapses having serious social consequences and the periods of economic growth causing increased consumption of resources. We are therefore abstaining from the vote.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We are conscious that the current economic situation in the euro area requires immediate action. Despite the fact that the fiscal compact contains many positive measures which impose financial discipline on participating countries, many doubts have also emerged over its operation. Firstly, we have to answer the question about how the compact will affect the transparency of decision-making processes in the Union, because under the terms of the compact a parallel system of cooperation is created, and the precise date of its incorporation into the Treaties is difficult to specify. Will this not weaken European Union integration? Secondly, critics point out that the fiscal compact duplicates many of the measures contained, for example, in the ‘six-pack’ and the Stability and Growth Pact. Will this fact not create confusion in the interpretation of certain acts of EU law? Thirdly, there is a risk that the compact will create divisions within the Union, the consequences of which are difficult to foresee. Very worrying aspects include plans not to allow participation in Eurosummit meetings by countries which have announced a desire to be part of the compact and which want to adopt the common currency. Fourthly, recent changes in the draft of the document lead to marginalisation of the role of the EU institutions. The European Commission is deprived of the possibility of lodging complaints about Member States to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which was always its area of responsibility, and the European Parliament’s participation in Eurosummit meetings is being greatly marginalised.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President! I find myself in agreement with much of the text, especially the references to the need for the 27 different states of the EU to work together to resolve this aspect of the financial crisis. The Government of my own Member State, the UK, has been uniquely unconstructive: achieving nothing other than undermining the efforts of the others to resolve a difficult situation.</p>

      <p sl="en">The draft IA is still being developed, and already there are moves from Member States to dilute the fiscal requirements identified at the December summit (including the so-called ‘golden rule’). For the Single Currency to work there needs to be strong economic and fiscal union between Eurozone (EZ) members. I am not yet convinced that the EZ states will finally agree to necessary strict controls, and I am glad the UK is not part of it. I believe it is in the UK’s best interests to have a strong and stable euro, given that 40% of our trade is with EZ countries. For that reason, and the fact it was the only option achievable at this stage, I supported the resolution.</p>

We regret that, so far, the draft international agreement of January 2012 does not reflect Parliament’s proposals expressed by the Members appointed by the Conference of Presidents to represent Parliament as part of an ad hoc working group. The agreement should also include a commitment from the contracting parties to measures aimed at increasing the employment rate, convergence and EU competitiveness. The EU is a political project, based on strong common values and institutions and on respect for common rules. This is why monetary union can evolve into a real economic and fiscal union only through the Community method. All the contracting parties to the agreement, Member States which are or will be part of the euro area, must enjoy the same right to attend euro area summit meetings. I call for the draft international agreement on a Fiscal Stability Union to be debated publicly in every Member State and for democratic accountability to be guaranteed by strengthening parliamentary involvement both at EU and national level in every aspect of European economic coordination and governance.</p>

However, this does not mean this is to take place at the cost of the unity of the Union and its institutions. Hence my support for Parliament’s proposal to implement a compact which supports EU legislation, a central role for the European Commission, the involvement of Parliament and, most important of all for Poland, full support for the participation in Eurosummit meetings of countries which still do not have the common currency.</p>

I believe that the proposed fiscal treaty is a step in the right direction, but we should not lower our guard. It is true that no treaty can stop the crisis. If EU legislation currently in force had been properly implemented and had been properly upheld, we would not need additional legislation or more stringent agreements. Our prospects nevertheless remain bleak. According to data from Business Monitor International, this year Lithuania’s public debt is expected to reach 43% of GDP (as compared to 15.6% in 2008). I really hope that non-euro area Member States will be able to participate in negotiations on equal terms. The majority of Lithuanians are sceptical about the introduction of the euro against the backdrop of the debt crisis, which threatens the survival of the euro area. A survey carried out last month showed that 49% of Lithuanians are against the introduction of the euro and just 43% are in favour of it. This long-term Treaty is not enough for Lithuanians. They also need specific and urgent measures for combating the crisis in the immediate future.</p>

However, I voted against this resolution because of the federalist nature of its proposals and its resolute yet ultimately futile attempts to push for an EU-wide financial transaction tax (FTT). This resolution calls for the use of the ‘Community method’ to create a fiscal and economic union. I am glad that the UK remains outside the eurozone. Giving up your national currency is bad enough, but I cannot imagine giving Brussels the power to scrutinise every penny the British Government spends. The financial crisis in Europe is serious; I cannot understand why Parliament is wasting its time in recommending an EU FTT. Taxation requires the unanimous approval of all 27 Member States and the UK has made it unambiguously clear that it will block such a tax as it would disproportionately affect my home constituency of London. The Commission’s own statistics reveal that the FTT would cost long-term growth in the EU EUR 220 billion with a 90 % decline in derivatives trading. Members of the European Parliament must dismount both their high horse and their hobbyhorse and realise that the FTT is a complete non-starter.</p>

I do not agree that Parliament should deny Member States the right to agree among themselves, as equal partners, on resolving pressing economic problems. If Europe is to overcome the crisis successfully, the Member States must regain the trust of the financial markets. The only proper way to regain trust is to take responsibility. Seeking other means, such as borrowing money for ineffective national and European projects, is precisely the type of thinking that led us into the crisis. It is a road to new public debts, a road to hell. I cannot therefore support a resolution that promotes the establishment of project bonds, the introduction of a financial transaction tax and stabilisation bonds. It is true that, if we are to overcome the crisis, it is not enough to reassess the level of well-being guaranteed by the State. It is necessary to create conditions that motivate the initiative of citizens, simplify their business and increase labour productivity. However, Europe is diverse and centralisation creates more problems than it solves. Even if we call it the ‘community method’.</p>

Firstly, the call in paragraph 5 of the resolution to introduce such measures as a Europe-wide financial transaction tax and so-called stability bonds conflicts with the political positions of the majority of EU Member States. Agreement at intergovernmental level on these items has not yet been reached. Secondly, the scepticism expressed in paragraph 1 of the resolution regarding an intergovernmental agreement as a form for achieving the EU’s fiscal goals is not justified. The Council decided upon an intergovernmental agreement (a fiscal compact) precisely in order to avoid the long and complicated procedure of amending the EU Treaties, which would run counter to the current main task of convincing the financial markets that the euro area and the EU as a whole is determined to resolve this enormous crisis with speed and certainty. Thirdly, I cannot support the call to use the Community method to transform monetary union into ‘true economic and fiscal union’, which the majority of Member States wishing to retain their sovereignty may find unacceptable. At the same time, I welcome the fact that the majority of Members supported the proposal by Mr Brok to include in the resolution a call to give all the EU Member States, not just those that have joined the euro area, the right to participate in all euro summits.</p>

Let me be absolutely clear: all EU Member States must comply with the rules of the Treaty.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">This goes for Hungary as it goes for any other Member State. If there are any doubts whether a Member State’s laws are in accordance with the EU rules, the Commission should examine and analyse the situation thoroughly. This is in the interest of all Member States, and that is exactly what the Commission has done in Hungary. Action is being taken.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Presidency fully supports the Commission’s role as the guardian of the Treaties. We appreciate the thorough analysis the Commission is undertaking. The concerns that have been raised about the recent developments in Hungary must be treated with the seriousness that the situation deserves. We all share a strong interest in Hungary living up to its application under EU law and, in the process for determining whether this is or is not the case, being fair and thorough.</p>
      <p sl="en">Rule of law cuts both ways. Member States’ compliance with EU law must be ensured, but the process must be based on a solid and fact-based analysis and there should be a dialogue with the Member State. We therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has issued its legal assessment of the Hungarian laws. It is on this basis that appropriate decisions and the next steps should be taken, in accordance with our rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has expressed a number of specific concerns and has taken steps to ensure that the Hungarian legislation is brought into accordance with EU law. Therefore, it has decided to launch infringement proceedings on three issues: the independence of the national central bank, the retirement age of judges, and the independence of the data protection authority. At the same time, it is sending a wider information request to the Hungarian authorities on the issue of the independence of the judiciary.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Presidency supports these actions. We of course expect Hungary, like any other Member State, to comply with the EU Treaties and laws and it goes without saying that the respect of EU law, including the Treaties and the values enshrined in the Treaties, is the basis on which the EU is founded. It is the duty of all Member States to act in accordance with these Treaties. I therefore expect that Hungary will meet the obligation it has accepted as a Member of the European Union, and I am aware that the Prime Minister of Hungary has sent a letter to the President of the Commission. I hope that this letter, and the work being done also in the debate today, will ensure that a solution is found to this very serious situation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Mr Minister representing the Council Presidency, Prime Minister, distinguished Members of the European Parliament, I very much welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate today on developments in Hungary and to present clearly the Commission’s approach and role in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an extremely sensitive matter, where I believe we have to be clear on values, firm on principles, fair on method and sensible on communication. The Commission has been closely monitoring developments related to the new Hungarian constitutional system since the beginning of 2011. We were in contact with the Hungarian authorities during the preparation of the draft ‘cardinal laws’ implementing the new Constitution – raising our concerns over the compatibility of these laws with European Union law. Similar concerns, among others, were raised by the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following an initial technical analysis, the Commission urged the authorities in Hungary to modify the draft laws. Unfortunately the Hungarian authorities did not take into account all the Commission requests. These concerns were then expressed at the highest political levels in December, through two letters from myself to Prime Minister Orbán and letters from Commission Vice-Presidents Rehn and Reding. Moreover, we made it clear that the issue of the independence of the national central bank needs to be addressed before we can start formal negotiations on the requested EU-IMF financial assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following adoption of the cardinal laws by the Hungarian Parliament on 30 December, the Commission immediately conducted a full and swift legal analysis of the final versions of these laws and their compatibility with the European Union treaties. Following this legal analysis, the Commission yesterday agreed to launch three infringement procedures. We have sent three letters of formal notice relating to the independence of the national central bank, the retirement age of judges and prosecutors and the Data Protection Supervisory Authority.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has also asked for further explanations concerning the independence of the judiciary. On this issue we expect additional clarifications by the Hungarian authorities. Should those clarifications not satisfy, or should they fail to provide a proper answer, the Commission will not hesitate in taking further action on this very important issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">These decisions reflect the special responsibility of the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, to provide a sound and thorough legal analysis, and its quasi-jurisdictional role in this respect. Moreover, these measures are part of a sustained and determined effort by the Commission to ensure full observance of European Union law by the Member States: the letter of the law and also, importantly, the spirit of the law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proceedings decided on yesterday by the Commission will be treated with the highest priority. At this stage, the issue for the Commission is mainly one of the application of European Union law, and we are doing everything in our power to pursue this in a consistent and objective way. However, I insist that we will not hesitate to take further steps if they are deemed appropriate, depending on the formal and substantive replies we receive from the Hungarian authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today I received a letter from Prime Minister Orbán, reacting to the three Commission decisions. He has indicated to me his intention to modify the relevant legislation and to work with the Commission in the coming days in order to find legal solutions to the issues raised. The Commission will continue its efforts with the Hungarian authorities to explore the various ways of complying with European Union law.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there may be issues at stake that go beyond the matters of European law that have been raised. These other issues should also, I believe, be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council of Europe is currently considering other points of Hungarian legislation which are under its remit. The Council of Europe’s Venice Commission could play an important role in this respect. Both Vice-President Reding and I have discussed this with Secretary-General Jagland, who has conveyed his full support for the approach the Commission has taken.</p>
      <p sl="en">This leads me to the more political dimension of this situation – something that we are also discussing today in this Parliament in its evident capacity as a political body. In fact, beyond the legal aspects, some concerns have been expressed regarding the quality of democracy in Hungary, its political culture, the relations between the government and the opposition, and those between the state and civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">I strongly appeal to the Hungarian authorities to respect the very principles of democracy and freedom and to implement them: not only in terms of norms but also in practice and in the political and social life of the country. These are matters where political judgment is more difficult, and sometimes – let us be honest – ideologically polarised. But I believe that all democratic political forces have an interest in working together for the consolidation of a Hungarian democracy.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will continue to call for the legislation in question to be modified and made compatible with European law. Above all we will continue to urge the Hungarian Government to act in a responsible democratic manner and in the best interests of all Hungarian citizens. In fact, yesterday, on a further matter which raised political issues, Vice-President Kroes again sent a letter to the Hungarian authorities expressing our concerns regarding media freedom. For it is only through a legally stable environment, based on the rule of law, democratic principles and fundamental rights, that the confidence of citizens, partners and investors can be gained and maintained. In times of economic crisis this is more vital than ever – apart from being, of course, a question of democratic principle.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important, I believe, that the message sent from this debate in the European Parliament to the Hungarian people is that we want Hungary to go on being a respected member of the European Union. This should be a debate not against Hungary but for Hungary and with Hungary. We are asking the Hungarian authorities to correct points that raise concern. We do not want a shadow of doubt on the democracy of any of our Member States.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">We have the highest regard for the Hungarian people: their history, their culture, their record of fighting a totalitarian regime as embodied in their struggle against Soviet troops in 1956. We therefore call on the Hungarian Government clearly to demonstrate its commitment to the principles of democracy, freedom and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to address these political concerns, and I appeal to Prime Minister Orbán to tackle this in a determined and unambiguous way. We believe this to be in the best interests of Hungary and of all our European family.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">I explained at the beginning of this debate that Prime Minister Orbán has asked to express his opinion here in the European Parliament on the statements that have just been made. I very much welcome the fact – and I also said this yesterday – that Mr Orbán sees this Parliament as the place where discussions are held on the situation in his country and on the relationship between his country and the EU. I am very grateful to you for this, Mr Orbán. I believe that the European Parliament is the place, as we will certainly soon see, where controversial debates on the policy of the European Union take place.

      <p sl="hu">Prime Minister of Hungary. − Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to be here among you once more, half a year after the end of the Hungarian Presidency. It is always a pleasure to address a parliament, because no matter what an institutional system is like, it is in parliament where democracy is at work, and it is the parliament that is the heart of democracy. I myself share this opinion, and that is why I have been a member of parliament since 1990. Thank you, President Schulz, for providing me the opportunity to be here today. I am grateful to the Danish Presidency, which did not object to, but was in fact in favour of my being here, and I would also like to thank President Barroso for his encouraging words.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I came here to you today because I had been informed that you were intending to discuss Hungary. I thought it appropriate to be at your disposal, so that you may learn firsthand about the intentions of the Hungarian Government. In the present situation, where there is already a tension due to the European economic crisis, the increased attention focused on Hungary justifies my presence.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Let me tell you that I am not surprised at the increased interest shown in Hungary. Our country has undergone a comprehensive, deep, magnificent and exciting reform over the past one and a half years. The reform was justified and urgent. In 2010 our country was on the verge of economic collapse. A country of 10 million people was supported by less than 3 million taxpayers. There were more people living off state funds than from the economy. There were no legal sanctions against the operations of paramilitary organisations. Our country stood at the brink of economic collapse and tragedy. We undertook an enormous amount of work in the past one and a half years, and we are proud of that work. Although we still have to face plenty of serious economic difficulties, for the first time Hungary’s budget can be considered stable and in compliance with European norms. We are in the process of reducing our sovereign debt, and our balance of payments is showing a long-term positive result. We have outlawed and eliminated paramilitary organisations, and as a result Hungary now offers protection to all minorities, including national minorities, the Roma, as well as Jewish minorities, and the Hungarian Government will continue to protect these minorities in the future.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Over a period of one and a half years we have enacted a new constitution, 25 cardinal laws and 339 other laws, which makes a total of 365 laws in one and a half years. We implemented structural reforms and reorganised the governmental system, the system of municipal governments, public administration, the justice system, education, health care, taxation and public contributions, the pension system and the social security system. We reorganised everything that was generating sovereign debt in Hungary. This naturally entailed the injury of interests, namely of lobby interests, business interests and the interests of major power groups in business. You need only think of the bank tax or the Hungarian crisis tax imposed on major corporations.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We were the last of the formerly occupied countries to enact a new constitution in place of the Communist one adopted in 1949. I would like to make it clear to you that the reform and reorganisation of Hungary took place on the basis of European values and principles. We drew upon both the good practices of the EU Member States and the fundamental documents of the European Union. Considering the extent and rate of the transformation I, together with everyone else in Hungary, consider it natural for disputes to emerge.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Today I sent a letter to President Barroso. In that letter I expressed my opinion that the issues raised by the Commission can be remedied in an easy, simple and swift manner. I anticipate quick results from our meeting scheduled for next week. At the same time I would like to inform Parliament that none of the passages which were sent to us by the Commission and with regard to which legal objections have been raised so far concern the Hungarian Constitution. Notwithstanding what newspapers publish, there has not been a single objection to the text of the Hungarian Constitution as adopted on 25 April. We adopted the constitution on 25 April last year. The Commission has raised objections regarding two of the temporary provisions related to the constitution, and I am at their disposal in order to remedy these two deficiencies, but I would like to point out that thus far no one has expressed any doubts of a legal nature in respect of any passage of the Hungarian Constitution. I am convinced that this is as it should be.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to you for allowing me to explain all this. I ask you to kindly continue to support in the future, in the spirit of European values, the major transformation and restructuring that we are in the process of completing in Hungary. Hungary is counting on the European Parliament’s support. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Prime Minister Orbán, in 2010 Hungary’s citizens entrusted you by a very large majority with the task of carrying out reforms. You then took the reins of a country that was in a poor state both economically and in terms of corruption. This was one of the reasons for your unprecedented success in the general election.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Hungarian people elected you with a clear mandate: to make a break from the political direction of the past, and to reform the country, as you have just said. This is what you undertook to do. Hungary was the last central and eastern European country to have kept its 1949 Stalinist constitution. The reform of the constitution was debated and adopted by the Hungarian Parliament, which also voted in the 30 ‘Cardinal Laws’. Criticisms were made over several of these laws, and doubts were raised as to their compatibility with European Union law. The only way to find out whether these criticisms and doubts are justified is to defer to the judgment of the European Commission, as guardian of the EU treaties. My group defers wholly to the Commission’s judgment, as it always does in situations of this nature.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yesterday, as President Barroso just mentioned, the Commission issued Hungary with formal notice to amend three areas of its constitutional reforms within one month. Yesterday also, the Hungarian authorities said they were prepared to address the Commission’s requests, and today, at his own initiative, the Prime Minister has proposed to answer questions from Members of this Parliament directly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, these are serious, weighty matters we are dealing with. We are talking about democracy, the rule of law, and Europe’s values. The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), at least in their capacity as the largest majority in this House, uphold the principles of freedom and democracy. Mr Orbán, I am sure, will prove to us that he also adheres to these principles and values.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the Council for its clear statement and also the Commission. Some of us will certainly be of the opinion that the Commission could play a more active role in evaluating the situation. However, I do not want to call that into question here. I am grateful to you for what you have said, Mr Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Orbán, this is not the first debate that we have held. You should not be surprised that we are discussing Hungary or, rather not Hungary, but what your government is doing. There have been complaints about some new laws, but these are important laws. They concern the independence of the data protection authority, the judiciary and the national central bank. This may even relate to the independence of the legal system as a whole. I am not intending simply to criticise the individual measures, but rather the spirit that lies behind them. You say that this is a reorganisation on the basis of European values. However, European values include democracy and changes of government. You want to prevent that from happening. You even want to continue exercising power in Hungary after a change of government. We are criticising the spirit that you represent.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Daul, I am deeply disappointed by your statement. You said nothing about the spirit behind these moves. After all, Mr Orbán is the Vice-President of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). You should finally take the initiative. You are in a better position even than the Commission to tell Mr Orbán what is right and what is wrong with his policy. It is time that you did this.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">What makes me particularly sad, Mr Orbán, is that, like me, you know many people who fought against National Socialism. They were imprisoned. Then they fought against communism. Now they are affected by your measures and they are saying: Why did we fight for freedom only to find that it is being taken away from us bit by bit? Mr Orbán, you must talk to these people. Listen to the people in Hungary if you do not want to listen to the Members of this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, President Buzek spoke about the great achievements of Václav Havel. Take Václav Havel as your example. He always fought against communism and in support of freedom.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Mr Orbán and the representatives of the Hungarian Government, I would like to thank you once again, also in my role as rapporteur for Croatia, for helping Croatia to join the European Union. However, you know as well as I do that Croatia with an Orbán government would not have been able to join the EU because it would not have met the criteria. You should at least make sure now, Mr Orbán, that Hungary fulfils the criteria.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all I have to tell you that I regret personally that this debate is a debate between the two sides of the House. If we have to discuss the basic values of the European Union, I do not think it is a good thing to have the type of reaction we have seen today.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have here a little document listing in total 30 breaches of the Treaty, fundamental questions and serious concerns in relation to Articles 2 and 4 of the Treaty. These breaches, questions and concerns relate to the new Hungarian Constitution, the independence of the Hungarian judiciary, the new media law, the independence of the data protection supervisor, the position of the Hungarian central bank, the new church law and a lot of other issues, as well as the ‘cardinal laws’ that have recently been published.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let there be no misunderstanding: I did not make this list myself. It is simply the summary of all the facts and all the complaints that you can find in official letters from official international authorities and official international organisations – the President of the Commission, the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the Venice Commission, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the US Secretary of State. I did not add to this list all the complaints from other organisations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, or from the civil society representatives who are protesting in the streets. It is only the summary of official letters from official organisations that have complained. So saying that there is no major problem today in Hungary astonishes me.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Yesterday the Commission launched infringement procedures in relation to three questions. Let us be clear, Mr Barroso: there is more at stake. The issues that have been tackled today are mainly technical ones, and I know there is also an important letter, which you mentioned, that raises other questions. What is necessary here is not a debate on technical issues, as we had at the beginning of the year. This is about checking the conformity of the constitution and cardinal laws with the European values that are enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty: democracy, the rule of law, freedom of religion, freedom of expression and so on.</p>
      <p sl="de">For all these reasons, besides the role that the Commission is playing with these infringement procedures, this House also has a responsibility under the Treaty to take action. That is why I am calling on all Members – not the right against the left or vice versa – in the Committee on Civil Rights, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) to draw up a report, based on Article 7(1) of the Treaty, stating ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – and it can be ‘no’ – on whether there exists a clear risk of a serious breach of our values. That is what we have to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">May I end with a personal message to you, Mr Orbán. Let us recognise, first of all, that you did a fantastic job in the past, together with so many other dissidents, in beating Communism and dictatorship, but I am afraid you are on the wrong path at the moment. Listen to what your comrades of the past are saying to you today. I shall repeat now an open letter sent to you a few days ago by your former colleagues, dissidents György Dalos, János Kenedi and György Konrád. They wrote to you that Hungary is an ‘example of what may happen wherever there is a concentration of crisis tendencies’ along with ‘authoritarian means and a policy of nationalistic isolation’. They end the letter by saying that it could be a good idea, Mr Orbán, to react sharply when someone wipes his shoes on liberal democracy, even if that someone is an old dissident …</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I must be dreaming, because apparently public opinion in the whole of Europe has a headache. According to all the European newspapers, both right- and left-wing, there is a problem in Hungary. Yet here, the Hungarian Prime Minister and this Parliament’s right wing are telling us that there is no problem in Hungary. We must be completely schizophrenic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me put this simply: the European Union is not a doormat for people to wipe their feet on. It is a shared home that we are building together, Mr Orbán. Yesterday, in Hungary you issued a press release in which you said, ‘I am going to go to Strasbourg to defend Hungary’s honour against attacks from the international and European left’. Let me tell you this: Hilary Clinton belongs to the European left; Angela Merkel belongs to the European left; Alain Juppé belongs to the European left; so welcome to the club! What is going on in this debate is purely for show, in my opinion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Orbán, you come here and you tell us that you have done all you can to change the constitution, which was a Stalinist constitution; and Mr Daul, your party’s spokesperson in this House, tells us that it was a Stalinist constitution. This means that this whole Parliament, including you and the whole lot of us, are utterly crazy, because we admitted a country with a Stalinist constitution into the European Union. You are completely crazy! It is not possible. How can you have done this? Shame on us!</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, Mr Orbán, at the time when you, together with your country and your party were about to become part of the European Union, I did not once hear the conservatives say, ‘wait until we change the Stalinist constitution before we go into the EU’. I never heard that. So why not stop this nonsense.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that the country is taking a new direction. However, when you say new direction, this could mean the right direction or the wrong direction. We are here to tell you that you are going in the direction of Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro, and all the other totalitarian and authoritarian governments of this world that we all fight against, together with you; only you are not strong enough to fight when it comes to Mr Orbán.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will give you three examples that affect me personally. The Mayor of Budapest, who belongs to the same party as Mr Orbán, has just appointed as a theatre director in Budapest a person who not only has contacts with the extreme right, but also a long history of antisemitism, and claims to be part of a group of Hungarian intellectuals of whom Viktor Orbán, when he was plain ‘Viktor’, said on leaving a theatre: ‘we will never support this intellectual’s nationalistic, antisemitic attitude in Hungary’. And now, these people are being brought back into the mainstream, with the Fidesz party’s approval.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If you disagree with me, let me suggest a very simple solution: let us follow Guy Verhofstadt’s suggestion and send a delegation via the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, under Article 7 of the Treaty, to find out why homeless people in Hungary are afraid; why intellectuals are afraid; why people from my family and other Jewish people I know in Hungary are afraid today; and why the spirit of your new constitution is that of a Hungary of the past, which frightens many Hungarian citizens. You may have a majority, but the minorities have the right to live in your country without fear, Mr Orbán. Therefore, if you are so sure of yourselves, and sure there are no problems with Hungary’s democracy, we should make use of Article 7, and see what kind of report comes back. If you are right, I will apologise; and if you are wrong, I will ask you to apologise to me, my conservative fellow Members, because if we are strong, we will even fight our own families if we have to, for the sake of freedom and democracy. It is easy to say that it is always other people, but when it is one’s own family that goes off the rails, it is the courage of those who fight for freedom that stands out, not that of collaborators.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, during the holiday period the attention of the international media turned towards Hungary with unprecedented vigour. Not only left-leaning but also respectable conservative papers were full of stories about Hungary. Sadly, all serious reports were negative. Hungary is suffering from a double crisis: an economic and fiscal crisis as a result of the government’s irrational and at times openly dishonest and destructive policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have a legal and political crisis as a result of the new basic law and a series of cardinal laws approved in a hurry. The Commission has realised that something has gone seriously wrong in Hungary, but I call the attention of the European institutions to the fact that it is not only the law on the Central Bank data protection and the judiciary which violates the common values and legal rules of the EU: the legislative frenzy last December resulted in a carpet-bombing of the rule of law and the system of checks and balances.</p>
      <p sl="en">All non-governmental state institutions have had their autonomy stripped away on a systematic basis. The new legal set-up has restricted the jurisdiction of the constitutional court, the ombudsmen and the competition office. It has emptied out the budget office and made a mockery of the court of auditors and media supervision.</p>
      <p sl="en">Leaders of all state institutions have been appointed by the ruling party and will stay in office well beyond the mandate of the present government. Their term in office is secured by cardinal laws. To add insult to injury, many laws were approved without the slightest chance for the parliamentary opposition to influence their content.</p>
      <p sl="en">Legislative drafts arrived at the last minute as individual initiatives inhibiting public debate and professional control. The old constitution, which was not a Stalinist one, was modified ten times in a period of one and a half years to avoid scrutiny. The first president of the constitutional court called this practice a destruction of the constitutional culture. The aim of this rampage was stated by the Prime Minister, who said in an interview last summer that he intends to tie the hands of the next ten governments.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a result of this legal carpet-bombing, Hungary may become ungovernable for a long time. German papers labelled the government as ‘Rechtskonservativ’. It is a mistake. This regime nationalised the mandatory private pension system, trampling the sanctity of private property underfoot. Having destroyed the trust of investors it was not able to reduce public debt; it wasted 10% of GDP and had nothing to show for it. Pain and suffering was inflicted upon the people without any reason and result. Depositors now take their savings to Austria in droves. Populist and nationalist policies damage the interests of Hungary.</p>
      <p sl="en">We true conservatives expect Europe to help us defend the rule of law and fight for the restoration of democratic institutions in Hungary. We know that it is our struggle and only the Hungarian people can bring about democratic change. Rest assured we will continue the fight.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I cannot quite believe the sitting we are having this afternoon. Is it really democracy, the rule of law and human rights that we are talking about?</p>
      <p sl="fr">A Prime Minister of a Member State has travelled here to provide some explanations. This is unusual enough to be a noteworthy event, and we would be delighted by it if we did not think that it would be exploited for purely domestic political ends.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What exactly are we talking about today? We are talking about a constitution that was rushed through in a few weeks by a government taking advantage of the huge majority it gained in the national parliament: a majority which everyone knows is artificial.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This constitution was passed in April last year and came into force on 1 January this year. In the meantime, over 300 laws have been passed, 30 of which are ‘Cardinal Laws’ dealing with matters of some importance, to say the least, from the point of view of so-called ‘EU values’. These are matters such as the independence of the judiciary, certainly Mr Barroso, but also the threat to freedom of expression and media pluralism; the definition of nationality; abandoning the republican structure of the State; compromising the separation of Church and State by parading so-called ‘Christian values’; promoting a very narrow view of the family; challenging the status of minority groups, especially homosexuals and Roma people, and freedom of the unions. It is a long list, and no doubt I have forgotten something. The European Parliament alerted the Commission in July last year, Mr Barroso, but we had to wait until December before you became concerned about what was happening in Hungary, only to announce that we should keep an eye on the independence of Hungary’s central bank. A fine demonstration of what EU values really are!</p>
      <p sl="fr">The proceedings that were initiated yesterday are therefore not sufficient to deal with the problem, any more than the answers coming out of Hungary are. Fascism is knocking at Europe’s doors once again, in the shape of nationalism and fear mongering, taking advantage of the social consequences of the economic and financial crisis, which the European institutions are daily proving incapable of handling. We should indeed remember the past: but the whole of the past. At least within this Chamber, let us not allow history to stare in disbelief. Let us really help supporters of democracy in Hungary. No-one is manipulating them, Prime Minister; they are simply daring to believe in values that, as Aung Sang Suu Kyi reminded us this week, are universal: the values of democracy and human rights.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in 1956, the movement for freedom and the national aspirations of Hungarians were brutally crushed by tanks from the Soviet Union. This happened only because the brave Hungarian people had the courage to claim their independent right to make decisions regarding their own internal affairs, to exercise their sovereignty and to run their own affairs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fortunately, those days are gone forever, but the fact that today the European Union is trying to use the institutions of the Union and financial pressure to restrict, once again, the free democratic choice of the Hungarian nation borders on a historical paradox. This time the Hungarian nation must defend its freedoms, its democratic elections and sovereignty in internal affairs against the attempts of transnational corporations that the European Commission represents in relation to Hungary. The issues of the constitution and free media legislation were only a pretext for attacking the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Orbán and his right-wing government, because they are rebuilding their country with courage after the terrible era of Communist governments and their post-Communist government heirs, because they have had the courage to impose taxes on banks and international corporations, because they had the courage to mention Christianity in their constitution, a beautiful national tradition, and the traditional concept of family, as opposed to left-wing political correctness, which shines in the salons of Europe. Please stand strong, Prime Minister, we are with you.</p>

No, it is not Hungary; it is you, dear ladies and gentlemen, the European Union itself. It is you who made all those decisions which resulted in mass unemployment, mass poverty and mass suffering across Europe.</p>

Who are you representing, ladies and gentlemen? Do your people in Greece, in Portugal and so on, the poor, the unemployed, want you to sit here for hours and hours and spend all the resources of the European Union on discussing the retirement age of Hungarian judges and the Hungarian data protection ombudsman, or would they want you to confess your sins?</p>
      <p sl="en">Instead of investigating Hungary’s issues of sovereignty and self-determination, why do you not investigate yourselves, your decisions?

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am addressing your chair, because for you democracy lasts only for as long as you proclaim your opinion in shrill tones, and when you should respond or listen to others, you leave the room. In that case I am happy to see that you are present, and I am happy that you can hear what I am saying, namely that on my own behalf, and on behalf of the Fidesz Party and Hungary, I protest against the allegation of anti-Semitism. Jews in Hungary do not live in fear. It was Viktor Orbán’s first government that introduced the Hungarian Holocaust Memorial Day, and yesterday we – he himself – launched the Wallenberg Year in Hungary. If the Jews have something to fear it is not Viktor Orbán, nor his Government. Hungary is a democracy and protects minorities. We strongly object to such insinuations.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, I am a European, a member of Fidesz, and a Hungarian democrat. I was a young lawyer when I began my fight for freedom against a dictatorial Communist regime. This freedom we did achieve. It is thanks to this that today Hungary is a European democracy. To this day Fidesz has always stood up for this freedom, no matter what you might say. Today Hungary is a democratic Member State of the European Union and abides by the EU’s rules. If the Commission says that Hungarian law is in conflict with EU law, we listen to its opinion and change the law. We demonstrated this over the recent period. In the case of the Hungarian media law we did so within a few weeks. We are disciplined, dedicated members of this Community and wish to remain so.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian people are astounded to read and hear what the foreign media have to say. They do not recognise their own country. We know that you, too, have read such reports. Recently a renowned French journalist who had written an article about Hungary was asked by a Hungarian television channel to describe how the article came to be. The journalist replied that he was not familiar with Hungary or the present situation, but had simply been given background material and had been asked to write an article. The article was naturally full of falsehoods and second-hand information.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the attacks against Hungary are an indication that there is a task we here in the European Parliament and in the European Union have failed to fulfil, namely to acquaint ourselves with each other. You do not know Hungary. The accusations that are largely published in newspapers and other media are untrue. We can provide evidence regarding every single point. We are at your disposal should you so need. You do not know us. You do not know that in 2006 the Socialist Government brutally assaulted peaceful commemorators with mounted police charges and rubber bullets aimed at their eyes, that in 2006 tens of thousands of people demanded before the Hungarian Parliament every day for weeks that the Socialist Government which had lied to their faces resign. You should, however, learn about the immense efforts Hungary is making. Viktor Orbán has already told you what these were. There has been a compete transformation of Hungarian public administration and the Hungarian state.</p>
      <p sl="hu">You claim to be Europeans and democrats. Europeans and democrats listen to others. They do not make a judgement before even conducting the investigation. This is what we are asking of you. Conduct the investigation. Become acquainted with us, and it will become clear to everyone that Hungary is a democracy where the rule of law is respected, and that Viktor Orbán’s Government has not weakened, but in fact reinforced it.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, as a Hungarian patriot and as a European I have felt ill at ease during today’s debate. The Orbán Government fully deserves the sharp criticism, but such criticism also casts a shadow over my country. I am aware that when the European Commission is trying to make the Hungarian Government see reason it by no means intends to offend or even less punish the Hungarian people, and this is the way it should be. Still, even though the Hungarian Government has taken some measures that go against European values I find it excessive for anyone to call Viktor Orbán a Hugo Chavez, a Putin of the Puszta or a dictator. It is true, unfortunately, that we can no longer call him a true democrat either, but even the Hungarian Prime Minister is entitled to personal dignity.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I ask President Schulz, President Barroso and the Danish Presidency to make it clear to Hungarian citizens that the EU is not dictating or issuing commands, that this is not Europe’s style. The European Union is not an external power; after all, we Hungarians are part of this Community as well. We, too, make up the Union. As with every family, in the European Union it is customary, or even a moral obligation, to warn a family member who has strayed from the right path. Such straying hurts the member concerned the most, but it also harms the Community as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="hu">If in Hungary people are worse off, can be stripped arbitrarily of their acquired rights and their pension entitlements, and if millions of workers are punished while the rich are rewarded by a tax system cemented by a two-thirds majority, then it is mainly Hungarian society that suffers. Indeed, it is the Orbán Government that is punishing the Hungarian people and not the European Union it condemns. It is first of all in the interest of Hungary and only secondly in the interest of the European Union for Hungary to be once again characterised by a genuine rule of law, true freedom of the press, a responsible economic policy that avoids state bankruptcy and a government that can be removed from office if it has lost the trust of the majority. As a responsible patriot I wish for Hungary to once again be democratic and economically prosperous, and to follow a system of values that is both national and European. This is in the common interest of both Hungarian and European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Article 7(1) must be seen as a normal procedure provided for by our own Treaty to defend EU fundamental principles, values and rights. The infringement procedure started by the Commission is based on certain EU directives and does not touch on Article 2 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The time has come for this Parliament, directly elected and representing the EU’s citizens, to prove it is capable of sending the right political message. We have received hundreds of messages from across Europe asking for just that. Let us be honest, no accession country would be allowed to join the European Union if the situation were similar to the one in Hungary today.</p>
      <p sl="en">To give just a few examples: the parliament has become an annex of the ruling party, which imposes the legislation it wants, not only for now but for the decades to come. A highly respected constitutional court has been transformed into a weightless body. The independence of the judiciary is under severe threat, as the right to appoint judges and to promote them belongs to only one person: the chief of the national judiciary office elected for nine years by a two-thirds majority of Parliament, which in fact means Fidesz. The written press is dominated by self-censorship through the huge fine systems, the audiovisual media is politically controlled and frequencies are conferred in an arbitrary fashion.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we add the decisions affecting the economic and financial system, we get a picture of a government which is doing its best to take absolute control of society as a whole. Fighting to secure full respect for fundamental rights and democracy in Hungary in fact means fighting to secure full respect for fundamental rights and democracy in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, a prime minister with a two thirds majority in his or her own parliament does not need to tinker with the constitution in order to achieve the results he or she wants. When one has such a large majority, there is no need to take the minority parties hostage, so that one can continue to rule from beyond the grave. Thus, a major question still remains about your motives. Why do you not just go down the normal route?</p>
      <p sl="nl">You will not be stopped from pursuing those motives by other countries. Nor will you actually be stopped by the Commission. As you, yourself, said, the likely outcome of an infringement procedure in which three issues are highlighted and in which another thirty-something are left until later – I would like to mention freedom of religion here – is that two or three things will be changed and then the infringement procedure will be discontinued, as we have witnessed in the case of the Media Act. Three amendments and then the Commission’s comments were withdrawn. Meanwhile, journalists are being stripped of their jobs and radio stations are losing their frequencies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would say to Prime Minister Orbán that, as with every human undertaking, his has its faults and deserves fair criticism, but a lot of what we have heard today was not criticism but a series of angry outbursts on the verge of hysteria. Some of the regulations my colleagues criticised Hungary for, concerning the central bank or the supreme court, exist also in my country, Poland, but to criticise them never crossed their minds. Why? Because they approve of the Polish Government, and they disapprove of the Hungarian Government purely for ideological reasons.</p>
      <p sl="en">When Hungary was ravaged by the Socialist government this Chamber shamefully kept silent. Why? Because of the disease of double standards. But there is also another disease: not to trust people. The people of Hungary are still supporting Mr Orbán’s government. Why do we not trust those people? After all, it is they, and not the EU, who are the real guardians of democracy. Prime Minister Orbán, I wish you and the Hungarian people every success.</p>

Our view is that this infringement must be stopped, preferably with new amendments in a positive direction by that country’s government which, as we have heard today, the Hungarian Government is willing to do, or with legal measures by the European Commission in line with the Treaties which make provision for compatibility between national laws and the European acquis.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I think that I am not the only one who does not like this spectacle of calling the Prime Minister of Hungary to account. I think that the founding fathers of Europe - Schuman, de Gasperi, Adenauer – must be turning in their graves today, as they see how the Europe of free nations which they created is turning into a super-bureaucracy that tries to interfere with national sovereignty. Strasbourg is not Canossa, Mr Orbán is not Henry IV and no explanations are required in relation to anybody.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Whom did Mr Orbán offend? He mainly offended big capital, because he had to rebuild a bankrupt country following half a century of Communist governments and their Socialist descendants, to put the country back on its feet. To this end, he taxed big capital. I refer to banks, telecommunications and energy companies, hypermarkets. For this, today he is facing a furious frontal media attack.</p>
      <p sl="pl">He faces the fury of the European Left, because instead of renouncing Christian values, he proudly included them in the Hungarian Constitution. In Hungary, marriage is between men and women, life is protected from conception, and the world finally makes sense. Hungary also faces the fury of Socialists, because Hungary holds Communist crimes to account today, and its constitution clearly states that Communism was tyranny.</p>

What should one think of the President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, who is now lecturing you on democratic rights, while, under his premiership in Belgium, one of the largest Flemish parties, the Flemish Bloc, was outlawed because of the political positions which it took? Nowhere else in the European Union has anything like that ever happened and yet nobody in the European Parliament or the Commission seems to have had a problem with it.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have principles in the European Union, including the independence of the judiciary and the central bank and fundamental democratic rights. If there are any doubts about these fundamental rights or principles, we need to discuss them. The right place for these discussions is here in the European Parliament. For this reason, I would like to emphasise specifically how grateful I am to Mr Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, for coming here. He was not invited. He said: I will take part in the discussion, because we have nothing to hide. I would like to emphasise too that Mr Orbán is here and is listening while many of those Members who were so hysterical and dramatic that they could hardly contain themselves have obviously already left the Chamber. He is still here and we should acknowledge that.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we leave the party politics to one side, the facts are quite simple: Europe has ground rules which apply to all of us. The job of the Commission is to ensure that everyone follows these rules and that is what it has done. The Hungarian Government has already promised on several occasions to deal with these problems and to make the necessary changes. These are the facts. If we could simply put aside the political hysteria, then we would be able to talk objectively about the situation. I have heard nothing new today from those on the left concerning the facts. Mr Swoboda stands up and says that the judiciary may be independent. Then I hear from Mr Orbán that there was absolutely no criticism of the constitution. Next Mr Verhofstadt says that this is not about individual legal details. It is about the fundamental question of whether Hungary is still democratic.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) stand for law and justice. If anyone has a criticism, they must substantiate it objectively and in terms of its content with regard to the judicial issues and not simply claim that someone has acted undemocratically.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we are experiencing in many areas is quite simply an arbitrary approach. If I do not like a specific aspect of the legislation in Hungary, I describe it as undemocratic, radical and right-wing or totalitarian. We in the PPE Group will not tolerate this.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, although some people may have lost sight of this fact, the European Union is about more than just markets and finances. More than anything, it represents values and principles. Similarly, the crisis that is reverberating throughout the European Union concerns not only the euro and its governance, but, also its values and principles, which are being threatened by the uncertainty and fear causing negative reactions against Europe and a resurgence of nationalism.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, Europe was not built on nationalist confrontation but, rather, on a supranational effort to subject all of the Member States to legally-binding legislation from which no Member State is immune.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why, when the European institutions express their concern regarding the Hungarian reforms they are acting on behalf not only of the 500 million Europeans represented in this Parliament, but also of the 10 million Hungarians represented in this Parliament with regard to their rights as European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is nothing against Hungary, certainly nothing against the Hungarian people, not even against the Hungarian Government, which was elected at the polls. There is, however, concern for the rights of Hungarians as European citizens, and a need for this Parliament to convey the message that democracy is not just majority rule, but it also concerns the protection of minorities. I refer not just to ethnic and religious minorities, but also to political minorities who have the right to rotation in government.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, democracy also includes an independent judiciary and the power of the Constitutional Court to control the laws made by legislative power; and a judiciary where the way in which cases are assigned is is determined by a judge established by law. Under no circumstances should there be political interference. Citizens should be guaranteed the right to privacy, with authorities who are independent from the government, and the right of information should be expressed through pluralism of information so that there may be a contrast between opinions and democratic principles may be properly developed.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that we in this House who are representing 500 million citizens have the right to hear the Hungarian Prime Minister make a commitment to reaffirm those values to which Hungary promised to adhere when it ratified the Treaties of the Union seven years ago.</p>

      <p sl="es">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, in one-minute or two-minute speeches there is not enough time to give details of which articles of a Constitution or a piece of legislation merit discussion, but what I believe I have understood from Mr Szájer’s speech is, precisely, that he is willing for the new Hungarian Constitution to be seriously examined. That is what I believe is in the initiative being discussed by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, that is, to bring Article 7 of the TEU into force, which would give us the opportunity to review whether the Hungarian Constitution really complies with the constituent principles of the Union and, if not, for Parliament to take a stand on the matter.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Orbán, I would like to make one thing clear straight away: Hungary is not Belarus, you are not Mr Chávez and it is possible to live a good life in Hungary. Nevertheless, we do have serious concerns. I am intending to link my criticisms to specific points, as Mr Weber has called on us to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">You said that no one had criticised the constitution. There are now 25 ‘cardinal laws’, which raise some issues to the level of the constitution because a two-thirds majority is required to change them again. One of these is the flat tax. I am a Liberal and I think a flat tax is an excellent idea. However, it is not acceptable to take a tax policy issue out of the political debate and include it in the constitution. This undermines and impairs the citizens’ democratic right to vote, to choose a different government at the next elections and to bring about comprehensive change. Tax law is a question which must stimulate central political debate and democratic disputes. This situation is unacceptable because it undermines democracy and that is why it is so serious.</p>
      <p sl="de">Incidentally, you have said, and this was the point which concerned the judicial system, that this is all about the independence of the judiciary and about facts. The Prime Minister has said that he has done everything possible to consolidate the budget. How can he then reduce the retirement age for around 300 judges from 70 to 62? That will cost the state a lot of money. Of course, new judges will have to be appointed to fill the vacancies. That is all well and good. We have our own ideas about who they will be. I think we understand that very well.</p>
      <p sl="de">A year ago we expressed our criticism of the media law. We were told that the pluralism of the media was not at risk. Now Klubrádió is being closed down. It has already been closed in Budapest and the frequencies are now being shut down in the countryside. Mr Orbán, you have said that you have written a letter to Mr Barroso in order to discuss the situation calmly and objectively. In the BILD newspaper today you explained that you are yielding to power.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I say to the Council, the Commission, Mr Orbán and colleagues – especially colleagues from the European People’s Party – that I am astonished, and even appalled, by the way the European People’s Party is dealing with this debate today.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know quite a few colleagues from the European People’s Party who are very critical of the authoritarian spirit that Mr Orbán and his Fidesz party have been installing in Hungary. There are people who are really afraid in that country, as Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit has said: be it Jews, be it critical journalists, be it artists, be it lesbians and gays, be it scientists, be it Roma people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why does not anyone in the European People’s Party speak out about that, if they see it as critical and are afraid of this violation of the European spirit, as Mr Barroso has said, and the violation of the common values which many of us – including Mr Orbán – fought for twenty years ago, before the Iron Curtain fell? Why does not any one of you tell Mr Orbán: ‘We are here to debate with you what you have to change in the constitution and the various laws to do away with this authoritarian spirit that so many people in Hungary are afraid of’? And not just the ideological Left; how about conductors like Mr Adam Fischer or cellists like András Schiff? Why do they not want to play again?</p>

If Mr Szájer were married to a man, the same thing would apply, but I know that is not possible in Hungary.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is about people who were founders of Fidesz – Mr Szájer, his wife, Mr Orbán and so many others. This is about what Mr Orbán is doing and the way that the chair of the justice authority has been appointed, like that of the media authority: they are all very close friends, very close allies, of Mr Orbán and of Fidesz.</p>

The new constitution excellently enshrines the values of marriage and life. Prime Minister Orbán is setting a new course, showing himself to be an EU realist and breaking with the communist past. That is all to the good, but Prime Minister Orbán should be careful not to fall into the same trap as his Communist predecessors, namely trying to exercise maximum hold over numerous sections of society. That would crush freedom and individual responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Because I, too, am concerned about the growing political influence on the Bank of Hungary. I, too, am concerned that politicians might start appointing hundreds of new judges. However, many of you in this House have reacted too hastily. The idea that we ought now to suspend Hungary’s membership is left-liberal nonsense, in my view. The preliminary procedure has now been initiated by the Commission. Let us wait and see and continue to debate this with Hungary. That is the way to handle this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr Orbán, today all the patriots among us feel Hungarian, feel proud to be Hungarian, and we envy your people for experiencing a new-found freedom after conquering it in the way that it did. Come and visit us in Padania, where you will receive a hero’s welcome, because we welcome those who defend their sovereignty. You will be welcomed as a Prime Minister who, unlike others such as our own Prime Minister, is not a servant to powerful lobbies, and perhaps this is why you do not have the favour of international finance, given that it seems to want to tie the financial hands of a free Hungary, denying it the support that is provided without question to every other country in difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe it is time to say that perhaps our peoples should be the ones to open infringement proceedings against those who, without a popular vote, have devolved their sovereignty to others, have abandoned their sovereignty, starting with monetary sovereignty, and I invite you to defend your country's monetary sovereignty. Those of us who have abandoned it anti-democratically and without consultation find ourselves in this fine financial situation. Courage, Mr Orbán, carry on along this route.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this debate is unprecedented. It is the first time we have debated infringement proceedings of this nature in this institution and in the presence of the highest European authorities, including no less than the Prime Minister of the country at the centre of the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">This unprecedented situation calls for us to assume our respective responsibilities, but also to respect each other’s institutional role. This means that we must respect the role of the Commission to start infringement proceedings and we must support it in its decisions. I would like to tell Mr Alvaro that we must also support the Commission if it decides not to start Article 7 proceedings. We must respect that too.</p>
      <p sl="en">This means that we must allow time for the matter to be discussed, and hopefully resolved, between the Commission and the Hungarian authorities, and the declaration of Prime Minister Orbán in this sense is very much to be welcomed. But it also means that we must distinguish between the legal process – the due process – and the public political debate. This House can very well express its political views, but this is not a tribunal and it should not replace the legal and judicial process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should therefore give time for the legal process to take place and hold back from jumping to conclusions until this process, led by the Commission, is completed. Further action on our part at this stage is not just premature, but could also do more harm than good because it would damage the respect that our institution enjoys with the Hungarian people as much as it would damage the image of Hungary.</p>
      <p sl="en">So let us support the Commission in its role as the guardian of the Treaties, let the Hungarian authorities rectify all laws that are found to be in breach of EU laws, but let us give the legal process time to run its course.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I for one am happy that Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is here today. Europe is about dialogue, and this is an opportunity for dialogue, even if Mr Orbán stated that he will only bow to power, and not to arguments. I do hope that he will still listen to arguments as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Communications at home are quite contradictory: on one hand, the Government asserts that only minor technical adjustments are necessary, and on the other hand, it claims that it is the lies of an international left-wing conspiracy against which it is up to the Prime Minister to defend Hungary. Hungary, however, does not need to be defended against this criticism, because it is not addressed at Hungary, but at you and your politics, which alienate our partners, isolate the country and worsen Hungary’s possibilities to assert its interests, thereby boosting the premium on our debt and weakening the forint.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Hungary acceded to the European Union voluntarily and not because it bowed before its power. It agreed with the EU’s values and with democracy. Democracy, social harmony, and a balanced framework for diversity, the peaceful resolution of naturally occurring conflicts and social unity – these are the things it wished for. This is exactly what is wrong with the basic law: it undermines the independence of the institutions that guarantee the peaceful resolution of social conflicts, and it is therefore not a minor mistake but an attempt on democracy to prematurely abolish the office of data protection ombudsman, to remove the impartial and critical President of the Supreme Court from office, and also to restrict the powers of the Constitutional Court, to stigmatise and criminalise the poor, and to exercise government control over the public media. Without democratic checks and balances we are at the risk of a social eruption.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Prime Minister, you may have a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian Parliament, but today 84% of people surveyed are of the opinion that things are awry in the country. Today’s debate is also a test of the independence of the public media in Hungary. Will they deliver a balanced report on this debate? I therefore ask Parliament’s media services to monitor the presentation of today’s debate in the Hungarian public media and to compare it with international media reactions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this debate is actually not about Hungary and it is certainly not about Mr Orbán. This is actually a test for Europe. This is a question that we have to put to ourselves. Are we willing to defend our common values when it really comes down to it, when those values are under pressure? Can the rules that we have laid down in the treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in European legislation, actually be enforced? That is the question that we have to answer here today.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Mr Verhofstadt, the leader of our Group, said, this is not about objections to single measures. It is about the accumulated impact of all those measures together, which justifies the activation of the Article 7 procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am actually quite surprised at the attitude of the EPP Group, because if it is true that all the allegations against the Hungarian Government are lies and invented by the media, then it should embrace the Article 7 procedure as an opportunity to prove them all wrong. I also hope – and here I am looking at the other side of the House – that we will get the support of the Socialist Group for the proposal of the Liberal Group and the Greens to use the Article 7 procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I think that this debate should not distract from the fact that there are violations in nearly all Member States of the European Union.

However, you are dependent on help from your European partners, whose correct criticisms you have only laughed at so far, and your neighbours, who, the speaker of Parliament, Lázsló Kövér, publicly says would best be dealt with by military force.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have not seen Mr Orbán’s government calling for an occupation of Wall Street in Budapest. What we are taking about is improving the governance of the central bank to achieve more transparency and accountability in cooperation with the government.</p>
      <p sl="en">The independence of banks should not be misinterpreted as inaccountability, especially in view of their role in recent financial bunga-bungas. We should not serve the corporate interest of bankers. The solidarity of democracy should prevail over the solidarity of banks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore I call for cooperation, not an arbitrary confrontation. One special point: in my country, Lithuania, the Eurosceptics always try to compare the unfortunate Soviet Union – which was no union – with our true union of democracies. We European politicians in Lithuania have consistently refused to accept any such mistaken parallel.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now it will not be easy to avoid comparisons with 22 years ago when Lithuania adapted her own independent constitution and was pressured by the Kremlin’s ultimatums to denounce it. There then followed political and economic sanctions, a blockade and finally bloodshed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission was ill advised in using the word ‘sanctions’ when addressing Hungary on its alleged serious infringements. Our suggestions to Hungary should not take the form of diktats from Commission experts, using Parliament as merely a tool to take action against disobedient Member States. This would create a very serious situation, more serious even than being forced to live under a Communist-era constitution for a considerable length of time.</p>

      <p sl="sl">I have read in detail a series of reports by prominent journalists' organisations and the facts are deeply troubling for the future of independent journalism in Hungary. Media legislation does not meet European standards on media freedom. Recent events should be the concern of every European citizen who believes in democracy, media freedom and fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="sl">How do you explain, Mr Orbán, that in the course of reallocating frequencies, the Media Council, which does not have a single member drawn from the opposition parties, revoked the licence of Klub Radio, one of the few remaining independent radio stations, and that this very council also sets extremely high financial penalties for the media?</p>
      <p sl="sl">How do you explain the Minister of the Interior’s recent threats to bring criminal charges against a journalist who published a concerning letter from President Barroso on a blog, claiming it is a breach of privacy, and that this journalist could even receive a lengthy prison sentence?</p>
      <p sl="sl">These facts may present an extremely serious threat to freedom of the media, creating fear and unease among journalists.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Since I have this information, it does not surprise me that today the Hungarian media have largely reported on yesterday's warnings from the Commission as if they were no big deal.

The laws you have passed contradict European values, and the Treaties. Your concept of democracy is nothing more than mathematics.

I strongly believe that it will demonstrate this again now with regard to the issues raised in the letter it received from the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In Hungary, just as in other countries, there is discontent; in this case, discontent surrounding the Orbán government, which has had to take tough economic measures that the Hungarian people has had to bear, in order to rectify the major economic imbalances left by the previous administration. I believe that other countries too would have done well to adopt some of these economic measures. I would give the temporary additional tax on banks as an example, a measure which has faced a huge barrage of criticism in the sector press and in other publications and columns. However, it is a just measure in relation to the irresponsible behaviour shown by banks not only in Hungary, but also in other countries, with regard to lending to the general public. Many of the difficulties which these economies are currently faced with are due to this reckless behaviour. I would like to wish the Orbán government every success.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to express my satisfaction at witnessing this House, which was elected by direct universal suffrage, debating political matters that are vital for solidarity within the European Union. However, at the same time, it is not a very promising sign that we are examining Hungary’s democratic system for the third time in less than a year. This calls into question not only the developments in Hungary and the wave of populism it is experiencing, but also the general state of some of our European democracies, where democratic debate is in trouble, when it is not over-simplified or biased.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nonetheless, it is crucial for us to ensure that all members taking part in the European project abide by our shared rules, especially considering that we do not fail to call to order a State that is not adhering to our sacrosanct budgetary rules, as is happening at present.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also unacceptable to dismiss the values that must be upheld before finding the golden key to unlock the door to the European Union, and to take it upon oneself to stop upholding them once admitted to the circle. The step taken by the Commission yesterday in initiating infringement proceedings, which in any event is part of its mandate as guardian of the Treaties, must be acknowledged. However, I think we must not content ourselves with simple adjustments to legal aspects, especially if we will soon have to revisit the Hungarian situation from the point of view of social matters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We know where Parliament and the Commission stand, therefore, but what about the Council? With a very few exceptions, there is a deafening silence coming from the Council also.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ultimately, my greatest hope, although I am not at all sure that this will happen, is that this debate will send a message to the Hungarian people that Europe, through the Members of the European Parliament today, at any rate, is aware of their difficulties and is not neglecting or forgetting them.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that the debate that we are listening to oscillates between a series of comments on the merits, which should be commended for their clarity – the Commission’s for example – and at the same time the Hungarian Government’s desire to go into detail not only in order to specify its own position but also to seek solutions together, and at the other end of the scale an ideological position that we are, unfortunately, used to hearing here, which in actual fact risks producing the opposite effect to the one it intends.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the last few days, following an ideological turn to the debate, we have in fact seen the European flag being burned in Hungary. This is a mere taste of what can happen when there is no perception of criticism and a desire to go into detail, but it can spark off populist reactions because it tends to divide those who have fought with good reasons, perhaps different from others’, but in any case for freedom, justice and democracy, from those who do not have a democratic approach.</p>
      <p sl="it">I now want to propose a very simple solution, which I will call the ‘Schulz solution', because I am referring to the words that you, Mr President, used in the meeting with our group. You said that attempting to cite Article 7 to criticise a government without looking at the issues in detail and simply accepting and listening to the responses of the government itself actually only produces the effect of making it stronger. You mentioned as an example what happened with the government that had Jörg Haider in the coalition in Austria a few years ago. I think your words were sensible.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, it is good that the Commission is now taking action, but a strictly legal analysis of individual laws is far from sufficient, because the problem is, essentially, not that EU legislation is being contravened; rather the problem is a political one. It boils down to the fact that the conservative Hungarian Government refuses to respect fundamental democratic ground rules.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The new laws threaten the independence of a whole series of democratic institutions, far more than those pointed out by the Commission. Social and human rights as well as the independence of the media are also under threat.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Today’s debate is not a left-leaning conspiracy against Hungary, which is what Mr Orbán is trying to turn it into. Instead, it is about fundamental democratic values that we should all apply right across Europe, including in Hungary. The Hungarian people deserve better than the autocratic behaviour that Mr Orbán’s government is demonstrating.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, the strongest pressure for change should be exerted by the governments of the other Member States. Unfortunately, these are almost all now conservative governments of the same ilk.

The elections prior to Mr Orbán’s victory elected a socialist prime minister whose name history has now forgotten; I myself do not even wish to remind you of it. He announced to his parliamentary group, to his citizens, to his co-citizens and to all his European partners that he had told clear lies throughout his election campaign. At that time, I never saw – as far as I know, though I should like to be corrected, if possible – the whole of the left in this House calling for a debate on the situation in the country during that period.</p>
      <p sl="pt">One thing is certain: Mr Orbán was not new to politics in last year’s elections. He has been in politics for more than 20 years and has already been prime minister before. When the Hungarian people give him a clear two-thirds majority it is because, essentially, they want reforms and it is these reforms that the prime minister is making at the moment.

This is a principle which lies at the heart of democratic systems and it is a tragedy that this is not happening.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact that we have to hold this debate today, and it is a good thing that we are doing so, is not just a result of the way in which the Hungarian Government is acting. It is also because the Council was not able in the past in the case of Hungary and in other situations to take up a clear position and to put the European values centre stage. It is also the fault of the European Commission, which has so far failed in its role as guardian of the Treaties. In the case of the independence of the judiciary, it is not about checking whether the change in the upper age limit for judges is in line with the anti-discrimination directive, instead we need to evaluate the entire package. Is the assumption justified that in future only members of a certain party will be represented in certain areas?</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that, in the current difficult situation and in order to overcome the major challenges which face us, we need all the Member States and all the citizens of the European Union. For this reason, we must focus on values and not on individual laws.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Prime Minister, Commissioner, much has been said here today about values, and I want to say something about Viktor Orbán and about history. I had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of Mr Orbán in 1989, when he was the leader of a student organisation and I was one of the leaders of a similar organisation in Poland. We met in Warsaw and talked not only about how to overthrow Communism; we talked about Europe and about the future, about our future in Europe. We talked about Mr Orbán’s dream that Hungary would become a European state. Hungary is a European state, and, in my opinion, Mr Orbán is a democrat and a European. He fought for human rights, and he fought for democracy, as opposed to some of his critics in Hungary, who built a totalitarian system. This should not be forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One message for President Cohn-Bendit, who is unfortunately leaving: we recognise your support of democracy in Eastern Europe. I hope that you have not forgotten what totalitarianism is. If you have forgotten, I suggest – I am sure Prime Minister Orbán will invite you to Hungary – that you spend one month in Hungary and one month with Mr Chávez. You will surely discover the difference.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, as the Danish Prime Minister said in her Presidency speech earlier today, the Union is based on fundamental values such as transparency, legal certainty and democracy. With these values we have united Europe and established peace in Europe. We have a particular duty to safeguard these values, especially at a time of crisis when they are placed under particular pressure.</p>
      <p sl="da">The developments in Hungary are very worrying at this time in particular. Nationalistic forces with Viktor Orbán at the forefront are threatening to undermine the foundation of the rule of law and break with the threefold division of power. I am therefore extremely pleased that the Commission is now taking Hungary to task over this. The Commission’s criticism is currently directed at the Hungarian Government’s supervision of the national bank, the judiciary and the data authorities. At a time when elsewhere in Europe we are raising the retirement age, Mr Orbán’s government intends to reduce the retirement age for judges – an initiative that critics regard as an attempt to tailor the composition of the Constitutional Court. We must not ignore the fact that there is also discrimination against minorities like the Roma and homosexuals either, nor must we forget the attempts by Mr Orbán’s government to control the press. What about women’s rights? I can assure Mr Orbán that I will keep an eye on the Hungarian abortion legislation in future after reading the new Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="da">A true democracy includes respect for minorities and allows room for a critical press and an active opposition. Many Hungarians are currently demonstrating against the government’s conduct and by no means approve of its policies. The many citizens who are fighting for democracy and legal certainty in Hungary deserve our solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been a Member of this House since 2004 and since then there have been on several occasions proven, actual and significant violations of fundamental freedoms here in the European Union, and these were not just rumours. We need only remember what has already been mentioned here, namely the events of the autumn of 2006 in Budapest, which the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg also deemed a serious violation of freedoms, and yet back then you were not so sensitive about freedoms because it was a Socialist government you would have needed to condemn. This is what I, together with an increasing number of people in Europe, call double standards, and in response to those who bring up the issue of compliance with the accession criteria, well, a great many old Member States would today fail to comply with those criteria, if for nothing else then for the lack of protection afforded by them to minorities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Twenty years after Hungary’s democratic transition we have finally reached a point where we can set our legal system right and make it European. This is demanded by the present economic situation, and to an even greater extent by the majority of Hungarians, because our fundamental laws were unable to undergo renewal even in a period of 20 years. For all that time judicial decisions took years to be delivered, hundreds of pseudo-churches unrightfully received state subsidies, minorities lacked parliamentary representation, and votes did not carry equal weight due to disproportionalities between electoral districts. You do not agree with some of these legislative provisions and the Commission is expecting amendments on certain points. This is understandable as this is their job, as long as the opinions are based on facts; however, what is not acceptable is that you make judgements on the basis of an unfounded press campaign and press rumours, mention words such as dictatorship and call into question the free democratic rights of Hungarian voters.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I have asked my fellow Members how many of them have actually read the constitution and the laws under discussion, and in every case they replied that they know them and have read about them only from press rumours.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, when we talk about defending European values, left-wing and right-wing do not come into these matters. This is why I am surprised at my colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) who are defending their party position without putting forward too many arguments, rather than the objective European position. The events taking place in Hungary are obviously at odds with European values, but the problem is even bigger than this.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Other countries, such as Romania and Bulgaria, have similar processes which are perhaps not as extreme, but also do exist. As a result of this, the measures which will be adopted by both the European Commission and European Parliament will be of paramount importance in indicating to anyone wishing to follow this path that this option is not possible.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Many examples on this point can be given. The last presidential and local authority elections held in Bulgaria were an example of how democratic elections should not be run. This observation appears in the report from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. It is a fact that the media in Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania are dependent on their governments. It is also a fact in Bulgaria that absolute party pressure is exerted on independent regulators, where staff at all the independent institutions were obliged to submit their resignation and be replaced by faithful party officials.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Pressure is exerted on the judicial system in these countries as an everyday occurrence. Investors are abandoning these countries not due to the economic risk, but rather to the political risk. These are issues which must be examined in the European Union. They have come about specifically because they conflict with European values. The fact something is legal does not mean that it is just.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Many governments have gone down the legal route and applied repressive measures, including in Bulgaria’s history. This is why measures must be adopted by both the Commission and Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="it">I have been a member of this Parliament for several years, and I challenge anyone to find a precedent to a debate such as this, where two opposing factions are railing against a country. I think that this could constitute a dangerous precedent. I say this to you, Mr President, as yesterday you made a fine speech in which you guaranteed Parliament’s independence and purpose.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are committing an outrage against a country’s sovereignty, because the process of European integration is a delicate, judicial and institutional issue in which sovereignty has to merge with a supranational element, and this sovereignty achieved for freedom – and we have all recognised the achievement of Mr Orbán and his country in winning this deserved place in Europe – has not, as Mr Szájer rightly said, allowed us to listen to each other.</p>
      <p sl="it">There have been invectives against a country relating to generic and sketchy issues, and to information from the media, some of which, to tell the truth, I did not know about. Mr Orbán has said that there is a constitution, and transitional and provisional laws that will lead to a result which will be difficult but is the one naturally hoped for, because the past, the battles and lack of freedom the country has suffered have put a lot of pressure on civil society, the political forces, democracy, the government and the parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore I believe that we must do justice to this and take into account the fact that, as has been said, the Commission must guarantee the Treaties. The Commission therefore …</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I have listened carefully to the explanations provided by Prime Minister Orbán about the economic and fiscal crisis Hungary is facing. However, this economic crisis cannot be used as an excuse for stirring populism which is detrimental to European democracy because it is precisely this populism which provides the basis on which regimes are formed with obvious discretionary traits.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the case of Hungary, we have expressed on more than one occasion in this House our concern about the restrictions imposed on press freedoms, state institutions, the political opposition and on citizens’ rights. I would like to tell you, Prime Minister, that your extremist rhetoric also poses a threat to stability in the region due to the implications for ethnic coexistence in the neighbouring countries. I would welcome it if Prime Minister Orbán would tell us here today to what extent he approves of and encourages the demands for autonomy which come enthusiastically from members of the political group he belongs to, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). We have strived for the last 20 years to join the European Union and create stability in the region. I believe that you, Prime Minister, must continue this work and not reward and offer a platform to those who promote ethnic hatred, because our region, Prime Minister Orbán, cannot be allowed to become the powder keg of Europe again.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is the sixth day that mass demonstrations are taking place in dozens of Romanian cities, with thousands of citizens demanding the resignation of the president and of an incompetent, provocative government which repeatedly displays signs of antidemocratic abuse, taking advantage of the European Union’s guilty passive stance.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am grateful that Mr Orbán is here today and that he recognises this Parliament as being a forum for debates of this kind. This makes him to a certain extent a trendsetter and we should use this as an opportunity to invite the governments involved in future treaty infringement proceedings to take part in discussions. This does not have to be in plenary; it could also be in the relevant committee.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am pleased that here we have a government which is open to criticism and which has promised to make changes to rectify the issues that have been identified as being incompatible with the acquis communautaire. It has already done this in the case of the media law. I think it is also important for us to remember how this government’s predecessors behaved. I recall, as other Members may do, the famous pack-of-lies speech made by Mr Gyurcsány. This makes it clear why the response was a two-thirds majority in the elections. Because the people who moved in these circles, as far as I am aware, were always very elegant and eloquent in handling our media and spoke several languages, they were also able to convey a picture of the country which, in my opinion, was a distortion of reality.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the three points, I have a question for the Commission concerning the national bank: When does it become a legal requirement for the central bank to be independent? I thought that had to be the case when a country joined the euro area. This implies that there is no obligation beforehand. Therefore, it is a political question as to whether or not a few structural changes are made on the way to joining. My specific question is therefore as follows: When does this obligation begin?</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, as far as the independence of the data protection ombudsman is concerned, I would like to ask the Hungarian Government to compare its rules with those of other European countries. Institutional independence is an important value and this also involves only being able to replace the head of the institution in an exceptional situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I do not have any detailed information about the government’s intentions in reducing the retirement age from 70 to 62. However, I am certain about one thing and that is that a left-wing government with the same intentions would have celebrated this measure as a major socio-political feat and as a means of making way for the younger generation.</p>

The so-called ‘radical’ reforms implemented by the Orbán government are an act of provocation against European values and the Treaties on which a united Europe is based.</p>
      <p sl="bg">‘Orbán’ politics is testing the desire to combat authoritarianism, xenophobia, populism and the suspension of democracy. This model is not unique to Hungary. Apart from everything we have heard about Hungary, we have election rigging in Bulgaria in favour of the ruling party, brutal police tactics in Romania, the Roma in France or media freedom in Italy. This is the fault of Europe’s institutions.</p>
      <p sl="bg">If the European Commission had not been satisfied merely with cosmetic recommendations on the media law in Hungary, it would not be composing a second letter today in defence of their independence.

      <p sl="fr">Having read all that, I get the feeling there are two ways of looking at things. However, what is clear is that, as the guardian of the Treaties, how the Commission sees things will prevail in a debate like this. I also note that, in recent days and weeks, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Orbán, and other representatives of Hungary have said that they are ready and willing to comply with the Commission’s verdict and to take part in the infringement proceedings. Objectively speaking, that is what is at stake, and not much else.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the rest, people are behaving as if something very sinister and terrible was going on in Hungary. Why? Because of some appointment or another that might become Central Bank policy. Is this really a massive violation of the human rights of the entire Hungarian population? Although in this case highly political, does the appointment of the data protection supervisor really equate to a violation of human rights of millions of Hungarians? I do not think so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If there is reason to believe that such problems exist, we need to take a closer look at matters. That is what the Commission is doing. The Commission will tell us what its findings are and we will act accordingly, working alongside it more likely than not.

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, reading the European papers in the past few weeks one could have been under the impression that even the bad weather was the fault of the Hungarian Government, not to mention the economic crisis. Today, however, we finally had the chance to continue the heated debate about Hungary on a democratic footing. Yesterday the Commission specified the three subjects in respect of which it expects the Hungarian Government’s cooperation in legal form as well. In response the Hungarian Prime Minister, demonstrating his commitment to democracy, came here to respond personally to the questions raised. It was up to us, to Parliament, to grow up to this task and to provide a framework and control for this dialogue. Today we therefore had the opportunity to conduct a debate that was about factually based arguments instead of seeking to induce hysteria. However, we seem to have missed this opportunity. Today it was demonstrated that many left-wing Members are more interested in continuing a campaign of accusations reminiscent of show trials than in a rational resolution of disputed matters. Today it once again became clear that the left-wing would rather strew false accusations all over this House than go through the trouble of learning the facts. Today it became apparent that many left-wing Members still hope that the democratic decision made by two-thirds of the Hungarian voters can be overruled in Brussels or in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the left-wing is attacking Hungary’s sovereignty and the popular government of the country, but we would do well to remember that in doing so they do the most damage to the common European idea. The left-wing hopes that it has found a Europe-wide model to weaken the popular model and that it can profit from this, but it is once again mistaken, because in truth what it does serves exclusively to fuel radical parties. Today, when the EU is going through the severest crisis in its history, this is unforgiveable irresponsibility.</p>

Populist leaders everywhere have the same targets: the parliament, the constitutional court, the judiciary, the so-called Leftist press.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is outrageous to see a government in Romania using the police and the secret service to intimidate political opponents, restrict civil liberties and falsify elections. At the same time, public television has become an instrument of government propaganda and the Romanian press is considered a threat to national security, like terrorism and organised crime. It is equally outrageous to see political elections in an EU country organised by a body with a military structure like the spatial telecommunications service under the orders of Băsescu.</p>

We are also not discussing the previous communist regime in Hungary. We are not talking about either of these things, nor about the financial crisis or other subjects. In fact we are talking about the fact that Hungary, as a member of the EU, has moved away from being a state under the rule of law. That is what this is all about and there is no doubt that Hungary has done away with the values of the European Union using legislation. That is the other factor compared with other countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not only the independence of the central bank and of the judiciary which has been abolished. We need to remember that the general right to take legal action has also been removed. The highest judges are no longer the guardians of the constitution. That is scandalous and it primarily affects the individual right to take legal action. All of these things represent a violation of EU values. The only question which we need to discuss today is: What are we doing? In contrast to other speakers, I am not calling for treaty infringement proceedings to be instituted, as the Commission wants.

For that reason, I would like to call on the Commission to ask the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights to shed some light on the matter for us, not just today, but every time we are faced with such cases.

This was preceded by the granting of Hungarian citizenship to minorities, but this would not be out of the ordinary if the Hungarian citizenship were granted on the basis of someone’s permanent residency, family ties or work in the country. But the citizenship is granted on the basis of a purely ethnic principle, and this ethnic principle is causing destabilisation across the region. I firmly believe that the Commission, too, will soon have a problem with this. I am surprised that my colleagues from the EPP have not noticed this, because it is an atmosphere of nationalism that is prevailing in Hungary today, and it is a nationalism that is fixated on the past, on the 19th century, rather than dealing with matters in a positive way.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European institutions, currently so preoccupied with the sustainability of our economies, must also concern themselves with the sustainability of our democracies.

Do not, therefore, tell us that this is a debate for the Commission either. The Commission has confirmed technical procedures that are offences and the Council does have the ability to use Article 7(2) as a ‘red card’, but Parliament does not use the whole of Article 7.

Since the current Polish Government is so enthusiastically inclined toward the Union’s institutions, the Commission simply turns a blind eye to discriminatory practises even though they violate fundamental values of the European Union.

      <p sl="it">I believe that these issues should be seriously looked into. However, I am sure that there has been lengthy discussion on the matter by my Committee on Constitutional Affairs, when the constitution had not yet been approved and there was already criticism of it, for reasons that people are too afraid to voice. Firstly, because there is the reference …</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, we have just had a lengthy debate on the situation in Hungary and in Europe. As is generally the case in parliamentary debate, a number of different views have been expressed. I am sure, however, that we do all agree on one thing: we all want Hungarian legislation to be in harmony with the European Treaties and laws as well as the values that they convey.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is with this in mind that the Commission has acted, focusing objectively, independently and responsibly on its own powers, in accordance with its quasi-judicial role and its role as guardian of the Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having adopted this approach after lengthy discussions with political leaders last year and the year before, the Commission decided to initiate three infringement proceedings, using a fast-track procedure, based on the Treaties, European legislation and the case law of the Court. In addition to these three demands, there has also been a preliminary letter of formal notice relating to the independence of the judiciary. I have taken note of several questions on this matter and I would like to tell you on what basis this letter was sent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">An independent judiciary is vital for implementing the Union’s law. According to the principle of effective jurisdictional protection, every citizen has the right to an effective remedy before an independent court. This is a general principle of EU law, which is also regularly used in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Given its importance, this principle was enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and it is for this reason that the Commission wants to know, among other things, whether or not certain provisions of the new Hungarian law on the organisation and administration of courts, and the premature termination of office of the President of the former Supreme Court, affect the independence of the judiciary</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, there has also been a lot of questions regarding media freedom. You will be aware that Ms Kroes, the Vice-President of the Commission, who has great concerns about this issue, is acting within the limits of her powers. Just yesterday, Ms Kroes sent a new letter to the Hungarian Government on the matter of media freedom. She reminded it of our European rules and asked the Hungarian Government to work towards this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One third and final matter – and I think this is also really important for the future work of Parliament – is the speech made by M Jagland, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, regarding that institution’s areas of jurisdiction: electoral law, religious freedom, the independence of the judiciary, freedom of press. It might be worth working with the Council of Europe on areas within its jurisdiction. Mr Jagland also proposed referring the whole matter to the Venice Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is where we are up to. We now need to get to work on these issues. This morning, my staff was contacted by the Office of the Hungarian Minister of Justice. Without delaying further, we are going to get round the table and discuss specific texts. We also know that, next Tuesday, the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, will meet the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, to discuss the letter and spirit of Hungarian legislation in relation to EU rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I have said many times, the ball is in the court of the Hungarian Government. Rapid changes would be in the interests of Hungarian citizens and the European Union. The only thing I can say then is ‘let’s get to work and sort things out!’</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to end with a quote from President Barroso, which perfectly sums up how we must continue our work:</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘I believe we have to be absolutely clear on the values, firm on the principles, fair on the method and sensible on the communication’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Prime Minister, honourable Members, I shall be brief. Many important issues were raised during this important debate. As President-in-Office of the Council, I have taken note of all your comments and concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">The line of the Presidency remains the same: all Member States must comply with EU law. The question is now how to ensure that Hungary’s legislation is in accordance with Community law and principles in a process that is as fair and effective as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said to begin with, the concerns about the developments in Hungary must be treated with the seriousness that the situation deserves. I am convinced that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, will fulfil its role. The Presidency strongly supports the work done by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also my clear expectation that the Hungarian Government will ensure that the legislation recently adopted complies with EU law, and I welcome the statement by Prime Minister Orbán today that the issues at hand will shortly be resolved. The Presidency is looking forward to that happening in the interests of Hungary and in the interests of the EU.</p>

    <intervention id="3-261-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Viktor Orbán" is_mep="False" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="hu">Prime Minister of Hungary. − Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank you on behalf of my country for your persistence in paying attention to matters related to Hungary. I wish to express my thanks for the support of those of you who stood up for Hungary and spoke as its friends.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to assure Mr Swoboda, who in his speech expressed his concerns about a Hungarian political ‘crop rotation,’ that I spent 15 of the last 20 years in opposition. Earlier I had been in government for four years, then I lost, and now I am head of government once again. You can rest assured that if there is one person in Europe who is in favour of political competition then it is me, and in this you can always count on me.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, to Mr Verhofstadt I must say that the statement he read out was accurate, but there is one fact he omitted at the end. It is true that the statement was written by former anti-communist dissidents, but the fact he omitted is an important one. These people were members of the leading committee of the liberal party, and were therefore partisan, and the party in which they worked has lost the trust of the Hungarian people to such an extent that at the last elections they did not even reach the five per cent threshold required to make it into parliament.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, due to the lateness of the hour allow me to forgo correcting every one of the unfortunately numerous factual mistakes that were made, and I therefore only ask those who made comments and criticised or accused Hungary and the Hungarian Constitution to please be so kind as to read that constitution. It is an exceptionally valuable document and one can find several novel things in it. The protection of minorities, the protection of sign languages, environmental protection, opposition to GMOs – these are all things that I believe are worthy of consideration by any European country.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, I also had the impression that this debate, which was about Hungary, had a European aspect as well, and was an ideological debate of sorts. People like me, and our political community, must accept that unfortunately the ideals we represent do not enjoy majority support in this House either. Our ideals are undoubtedly Christian and based on personal responsibility; we find national sentiment to be an important and positive thing, and we believe that families are the foundations of the future. It may be that a great many people believe otherwise, but that makes our position no less a European one. It may be that with this we are in a minority in Europe, but this position is no less a European position, and we are free to represent this conviction. You may disagree with what I will quote now, but I personally profess Schumann’s view that there will either be a Christian democracy in Europe or there will be no democracy at all. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a European position.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As regards concrete details, allow me to avoid having the same debate here that we will have to conduct with the Commission on the specifics. I would only like to mention two concrete points here. We have no conflict with the Commission over the independence of the judiciary. The retirement age of judges is not a matter of the justice system but of the new pension system. Hungary was ruined by an unmanageable pension system riddled with exceptions, and we therefore made the decision to introduce a single and general age limit for civil servants. We raised the age limit of police and military personnel, as theirs was below the new limit, whereas we lowered that of others, and to us this is therefore not a matter of the justice system but a matter of the pension system, and we will gladly consider the position of the Commission. We are ready to accept all the comments made in respect of the independence of the National Bank but one. At this point there remains only one point in this matter where we are in sharp conflict with the Commission. The Commission is asking us to refrain from having the President of the National Bank and the members of the Monetary Council swear an oath before parliament and on the constitution. I suggest that we think this over. Other than that, it seems to me that we are of the same opinion in all matters. Whether we will need to concede on this latter issue – I ask that we leave that discussion to another time.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As regards the old and the new constitution, ladies and gentlemen, I would only like to point out that the old constitution was incapable of protecting the country’s assets, and plunged the Hungarian people up to their necks in future debt. It failed to protect competition, which resulted in the Hungarian economy being ruled by monopolies and cartels. The previous constitution failed to protect the environment, which as a result decayed and deteriorated, and the previous constitution also failed to protect civil liberties, as it did not protect civilians against the arbitrary use of police force and allowed paramilitary organisations to keep minority groups in fear. The new constitution remedies all these deficiencies, and I am convinced that it does a good job at remedying them.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Finally, allow me one last comment. We Hungarians believe that what makes Europe Europe is its culture. In our view the foundations of European culture are goodwill and benevolence. There have always been and there always will be disputes in Europe, but as long as the arguments in these debates are specific, reasonable and sober, and as long as we assume the other party’s good intentions we will always be able to find a way to resolve these disputes. It grieves me that in today’s debate I was on many occasions presented not with arguments and concrete facts, but with absurd factual errors, vehemence, rage and prejudice. I am convinced that accusations made without knowledge of the laws under discussion are unbecoming Europe, as are judgements motivated not by common sense and objectivity but partisan rage and vehemence. We Hungarians, and I myself, believe in these principles, and it is these principles that guided us to the European Union, and we ask everyone to return to the European way of resolving disputes.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Hungary was, is and will be a land of freedom fighters. As a 1 000-year-old European nation we expect everyone to show us the respect and European manners that we accord to all nations. Should any of you have doubts, feel free to visit Hungary, acquaint yourselves with us; acquaint yourselves with the Hungarian people. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Thank you very much Mr Orbán. Please allow me to give you some information. It is certainly correct that Christianity has a place in your country, in your constitution and in Europe. However, as a Catholic and, at the same time, as President of a multireligious, multiethnic, multinational assembly of parliamentarians, I would like to say one thing to you. Europe is either Christian or it is not. That is as it may be. However, it is quite clear that Europe must be pluralist or else it will fail.

      <p sl="de">I would like to make a few brief comments. I am pleased that you are prepared to admit, at least to a certain extent, that you have made mistakes and that some of your laws need to be amended. The laws which require amendment are important ones.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, why are we occupying ourselves with the subject of Hungary? Because we love Hungary, we love the people who live there and it is an important country. You underestimate this. You underestimate the importance of Hungary and of the development of Hungary for democracy. That is the decisive issue. We are not criticising Hungary, but your policy. The President of this House has already said this and I would put it even more strongly: do not misuse religion for political purposes. Whatever our religious conviction is, we combine religion with tolerance. Religion without tolerance is not acceptable, whether it is Islam or a Christian religion. This is the decisive factor.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, you spoke about the family. We all belong to families. As you are well aware, my family comes partly from Hungary and partly from the Czech Republic. Therefore, my family is Europe. I would be pleased if you could recognise that your family is also Europe. This is how it should be. The family of the Hungarian Prime Minister should be Europe. That is what I am fighting for in this Chamber and what we are fighting for in Europe.</p>

You are insinuating that the freely elected Prime Minister is not doing things out of love. Therefore, I would like to ask you how you come to say that you are acting only out of love of Hungary.

Because it is not in line with their views and that is what I value about it. Do not defend an attitude which you would criticise heavily in your own country. Do not defend an attitude which undermines democracy. You should be defending the attitudes which strengthen democracy. That is what I would like to see the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) doing.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr Président, Mr Orbán calls György Konrad, Dalos and Kenedi the liberals. It is not a disease being a liberal, Mr Orbán, as you would suggest. You yourself were a liberal, for a long time, before becoming a nationalist when you started supporting other views. I do hope that Mr Konrad is a liberal. I hope that Mr Kenedi is a liberal, he is a great historian. These three characters are great Hungarians. There is no need to start saying that because they are liberals, what they say is bound to be partisan. I have not heard one single argument against everything that has been said today. The only argument was about the 62-year old rule: ‘Pension costs are too high and that is why the pension age is being lowered’. That is the argument put forward today. In other words, no argument.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What really is important is what the Commission said, because, if I understand it right, Commissioner, other infringement proceedings may be brought, as well as the current three. If the letter does not receive a satisfactory reply, the Commission will go one step further than three infringement proceedings. It is important for you to confirm this one more time.</p>

Therefore, I would like to give you one thing to think about in peace and quiet. You may believe that we have a negative attitude to Hungary, but that is not the case. Do you believe that I would have risked my life and my freedom to help illegally in the fight against the communists and to bring information sheets to Hungary out of hatred towards Hungary? There is no country in the world which is populated only by freedom fighters. Not France and not Germany, Italy or Hungary. There were many people in Hungary who during certain periods in the past did not fight for freedom. Equally, there were many Hungarians who did.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make it clear to you that Christianity can be an important religion in modern states. However, a modern state and an open society cannot be based on a religion. Otherwise, the atheists, Jews, Muslims and people of other persuasions would not feel comfortable in this country. That is precisely what many people in Hungary today find oppressive. The nationalist and chauvinist atmosphere makes them uncomfortable. You need to accept that. Go home and sleep on it. Think it over as Viktor would have done.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The second thing I wanted to say, Mr Orbán, is that attacking the Hungarian Government, criticising the Hungarian Government’s policy, is not criticising Hungary, it is not picking on Hungary and it is not picking on the Hungarian people. Sadly, we know exactly what the nationalist tendencies of those who talk like that are.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The other thing I wanted to say is that you have invited us all to read the Hungarian Constitution. Unfortunately, I do not speak Hungarian. I know that some translation work has been done.

I am sure that here we are looking for solutions with Viktor Orbán, as he is no Chavez – a name which it pains me to use here in this debate, in a democracy, in a democratic house, this is one step too far and not normal.

      <p sl="it">Many of the speeches in our long debate have been rather generic. It has not been clearly shown which provisions of the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have been violated by Hungary, or which precise provision of Hungarian law should be censured. Only the Commission has indicated three more precise areas for investigation. I believe that in this regard we need to have faith in the Commission and in the Hungarian Government and Parliament. However, there is an underlying issue that needs to be brought to light. Attacks continue to be made on the Hungarian Constitution, but no one has the courage to indicate the real reasons why a certain European radical left-wing is supporting a campaign of denigration against a country which has great merit in the fight for democracy and freedom. What is disturbing about the Hungarian Constitution is the reference to Christian roots, recognition of human dignity from the moment of conception, and statement that the family is a natural state based on marriage between a man and a woman. I do not believe that these three aspects conflict with European values. In fact they are an exemplary description of the foundations of such values, which should be taken as a model by all of European law.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Against the background of a serious economic crisis whose consequences are primarily having an impact on citizens’ standard of living, we are witnessing an alarming erosion of respect for democratic principles in the EU. The not-too-distant past has shown us the danger that arises when these two factors come together: poverty caused by recession and nationalist tendencies. European history still bears the burden of totalitarian regimes whose actions recklessly crushed people’s destinies. The European project, founded on democracy, the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights, is being undermined in Hungary by the recent decisions adopted by the government to amend the constitution arbitrarily. A state which claims to be democratic cannot curb fundamental freedoms, cannot gag the press and cannot restrict the independence of the central bank. Unfortunately, Hungary is not the only state where the government is violating citizens’ rights. In Romania, thousands of people are currently out in the streets protesting against the abuses and incompetence of the Băsescu regime and to protect their constitutional right to elect their leaders by a free vote during early elections, at a time when the current government no longer represents them. It is the European institutions’ duty to punish such abuses severely to avoid history repeating itself.</p>

Besides, it is no secret that certain initiatives are unacceptable to many among the European elites, because, among other things, they affect the interests of large international corporations and businesses. The actions of the European Commission are a demonstration of illegitimate pressure exerted on a democratic state and give this institution a bad name.</p>

      <p sl="ro">From the very moment it came to power, the Hungarian Government has been persisting in promoting policies that conflict with European law and have a strong nationalist-populist aspect. Both the media law and certain provisions of the new constitution or the new law concerning the organisation and management of the central bank prove that the right-wing government in Budapest is deliberately challenging the Community acquis and democratic principles, even though a whole series of international and European organisations, including the European Parliament, have reiterated their serious concerns regarding the undemocratic tendencies of the policies promoted by it.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this context, I welcome the decision made by the European Commission to initiate proceedings against Hungary for infringing the Treaties.

      <p sl="hu">There are several Member States against which hundreds of infringement procedures are launched even within the span of a single year. Hungary’s case is not unique in the European Union, yet we are treated with increased attention whatever we may do. The debate has shown quite well that left-wing speakers are rather lacking in terms of factual accuracy, which, however, does not seem to disturb even their leading orators. It is a fact that over the past two years there has been a reform in my country of such a magnitude that it should have been undertaken already at the time of Hungary’s democratic transition. This is exactly what the voters authorised the Government to do. I can sympathise with those who have suffered grievances, but the methods through which they seek recompense are unacceptable to me. If I recall correctly, when we acceded to the European Union we did not choose to completely surrender our country’s sovereignty in all matters, but to fulfil our jointly undertaken commitments. I indicated already during the debate on the presentation of the Danish Presidency programme that putting Hungary in a pillory will not bring about a satisfactory resolution of the euro area debt crisis. If we were to spend as much time on crisis management or the protection of the euro as we are spending on Hungary, we may already have succeeded in resolving our problems. It is unbecoming that in this period of European crisis we are looking for scapegoats and in the meantime divert attention from the fact that another intergovernmental agreement is about to be concluded in complete disregard for the Community method.</p>

      <p sl="ro">During the revolutions in Eastern Europe in 1989, the Hungarian people, just like other peoples, wanted to live in freedom. They wanted a democratic state sharing European values. Unfortunately, Hungary is not heading in this direction and is not alone in this in Eastern Europe. The argument for reforms in Hungary revolves around the new constitution. The fundamental law was amended after 1989, marking an almost radical move away from the 1949 version. The argument that this constitution needed to be changed because it was Stalinist does not stack up in this context. Hungary is going through major changes. It is not possible to talk about reform when democratic principles are being violated. A series of laws have been adopted, targeting the whole judicial system and the independence of the central bank. They are moving Hungary away from European values. Similar scenarios can also be encountered in Romania and Bulgaria. In times of crisis, populist arguments which actually provide the basis for such governments cannot be accepted. I have said it before and will repeat it: regimes that move away from democracy must be brought up for discussion at European level. Romanians, Bulgarians and Hungarians must be protected from politicians of the likes of Orbán, Băsescu or Borisov.</p>

The government prioritised developing an EU-level strategy for Roma inclusion, the successful adoption of which was appreciated by the vast majority of this House. Prime Minister Orbán signed an unprecedented cooperation agreement with the National Roma Self-Government, presenting quantified and clear targets, and Hungary was the first to submit to the Commission its comprehensive national strategy for Roma inclusion. I was therefore astonished that some of my fellow MEPs stated without the slightest evidence that Hungarian Roma are afraid. There is of course a significant anti-Roma sentiment throughout Europe, but to blame it on a government that has been in office for less than two years is another example of the political misuse and abuse of the Roma issue, which I firmly reject.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I am sure that many victims of totalitarian Communism and their close relatives welcome the clause in Hungary’s new constitution that states that the Hungarian Socialist Party has inherited liability for the crimes of the Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party. This is not a problem that is specific to Hungary, since many European states still have influential politicians who during the Cold War years collaborated with Communist parties and the USSR, ignoring the crimes carried out by them against humanity. Unfortunately, not all the provisions included in the new constitution clearly comply with Europe’s principles. The independence of the central bank is one of these fundamental principles. I am convinced that the procedure begun by the Commission will lead to legal clarity on this issue. I welcome the fact that Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, has found time to visit the European Parliament in person and discuss the new constitution with MEPs. His commitment to comply with Europe’s principles is welcome and permits us to hope that we will not have to return to discussing these issues again at the European level.</p>

      <p sl="hu">For a few weeks now, Hungary has been the focus of attention in the Western media. What is the reason for a Central European EU Member State whose conservative government successfully filled the EU’s Presidency last year becoming so important? I find the barrage that has been levelled at Hungary for some time now unacceptable from a political and even from an ethical standpoint. The unfounded and overly politically motivated accusations directed by this House at the Hungarian Government should be rejected. In the present economic and social situation which is marked by a crisis the EU should offer support and a reliable background to its own Member States. It is therefore inappropriate to launch political attacks against a Member State that has come to be in a difficult economic situation. Hungary has undertaken to comply with the legislative amendments urged by the European Commission, because it considers respect for EU values and the Community legal order to be essential. It is only those who do not know the country and its leaders who call this fact into question. The oft-mentioned principle of solidarity should apply to all Member States equally. The use of double standards should be condemned in all such cases. A significant majority of Hungarian voters support the right-wing conservative government to this day. The left-wing and liberal media, engaged in an unprecedented campaign against the Hungarian civic state, remain silent about this, and also for example about the peace marches organised in support of the government. An equitable judgement – this is what the seasoned democracy of Hungary deserves and expects.</p>

      <p sl="en">In the face of the financial crisis, when it is so important to safeguard the independence of policy implementation, the new rules of the Hungarian central bank, granting its directors the right to choose their deputies and increase the number of Monetary Council members elected by the government may give cause for concern. Weakening the independence of a central bank may breach the provisions of Article 130 of the TFUE, which provide that when performing their duties, central banks shall not receive instructions from governments of Member States, and these in turn agree not to influence members of the former’s governing bodies. However, we must not forget that the EU is a community of sovereign states, which have the right to self-determination within the limits of the commitments made in the Treaties. In case of doubt concerning the compatibility of national legislation with the acquis communautaire, there is a procedure according to which a Member State may submit its interpretation. We should appreciate the open communications strategy of Prime Minister Orbán and his willingness to listen to the arguments of the European institutions. The main focus of our recent discussions has been the debt crisis, but we must not forget about the values upon which the European Community was built. In this context, attention should be drawn to the fact that while some so vigorously criticise Hungary for violating the Treaties, at the same time we are dealing with attempts to undermine the primacy of European law through intergovernmental agreement, and there is no similar debate regarding this issue, even though objectively it is equally important.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to express my deep concern over the direction in which Mr Orbán’s government is currently leading Hungary. One can always find one-sided justifications for different measures that the government is taking and the methods it is pursuing, but at the moment these justifications do not reflect the democratic values that we stand for as Europeans. It seems that Mr Orbán has forgotten that democracy is not only the rule of the majority, but also the respect and protection of the minority. It is also important to understand that Hungary, as a Member State, has an obligation to follow the principles enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union and thus have its legislation adhere to the TEU, the TFEU and other international treaties and obligations. I sincerely hope that Mr Orbán can comprehend our reservations and will act accordingly to re-route Hungary away from becoming an autocratic country and back onto the track of democracy. I must reiterate that the situation in Hungary is not an internal matter of the Member State, but it is a concern for all of us, since the Treaties are being disregarded.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Hungary is currently facing a problem which we must address. France believes strongly in respect for human rights and democracy. I am concerned by the path being taken in the name of constitutional reform. The boat was first rocked a few months ago when the Hungarian Government passed a law restricting media independence. Now it is the independence of the Hungarian central bank, the independence of the judiciary and the independence of the national data protection authority that are under threat. Viktor Orbán once fought against communist totalitarianism; Hungary is now part of the Union and there are fundamental values to be respected. The European Union fights for democracy and human rights worldwide. What is the logic in supporting the Arab revolutions, on the one hand, while allowing a Member State to undermine its own democracy. I am glad to see that the European Commission has got behind this issue and I hope that, with the help of the Hungarians, we will find a way that allows us to reconnect with the values at the heart of our undertaking.</p>

I listen to the statements of the left in this House, read the articles in the Western press, look at TV reports on Hungary and Hungarians, and I entirely fail to recognise myself in what they say. The mirror that is being held up is a distorting one; it shows an imagined Hungary, born of the dystopic fantasies of the Western left. This selfsame left has referred more than once to European values. The one that I miss is that of fairness, of listening to the views of the other side. Nor is there much evidence of moderation or reason in what is being marshalled against Hungary; it adds up mostly to wild exaggeration and hyperbole. But this campaign, this onslaught against Hungary is not without its unintended consequences. Opinion in Hungary does not recognise itself in the distorting mirror and it resents what it does see. And that resentment is directed at the left, not at the government. It is directed at those who are seen as traducing Hungary, Hungary’s European credentials and the very European values in the name of which the left claims to be acting.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Yesterday the European Commission decided to initiate an accelerated infringement procedure against Hungary in three cases concerning the independence of the Hungarian central bank, data protection authorities and issues associated with the judiciary. The Commission gave Hungary one month to implement changes. The procedure initiated by the Commission concerns only part of the problem with which Hungary is struggling, and includes breach of European legal provisions. In addition, the Hungarian democracy has a clear problem relating to respect for minorities, rights guaranteed to the opposition, and media pluralism. I am grateful to Hungarian society for so vocally expressing its views and opinions, and sometimes criticism, which I listen to attentively. It is not possible to ‘bind’ matters of public debate, such as tax policies, by basic law, even if they are the best solutions. The public has a right to seek changes in relation to such matters. Democracy is the rule of the majority, but minorities must also be respected, and therefore we should all take a close look at the Magyars and put pressure on their rulers to go back on these changes, which are harmful to democracy. I hope that the Hungarians and their government are successful in introducing reforms to overcome the recession and that they will be guided by their commitment to freedom and democracy and respect for our common European law in all their endeavours.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I would, first of all, like to express my solidarity towards Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, to whom Mr Swoboda went so far as to suggest that he should take a leaf out of the book of the freedom-loving Václav Havel. The Prime Minister of Hungary should not have to act as an advocate of his country, which has been put in a pillory, but should be among us as a guest of honour of the European Parliament. However, I am convinced that not so far from now there will come a time when, as Havel, he too will be greeted in accordance with his merits as a prominent personage of the Hungarian democratic transition. Those who are trying to put Hungary and the head of its government, Viktor Orbán, on a wall of shame, have no idea about the period and nature of the fight against the communists who clawed their way back into power twice after 1994. It is, first of all, Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz Party to whom the imperishable merit for rising up from a defeated position and making the communists fall once and for all in an act comparable to a second change of regime belongs. In today’s Hungary the post-communist regime that was vetoed by a two-thirds majority of Hungarian voters continues its rear-guard struggle against the national public will and seeks to make the efforts of a democratically elected Orbán Government impossible in both the internal and the foreign political arena. I am quite familiar with the anatomy of counter-revolutionary communist restoration from Romania’s case. It is an indication of the maladjusted condition and moral crisis of the European Union, which is beset by a complex crisis, that instead of far-reaching solidarity and support it exposes a Hungary ruined by socialists and pseudo-liberals to infringement procedures and undeserved prosecution. I am worried for Europe, and I am worried for Hungary.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-285-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Connie Hedegaard" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity, at this early stage, to discuss the follow-up to Durban.</p>
      <p sl="en">From the Commission’s point of view, Durban was a success for Europe. Why was that? I believe it was because it showed that if we stay firm, if we stay united and if we make the right alliances, then we can actually achieve substantial progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">The strategy that we should not simply say ‘yes’ to a second commitment period without getting anything in return actually worked. But it is also very clear to all of us that Durban did not produce the perfect outcome for climate change. There is still a lot of work ahead of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear to me that 2012 is going to be a very tough year for international climate negotiations, for a number of reasons. We have American elections coming up, we have a new Chinese leadership coming in and, for instance, we have an incoming Conference of Parties (COP) president who is a relative newcomer to international climate negotiations. It is clear that there are many challenges in front of us this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what should be our follow-up activities? Well, of course, in the Commission we are still reflecting on and digesting Durban and reflecting about the next steps. But let me mention five things.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, in the period between 2012 and 2015 we will have to find out exactly what should come after the second commitment period. We have to reflect on what is the best way forward to get the world to where we need it to be by 2015 and, in good time before Doha, the Commission will present our suggestion on a world work programme for 2012-2015. Here I would look forward very much to the input of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second issue, for 2012, will be the ambition gap. In the last 24 hours of the conference, Europe and the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) – together in a joint effort – got new wording included in the Durban package to the effect that in the first half of this year we must try to address the ambition gap. That is obviously easier said than done, but a crucial issue is that the world is currently locking in too little ambition for the period up to 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know that we will have a review. It is as the result of an EU initiative that we will get a review. We also know that before too long we will have a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and, if one thing is for sure, it is not going to require us to be less busy on addressing the ambition gap. There is no indication that the warnings will be less serious. So, through substantial outreach we will work with willing partners to address this ambition gap and identify a way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">My third point therefore concerns outreach. We undertook substantial outreach in 2011 with the Pacific Island Forums, with a lot of developing countries and also through the New York UN Ambassadors’ visits to all parts of the world, including of course to Africa, working very closely with AOSIS and with a number of good allies in the Cartagena Dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should build on that further this year. I went straight from Durban to New York, in the middle of December, to a meeting with AOSIS ambassadors and ministers to make the point that the good cooperation we had in Durban should not be a one-off, but rather something to build on when we go to Rio+20, and generally in a number of fields.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we will continue to work on this alliance, and in the Commission we are also considering whether Europe could take the initiative on discussing the way forward with a number of other ambitious countries in one context or another.</p>
      <p sl="en">My fourth point concerns what Europe itself is doing. There will be a strong focus on this. Before 1 May we have to come up with so-called quantified emission-limitation or reduction objectives – a very technical thing but something that is also, of course, of political importance, and we will have to discuss our own low-carbon pathway.</p>
      <p sl="en">We in the Commission hope that now, during the Danish Presidency, we will have Council conclusions in March on the low-carbon strategy and that, with the good help of Parliament, we will have an ambitious energy efficiency directive within the next six months. So there are things in the pipeline that make it do-able for Europe to step up our own ambitions, not least through energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="en">My fifth and last point is that Rio+20 is coming up and there are a number of issues – pricing, access to sustainable energy and other matters – on which we could make progress in Rio in June, thus indirectly benefitting the international climate agenda. As I have said, it is absolutely key here that we build on the very good alliances we made in the run-up to Durban and in Durban.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think this is all that time permits, but I would just say that it is extremely important to take this dual approach, moving forward both in international negotiations and in terms of what we do domestically in Europe. For all the reasons that this Parliament knows, it is extremely important that we also move on that second track.</p>
      <p sl="en">I very much look forward to continuing the good cooperation with Parliament and seeing how we can tackle the question of ambition, both internationally and regionally in terms of what we do ourselves here in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you very much Ms Hedegaard. I would like to focus straight away on the last point that you made. Of course, we need to continue to move forward in Europe and we must not relax our efforts. However, we must, of course, also explain this to the Council, which did not show as much commitment to some of the issues in Durban as I would have liked. I went to Durban with slightly higher expectations and I must admit that I came home feeling a little more hopeful than when I left. We do now have the Durban Platform, which was one of the Commission’s fundamental initiatives and I would like to give my sincere thanks to you and your team. This now forms the basis for a global climate agreement, which we must work very hard on in the years up to 2015.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, we did not manage to expand the single-track Kyoto 2 route. It still only covers 15%. However, it is clear that we are now in a position to say that the world climate map has changed significantly. We no longer have the simple division between Kyoto and non-Kyoto countries. States like China and the US can no longer fall back on the ridiculous arguments that they have used over the last 10 years and say that if someone else is not doing something, then they will not do it either. This was genuinely embarrassing in Copenhagen and Cancún, but the situation had improved in Durban. We now have a new world order and the Commission has shown great commitment in helping to develop it.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will now all have to travel in the same direction. There is no other option. Some countries will be slower than others. I like to compare this situation with that of a tunnel. We all know where the end is, but we still have to build the individual stations and stopping places. You are right in saying that we and the Commission will all have to work hard on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to give you, Ms Hedegaard, my very warm congratulations. I have always been happy to do this. You made a very important contribution in Durban, but the Council did not. I will be taking the Council to task about this again later today. You have established important milestones and we will be happy to go on supporting you along this route.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Hedegaard, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would also like to congratulate you on your handling of the negotiations in Durban. The EU has demonstrated its strong leadership skills and this has paid off. I am also pleased about the climate diplomacy and the coalition of 120 states. I would like to see China joining our strategic coalition, alongside Africa. China is moving towards taking over worldwide responsibility. This would send out a signal to the US to bring an end to its policy of denial and to join the mainstream of international climate policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have prevented a fiasco and we have produced the road map which we will have to work on. There is, of course, a great deal for us to do at home. We have the gigatonne gap and if Europe wants to play a leading role, it will have to do more than it has in the past. I hope that there will be new initiatives which go beyond 20%. We must take the hot air out of Kyoto 2. The policy cannot really be credible with all these surplus certificates.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to encourage you to remain tough in the areas of aviation and shipping and to take new initiatives. It is totally absurd that the US Congress can pass a law banning airlines from taking part in our legislation. We must not allow this to happen and Parliament would like to see you maintaining your tough stance.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by congratulating you and thanking you for the work that you personally carried out in Durban, which in effect led to an almost binding agreement and did so – and here echo the words spoken somewhat less diplomatically by Mr Lorenz – despite extremely strong reluctance on the part of the Polish Presidency on certain points. Well done also for standing firm on including aviation in the ETS despite threats from the United States and China.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have made some progress. It was not as great as we would have liked and we now know that there is very little chance of us getting greenhouse gas emissions restricted to two points, as we were promised. In these talks, it was governments, particularly those of the United States and Canada, which still fail to recognise the significance of the risk we face. However, although it has made some considerable effort on the domestic front, China also put up some resistance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The role played by the oil and gas lobbies has also been extremely negative and we cannot help but be concerned about the next COP being held in Qatar, a State that is one of the major emitters of greenhouse gases per capita on the planet and that, moreover, denies civil society, trade unions, NGOs and women of their rights. This is a truly appalling symbol for something so important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Progress will only be possible if progress is also made in terms of global governance. This year should then be the perfect opportunity to do so by building on the progress already made, particularly with regard to the least developed countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall finish by saying that we, in Europe, must also adopt this proactive approach that we have seen in Durban. This is not just about climate protection. It is in the interest of the European economy and we must fight to be or stay, depending on circumstance, at the forefront of the transition to a green economy. This goal can only become a reality in the months ahead and of course, Commissioner, you have our full support for going down this road.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would, first of all, like to congratulate Commissioner Hedegaard on the role she played in Durban on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. We demonstrated there that, if Europe works together and speaks with one voice, we can, indeed, make a difference on the world stage. To my mind, this was the most important result of Durban: to show that Europe can make a difference. So, thank you very much for that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, there remains much to be done, because we all know that we have, in fact, not moved much further forward when it comes to climate change. The gap between the two degree target that we committed ourselves to and the reduction that we promised by 2020 is still gigantic. We are still only heading towards three to four degrees. That is still a huge climate change problem and we should not be putting it off until 2020. You are right when you say that we still have a great deal of work to do between 2012 and 2015.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What matters most to the Group of the Greens? Building on our alliance with the least developed countries and the low-lying islands. They have opted to side with Europe and we should keep them firmly on our side in the forthcoming period, in order to maintain pressure on China and India. These countries need a credible trade policy and a credible technology policy. Europe will have to be very consistent on that score.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Talking of credibility: Europe itself will also have to pull out all the stops in order to demonstrate that we mean to act. That means a step towards -30% – leaked studies show that that will also save money – and the set-aside. That is the decision that was made by the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, in December. The Committee should now really take the initiative to this end. We can take action. We have to, for the sake of the climate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for a treaty on climate change to be meaningful, all the major emitters in the world must be a part of it. The Durban Platform gives us a roadmap for a binding legal treaty to combat climate change. Everyone in the world, including the major emitters – the United States, India and China – must be committed to this goal.</p>
      <p sl="en">The roadmap gives us a realistic timetable to negotiate a new agreement by 2015. The reason Durban was successful? Because it is not overly ambitious. It is not an ‘all or nothing’ summit like Copenhagen. Also, the European negotiators and the British negotiating team were able to persuade a broad coalition of countries to commit to commit. Richer developing countries have agreed to do their bit, and the poorest countries will receive assistance to cope with climate change through a green climate fund. I hope the EU will continue with this positive approach.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, let us be clear: there is no way to ‘sugar the pill’. The result of Durban is a Kyoto Protocol weakened even further, covering less than one fifth of world greenhouse gas emissions. Given the history we have, to conclude now – as the Durban Platform does – that important decisions will be made in the future does not even justify optimistic discourse.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Regrettably, only one thing seems to be containing an even greater increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere: the deepening crisis of capitalism, the recession and the consequent decline in economic activity. It is in this context that it would be even more important – that it is even more important – to change profoundly the approach we have been making to the problem of climate change. Specifically, we need to call into question the so-called flexibility instruments and carbon trading.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We shall leave you with a question, Commissioner: how can you guarantee that we will not have, in the place of investment in low-carbon technologies, a situation of business as usual, underwritten by the purchase of the emissions licences of those unable to make use of them.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the experience of all the climate change conferences held since 1995 tells us that, in their present format, they are doomed to failure.</p>
      <p sl="es">They sought a global agreement and, furthermore, sought to arrive at it by a consensus, an impossible ambition to achieve because of the very different productive, economic and social structure of the states concerned. That is why, in the end, what they can hope to achieve are minimum threholds, but clearly this is not enough.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, climate change is linked to other deep-rooted problems in societies, such as their development and education models, social differences and poverty. If all of these issues are to be raised at these conferences, it will be even more difficult for agreements to be reached, especially if the conferences turn into fairs, international exhibitions, with thousands and thousands of participants, which has been the case.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union must continue to fly the flag for the environment, which Commissioner Hedegaard did very well in Durban. For that, I congratulate her. These conferences, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, need greater coherence between the states, more diplomatic work and less of a festival atmosphere.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, when I look at the almost empty Chamber and compare the situation with the previous debate, with the emotion and the heat that the subject generated, and when I think about the importance of climate change for every individual person in Europe and, most importantly, for the population of the world as a whole, I find it very sad. Unfortunately, it demonstrates that this subject is gradually slipping off the political agenda. The Members who are here have all tried to do our best. Some of us attended the conference in Durban and you, Ms Hedegaard, accomplished a great deal there. I would like to compliment you on having reached an agreement and established the Durban Platform under these circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was very difficult for me. We were fighting against a headwind from all directions. It came in particular from China, from the US and from India, but nevertheless we Europeans took on the role that we have always assigned ourselves. Everything will now depend on how the next few years go and on whether we can really achieve the goal that we have set ourselves of a binding worldwide agreement in 2015. It is up to us to convince the other states that action is needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">We now have a consensus among most of the countries in Europe that climate change will help the economy and that we must remain competitive, but that we must do this by investing in climate-related technologies. There is a strong awareness of this in most states. We can make progress by building on this foundation. These are the only arguments which the major polluters, such as China and the US, will understand. Unfortunately, their concern about the welfare of the world’s population has been put on the back burner.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to ask you in the near future to submit the proposal about F-gas emissions that you have promised us and to include aviation. Please could you also investigate what we can do with regard to tropospheric ozone and soot particles, so that we have a comprehensive strategy. Once again, Ms Hedegaard, I would like to congratulate you on what you have achieved in Durban.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Ms Hedegaard, many of us always praise you when you are here in Parliament because you always take the lead in the fight against climate change and always support a very progressive and ambitious line. You did this in Durban, too, but I am nevertheless critical of the results. I would even go so far as to say that I think Durban was a fiasco. The reason I say this is as follows: the fact that we could not achieve anything better than a legal obligation to reduce CO2 emissions in 2020 does not mean that we should accept that. The problem with doing that is that, by doing so, we have in fact said to the rest of the world that we accept the fact that we will not have anything legally binding that can keep us below the 2 degree target before 2020. Everyone sitting in this Chamber and everyone following this debate via the web streaming or by other means and who is interested in the climate knows that this will be too late.</p>
      <p sl="da">If we are to keep the temperature rise to less than 2 degrees – and we must do that because if we go beyond 2 degrees there are a whole series of positive feedback effects that will kick in and then the process will be irreversible and we will not be able to do anything – we need to start within 5 years. All science indicates this, the International Energy Agency says this and it is difficult to find people who understand this matter who do not agree with this. That is why it was a fiasco, and therefore we need to say that we can no longer concentrate on solving this problem from the top down via the United Nations. There is now only one way to go about this and that is from the bottom up, and you also need to play a part in this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commissioner’s achievement of a deal on an agreement with legal force by 2015 is a significant step in the development of responsible stewardship for our planet. To me, the significance of Durban lies not just in an agreement between governments, but in a consensus among the peoples of the world in that great tented city outside the conference hall, speaking many tongues, but with one global language of common concern. Their sense of urgency needs to be matched by government action.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our greatest ally may yet be the world’s largest emitter of CO2 – China’s recent second national assessment report on climate change warns its government that action is urgently needed. The Union must work with China to build a coalition of the willing to hand down a healthy planet to future generations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent IPCC report on extreme weather events ought to convince the USA and Canada. What can the Commission do to counter the detestable and irresponsible behaviour on their part that imperils humankind and bring them into the new alliance?</p>
      <p sl="en">Among all the praise for the Durban Platform, please remember that a halo is only ever 25 centimetres from being a noose. We must change our action in the European Union.

In terms of diplomacy, Durban was a breakthrough, and continental plates moved. As has already been mentioned in this debate, a timetable agreed from the scientific perspective is a solution that is much too slow to prevent the catastrophic acceleration of climate change.</p>
      <p sl="fi">At Durban, the EU persuaded almost all the other participants to agree to take an additional step. Now it is time to step up our own climate measures. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is urging industrialised countries to cut emissions by 25% at least by 2020. Our legislation says that the figure is just 20%. Our emissions targets have to bemore stringent. The hot air at Kyoto needs to be eliminated. We must obtain criteria for biofuels to prevent natural forests from becoming biofuel plantations. Tar sand and other dirty new sources of fossil fuel should be treated as the dirty options that they are. Emissions from shipping should be subject to restrictions. In short, we need to have more stringent measures in place to ensure that global warming does not exceed two degrees.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I think that after Durban we can be sure of one thing. We can be sure that we are alone in the world as concerns our ideas on emission reduction. The extension of the operation of the Kyoto Protocol is only an illustration of this impasse. I think that instead of beating our head against a wall, we should revise our climate policy so that its costs are distributed more equitably.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Moving on into the next phase of the emission trading scheme in 2013 will entail in Poland, for instance, being under even greater pressure to transfer paper, glass, and cement production outside the Union. In crisis conditions, the climate policy is a millstone around the neck of European industry, which will eventually be relocated to countries that are our direct competitors. The European Union, in pursuing such a radical climate policy alone, without global agreement, brings upon itself responsibility for economic slowdown.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the lack of agreement in Durban is a fact which the Commission should take note of. The Commissioner should take this fact into consideration in her decisions and other activities, because policies should be rational, pragmatic and predictable and lead to a clear goal.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Climate policy can only be rational when looked at from a global perspective. Greenhouse gases know no borders, so if it is a fact that Canada pulled right out of the Kyoto Protocol in Durban, if it is a fact that other countries that are major emitters, including China, do not wish to decide to significantly reduce emissions jointly with Europe, it means that our policy is Quixotic, that it is not effective, that even if we managed to reduce the limits, as proposed by the Commissioner and the Commission, this would not achieve the intended purpose in terms of impact on the global climate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The policy makes sense only if there is a global agreement. If an effect of the policy in Europe is that our economy becomes less competitive in relation to less developed countries, and industry relocates to those countries, and with it jobs, then the consequences for our economy will be fatal. In Poland alone, according to estimates for 2013-2020, this will entail a loss of 250 000 jobs. Meanwhile energy bills will increase by 30-40% from 2013. This may lead to a crisis in the European Union as well as in relation to the European Union. This is very bad news, Commissioner. We need to take these actual facts into consideration.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in discussing Durban, the most obvious question is whether an agreement last year to reach an agreement in three years’ time to do something in eight years’ time is really an agreement at all.</p>
      <p sl="en">Likewise, one has to ask whether the agreement to create a green climate fund and transfer USD 1 billion a year from hard-pressed taxpayers in countries like Britain to corrupt third world oligarchies reflects a serious threat of global communism or a happily unattainable fantasy. Given the way in which EU Commissioners are forcing economically suicidal spending cuts on the protectorates of Greece and Italy – a move likely to spark a chain-reaction implosion of the entire financial system – the fantasy answer is fortunately the more realistic.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the most significant thing about Durban is what was not discussed: climate science. This is no surprise, as it is now crystal clear that the so-called scientific consensus on man-made global warming simply does not exist. It is not just a matter of the thousands of independent scientists who dispute the whole theory: even the warmists themselves now admit that the computer models on which the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) cult is based are simplistic and flawed. The more they learn about feedback mechanisms and the complexity of real climate, the more they realise they do not know. To crucify our taxpayers and de-industrialise our economies in pursuit of the one-world government madness of the United Nations is therefore crazy.</p>

      <p sl="it">I share the concern about this Green Fund. At a time like this, where we will find the resources remains a mystery and a major concern. However I believe that in order to be realistic, we have to recognise that this time things changed at Durban. The old set-up that no longer reflected the actual global geopolitical situation was finally laid to rest. We had continued to work on a snapshot of the world in the 1990s that had been superseded for some time, and that, used as a basis for the forecasts to 2050, had become truly unsustainable.</p>
      <p sl="it">Looking at 2050 we can see that the world’s top 30 economies will probably include 19 countries that are currently classified as developing countries. I believe that this change of pace was perhaps the most interesting piece of information from a political point of view, and in fact this was correctly emphasised by Mr Florenz.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also think that we should no longer proceed as separate, watertight entities. Therefore, bearing in mind also the words of Mario Draghi, governor of the European Central Bank, in the House the other day, if we want to push for the priorities of growth and employment in this sector as well, we must be consistent and focus on green technologies in order to deliver sustainable development and to respond to our citizens’ most important needs.</p>

It is also important to mention the Green Climate Fund, which will have funding of USD 100 billion up to 2020.

Just as there are two sides to every coin, there is also a positive and negative side to this outcome. Certainly, if we take a political view, the conference was a great success, since it represents a major step towards global responsibility, while the European Union once again played a leading role in this area and I sincerely congratulate you for the strategy you developed and also for your performance at the negotiations. Of course, those who judge the conference from the viewpoint of reducing greenhouse gas emissions cannot - we cannot - be satisfied. Here I am thinking of the biggest polluters, such as the United States, China, India, Japan and Russia. We met many representatives of these countries and actually I did not get the impression these representatives really wanted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I think a massive task still lies ahead of us to try to gain the support of these countries. We are particularly lacking in support from developed countries. In addition, I would like to see a future agreement reached on a uniform system for calculating emissions, because without this, we do not really know what numbers we are talking about or what these numbers mean. In the future, I also want to see more progress in the field of maritime and air transport, and of course, more ambition on the part of countries. We said that our goal was 2 degrees Celsius. Now we have 4 degrees Celsius, while scientists are warning us that we should be aiming for at least one and a half degrees. Thank you.</p>

The strong words and declarations of the participants before the start of the UN conference did not translate into concrete ambitious and legally binding resolutions. Although the final text of the universal convention is expected in 2015, it is not expected to become legally binding until 2020, that is to say, in eight years’ time. Many world powers, which are also the largest polluters, thus left the conference feeling satisfied that they had avoided the new global rules. It appears that the European Union delegation was not sufficiently prepared to push through its objectives and force countries such as the United States, Russia, China, India and Brazil to actively engage in global strategies to combat climate change, and I am truly sorry about this.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I wish to raise a single matter, which is one of concern. This new climate agreement now excludes the possibility of compensation for emissions from deforestation, and this is a very worrying development, especially for European countries dominated by forest. Previously, of course, it was possible for the carbon sink, which is truly massive in these forested countries, to compensate for emissions. An example is to be found in my own country, Finland, where 85% of the land surface is forest, which is well looked after. The tree growth is 10 million cubic metres a year greater than the loss. This is a real slap in the face for these countries, and I hope that we can somehow bring about changes to this situation.</p>

It would be much better to have the courage to tax goods imported from the countries that pollute the most and to use the income to fight climate change.

The EU and the other Kyoto states have committed to new climate targets for 2013, but these countries are only responsible for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, the main polluters – China and the US – have not signed the Kyoto Protocol and were not prepared to agree in Durban on common goals for 2013.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, we need to consider carefully what we can do ourselves, for example, subsidies for public transport and agriculture. While imported kiwi fruit are so cheap that native fruit is allowed to fall to the ground and rot and while animals are transported all across Europe, we will still be saddling ourselves with unnecessary environmental problems. We must focus on our regional economic cycles and we must not shut down our industry because it is no longer competitive internationally when other global players are failing to follow the ground rules or even to accept them in the first place.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I fully share Ms Manner’s concern regarding the way in which carbon sinks are calculated. I am not going to speak any more about that, however. Instead, I wish to say that I am surprised that we here in Europe think as if the strategy according to the Kyoto model, with its emission ceilings, is the only way to save the climate. Considering the results, at least, it is not, so I wonder why we still adhere to it. If we look at the statistics, it is evident that the United States, for example, has cut its emissions in the last ten years or so more effectively than the EU, which is committed to Kyoto. The USA and the big emitters have rejected this model, as have Japan, Russia, Australia and, most recently, Canada, which said that it was remaining outside the Kyoto agreement because it was ineffective. Mr Kent, that country’s Minister of the Environment, said that if Kyoto was anything, it was a barrier, a barrier to an effective climate policy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We did not save anything of significance at Durban. We saved a model that we desperately cling to. However, the model has no support globally. Just nine countries have adopted the same tactics as the EU in reducing emissions. Kyoto accounts for 15% of global emissions. Should this not inspire this House to demand real results? Now that we are looking for a common new agreement for everyone, the EU must abandon its obsessions. We therefore need something more comprehensive, more satisfactory to take its place. Only that could be called an effective policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would first like to thank you for all your kind words, which I will also convey to the very hardworking people in DG CLIMA when I see them tomorrow. I know they will appreciate that very much. So thank you. I will make only three points.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, in response to some of the recent interventions, I would say that those who were always rather sceptical towards Kyoto should be very happy with what happened in Durban. Because what we are talking about – what we actually did achieve – has been one of the key priorities for the European Union for many years, namely achieving an international system in which not only the traditionally developed countries but all the big economies should be equally legally bound. This is not a trivial thing for Europe. It was always an essential thing, and the further we move into the 21st century, the more it is clear that you cannot cope with a global problem by having only those countries that were labelled as developed countries back in 1992 being obliged to do something. That was the big step forward in Durban, namely that all countries in the end agreed that in the future they would somehow have to be legally bound and that we would be equally legally bound. I believe that there the allied effort involving the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) played a role, because while it may not have mattered that much in Beijing and Washington if Europe asked them to commit, when a total of 120 countries – among them the most vulnerable and the poorest countries in the world – said that they were ready to be equally legally bound, then it is clear that the pressure on China and India, in particular, grew, so that in the end they shifted their position. This was significant.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second point is directed at Dan Jørgensen. Basically I agree, as Dan knows, with many of the things he says. If it had been better to say, at the last minute, ‘no, we do not want it’, then we must also ask ourselves what the alternative would have been if Europe, Norway and a few other countries had taken a second commitment period and then – full stop. If that had been the outcome of Durban, would the fight against climate change then have been better off or would it not have been better off? Would we have achieved more or less? I think it is beyond dispute that we would then have achieved less in Durban.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can always reflect on what would have happened if we had said no. Would we have another chance in 2013 or 2014 in Doha? But sometimes, as politicians, we have to try to cash in what can be cashed in when it is possible to cash it in. My basic point to Mr Jørgensen is that it is not a question of either ‘bottom-up’ or ‘top-down’. It is not ‘either/or’, but rather it is ‘both/and’. We must have both the international framework – the rules – and the regional, national, local, business and all the other efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why I believe that we actually did make some progress although, as I said at the beginning, not nearly enough. I believe that if the timeframe here is important and if we agree that it is important to stay below the 2°C – and there is a matter of urgency here – that is why we also still need to have an element of ‘top-down’.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is my third and last point, because I agree with those who have said that the process is still fragile. Many battles lie ahead. So I agree that we cannot now afford to sit in Europe and just wait for whatever comes next in the international negotiations. That is of course precisely why, over the past 18 months or two years, the Commission has come up with a communication on how to move our targets, with our low-carbon roadmap and the energy roadmap; has proposed an energy efficiency directive; has come up with substantial Multiannual Financial Framework proposals with a substantial climate, environment, energy-efficiency and resource-efficiency component; has come up with a proposal on energy taxation; and has come up, as requested, with tasks and values. The list is even longer.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is very much proof that we in the Commission do not think we should sit idly waiting for the big international agreement. We must continue to move forward in Europe. I agree very much with Corinne Lepage and others who say that this is also about economics. It is about how we, as a region and as an economy, will become more competitive through energy efficiency, resource efficiency and using intelligent climate and environment policies as a driver for innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Other regions in the world – our competitors – are joining this race. We are still the front runner. I look forward to working with the European Parliament to ensure that Europe stays in that position. If we are to achieve that, we will soon have to be extremely busy getting all the initiatives the Commission has proposed through the Council and Parliament. We look forward to working with you on all these issues.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Prior to the summit in Durban many questions were raised – what position would the European Union take, was there a chance that all countries would move in the same direction and manage to work out a compromise by 2020, what about the sale after 2012 of CO2 emissions from unused limits under the Kyoto Protocol? Personally I believe, and I always underline that we must not forget about the current economic situation caused by the global economic crisis, where many markets, and not only European ones but also global markets are wondering what will happen in the near future. All these questions are affected by globalisation, the financial crisis and the interests of individual countries, so I think that the position of the European Union should be a compromise and take into account the current economic situation in the world and in Europe, the position of both people and entrepreneurs who create jobs together with the views of the world’s largest economies, such as India, China and the USA.</p>

      <p sl="pl">At the conference in Durban the European Union made another attempt to implement the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol commitments. During the conference, Poland was labelled ‘fossil of the day’ for its constant unwillingness to reduce greenhouse gases. Those who sought to find ways of reducing emissions and implement these were deemed completely unreasonable.</p>
      <p sl="pl">EU commitments should be conditional on comparable commitments from other world economies in order to safeguard the competitiveness of the EU economy. In addition, the largest developing countries should be adequately involved in the process, according to the conclusions of the European Council of October 2009. At present, Europe emits only 11% of the total CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and fully meets its commitment to reduce emissions, as stipulated in the protocol. Only concerted action can help fight climate change. The European Union should not agree to extend the Kyoto Protocol without the participation of these key countries. This scenario would result in a transitional agreement relating to only a fraction of emissions. Therefore, the EU’s ability to provide effective global leadership in the fight against climate change will largely depend on its ability to attract large emitters to join the fight against climate change in a legally binding manner. Solidarity and fair and equitable distribution of reduction commitments should be the pillars of the further development of climate policy in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">At the end of November and beginning of December last year, a conference on climate change was held in Durban, South Africa. The need to keep the global average temperature increase below two degrees Celsius was one of the key themes of this international forum. As I stated last year, this goal is also one of the main priorities of the European Union on environmental issues. However, it is quite difficult to evaluate the results of this conference. On the one hand, the Durban conference paved the way for a common legally binding agreement on reducing the increases in emissions and greenhouse gases and keeping the global average temperature increase below 1.5 degrees Celsius, or a two-stage threshold. It is still only path to a binding agreement. What is most important, however, is that it was possible to find a consensus among the biggest producers of emissions and greenhouse gases, including the United States, because only through a common approach will a starting point be found on the issue of climate change.</p>

Although we cannot say that Durban was a huge success, we can still applaud the fact that through intense negotiations, delegations from the 190 largest economies have committed to the long haul. The greatest success, without a doubt, was managing to keep the two most reluctant parties at the negotiating table: the United States and India. The United States have always been sceptical about climate change, and India, meanwhile, is among the emerging powers that refuse to acknowledge their part in the current climate situation and that believe that this is the responsibility of the long-standing industrialised countries. This is actually true, but can the historical responsibility of Europe and the United States justify the irresponsibility of major polluting countries?</p>

      <p sl="hu">At the Cancún Climate Conference, it was brought up as a solution that in exchange for contributing to the European Union’s 30% emission reduction commitment Central and Eastern European Member States should be allowed to a limited extent to carry over their unused emission allowances. This solution seems favourable in several respects. Firstly, even during an economic crisis the whole of the European Union should strive to be at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Through appropriate regulatory means, European companies could be encouraged to undertake innovations in energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and water and resource efficiency. In future such technologies in the service of energy and resource efficiency will represent the foundations of European competitiveness. Without innovation there can be no competitiveness, without a competitive economy there can be no employment, without jobs the European social model cannot be sustainable. Secondly, such an agreement could also be to the advantage of the Central and Eastern European Member States. The reason for this is that by selling their climate assets they can make up for missing funds necessary to implement a shift to an economic model based on sustainability. In Hungary’s case the estimated value of these climate assets is around EUR 900–1 000 million; revenues of this amount could be an immense help in achieving a green economic turning point in Hungary. I therefore encourage Member State representatives in the Council to agree on the carryover of Central and Eastern European emission allowances during the term of the Danish Presidency, which has a positive attitude towards this initiative.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the Council position at first reading with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (Recast) [07906/2/2011 - C7-0250/2011 - 2008/0241(COD)] (Rapporteur: Karl-Heinz Florenz) (A7-0334/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-326-000" speaker_id="1038" name="Karl-Heinz Florenz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to start at the very heart of the matter by explaining what exactly we are talking about when we mention waste electrical and electronic equipment, because many people will say: all this stuff about waste electrical and electronic equipment really does not matter very much. One million mobile phones contain 250 kg of silver, 24 kg of gold, 9 kg of palladium and 9 tonnes of copper. One tonne of mobile phones contains 50 times more gold than one tonne of the earth from which gold is extracted. This illustrates just how valuable raw materials are and it can be shocking to learn just how casually materials are illegally shipped from Europe. Waste is exported to Africa, India and China, where it is recycled under ruinous environmental standards; while we can achieve 90% quality with our recycling and reuse, other countries compare quite badly with only around 18 or 19%.</p>
      <p sl="de">The significance is clear. For this reason, I am actually quite happy that we have taken the right approach with some of the fundamental questions in this directive: illegal shipments of waste are becoming rarer because we have introduced the reversal of the burden of proof. Yet, we are once again faced with the question of whether Member States, including my own country, are really prepared and able to provide personnel to enforce these regulations at the customs posts in our ports.</p>
      <p sl="de">Which brings us to another important point, namely collection targets. These collection targets have been significantly increased. Sweden manages to collect 16 kg while one wonderful country to the south with a city with which I share my name collects a paltry three kilos. On the one hand, we have a marvellous achievement and, on the other, a disaster. The collection quotas in many of the founding Member States of the Union are 3 and 4 kg per person. This will be seen by our children as a sign of our inadequacies, because we are selling off our raw materials or sending them to the waste tip, where no one will ever be able to reach them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Luckily, we have reached these collection targets. Unfortunately, we have had to deal with an extremely phlegmatic institution of the European Union in the Council, which has shown itself to be not particularly friendly towards Europe throughout the negotiations. Let me give you an example: if a business in Europe produces a light bulb today, then sometime in the future it is going to have to bring it for recycling. It then has to register 27 times in 27 different countries so that the recycling issue can be clarified.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is national politics at its worst. It is astonishing that a single registration suffices when it comes to the different VAT regimes, but not recycling. This is a tragedy for the Council. It is unfortunate that the Council has had its way here and that the small and medium-sized enterprises that produce light bulbs will have to register them separately in each of the 27 Member States of the Union in future. This alone will cost EUR 60 million per year for each individual process. I consider this to be disastrous.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although some red tape has been done away with, the Council naturally sees the money that businesses have to pay as an attractive source of income. Unfortunately, it is the Council and the Member States that have control of this money, leading to major toing and froing when a light bulb is first sold in France and then supplied to Italy through a dealer. An enormous amount of money moves around, something that could be managed much more easily through the use of modern technology.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Potočnik, I am personally very grateful to you and your staff for having played such a decisive role in the process. If it were not for you, these negotiations would have failed.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Council has behaved in a way I have not seen before in my 22 years of experience. I include my own country in this. The determination to link European environmental policy with economic criteria has declined to sorry proportions. Miserable national policies are being pursued, while we have not even managed to come up with a Europe-wide definition of the term ‘recycling’. The Member States can all do what they want.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have started along the right path. Nonetheless, we have a lot of work to do in getting the Council to move in the right direction. To reiterate, my criticisms are directed at everyone, not just one individual. Thank you very much for your patience.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members of Parliament, we have two important issues today on the agenda, one of course connected to the WEEE.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would first of all like to congratulate the European Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, and the shadows and their teams for the success achieved in the negotiations on the Directive on Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament and the Commission have been standing side by side in this debate, fighting for ambitious collection targets for e-waste to increase resource efficiency, fighting for a clear reduction of administrative burdens and fighting to give the Member States’ enforcement authorities an effective tool against illegal exports. By and large we have succeeded together. I am satisfied that the proposed directive as it is now on the table goes a long way towards meeting the objectives that the Commission set out to achieve with our proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, I would like to move towards these improvements more quickly and also further, as Mr Florenz mentioned, and I am sure many of you would too. But this directive clearly puts a new momentum and new dynamic into management of e-waste and it deserves our support.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just to give you an idea of what level of improvement this directive will bring compared to the existing directive, let us do a quick calculation. The current collection target for WEEE is four kilos per capita per year in each Member State. With 500 million citizens in the European Union, that means that Member States are obliged to collect around two million tonnes of e-waste out of 10 million tonnes of e-waste we generate every year. That is about 20%. In fact they collect rather more because some of the countries are overshooting that target.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new directive will oblige the Member States to collect the equivalent of at least 85% of e-waste generated, so by 2020, when we estimate that Europeans will be throwing away 12 million tonnes a year, we should be collecting at least 10 million tonnes of WEEE. Ten million tonnes including lead, PVC, chromium, mercury and cadmium that will then be treated in an environmentally sound manner; 10 million tonnes including gold, copper, silver and platinum and other valuable raw materials that can be pumped back into the production cycle, reducing production costs and also emissions. This calculation is perhaps not very scientific, but it nevertheless shows that we have taken a truly big step forward from the current WEEE directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Separate collection of WEEE is essential to making recycling profitable. Proper treatment is crucial to ensure that harm to the environment and human health is prevented.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are highly concerned at the environmental and human health cost of smash-and-burn methods used in some third countries. Legal and legitimate exports of used equipment declared to be for refurbishment have in the past been abused to cover up illegal exports of what was in fact treated as waste and was in quite poor condition. The Commission will therefore continue to work in international forums to prevent legal channels for exports of used equipment being abused for illegal waste shipments.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can say today that the Commission can accept the text negotiated between the institutions and will do its best to ensure smooth and full implementation after adoption by Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will make a number of declarations to accompany this adoption, which I will briefly summarise. Firstly, concerning product design: the Commission will assess the feasibility of introducing the respective requirements when adopting implementing measures pursuant to the eco-design directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we will state that transitional arrangements for Member States with difficulties meeting the new collection targets must be limited to exceptional circumstances. The difficulties faced and the specific circumstances on which they are based must be objective, well documented and also verifiable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, where nanomaterials are mentioned in the text, the Commission understands them to be those falling under the definition of nanomaterials set out in the Commission recommendation. Potential risks posed by such nanomaterials would be identified with tools available under the appropriate legislation for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, the Commission considers that to be consistent with the Treaty, the powers conferred on it to establish methodologies for calculating the amount of electronic and electrical equipment put on the market and the amount of WEEE, and to set additional rules on inspections and monitoring in Article 7 (5) and 23 (4), should be delegated powers. The Commission therefore informs Parliament that it reserves the right to pursue the legal remedies provided by the Treaty with a view to seeking clarification from the Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission will also make a declaration on the procedure for adoption of implementing acts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Used electric and electronic equipment is the fastest-growing waste stream and one that contains valuable materials and rare metals worth recycling into new products. Nowhere is it more clear that waste really is a resource and therefore crucial in achieving a resource-efficient, competitive economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, you have heard well. It is not only a question of environmental preservation; it is also one of the central questions of the competitiveness of European industry in the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to Karl-Heinz Florenz and the Commission for the work they have done. As we know, this is a new version of the directive that came into force on 13 February 2003, in other words almost 10 years ago. Unfortunately we have actually achieved very little to date if we look at the EU averages.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Florenz mentioned a few figures from various Member States and, as has been said, the differences are extreme. Let me quote some examples: Romania has collected 0.8 kg and Liechtenstein, which is not a Member State but which is not performing particularly well, 1.4 kg – while Germany has collected 7.8 kg, the Czech Republic 4.3 kg and the countries of Northern Europe have achieved great successes. We need to be clear about one thing: if we are not capable of establishing a recycling system in our economy, then we will come unstuck in the long term, because the earth only has a finite supply of raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason I believe that the statement the Commissioner has now made represents a decisive point because it indicates that ecological design must also include reuse, in other words the time after the product has been used, in the design phase.</p>
      <p sl="de">The old directive contained a number of weaknesses. These included the fact that there was no link to the Eco-design Directive. Of course, the rigid collection target of 4 kg is not appropriate to economic development in the various Member States, either. The current approach as set down in the new proposal makes far more sense, involving targets of 65% of the goods brought into circulation and 85% of the WEEE produced after the transitional phase.</p>
      <p sl="de">The abilities of the Member States to develop efficient collecting systems will also be of decisive importance, however. A lot will also depend on the dexterity of the Member States in lending a helping hand to consumers. Here too, the role of the consumers is vitally important in taking matters into their own hands. Door-to-door collections are not the answer.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the whole, it will be a matter for the Member States to decide how to implement this system. I have faith in the Commission to monitor performance closely, so that these collection targets are met. In the long term, this is our only chance to provide these vital resources for industry and to maintain the environment in the state we need.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, William Painter was the inventor of the crown cap and, at the end of the nineteenth century, he told his friend and colleague, King Camp Gillette – I assume he is the one who manufactured those razor blades – something to this effect: ‘If you really want to get rich, then you have to make products that people throw away’. I believe that the two gentlemen failed to realise at that moment that this was the beginning of what we now know as the throwaway society, for a long time a symbol of our progress, but today, in reality, a huge, huge problem.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When the directive came out for the first time in 2003, we turned our attention – rightly, because these things are still very important – to the problems that that throwaway society poses to our environment, air quality and soil quality and the social consequences of the poor dismantling and recycling of such electronic waste in developing countries. Allow me to reiterate that these remain very important arguments. However, as the Commissioner said, there is, of course, one further, additional issue, in particular the issue of the noble metals, those important raw materials used in our mobile phones and other electronic products.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As a result, during this recast, we have received enormous support from a particular segment of the industry. Support, ladies and gentlemen – and the rapporteur has already referred to this – that we have also received from the Commission, but unfortunately not from the Council, which, for one reason or another, is still in the frame of mind where it thinks that rules are not a good thing. Well, in this case, the rules are not only good, but they are also very much necessary, if we are to achieve our targets. Ambitious recycling targets, extremely robust rules for export and making sure that small products, in particular – for instance, our mobile phones, where we keep a lot of important information – comply with the more ambitious targets.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur – and I do so with a great deal of conviction – because it is under her able leadership and thanks to her experience that we have nevertheless been able to push through Parliament’s strong position as far as possible. However, as I said just now, the Council actually seems to be on totally the wrong wavelength. That is also the reason why I, together with my group, will definitely and with great conviction vote for this result tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, after touch and lengthy negotiations between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament delegation, an agreement was reached on the new Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I would like, at this point, to express my gratitude to Commissioner Potočnik for his excellent assistance and cooperation, as well as to the rapporteur Karl-Heinz Florenz, who demonstrated strong leadership and contributed to Parliament’s general strong stance and the final positive outcome. The new, better directive means that we can set the terms for more efficient, better quality recycling of electronic and electrical waste.</p>
      <p sl="bg">As you are aware, until now only 30% of this waste has been processed in accordance with the directive’s standards. The remaining 70% either ended up in rubbish dumps or was illegally exported outside the European Union, which means a significant loss of valuable raw materials for all of us. The new directive will create conditions for establishing a new common European market for collecting and processing electronic and electrical waste.</p>
      <p sl="bg">An open scope is envisaged for the directive, which means that six years after it comes into force, in 2018, all electronic and electrical waste will come under the scope of this directive. A new, more ambitious waste collection target will come into force after 2019, when we will collect 65% of all electronic and electrical waste from devices placed on the market.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Another new feature which will greatly help increase the volumes recycled and favour a more efficient raw materials policy is the obligation on sales outlets with an area of more than 400 square metres to accept small electrical appliances and electronic devices from consumers. Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely believe in the attributes of the new directive. I think that this is a great joint success for us and I believe that this is a success for all Europeans and their future benefit.</p>

Following an arduous consultation procedure with the Commission and the Council, we have arrived at a compromise text which we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, support. It is not a radical approach to the issue, but it is certainly an important step.</p>
      <p sl="el">As the Group of the Greens, we pushed, in particular, for collection targets to be increased and calculated on the basis of the waste produced, for distributors to be forced to collect waste electrical and electronic equipment without any obligation to buy it from the consumer and for stricter controls of such waste to be introduced in terms of reuse and exportation to non-OECD countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">We were the only group to make proposals on nanomaterials. We did not manage to squeeze a commitment out of manufacturers to state that waste electrical and electronic equipment contains nanomaterials, but we did manage to persuade the Commission to evaluate if selective treatment of nanomaterials in such waste is necessary.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I say how nice it is to see you back in the Chair again this week.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my view, this recast was proposed by the Commission as a consequence of failure – the failure by Member States to put in place effective recycling systems for electrical equipment in the 2003-2008 period – because in 2008 over 70% of waste electronics was still being landfilled, incinerated or illegally exported. That simply was not good enough. We all agreed on that. It was interesting to hear how much the Greens have apparently put into this, but I would like to lay its success clearly at the door of Karl-Heinz Florenz, the rapporteur, who worked so hard on getting a good solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">So now we have some changes. They are mostly welcome, but we do need to make sure that they will contribute to improving the situation. Collection targets have been considerably adjusted, both in their methodology and their ambition. Some Member States have been given more time. I approve of that because, if we want to work with them, they need to build effective systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am happy that Member States have retained significant control over many aspects – particularly financial – and especially welcome the fact that we have avoided any attempts at compulsory increases in costs for municipalities. But with this flexibility comes responsibility for Member States. I believe that consumers want to be able to recycle and reuse effectively, particularly in this challenging economic environment, so they must have the information and the opportunity to do so. Member States now have a flexible framework that we have worked very hard to deliver. The ball is now in their court to deliver their side.</p>

The open area of application is of decisive importance. This approach can and should set an example in terms of environmental legislation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am pleased that a collection target of 85% has been set, particularly because the Council held out stubbornly for lower targets for a long time. I constantly find myself saying: Parliament needs to flex its muscles. After all, people will only invest in environmentally-friendly technologies and innovation will only be encouraged if legislators speed up their work.</p>
      <p sl="de">With this in mind, I also welcome the fact that solar modules are not to be excluded from the directive. It was right not to rely on a voluntary, self-imposed commitment by the manufacturers. All too often in the past, Parliament has bowed to pressure and given in to such deals. These deals have also often proven to be just another way for the industry to drag its heels.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nonetheless, I do not agree with the way the directive deals with nanomaterials. It is essential that waste equipment containing nanomaterials should be dealt with separately. The report simply invites the Commission to investigate whether this is to continue to happen in the future, however. This is an extraordinarily weak formulation that is not worth a great deal. Nanomaterials can be hazardous for people and the environment during the recycling process. Some nanomaterials come with clear indicators stating that they are damaging to health. I am therefore calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation. If it is not possible to prove conclusively that these products are not hazardous, then they should not be allowed onto the market.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, however, I am satisfied with the results in this context. The perseverance of Parliament in its negotiations with the Council has paid off. I should also like to thank the rapporteur for this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive requires Member States to carry out separate collection of electrical and electronic equipment waste and sets collection and recycling targets.</p>
      <p sl="it">The agreement reached with the Council focuses on reducing the administration costs to manufacturers of the registration and reporting procedures. It has raised the recycling target by 5% and set the collection rate at 65% by the end of 2016, with mandatory collection of small equipment by retailers, luckily only for outlets with a surface area of more than 400 square metres.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am in favour of the text, which is the result of a compromise that takes national requirements into account and safeguards small manufacturers, as at an earlier stage of the discussions mandatory collection also applied to smaller shops. It is crucial for the success of the new collection system that Member States no longer allow unauthorised collectors to receive domestic appliances that no longer work, as these would no longer be part of official recycling calculations.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are undoubtedly talking about a highly sensitive and important issue.</p>
      <p sl="it">As Mr Florenz pointed out, when we talk about waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), we are talking about dangerous pollutants that endanger both the environment and human health, and we are also talking about an extraordinary opportunity for recycling raw materials which, as we know, Europe desperately needs. These are precious metals and rare earths, such as indium, which costs thousands of euros a kilo.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I wanted to respond to what Mr Florenz said, because he made a reference to my country. While it is true that it is not at the levels of northern Europe where WEEE recycling is already well-established, it is also true that it has made extraordinary progress in the last few years and that there are vast differences within the country, because in northern Italy we have very high collection levels.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my region, the Veneto, for example, which is in third place, we already have a substantial collection that exceeds 5-5.41 kilos, and peaks of excellence such as Belluno, with 7.36 kilos, while Emilia Romagna, for example, serves 100% of its citizens and therefore has total coverage. This trend is very positive, rising 27% in the last year.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore I believe we must consider what has been done thus far as an achievement and appreciate that we are on the right track. We need to launch a large-scale information campaign for citizens. Essentially we need to reinforce all the existing structures, and maybe also to update the figures as these might not have kept up with the rapid pace of improvement.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, waste electrical and electronic equipment is a source of household waste which is seeing one of the fastest growth rates, while also being one of the most dangerous. The majority of this waste is not managed properly and ends up in landfills, thereby discharging toxic chemicals into the environment.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I therefore welcome the proposal from the Commission for improving and increasing collection. However, as in other areas, the situation on the ground differs hugely from one Member State to another, which must be taken into consideration so that the legislation is effective and easy to apply.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In Romania the electrical goods market is not yet saturated. In other words, we are not throwing away yet as many electrical and electronic goods as other Member States. It would therefore be important for us to have more time available to adapt to the ambitious targets set by the new regulations. The gradual rise in collection rates in the next seven years, which has been established as part of this package, partially provides us with the flexibility we need.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In overall conclusion, the compromise that has been reached strikes a balance between the ambitious nature of the targets set and a realistic deadline allowing them to be achieved. I wish to thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs for the work they did and the results they achieved during what were extremely tough negotiations with the Council.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate Karl-Heinz Florenz on his success. This was a truly Herculean task. He and the committee have worked on this topic for over three years.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not wish to repeat what many of my fellow Members have said, but instead would emphasise one small aspect that is very important for the public. I am talking about energy-saving bulbs. Energy-saving bulbs make sense and use 80% less electricity than conventional incandescent bulbs. However, they contain rare earths that need to be recovered, as well as a small amount of mercury. They contain 200 times less mercury than the thermometers that were still in common use up to a few years ago. This mercury needs to be disposed of correctly, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have given citizens little guidance in this area in recent times. I experienced this myself in the town where I come from: I wanted to dispose of some small items of electrical equipment, but I was told: you need to take that to the recycling centre outside town. It is open every Tuesday until 15.30. Is there anyone in regular employment who would have time before 15.30 on a Tuesday? The service must be made more user-friendly. That is why I have drawn up an amendment with some of my colleagues, requiring that energy-saving bulbs and other small items of electrical equipment should be returned to the shop. Alternatively, a different, user-friendly solution must be found. I am grateful to Mr Florenz and the shadow rapporteurs for having pushed this amendment through. This is a signal to the public that we take their problems seriously, that we include them in our deliberations, and that we want to make it easy for them to return such equipment, so that it can be disposed of correctly.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, may I, first of all, pay my compliments to the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job. His task was certainly not an easy one. The fact is that we literally have gold lying in the streets. We are actually throwing precious metals away, even though we can really no longer afford to do this, at this time of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Modern products – as we have already heard: not only mobile phones, but also printed circuit boards and, actually, all modern electrical and electronic equipment – are packed with all kinds of stuff that we want to get back. This is what we have addressed in the directive. It deals mainly with collection, but it should not just be about collection, because if a butcher takes apart a mobile phone, he will not be as skilled at it as a specialist.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Therefore, this is ultimately not just about collecting electrical and electronic equipment. We also have to ask ourselves if we really want to recover the materials that we are interested in from that particular piece of equipment. For that reason, when you talk about collection, you also have to look at reuse, dismantling, pre-processing, recycling and remelting. In addition, we need to look at recovering as much as we can and recovering the best quality resources, instead of just recovering what is easiest to recover. Because we all know that this equipment will very soon be dumped across the border, and that will be harmful to the environment and we will not even have managed to recover the materials that we want from it.</p>

The work on this report required extraordinary diligence, and many meetings and consultations with various stakeholders. Unfortunately we have different opinions on this subject, but most of us strive to achieve the same goal: to reduce the quantity of waste electric and electronic equipment. At the moment this document is of crucial importance, because we are talking about wanting to save resources, whilst using waste, namely waste from electric and electronic equipment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have difficulties, in Europe, in finding raw materials to produce electronic equipment. Here is a hint: we can actually move forward because those raw materials are in our waste. We must not disregard this waste. The volume of waste should be reduced by recycling. It is also very important to extend the life of equipment. Currently we use equipment for a very short period and often novelty causes us to replace it quickly.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should also replicate the best practices in operation in Europe, identifying the relevant country and model. One last thing - penalties are a last resort in law enforcement. Let us first show that there are good models and implement them.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for far too long Europeans have generated waste with no or little concern about end-of-life recycling. Even now too few citizens instinctively deal with their waste electrical and electronic equipment. For example, last weekend, when I wanted to return a power strip to my local DIY store, the salesman did not have a clue what he was supposed to do with it. Fortunately, his supervisor told him that, in his shop, there was actually a collection point available to customers, which he only found out about at the same time as me. There is still a long way to go in this area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As we have already said, currently only 33% of waste electrical and electronic equipment is collected and treated appropriately.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will therefore be voting in favour of the text negotiated fiercely by Karl-Heinz Florenz, and I congratulate him for the outstanding work he has done throughout recent months. I congratulate him because he has set each Member State a target collection rate, by 2016, of 85% of waste electrical and electronic generated by their country. Above all, he gives them the resources to achieve this through increasing the number of collection points for this type of waste and reaffirming the principle of free waste disposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This directive will allow progress to be made in terms of collection. It will support and reinforce a gradual change of behaviour in European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Get sorting citizens of Europe! It does not cost anything, it is good for the planet and good for future generations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I take this opportunity, Mr President, to congratulate you on your election and ask you to make your contribution to energy efficiency by trying to raise the temperature in here but use less air conditioning.

      <p sl="sk">Improperly treated or even untreated waste from electrical and electronic equipment is a significant threat for the environment and the health of people living in the European Union. The rapidly increasing volumes of this type of waste require a speedy response in the form of the adoption of modern and responsible legislation that will encourage more separate collection and recycling. I firmly believe that it is essential that the EU and Member States give clear guidance to companies so that they manage resources better, including by recovering discarded but still usable equipment or their component parts. Sustainable production is closely related to the development of innovations and intelligent recovery of the resources already available.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the reform of the Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment and emphasise the need for investment in recycling raw materials and rare earths since the mining, refining and recycling of rare earths have serious consequences for the environment if they are not managed properly.</p>

The new method of collection calculation will be introduced gradually, which is important, since it allows individual countries to adapt to the changes. I believe the introduction in large retail stores of free collection points for used equipment is a great success, as has already been mentioned. This is without a doubt one of the strong points of the new regulation. It is axiomatic and good that this principle has finally been settled. I think the compromise negotiated by Parliament and the Polish Presidency is balanced. The changes will contribute to raising the level of environmental protection and human health. Manufacturers will also benefit from these. By limiting bureaucracy big savings will be made possible.</p>

The season when companies publish their annual figures for the year just past and their expectations for the coming year. We all know that these will be poor. They will be disappointing. Of course, we have the economic crisis, high unemployment and disappointing sales to blame for this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, I will tell you a secret. The explosive increase in the cost of raw materials will be reflected in almost all of these corporate figures. These materials have gone up in price by dozens of percentage points in recent years. That will have a lasting impact on the European economy. That is also the essence of the directive that we are discussing today. Because we are throwing away hundreds of kilos of gold, silver, platinum and cobalt without reusing them. The Council ought to give this issue top priority. Unfortunately, the Council seems to be penny-wise and pound-foolish.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, two short answers, and a little bit longer one, about the past and the things with which we are dealing today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, on the differences in the Member States, it is true that the challenges they are facing are huge, but it is an absolute fact that the opportunities which they have – especially those countries which are on the lower level – are also huge. They will have to take that on board.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, on nano-materials, I have stated clearly that they do deserve special attention, and they will have special attention, under the appropriate legislation. This is an issue to which quite a lot of attention is being awarded, including inside the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, about the past and why I have said that the environment and business are both under consideration today. I do consider this past – which we have tried to address in the best way through the roadmap to resource efficiency – as one of the most central stories of today’s European future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many countries in Europe today are indebted. If we want a proper answer, we will not have it without stimulating growth. If we want to address the issue of growth properly, then we will have to focus on the competitiveness of the European Union. So the competitiveness of the European Union is a real problem. These things which we are proposing – better use of resources, a more intelligent use of resources – are the central issue leading out of the problems which we have. I hope we will understand that. As mentioned by Mr Gerbrandy, the prices of these resources are increasing extremely fast. This is a totally different trend than that in the 20th century, when the composite prices of raw materials fell constantly, except during World War One and World War Two and the oil crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the first decade of the 21st century, it is just the opposite. If you take into account that Europe is extremely import-dependent, and if you take into account that, in the cost structure, this accounts for much more than the labour, then what is actually happening in the companies is logical. They are refocusing from innovating in the area of labour incentives and labour productivity to productivity which is connected to the resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the past we are talking about. We are talking about something which is a central piece of the problem that Europe, in the financial and economic crisis, is today talking about.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what we will hopefully vote for when we adopt the new WEEE legislation is one of the central pieces of that past, which will give the right part of industry, which is forward-looking, a clear signal and clear incentives that this is the way we want to go and that this is what we are talking about today. That is why I am extremely happy that the target which was set quite high has remained unchanged.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to thank sincerely Parliament as a whole, but especially Karl-Heinz Florenz. It was really enjoyable to work with him, because his skills and also his understanding of the problem really gave us the opportunity to work hand-in-hand.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the successful negotiations, thanks to which a crucial directive on European resource efficiency has been adopted. We are all aware of the fact that as the quantity of our waste electronic equipment rises year by year Europe is faced by a myriad challenges. Unprofessional collection and treatment not only entail serious health and environmental implications, but in carelessly letting such equipment ‘go to waste’ Europe is also losing valuable raw materials in an increasingly intense global competition for resources. The current recast of the Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment provides a suitable framework for addressing these challenges. Indeed, the compromise reached stipulates for Member States collection targets which are not only ambitious, but also take account of the consumption habits of the various countries. In Eastern Europe, for example, there is a smaller chance of consumers replacing their household appliances within three to four years after their purchase, and will rather continue to use their old devices in their holiday houses. With its four kilograms per capita per year target, the ‘one size fits all’ approach of the previous directive was unable to address such market specificities. One of the most important aspects of the present agreement is therefore that, depending on a Member State’s choice, the amount of products introduced to the market or the amount of waste products actually generated can be used as the basis for the calculation of collection targets in the future. This option makes the achievement of the objectives of the directive realistic and it can thereby make an actual contribution to increasing European resource efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) generates 9-10 million tonnes of waste each year in the EU and it is estimated will reach 12-13 million tonnes by 2020. WEEE that has not been properly treated poses a significant danger to health and to the environment and can contain hazardous material, such as mercury (in switches), lead (in solder) or cadmium (in batteries). Under the EU’s 2020 strategy, the EU is determined to improve the recycling and reuse rates of WEEE and to tackle the expending of resources. I welcome the directive’s strong measures, especially the provisions that say that it should be easier for consumers to have access to WEEE facilities and that free WEEE recycling facilities should be made available in any sales centre larger than 400 square metres. That would put extra pressure on producers and on small businesses, and therefore, I support the report’s recommendations in relation to simplified reporting responsibilities and measures to prevent the implementation of double-costing of fees for producers, who are responsible for waste management costs.</p>

Barely one third of electronic and electrical waste is processed according to requirements, with the remainder bound for landfills or illegally exported to third countries.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The new directive marks an important step forward towards a more extensive recovery of this waste, because it sets high targets: 85% of generated electronic waste (or 65% of electronic equipment placed on the market) must be collected through an organised scheme by the end of the decade. Requirements are being introduced for drawing up standards for the collection, processing, recovery, recycling and reuse of such waste, by which means the same hi-tech requirements are to be established in Member States.</p>
      <p sl="bg">One very important aspect is the electronic waste collection schemes, especially the possibility for electronic equipment businesses with an area of more than 400 m2 to take back small waste electronic equipment, which may actually increase the level of organised collection. The new directive’s complete entry into force is envisaged after a six-year transition period. However, by that date all electronic waste will, in theory, come under its scope, which will eliminate both potential environmental threats and the waste of a genuine, rare resource.</p>

Following the rules for chemicals in the REACH Regulation and the Regulation on Pesticides, we are for the first time also regulating the authorisation and placing on the market of biocidal products. In the third trialogue with the Polish Presidency on 17 November, we were able to reach an agreement at second reading. Today, we can say that we – the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission – have succeeded in making major improvements in respect of environmental protection and consumer protection, but also in terms of providing for a simple and faster European authorisation procedure. At this point, I would like to thank everyone involved – my fellow Members, colleagues in the Commission and also the Council – most sincerely for their excellent cooperation and for their readiness to compromise and work together.</p>
      <p sl="de">Biocidal products are essential for a high standard of health and hygiene in our society. Disinfectants and pesticides protect against dangerous diseases and are used to protect highly perishable materials. Biocidal products are, however, also used as preservatives, for example in paints or wood preservatives or as sealants for automobile lacquer or to treat furniture and fabrics. Thus, we come across biocidal products very often in our day-to-day lives. They have an effect and thus also a side-effect that can be dangerous to people. The 1998 Biocidal Products Directive contained no harmonisation of active substance testing and product authorisation between the individual Member States, and lengthy coordination procedures among different national authorities made authorisation almost impossible.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we also need regulation in this area on account of the incidents that have occurred in recent years where sofas and boots imported from Asia have resulted in skin irritation and poisonings. In future, only goods that have been treated with biocidal products authorised in the EU may be placed on the market here. Our aim is to find a balance between benefit and risk. We have laid down stringent exclusion criteria for active substances and products. However, we are aware that the risk associated with not using biocidal products also needs to be taken into consideration. Where there is a risk of danger, it must also be possible to have exceptions. These are clearly defined and apply only if an active substance is necessary for reasons of public health or animal health or if not authorising the biocidal product would have negative consequences for society.</p>
      <p sl="de">Consumers want to be informed. Thus, there will be labelling requirements in respect of the name of the active substance and its biocidal properties, relevant instructions for use and indications of danger and any content of active substances in nanoform.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our aim is to achieve faster EU-wide authorisation of products and active substances. For Parliament, this can be best achieved by means of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). In order to avoid a back-log of applications or authorisations, we have agreed on the introduction of the Community authorisation system in stages. Products with low-risk active substances are to be authorised EU-wide by the ECHA by means of a simplified procedure. We want a uniform internal market. Therefore, Member States can only refuse an authorisation on their sovereign territory in clearly defined circumstances and with the consent of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">The authorisation procedure must be efficient and simple. If it is just the colour or the aroma that is to be changed, then we do not need to go through this whole authorisation procedure again. Studies must be made available under controlled conditions in order to avoid the duplication of animal experiments, but also, ultimately, to share the costs. Only if research companies have the opportunity to recoup the high costs of testing active substances and getting products authorised through the marketing of the products will they also be prepared to invest in future. All users must be fully aware of the effects of biocidal products, in particular those who use these products in a professional capacity on behalf of others. If I try and get rid of lice on my head myself, that is at my own risk and I am doing it for myself. However, if I go to a professional hairdresser for this purpose and pay him for it, then I expect him to have had the best possible training and the risk-free use of the products to ultimately be guaranteed. Thus, his training must include information on the use of biocidal products. The same applies to pest controllers, car body painters, painters and joiners.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Parliament, we will not lose sight of the demand for a directive for the sustainable use of biocidal products – just as we will monitor the implementation of the regulation, which is now the responsibility of the Member States. We are all aware that this sort of regulation is not set in stone. There are sure to be more amendments and additions over time. Even now, some issues remain unresolved. For example, the demand for the delegated acts that give Parliament more rights of scrutiny in accordance with the new Treaty of Lisbon. It is certainly the case that political decisions are often involved in the implementation, too. It is important that Parliament be involved in the decision making when it comes to setting fees and with regard to the authorisation of active substances. In these areas, we have not been granted the involvement that we are entitled to and therefore we will make it clear in a written statement that this does not set a precedent for future legislative acts. Democracy requires the participation of elected representatives, in this case the participation of the European Parliament. I would like once again to offer my sincere thanks to all of those who have contributed to this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would firstly like to thank Parliament, in particular the rapporteur, Christa Klaß, and also the shadows for their constructive engagement with the Council and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">This has resulted in a compromise text that provides an excellent basis for strengthening the internal market for biocidal products while at the same time ensuring a high level of protection for humans and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is also very happy with the pragmatic solutions that have been found for difficult issues, such as the scope of EU centralised procedure for products, the transitional arrangements for moving from existing directives to the new regulation and the rules for dealing with treated articles.</p>
      <p sl="en">Throughout the negotiating process the Commission has insisted on the need to ensure that the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki would have the necessary resources to carry out all the tasks it has been given under the regulation. These have been expanded considerably during the course of the negotiations. To this end, the Commission has produced a revised financial statement, and I would like to take this opportunity to remind Parliament of the need for the appropriate amounts to be included in the future budget allocations for the agency. I would also like to thank you in advance.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the Commission is supportive of the compromise text and does not wish to stand in the way of its adoption, there are two important issues which it would like to draw to the attention of Parliament. Firstly, the Commission considers that, to be consistent with the Treaty, the regulation setting the fees to be paid to the chemical agency should be in the form of a delegated act rather than an implementing measure. The Commission therefore informs Parliament that it reserves its right to pursue the legal remedies provided by the Treaty in order to seek clarification by the Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, in relation to the definition of nanomaterials, the Commission believes that it would have been better to include a simple cross-reference to the recent Commission recommendation on nanomaterials rather than to embed the definition in the text of the regulation itself. Therefore the Commission would like to emphasise that the approach taken in relation to the biocides regulation should not be understood as constituting a precedent for future cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will make declarations on these two issues, and it will also make a declaration on setting the level of the fee for applications for mutual recognition payable to the European Chemicals Agency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having said this, I would like to make it clear that we regard the compromise text to be voted on during this plenary as an excellent basis, both for strengthening the internal market for biocidal products and for ensuring a high level of protection for humans and the environment. This is the most important thing, is it not?</p>
      <p sl="en">This regulation strikes the right balance. It will ensure that we can develop safer products and use biocides efficiently to control the spread of harmful pests and germs, but it will also keep the most dangerous substances off the market, particularly those that cause cancer or fertility problems, and will also keep them out of the environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Klaß for the work she has done here. It was certainly a very difficult dossier, and we spent a long time grappling with it before we found a common line, particularly among the different groups.</p>
      <p sl="de">Biocidal products must, by their very nature, involve active substances that entail a certain amount of danger, otherwise they would not have any effect. Achieving the balance is the big challenge. Our consumers cannot understand why many active substances should be more dangerous in some Member States than in others. Therefore, it is also important from the point of view of the single market that we put this European authorisation system in place here. It is very important that we make progress in this regard and make it clear to consumers that the single market should apply in this important area, too, and what is dangerous and prohibited in Denmark should not be authorised in other Member States like Italy or Portugal, either. We have also clearly defined the substances for which we are prepared to accept exceptions, so that Member States that want to go a step further are actually able to do so. We have surely therefore fulfilled our task of ensuring a high level of environmental and consumer protection while, on the other hand, also recognising the special characteristics of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The importance of this matter is also demonstrated by the fact that, these days, we can probably say that there is hardly anything that we handle in our day-to-day lives that is not treated with these substances. There have also been rumours recently that there are problems in various hotels in this wonderful city, where certain small animals are seemingly terrorising the place. Here, too, we see that it is perhaps necessary to do something to combat these animals. I just mention this in passing.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact is, we want to create this single market. It is also the case that we are in favour of all products that are placed on our market only being permitted to be treated with substances that have a European authorisation. Thus, no preference is being shown here to imported goods. That is also important for our consumers to know.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have also tightened up the requirements relating to animal experiments. In this regard, results obtained by other producers must also be incorporated so that as few animals as possible are used.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, this is a perfect compromise. I think all of the groups have worked well together, and Ms Klaß has done a very good job here.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, every now and then, environmental organisations arrange media events where they present blood that they have tested – either from some of their staff or from well-known people, actors, singers or sometimes even from children. Unfortunately, these tests always show that we are all walking around with chemical residues in our blood. That is not all. It is also possible to find chemical residues in the umbilical cord that connected a child to its mother. Many of these residues come from very harmful chemicals, chemicals that are carcinogenic, endocrine disrupting, toxic to reproduction, bioaccumulating, resistant and toxic, in other words chemicals that are extremely dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="da">This legislation is intended to help solve this problem. It will ensure that we will get some of the most dangerous chemicals on the market replaced now. What is more, these chemicals are in some products that we all surround ourselves with every day. After all, biocides are actually a good thing. There are biocides in detergents, that is quite sensible. Biocides are used to impregnate textiles and furniture and so on – and that is also quite sensible. However, it is clear that if we have biocides and chemicals in general so close to us in our everyday lives, it is important that they do not contain substances that are extremely dangerous. It is therefore good that we have now adopted legislation that will ensure that we will phase out the most dangerous of these substances.</p>
      <p sl="da">There are also a couple of other really good elements in this legislation. We are strengthening the rules regarding the labelling requirements for the products. We deal with nanomaterials in biocides in a different and more detailed way. We have set out a plan for how, in the future – once the Commission has submitted a proposal for it – we are to have legislation regulating the use of biocides. We have at last introduced the possibility of allowing a country – despite the fact that we have a common approval procedure – to be granted exemption and prohibit a pesticide where it may be hazardous on grounds of climatic or special national conditions when it might not be so in other countries. I would therefore like to thank the Commission, the Council and my fellow Members, particularly the rapporteur, Ms Klaß.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would like to apologise on behalf of Corinne Lepage, our shadow rapporteur, who is unable to attend this evening because of the presidential campaign. On her behalf, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Klaß, who has had to leave for a few moments and who held her own in the Council during the second reading on biocides, and, of course, the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent collaboration. Commissioner, Ms Lepage also wishes to thank the Commission for adopting such a constructive attitude and making every effort to promote the compromise that is on the table this evening.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that we have succeeded in establishing a viable system that provides better protection for the environment and the health of users, and it was by no means a foregone conclusion. In particular, we have ensured that the new central authorisation system does not result in a gradual blackout of the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki. The approach adopted – which is a three-stage approach – is the right one and it is also right that for September 2013 priority should be given to low-risk biocidal products and products used primarily for human hygiene and veterinary hygiene purposes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I said, the compromise thus improves the system on several fronts: clear criteria for excluding from the market products containing the most harmful substances, the establishment of provisional criteria for endocrine disrupters, better monitoring of nanomaterials, compulsory labelling of treated products and new rights for us as consumers, including the right to request information about these products from the manufacturers. That was one of Parliament’s priorities, aimed at preventing further scandals, such as the sofa scandal, which you might remember, whereby a large French company imported from China sofas containing unauthorised substances, which resulted in serious burns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do have one regret, however: the price Parliament has to pay for these improvements is giving up its right of veto concerning the amendment of the list of authorised active substances, and that is a great pity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, on the whole, the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is obviously pleased that, with this regulation, with REACH and even with the Regulation on pesticides, Europe is today equipping itself with the world’s most ambitious legislation on chemical products, nothing more and nothing less.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Klaß, and the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Polish Presidency on their constructive work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From now on, consumers will be guaranteed better information. Ms Ries spoke about the sofas imported from Asian countries that contained fungicides and we all know the consequences these had for consumers, including extensive skin problems and severe erythema. Consumers should absolutely have been informed that items had been treated, but that was not the case until now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is essential to reinforce the substitution of highly dangerous active substances by strengthening the exclusion criteria but also by limiting the derogations and introducing national guarantees for the adjustment of the conditions of use of product authorisations. We welcome, too, Commissioner, the specific and detailed provisions on nanomaterials, which you mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is a very important matter because we will be informed, there will be labelling, and substances such as nano-silver will have to be specifically authorised and assessed separately, which is justification for the validity of the methods used for the supporting assessment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The only damper on things – as has been mentioned – is that Parliament has lost its right of veto regarding the approval of active substances. It would seem that that was the price we had to pay for these improvements.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this proposal on biocides is not perfect but it does present to us a perfect example of a European compromise.</p>
      <p sl="en">The draft regulation emphasises the introduction of EU-wide authorisation procedures which should operate alongside national approval structures for biocidal products with similar conditions of use, which I welcome. I also welcome the introduction of the concept of low-risk products with a simplified procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is all moving in the right direction but there are still some areas of concern. I wonder particularly whether we have got the issue of confidentiality right. Transparency is, of course, essential for consumer safety but innovation could be stifled by disproportionate disclosure demands. It is important to be consistent, and I wonder whether the Commission is prepared to consider how this stacks up against the confidentiality and transparency issues in the REACH regulations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, the composition of products is only one issue. It is also important to think about how they are used. The proposal requires the Commission to come forward in three years’ time with a report on how this regulation contributes to sustainable use, particularly for professional users, and I welcome this initiative from Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Balancing environmental and consumer protection and promoting the single market are always a regulatory challenge, but I think this proposal has moved us some way forward.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendation concerning the handling of biocidal products that is to be decided upon tomorrow is extremely important. We encounter biocidal products not only in disinfectants or pesticides; they are also in furniture, lacquers and products that we handle every day. They provide us with a very high level of protection in relation to hygiene.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore important for us to examine this proposal. From the result, we can see that the highly toxic biocidal products will disappear from the market with this legislation. We have established that the loopholes in the commercial chain will be closed by means of a clear labelling system. I consider this to be extremely important. Consumers will then know what they are buying. However, it also demonstrates a high level of understanding in this area that, in addition to national defence, we are also able to allow exceptions in the area of animal disease control. After all, in this area the threat to animals and people from animal epidemics or other diseases is very high. It is therefore right and important for us to allow exceptions here. This decision is justified by its proportionality.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I do not believe it is important for us in Europe to decide how these agents are used. That is something that is subject to the principle of subsidiarity and should be decided by the authorities in the individual Member States. Climate change, transport and many other external influences can deter the use of particular agents or prevent comprehensive implementation. That is why we are leaving that up to the local authorities. We will then surely succeed with regard to biocidal products and the protection of people against toxic substances.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I would like to thank my fellow Members in Parliament who have contributed to our success in tightening up several aspects of the Commission’s proposal. I think it is extremely important that we have managed to expand the criteria for which substances are to be subject to the cut-off.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The clearer labelling that will now be introduced is also extremely important and this will hopefully deter consumers and thereby reduce the use of several questionable biocidal products. What is the benefit of triclosan in children’s underwear for example? What informed consumer would buy that for his or her children? However, these things currently appear to be a better choice because they are labelled as being ‘antibacterial’, and there are clearly some parents who believe that it is better to buy such things despite the fact that they pose a risk, even to their own children.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It worries me that this type of substance, which will possibly not fall within the cut-off criteria, is being used to an ever increasing extent, and therefore I look forward to the Commission presenting a new proposal for a directive on the sustainable use of biocidal products which will also tighten the rules for those substances that are not as dangerous as the very worst ones.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Christa Klaß, for a fine piece of work. This report introduces new rules for placing biocidal products on the European market and brings a number of advantages, most of which have already been mentioned here. These include mainly the right of consumers to information and a ban on the use of extremely hazardous materials, such as carcinogens, as well as the mandatory communication of data Europe-wide, which should prevent the duplication and multiplication of tests on animals, while simplifying data protection and harmonising the fees in individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The regulation strengthens the position of the European Chemicals Agency, but at Member State level there are demands for retention of the power to withdraw permission to place a product on a Member State market on public health grounds. The ‘submission fees’ paid to the European Chemicals Agency for submitting a request at national level have also become a legitimate target of criticism. Despite this justified reservation, we are ready to support the regulation.</p>

I am especially pleased with the result and with the broad-based interinstitutional negotiations that have taken place over the last few months, as many issues that were adopted also in previous opinions are acknowledged here. For this I would like to thank Ms Klaß for her excellent and I imagine tiring work.</p>
      <p sl="it">We can confidently state that when this regulation comes into force it will ensure that internal procedures in the European single market are smoother, thanks to simpler authorisation procedures reinforced at EU level, as well as greater monitoring of human and environmental health, as many here have acknowledged. The criteria for removing products that harm living organisms from the market have been reinforced, and at the same time there are exclusion clauses for certain products which have to be used but only when strictly necessary in safe and controlled conditions.

That said, the centralised authorisation system will definitely have positive repercussions on the internal market, because it will allow equal application of the requisites in all the Member States. In order to streamline bureaucratic procedures for small and medium-sized enterprises and facilitate the entry of biocides onto the market, we needed to remove comparative assessment, still required for biocides that have been proven to be safe for use.

Special attention must be paid in this case to the protection of children and pregnant women. The main threats to health are substances that have been identified as carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic or toxic to reproduction and biocumulative, as well as substances with the properties of endocrine disruptors. I therefore agree with the explicit prohibition of the approval of these active substances and EU citizens ought to be confident that none of these hazardous substances are present in the objects of everyday use and especially in drinking water, food or materials and objects intended for contact with food. I also welcome the fact that it is possible to harmonise at a European level, but the costs for small and medium-sized enterprises should not be ruinous.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in relation to the recommendation of Parliament for the second reading of the regulation on the placing on the market and use of biocidal products, the Council and Parliament have adjusted their common position, where the Council has taken on board a large part of the proposals of Parliament, but only in a modified form. For the sake of consistency and clarity, it was necessary to remove a number of inconsistencies contained in the text amending the proposals. The position of the rapporteur, Christa Klaß, who states that to achieve the declared objectives it is necessary to eliminate the shortcomings of Directive 98/8/EC on authorisations and to simplify the entire decision-making process, is legitimate, and should, I think, be collectively supported. The warning of the rapporteur about the duplication of regulations concerning labelling with other legal acts indicates that, in our legislative work, we should monitor more closely the various links and related legal measures. The safety of handling biocidal products, especially in the environment of their professional users, is also a serious related issue, which we will also have to monitor very closely.</p>

      <p sl="en">On the question of sustainable use: for the record, we are in favour but we still need to work on the review of active substances used in biocides. We will have a lot of work to do to implement this regulation – delegated acts, guidance documents and so on. Therefore, let us focus firstly on the regulation and look at sustainable use on the basis of the report provided for in Article 17a.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, a short comment on confidentiality – an issue addressed many times in relation to this proposal over the past two-and-a-half years. In my opinion, we have the right balance in the proposal between transparency and the legitimate protection of commercial interests. Transparency was already a central principle of the Commission’s initial proposal and, on the other hand, changes were introduced into the text limiting the amount of information which should be made public.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises, we in the Commission are very sensitive to the needs of SMEs, and the regulation does include a number of provisions that will help smaller companies: the possibility of waiving information data requirements thereby reducing costs; compulsory sharing of data; the provision on tests on vertebrate animals; a simplified and much less burdensome authorisation procedure for biocidal products based on safer ingredients, and so on.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The aim of the new European biocide regulations is to exercise tighter control over the impact which they have on health and the environment, while also simplifying the procedure for authorising the products. ‘Biocides’ are products designed to fight harmful organisms and pathogenic germs. They are used to protect human and animal health. They include disinfectants and insecticides and are used for preserving materials, embalming or painting ships to prevent fouling from algae and micro-organisms. The EU has fairly old legislation in this area, which has been in force since 1998. Updating the legislation is a natural step to ensuring that only safe products access the market. The new regulations cover new areas such as furniture and textiles. The most hazardous substances, either carcinogenic or toxic for reproduction, should be banned or used with greater care. The measures also provide a simpler authorisation procedure for placing products on the European market. As far as animal testing is concerned, applicants must share studies on vertebrates in exchange for fair compensation. In the future, an authorisation system needs to be introduced at EU level to establish a harmonised European biocides market.</p>
