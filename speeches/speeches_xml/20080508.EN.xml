      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Alexander Stubb, replaced by Ingo Friedrich, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the framework for the activities of lobbyists in the EU institutions (2007/2115(INI)) (A6-0105/2008).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-008" speaker_id="1264" name="Ingo Friedrich" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, the background is as follows. With the Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament's powers will substantially increase again, and in view of this increase in powers, it is particularly important for us to carry out a precise analysis of the legislative process once more. As we do so, we see that interest representatives – or lobbyists, as they are often called – also play a very significant role in Brussels. We estimate that there are as many as 15 000 interest representatives working in Brussels, of which 5 000 are already registered with the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our task, then, is to establish a framework in which lobbying activities can be conducted in a fair and acceptable way. Parliament has maintained its own quasi-obligatory register of lobbyists from as long ago as 1996, as well as a very precise code of conduct. The task now is to see whether a similar arrangement can be achieved for all the European institutions. The contents of the report to be voted on today therefore represent an important step towards more transparency: in other words, towards the provision of accurate information about who has participated as a lobbyist – an interest representative – in the development of European legislation, how they have done so, and in which areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we wish to establish ethical and moral standards governing these lobbying activities. Thirdly, there must be proper safeguards in place to ensure the independence of the political decision-making process in Parliament and the Commission. Lobbying activities must be removed from the grey area, as it were, so that we have a clear and factual picture of where influence is genuinely being brought to bear. We have therefore introduced the following elements into the report, which are new features compared with the previous situation: firstly, a relatively wide-ranging definition of what lobbying means, or what it is, namely 'activities carried out with the objective of influencing the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the EU institutions'.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second new feature is the introduction of a 'legislative footprint'. This would mean that when a new directive is deliberated and adopted in a parliamentary committee, the committee secretariat would annex a page to the document listing which associations had participated in the debate and whether they did so in the framework of a public hearing or other type of meeting. This list should also help the interest groups themselves to see who was involved in the process, and who did not wish, or was unable, to participate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, our aim is to establish a common register for interest representatives in the EU institutions. It remains to be seen whether this really will happen with the Commission and Parliament. We intend to set up a working group to look at this issue. It would of course be easier for all lobbyists if we could get a kind of 'one-stop shop' where they could register and sign up to indicate that they intend to comply with the rules. That is the aim, but as the rapporteur, I must say that I am not certain at this stage whether we really will get a common register. At any rate, the registers need to be linked up so that it is a straightforward process, in terms of the bureaucracy involved, to set up this common register. Paragraph 21 also talks about the requirement of financial disclosure, which would be an entirely new element. We also talk about the option of sanctions which should apply to lobbyists who breach the code of conduct. Here, we have to consider what kind of sanctions we want. The Greens' idea is to have a black list, but in my view, this is reminiscent of a pillory in the Middle Ages. Black lists are really not appropriate in a democracy. What we would want instead is for inclusion in the register to confer such a high degree of prestige that serious-minded associations will want their name to appear in the European institutions' official register. It must be a prestigious and desirable aspiration, not only because they are then issued with a pass to grant access to the institutions' premises, but also because inclusion in the register would be sought-after in its own right, signifying that the association concerned is recognised as an important and useful interlocutor which is taken seriously enough by the institutions to warrant inclusion in the register. In the event of misconduct, the association would be struck from the register and the pass would be withdrawn: that would be the sanction.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yes, I will be as brief as possible. It is important that church organisations should not be defined as lobbyists. I am very disappointed by Amendment 3. Mrs in 't Veld from the Liberal Group has said that churches should be lobbyists. That really would run counter to everything we have agreed in Parliament to date. According to the Treaties, the churches are partners for our institutions, but they are not lobbyists.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, my assessment is that this is a major step forward towards a situation which is more transparent, correct and fair. I hope that we will thus set an example that can be followed around the world, showing how lobbying can and should be taken seriously.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am really glad to attend this plenary session where your discussion on the European Transparency Initiative will come to a conclusion. I have been following your debates and have participated in your debates in different committees. I am convinced that the report as it stands is a real step forward to improving transparency in the European decision-making process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the positive reaction of the European Parliament to its suggestion to consider an interinstitutional approach for a register and a code of conduct for interest representatives, who think that such a one-stop shop for registration would best serve the purpose of enhancing transparency, while avoiding an unnecessary administrative burden. I think that your report is an excellent starting point for discussions in the future interinstitutional working group that you suggest.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to underline one point. The European Commission is convinced that the activities of interest representatives are legitimate and offer valuable input in the decision-making process, but things have to happen in a transparent manner. This is why the European Transparency Initiative aims at opening what is too often perceived as a black box. Citizens, stakeholders, decision-makers and the public at large can then form their own views of what is going on in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I look at what information Parliament and the Commission expect registrants to disclose, I observe that, here again, we largely agree. The Commission considers that it is important to know who the interest representatives are, what interests they represent and against what financial background. It goes without saying that non-respect of the rules of the code of conduct must be followed by sanctions. Sanctions would mean suspension or even withdrawal from the register.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission announced that it would launch its European Transparency Initiative Register in spring 2008. I can assure you that we expect to meet this deadline. Having recently talked to the services, I expect the register to open in six weeks’ time. We have also decided that the register is a pilot project and that we shall review it after one year, which means in early summer 2009. The European Commission is ready for discussions with Parliament and the Council of Ministers, as well as the two consultative committees, in working towards the development of a shared system.</p>

      <p sl="es">Firstly, Mr President, it is a shame that the Finnish Foreign Minister, Alexander Stubb, is not here today as he contributed so much in the Committee on Budgetary Control and to this report.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am here to give the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Following on from the final words of Commissioner Kallas, I would stress once again that the role of the Members of the European Parliament is to remain in as close contact as possible with all citizens – with interest representatives and with non-interest representatives – and that this Parliament therefore has to have its own rules. My office is open to anyone wanting to have a coffee with me or invite me for a walk. I cannot demand that people are registered in a special register. I cannot tell someone who is not registered that I cannot receive them in my party, the Unión del Pueblo Navarro. I cannot say ‘you must be registered’. No, indeed: administration is one thing, but the political function of this Parliament is something else entirely.</p>
      <p sl="es">We would therefore do well to have two ways of ensuring transparency. I was the rapporteur on transparency, that great project which has brought Commissioner Kallas here. Transparency must not prevent our contact with real life, with interest representatives or non-interest representatives.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thank you. I am sure that Commissioner Kallas understands this.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I am in a paradoxical situation, as has happened on a number of occasions, for example when the rapporteur, Mr Pistelli, who was in the vanguard of what will undoubtedly be the European Parliament’s position on transparency, was unfortunately disregarded by our committee. I am therefore delighted with what I am sure will be our final result today. It is impossible to imagine the markets functioning properly with transparency being anything other than the fundamental rule. We, the legislators, must apply that rule to ourselves, particularly as we know all too well that in our legislative process – and I say this to the previous speaker – our relations with external representatives, be they pressure groups or religious organisations – and that is directed at Mr Friedrich – play a decisive role in our European legislative process. It is our duty to set an example in this area, including going as far as ensuring the systematic use of this idea of a ‘legislative footprint’, which I think would be extremely beneficial.</p>

    <intervention id="4-012" speaker_id="4432" name="Claude Turmes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, without transparency, there can be no European democracy. Brussels already has a reputation for allowing the major corporations to call the shots and pull the strings. That is dangerous for the European project, and it is an issue which is of great concern to me on a personal level and to the Greens as a whole. As the European Parliament, we therefore have a responsibility to show our hand to voters in the run-up to the next European elections. We have a good report in front of us, but there are dark forces at work and they want to suppress two of its core elements.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, they want to prevent financial transparency. Without financial transparency, we can never be sure who is really behind the campaigns. I am astonished to find that it is actually the Socialist Group which is opposed to financial transparency and is thus undermining one of these core elements. As for the second core element which is being undermined, there are people in Parliament who assume that lawyers should not be regarded as lobbyists, even if they are not defending people in court, but instead are trying to pull strings to influence legislation in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me quote from the website of a law firm in Brussels. It says that because we are not currently regarded as lobbyists under this legislation,</p>
      <p sl="de">‘Therefore lobbying by lawyers will be more and more effective and goals are more likely to be achieved with legal support. Alber &amp; Geiger as a law firm exclusively specialised on lobbying and government relations will be at your side to assist you in reaching your goals within the EU.’</p>
      <p sl="de">As you see, even the law firms themselves are admitting that they are lobbyists. Ladies and gentlemen, that is unacceptable. If we allow that to happen, we will undermine our own credibility.</p>

      <p sl="en">Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. − Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs was very supportive of the Commission’s initiative and of the rapporteur’s stance. I think we supported without question that there should also be a coordinated approach between all the institutions. But, having said that, we would wish to emphasise the particular openness of this institution as a democratic decision-making body; further, that lobbyists should be treated equally. In that sense, in the longer term, we would want to move towards a mandatory register where everybody is treated equally.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to return, if I may, to the issue of lawyers as lobbyists, which Mr Turmes has just raised. There is an issue here, and I would ask everybody to have careful regard to the very nuanced definition that the Committee on Legal Affairs gave in relation to when is a lawyer a lawyer, and when is a lawyer a lobbyist? That definition was very carefully thought through, and I would ask that that is the one that be taken into consideration.</p>

    <intervention id="4-016" speaker_id="37676" name="Søren Bo Søndergaard" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs">
      <p sl="da">Mr President, the report that we are considering here is a good one. It is a step in the right direction – not a big step, but a step nonetheless. There is also a need for action, not because all lobbying is harmful, or because all lobbyists are evil, but because it is completely unacceptable that lobbyism has such a major influence without there being any binding rules in place on maximum openness in the area. Lobbyists have a major influence within the EU system. This is apparent from the sums that are spent on lobbying and from the number of lobbyists around.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, the report could be better and the controls on lobbyists could be strengthened if you were to adopt the amendment proposal, which is partly an extension of the statement from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. We must have a mandatory common register, which ensures full clarity and full transparency with regard to the amount of money that is being spent on lobbying. We must have a register and an ethical code of conduct for all lobbyists, including legal companies carrying out lobbying, that can enter into force before the elections in 2009. We must have effective controls and visible sanctions to be imposed on those who breach the adopted rules.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, it is also a matter of looking inwards. It takes two to tango. We are therefore proposing that lobbyists must be obliged to disclose the same information on expenses for an individual member that that individual member is obliged to disclose in his or her financial declaration. A little more control over ourselves would not harm our reputation amongst the electorate.</p>

    <intervention id="4-017" speaker_id="4540" name="Philip Bradbourn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, this House should welcome all initiatives which increase the transparency of the EU institutions, which is why I support the proposals before us today.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we must ensure that the nature of the work of each institution is also taken into account. Parliament to this end works in a wholly different way to the Council and at a different stage in the legislative process from the Commission. Taking this into account, a common single register for all institutions would, I believe, be very difficult to achieve and would in fact put in place an over-bureaucratic procedure for applying for access when lobbying only the Parliament. We are also an autonomous institution and I do not feel it is therefore appropriate for other institutions to dictate our policies in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to raise an issue which has previously been brought up in this Chamber by a number of colleagues: how NGOs, in particular, are financed by the Commission and, in turn, use this money to lobby MEPs into taking certain positions. If the end result of what we are debating is to increase transparency, the House must be provided with a certain amount of non-commercially-sensitive data on how these organisations who lobby us are financed.</p>
      <p sl="de">On a more general note, I express concern at the free access that some lobbyists have to Members’ office floors in this Parliament. Once in the building, people are freely able to walk around and have unrestricted access to private offices. Having the right to freely roam the building does nothing for transparency, but leads to malpractice by some individuals. I am sure Members have all experienced this. In many of our national parliaments, there are central lobby areas where lobbyists who have appointments can be greeted and escorted to Members’ office areas. We should, in my view, try to implement a similar system. Overall, I am pleased to see Parliament addressing the issue of transparency, but we must also ensure that the organisations who lobby us are just as transparent as we are.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, firstly, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I must say that I support the report we are debating this morning and will very likely adopt later on in plenary.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe this represents a major step towards transparency and control in an area which is undoubtedly surrounded by a great deal of myth. Lobbyists are not bad or good by definition; it depends on how they act and on how they are controlled.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must say that we Socialists have been at the forefront, right from the start, in reinforcing transparency and control and, as a result, democracy with regard to lobbyists.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Turmes, it seems that you have a fixation with the Socialist Group. Focus on other groups. I wonder, did the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety decide, in its opinion, to criticise the Socialist Group? You are speaking on behalf of the Committee on the Environment. I would ask you to please give your opinions on other groups when you are speaking on your own behalf and not when you are speaking on behalf of a committee.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe that the definition of lobbyists contained in the report is correct, although we should like more differentiation. Profit-making private companies are clearly not the same thing as non-governmental organisations or trade union federations.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the footprint is legislative. The common and mandatory register and code of conduct, the corresponding sanctions and financial disclosure are key issues which are correctly included in this report.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also draw your attention, Mr Turmes, to the fact that you insist that we Socialists are against financial disclosure, when some of your group’s amendments set limits on this financial disclosure, whereas we do not want any limits.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also want entry into force before the 2009 European elections and for the planned working group to complete its deliberations before the end of 2008.</p>
      <p sl="es">Do you know, for example, that the Socialist Group will support two of your amendments in this respect? You must be unaware of this.</p>
      <p sl="es">Myth and reality are being mixed up in this issue, but we Socialists, having been at the forefront of the fight for transparency and control, are not going to allow anyone to perpetrate a false myth that we have a hidden agenda. We have an open agenda which involves the citizens and transparency in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the increase in the power of the European Parliament under the Lisbon Treaty will put pressure on the aim of greater openness in legislative work. It is vitally important that the work of the EU is transparent and that the public knows who has had a say in the content of laws. The purpose of registration is not to restrict or hamper the work of lobbyists. Their work is important. The current system of registering lobbyists in the European Parliament is more, however, and above all, a matter of security rather than one of openness.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has changed a good deal since the first drafts presented by the previous rapporteur, now the Finnish Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Stubb. I am particularly pleased, as is my group, that the report’s wording is now a lot more forceful than it was initially and that the mandatory system of registration that my group supports is to come into being, because it establishes impartiality.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would like to refer to Amendment 3, which has already been discussed here. Some of the Members in my group support it, but as the current rapporteur said, and I am with him on this, churches are not lobbyists. On this matter my group is divided and it will probably vote two ways.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposes that the rapporteur may attach a list to his or her report of the registered interest representatives who were consulted during the preparation of the report. I hope in future this will be made an official practice. It would cause rapporteurs to listen objectively to the various points of view expressed. This way it might also come to light if someone was eating directly out of another’s hand.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I am glad to have the opportunity of taking the floor after the former President of Finland as we debate a report by the current Finnish Foreign Minister, Mr Stubb, who was until recently a Member of this House. The Lord does seem to move in mysterious way where Members are concerned!</p>
      <p sl="pl">The latest report by NGOs indicates that lobbyists’ influence on the European Commission’s decision-making process has become a serious problem. For example, lobbyists hold a significant number of experts’ posts in various bodies close to the European Commission. Five thousand lobbyists out of the 15 000 operating in Brussels have access to the European Parliament. These 5 000 need to operate according to very clear rules. The proposal to set up a common register of lobbyists is a good idea, as is the threat of sanctions. It is high time our electorate knew who the lobbyists are. Voters are entitled to know how lobbyists are financed, and which of them attempted to influence certain reports in various ways. This report is a step in the right direction. It is an attempt to regulate a situation that already exists.</p>

    <intervention id="4-021" speaker_id="4254" name="Monica Frassoni" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the Greens/European Free Alliance Group the watchword on the ex-Stubb report is transparency. There is undoubtedly a tendency – and we have heard from some of its exponents here – to underestimate, probably in good faith, the effects and effectiveness of lobbyists' work, possibly in ways that none of us can even imagine as serious Members who operate in good faith and are decent and respectful of others. The facts are clear and keep coming to light daily: for example, we have known for a few weeks now that 34 officials within the Commission are being paid directly by private firms.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some recent research has found that most of the Groups – with the exception of just one, my own, but probably others too – that most of the amendments they tabled on REACH originated from a lobby. Furthermore, it emerges that some of the officials assisting Members with their work in certain committees are or have been employed by firms and are now working for us as national experts; Members are obviously unaware of this.</p>
      <p sl="it">In our opinion, therefore, the work we are doing today does not put an end to the issue of lobbies, and I do not believe that the work of Commissioner Kallas ends with the report we are adopting today. That is why we have emphatically backed all the amendments and all the work done by everyone – including the Socialist Group, the GUE/NGL Group and the Liberal Group – on those amendments and texts aimed at improving the situation and enhancing transparency.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, there are still some problems concerning the Stubb report which we hope can be resolved at the vote. The first relates to lawyers: when lawyers work with us and seek to influence legislation they are lobbyists, even when giving a legal opinion. We hope that this amendment will be rejected.</p>
      <p sl="it">Next, there is obviously the question of determining when this code of conduct should enter into force. It absolutely has to do so before the forthcoming European elections, because otherwise we will be starting off another term, another excessively long period of time.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, Mr President, I really do not think that this question of lobbying can be settled by stating that we dislike it, or by criminalising lobbies. In our opinion the problem with transparency is finding out whom we are dealing with, what they are doing and who is paying them: that is, the issue of financial disclosure. The report perhaps does not yet make all of this absolutely clear, but it can be clarified, and here I agree with Mr Carnero about the tasks of the working group which is to be set up.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, of course lobbyists should not be made a scapegoat. Of course it is perfectly legitimate, in a thriving democracy, for the various groups in society to represent their interests and concerns pro-actively and bring these interests to bear on social processes. It is also entirely legitimate for them to address these issues to the men and women in the institutions which prepare and take the decisions. Indeed, as legislators, we have a duty to inform ourselves as fully and accurately as possible before taking decisions on any legislative initiative that we are dealing with, and take account of the concerns of stakeholders with all their conflicting views. It is also clear, however, that transparency is essential to ensure the fair representation of interests, and is crucial for the European Union's credibility. That is why our Group believes that the three institutions must at last set clear rules which must apply to all interest representatives. In our view, this is long overdue.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have a duty to demonstrate very clearly to our citizens that the European institutions are not acting as accessories to 'dark forces'. Lobbyists should therefore be required to disclose publicly whose interests they represent, what their objectives are, and above all, where they get their funding from.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Parliament’s working group on reform has been in Washington to study the US Congress.</p>
      <p sl="de">We saw how all lobbyists have to register their function and their income from their different clients. It is mandatory in the US and Canada and not voluntary, as the Commission proposes. We also saw how each member of Congress documented their budget, including every paid cup of coffee. If they can do it, why cannot we? Why cannot we be fully transparent with our secretarial allowances in the EP, and then demand transparency in the other institutions?</p>
      <p sl="de">At the last meeting of the Conference of Presidents we became aware of organised lobbyism in our own House. In a very big and nice room on the fifth floor of the Spinelli building, 28 multinational companies have their own office, the telephone numbers and e-mail addresses paid for by Parliament. This may be a very good scheme linking companies to MEPs, but no one presented this proposal for us; it was established behind our backs.</p>
      <p sl="de">The views of the small and medium-sized companies are missing; the views of the consumers, trade unions, green organisations are missing. It may be a good idea to rent facilities to lobbyists, but then everyone should be invited and an elected board could supervise the activities.</p>
      <p sl="de">Multinational companies are not those who most need our financial support. Support for the scheme has been hand-picked and not elective from the political groups. This is the latest lobbyist scandal I hope you will redress.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is my last political speech in the European Parliament. If I may have one wish, it will be for the adoption of the proposal from the Convention signed by 23 governments and every single member from the national parliaments, every MEP except one: make all documents and meetings open unless you decide a grounded derogation. This simple proposal will also solve most problems that bias lobbyism.</p>
      <p sl="de">We would then be able to see what they write to us or to the Commission and we would take part in the decisions on derogations from transparency, so we would know what is hidden from us and why. We need the lobbyists to raise and improve the laws. We need their knowledge and advice and counter-arguments from other interests. We need balanced or pluralist information since we were elected to serve all citizens equally.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is no secret that we live in a European Union in which events are bypassing citizens and increasingly benefiting the major companies. This is undoubtedly due, first and foremost, to the influence of lobbyists in Parliament, the Commission and the Council. Who would be surprised to hear, then, that the Alpine-Adriatic Convention which is so unpopular with the freight lobby is still not being implemented? Who would be surprised to hear that more and more small and medium-sized enterprises are being forced to throw in the towel because they are snowed under with paperwork and regulations, and because they are literally being starved of any support from the funding opportunities available, while industry giants – the multinationals – understand only too well how to exploit these opportunities and, grasshopper-like, constantly relocate from one Member State to another, leaving a trail of devastated jobs in their wake?</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us take the debate and the decision-making process on the much-discussed and contentious topic of the REACH draft legislation, which aims to improve safe use of chemicals, as an example: if citizens hear that out of 132 proposed amendments, 32 were identical and were accompanied by written recommendations from the chemical industry associations, if citizens hear this, they will of course steadily lose faith in Europe, and they will have the feeling that European policy-making is simply there to do the multinationals' bidding.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we want to prevent that, if we want to curb the growing Euro-scepticism, we must achieve a situation in which it is clear who is influencing decision-making in Europe, who is lobbying on behalf of donors and who these donors are, and who is seeking to bring influence to bear on the legislative process.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, number one: we congratulate Alexander Stubb on his elevation to Foreign Minister in Finland. Number two: we congratulate Ingo Friedrich and thank him for taking over the report and, hopefully, bringing it to a good end this afternoon. Number three: we support the concept and the direction of the Stubb/Friedrich report. But …</p>
      <p sl="de">I will now continue in German. After this twofold tribute to Alexander Stubb, a 'but' is necessary. It is good to have rules on lobbying, but in Parliament, we already have good rules, and I am not entirely sure that this attempt to achieve a combined arrangement is really a wise move. Transparency is a good thing, but it cannot work miracles, especially if it is essentially piecemeal in nature.</p>
      <p sl="de">Registration and disclosure of the financial interests of registered lobbyists are all very well, but what about the numerous letter-writers, experts, and our other contacts? How should we deal with them? Will we expect them all of them to be registered in future, and to disclose their financial interests? I do hope not!</p>
      <p sl="de">Then there are the exceptions: in particular, two exceptions are proposed in two of the amendments which certainly do not promote transparency. Amendment 3 has already been mentioned. The aim is to bring about a situation in which the churches will be deemed to be official lobbyists. In my view, this is not about transparency; it is simply the reflection of an anti-clerical attitude, and we should say 'no' to that.</p>
      <p sl="de">A similar attempt is made in Amendment 10, namely to achieve an arrangement, via an exception to the exception, which also does not serve the matter at hand. In reality, this is simply an attempt to penalise certain sectors. We should ensure that we have a transparent system and that we improve it. However, we should not assume from the outset that this now represents a major change compared with the current situation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we can be proud of the fact that the European Parliament in many ways is already at the forefront when compared to some national parliaments in terms of how we handle these issues. We already have a register of interests. We have a code of conduct for lobbyists, and we have an absolute prohibition on Members of Parliament receiving gifts. That is good. What the issue is here is whether we can extend this system to cover the other institutions. We are willing to embark on negotiations to attempt to do so, to try and reach agreement – because that would be better – and, secondly, whether we can upgrade the requirements and be even more at the forefront of openness and transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group supports the report, which attempts to do that. We also support many of the amendments which would improve the report and would indeed increase the transparency requirements. We are even supporting some of the amendments from the Green Group, but not an amendment which would actually limit the way it is written and would actually set a ceiling on the transparency requirement.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I was somewhat astonished to hear the spokesman of the Committee on the Environment attack the Socialist Group for being less transparent than the Greens, when in fact the Greens have an amendment which, if you read it literally, would actually put a ceiling on the transparency requirement. That is the position of our group. We are at the forefront of openness and transparency on this, and we do resent unwarranted attacks on our position by groups who are trying to portray themselves in public opinion as being the champions of all this, ahead of everybody else, when they are not.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree that there needs to be a compulsory register, a register accompanied by a code of conduct for lobbyists, but it should apply to all the institutions and above all, if I may say so, to the Commission. It is obviously vital that the code of ethical behaviour should lay down sanctions in the case of impropriety and make financial disclosure mandatory. These records should be easy to access and available for consultation via the internet; that would be ideal.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Friedrich report recognises that there are thousands of lobbyists seeking to influence the institutions' decisions, even though it should be acknowledged, all things considered, that in many instances they do provide MEPs with detailed information on various aspects of the measures under discussion. Personally, as those who know me will confirm, I am highly unlikely to be influenced by anyone at all. Notwithstanding that, in order to guarantee independent decision-making and oversee activities which are often geared to influencing the allocation of Community funds as well as the monitoring and implementation of legislation, rigorous ethical criteria must be scrupulously applied. I shall therefore vote in favour of the Friedrich report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in order to clear up certain misunderstandings and correct the populist statements made by some Members here and in the press, I wish to point out, too, in my capacity as a Quaestor, that the European Parliament has had rules to govern our relations with lobbyists for 12 years. These rules, set out in Rule 9(4) of the Rules of Procedure – which would be worth reading at least once! – stipulate that access to the European Parliament for lobbyists is controlled, regulated by access badges. In order to obtain a badge, lobbyists must fill out an accreditation form and provide a character reference and a letter signed by the police. The European Parliament keeps a register of all lobbyists, which is published on the European Parliament’s website. Accredited lobbyists must also comply with a code of conduct. Mrs Frassoni and others are thus stating the obvious. Any infringement of this code is punished by withdrawal of the lobbyist’s badge and exclusion from the register.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the proposal for a single register, I do not think that there is any need for such a register with the Commission since the European Parliament and the Commission operate in completely different ways and, consequently, have different relationships with lobbyists. In the interest of the separation of powers at European level, Parliament must at all costs continue to be the sole body responsible for its Rules of Procedure. The Commission can copy our excellent system but we must have the last word when it comes to our own Rules. The report adopts a cautious approach to this register and I agree with that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards financial disclosure, I do not see why accredited lobbyists should have to provide detailed financial information indicating the source of their funding and the allocation of these resources. Such a measure would be totally impracticable and counterproductive. I am also of the opinion that the scope of the lobbying is not always reflected in the financial means. An organisation’s good reputation and level of expertise are also crucial. I fully subscribe to the description of lobbying provided in recital D of the report. I must pay tribute to our former colleague, Alexander Stubb, with whom I did a lot of work on this issue, and I want to distance myself completely from the sweeping accusations made by the Greens who have spoken in this debate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the longer our esteemed colleague Mrs Lulling spoke for, the more points she offered for attack. The committee would like to have a common system in place in Brussels, because citizens do not make a distinction between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. To them, it is just Brussels; it is the EU! I think that a common system would be good, and, Mr Kallas, we appeal to you to allow the working group to convene swiftly after today's debate and to draw up common rules which would still leave the individual institution the requisite autonomy to make its own decisions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like the Council to be involved. The Council is a legislative body, just as we are, and of course lobbying plays a part in its ranks too. For that reason, the call to participate in this initiative goes out to the Council as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, we want a new system of transparency – a new culture of transparency – in Brussels, so that we can thus demonstrate openness and build confidence. Lobbying is good, and representation of interests must of course take place, but the rules must be clear. It must be a fair and honest process. We must ensure, above all, that it is not about selling opinions.</p>
      <p sl="de">With today's decision, we are taking a major step forward; that is beyond question. However, there is still a great deal of work to be done, because the devil is in the detail, for example on questions such as: who is a lobbyist? The definition which we have provided in the report is very broad. In essence, we are saying that a lobbyist is anyone who wants to influence us. Nonetheless, there are exceptions. The municipalities, the regions, the social partners, the political parties: all of these are institutions which are enshrined in the Treaties. They are involved in lobbying as well, but they are not defined as lobbyists in our system. We will have to define the boundaries for lawyers and the churches as well. These are questions which have yet to be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, financial disclosure is important, Mrs Lulling. This is the new step forward which has been lacking until now. Money is not everything, but money is used to achieve a great deal. It is time to start work, and I would like to thank Mr Stubb and Mr Friedrich and, indeed, everyone else who has made a contribution to this process so far.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I think the topic we are discussing today is extremely interesting. I should say that for once the European Parliament is showing the way on an issue not discussed at all in our national parliaments, least of all in the Greek Parliament, and one to which no solution has been found.</p>
      <p sl="el">There are three important political problems involved here. Firstly, how do we deal with the issue? Are we afraid of the way informal lobbyists go about their business or are we trying to operate transparently?</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe we must do as follows. We must operate transparently; we should not be afraid of the lobbyists or of their existence, and we should lay down some rules.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, how is transparency best achieved? The answer is with very strict rules, regulating even sums of money, or in a general compulsory framework. I must emphasise here that this register could very usefully be mandatory and shared by all three EU institutions.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, we are talking about groups operating informally, but within an institutional process. It is crucial to distinguish between different types of lobbyists. Greenpeace and Shell have nothing in common when they act as lobbyists. That is why this distinction is essential, at least in the register.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Lobbying is a legitimate part of every democratic system. Wherever democracy is not to be anarchy, clear rules must also apply to lobbying.</p>
      <p sl="sk">American lobbyists consider their law to be too strict; on the other hand, in the new Member States, no rules exist, to the point where people often think of lobbying as having negative undertones. Therefore the new EU model should be somewhere between these extremes.</p>
      <p sl="sk">My view is that the proposal to establish a common interinstitutional system for the mandatory registration of EU lobbyists, the disclosure of financial background and the ‘legislative footprint’ will contribute to the transparency of rules on lobbying. However, I also believe that after today's vote the churches will remain our partners and will not be classified as lobby groups.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am convinced that the Stubb/Friedrich report will eliminate all kinds of prejudices and negative views about lobbying and that European citizens will view lobbyists as specialists who bring knowledge based on practical experience, helping to prevent European legislation from having a negative impact.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, lobbying at the European institutions is a complex issue. On the one hand, access to the institutions’ activities is a consequence of the principle of transparency of their operation laid down in the founding treaties. It is also a way of bridging the gap involving the so-called democratic deficit, because expert organisations provide valuable expert analyses which have a beneficial impact on the quality of European legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the other hand, however, large international corporations can resort to specialist lobbying companies to influence the institutions’ work, aiming to promote the corporations’ own interests first and foremost.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The problem of lobbying at the European Parliament is gaining prominence as the competences of this House increase. We should therefore support the Commission’s initiative proposing cooperative interinstitutional work to define a framework of operation for lobbyists, including the creation of a common register of lobbyists. The principle of transparency pursuant to which lobbyists can access the work of the institutions should also be applied to the lobbyists themselves. Voluntary registration is not enough. It should become compulsory for lobbyists to register in order to gain access to the institutions of the European Union.</p>

I must say, I feel I should thank many of the lobbyists, for they have proved to be a source of considerable expertise in our day-to-day work. In my view, it is always good for Members to listen to all sides and keep their door open to citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we currently have 5 000 lobbyists registered with Parliament – all of whom we can recognise by their badges and who are accredited or certified, as it were – that works out at an average of six lobbyists for every Member. I think it is extremely important for us to utilise this expertise appropriately in our legislative work, for the fact is that Members cannot be specialists in every area. That is why it is important to listen to the practitioners and recognise that in reality, lobbyists do enhance our parliamentary work.</p>

However, we can make things better today by supporting the amendment calling for a mandatory register of financial interests and real sanctions for those who break the rules. In addition, we need to clarify what those people working in the Commission who are paid externally are actually doing.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As many people point out, lobbying is not bad in itself, but the problem is that when we centralise decisions it becomes easy for large companies to turn economic power into political power. At least four fifths of lobbyists are paid by big companies. That imbalance affects our legislation. Transparency must therefore mean that all amendments to legal texts submitted by lobbyists must be registered openly so that we can see who is behind them.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When the register of those who are allowed to come here is set up, I call upon Mrs Lulling to ensure that one third of the places are given to companies, one third to non-governmental organisations and one third to others. That will enable us to have a balance.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the debate about lobbying is always interesting and exciting. I enjoyed very much hearing the observations of the honourable Members, which reflect the understanding which was also mentioned here by Mr Leinen: the devil is always in the details. I totally agree with Mrs Frassoni that work will not be finished with this report or even with the opening of the Commission’s registers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure Parliament that we are very cooperative and we are doing everything we can to start this interinstitutional group and to work out a common approach as soon and as smoothly as possible. I would like to say that, in my view, this common register is not some kind of heavy animal which will threaten everybody. It is a common package of information, common storage of all necessary information so that all interested representatives do not need to submit different applications to different institutions, with these applications not being interoperable. This was your suggestion for how not to create a burden. But all other details have been discussed over the years since we started our debate about this in 2005.</p>
      <p sl="en">I shall only say – in answer to one point you raised – that there are, of course, a lot of complicated details in defining who is lobbying and on what subject. In our discussions we have met lawyers’ organisations. They have accepted our approach that, when and if they are really acting as lobbyists, then they must declare this as lobbying and they have no need to declare their activities as legal advisers or something like that.</p>

Serious and transparent lobbying activities help to enhance the efficiency of the decision-making process. Mr Turmes, you were not correct in what you said: financial disclosure is covered in paragraph 21. To that extent, you were wrong to attack the Socialist Group. I feel compelled to point that out.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, as regards the issue of lawyers, we cannot make the sweeping assertion that every lawyer is by default a lobbyist because he or she has studied advocacy and all that it entails. We have the correct definition before us: anyone who seeks to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the EU institutions is a lobbyist, and that includes lawyers.</p>
      <p sl="de">May I point out one error in the translation: 'municipalities' has been translated as 'Städte' in German. The US system is very detailed; indeed, it is so detailed that some senators produce 300-page reports at the end of the year, with the result that it is almost impossible to gain a clear insight into what is really happening in terms of lobbying activities in the US.</p>
      <p sl="de">From my perspective, it was interesting that the ultra-left and the ultra-right virtually converge in their fundamental criticism.

I have in mind, amongst others, regional representations, sectoral organisations, lawyers undertaking a lobbying role and research institutions.

      <p sl="pl">Regulation of lobbying should certainly be welcomed. At last there is a chance of transparent cooperation between Parliament and interested groups, namely lobbyists. It is proposed to create a compulsory register of all lobbyists interested in presenting and defending their interests at the European institutions. This proposal deserves our support. Entry on the register would allow interested lobbyists to access the European Parliament’s premises, attend committee meetings and also to make contact with Members in their offices, but without disrupting their work.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The effectiveness of civilised and therefore transparent lobbying largely depends, however, on the lobbyists’ behaviour. It will therefore be necessary to draw up a code of ethical practice for lobbyists at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Parliament should also monitor implementation of these provisions, especially as regards checking the veracity of the information on the register. Lobbyists providing inadequate or untrue information should be sanctioned. The sanctions imposed should be in proportion to the offence and serve as a deterrent, ranging from suspension of registration to permanent exclusion from the register inclusive.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be remembered that this new proposal was drawn up at the European Parliament’s own initiative.

      <p sl="et">The idea of a ‘one-stop’ register is a good one. It is important for the Council to be involved with the register as well as the European Parliament and the Commission. In the interests of usability of the data collected, a single data base, available on-line and accessible to all the institutions, should be established as a matter of urgency.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Manolis Mavrommatis, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the White Paper on Sport (2007/2261(INI)) (A6-0149/2008).</p>

    <intervention id="4-050" speaker_id="28574" name="Manolis Mavrommatis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank the Commission and Commissioner Figeľ for their initiative in drawing up the White Paper on Sport and the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan. This is the EU’s first effort to deal with sporting matters.</p>
      <p sl="el">May I also thank Commissioner Špidla for being here today in place of Commissioner Figeľ, who is travelling outside Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">My thanks also go to my colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education and to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. They have cooperated excellently in drafting the report on the White Paper on Sport.</p>
      <p sl="el">In the European Parliament report, the key points of the White Paper were covered by 16 conciliation amendments jointly agreed by all the political groups in the Committee on Culture. The main points were also covered by 426 amendments tabled to the lead committee and to the other seven committees, which gave their opinions.</p>
      <p sl="el">Doping is once again the focus of attention because there are unfortunate examples of it every year in almost every sport. Through the White Paper, the European Parliament seeks to adopt measures allowing athletes not be forced by their heavy schedules to resort to performance- and stamina-enhancing substances.</p>
      <p sl="el">In addition, internal and external independent checks on professional associations and sports organisations, as well as educating male and female athletes on the side effects of doping may help to curb this problem.</p>
      <p sl="el">Debates have focused on two issues of the financial side of sport. The first is sports betting. We in the Committee on Culture all agree that the possible deregulation of the gaming and lotteries market will be problematic for the funding of amateur sport so long as the existing system of state betting agencies provides it with considerable income.</p>
      <p sl="el">For this reason, the White Paper calls on Member States and the Commission to adopt regulations which ensure that amateur and professional sport is protected from any improper influence relating to betting.</p>
      <p sl="el">While continuing to protect the betting market, we are thus increasing transparency, and also guaranteeing the state aid for amateur sport, culture and other social activities.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second issue is the sale of media rights. As we all know, the 27 EU Member States go about selling television rights for major sporting events in different ways. This is especially true of Champions League matches and the UEFA Cup.</p>
      <p sl="el">Rights can be sold either individually or collectively, but they are the main source of income for professional sport in Europe. Similarly, rights to sports events are a vital source of programme content and income for many media owners.</p>
      <p sl="el">Parliament’s report also recognises the importance of fairly redistributing income among sports associations, however small, and between professional and amateur sport.</p>
      <p sl="el">The collective sale of media rights, which the Commission presents as incompatible with competition law, is therefore important for the redistribution of income. It may thus help to achieve greater solidarity among sports.</p>
      <p sl="el">We therefore call on the Commission to recognise collective sales and accept that such practical solidarity among small sports clubs is sanctioned by law.</p>
      <p sl="el">Lastly, as we stated in the Belet report on professional football, UEFA and FIFA should reach agreement and work with the agencies of the Commission. They must ensure that football is universally accepted by the citizens and Member States of the EU without losing its independence; it must not overstep the powers conferred on it by the statutes.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is important for everyone that UEFA and FIFA recognise in their statutes the right of recourse to common courts. We must, of course, accept the principle of self-regulation and the structures of the European model of sport governing the organisation of sports events.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let me end by reaffirming the satisfaction we all feel at the official recognition of sport by the Member States in the reformed Lisbon Treaty. We do of course recognise and respect the special nature of sport. It is of great significance for Member States and the sporting world in general that the EU will in future be able to substantially contribute to and promote European policy on sport.</p>

    <intervention id="4-052" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vladimír Špidla" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="cs">In the first place I should present apologies from my colleague Commissioner Figeľ, who cannot take part in this sitting because of a long-planned working visit to Egypt. I accepted the proposal that I should deputise for him with pleasure, inter alia because much of what falls within my competence is closely related to sport.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent report that he and his colleagues in Parliament have spent six months preparing. I am convinced that the report is a balanced document and deals with all the relevant themes. Thank you for the European Parliament's support for the White Paper on Sport and for your high level of cooperation with the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As the European Parliament has emphasised, it is important to recall the principle of the applicability of Community law to sports in Europe, whilst also respecting the specific nature of sport. Therefore the European Commission remains active on sport, and from now on will apply Community law, including the competition rules, to that area. The White Paper and its annexes are useful aids for sporting organisations and for Member States in the concrete application of the acquis communautaire to decisions in the area of competition and to judgments of the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="cs">On the question of the specific nature of sport, the European Commission will lead and support open dialogue with sports organisations, Member States and the European Parliament within the framework of the structured dialogue on sport. This dialogue will be conducted in such a way that issues of the specific characteristics of sport will be dealt with concretely.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The European Commission does not have any general objections to the amendments to be discussed at this plenary session, especially if their aim is to preserve the proper and equal participation of representative structures in controlling sport. However, we cannot agree with an unconditional obligation for young players to sign their first professional contract with the club that has trained them, because this infringes the fundamental freedom of free movement of workers.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Meanwhile, as you know, the implementation of the White Paper is continuing according to plan. Twenty-six of the 53 actions in the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan have already been carried out; this year, for example, three studies will be initiated (with results in 2009), on the following themes: sports funding, players’ agents, and volunteering in sport.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In autumn last year, under the leadership of my colleagues, Commissioner Frattini and Commissioner Figeľ, a conference took place on the high level of violence in sport, which identified concrete methods that could achieve an improvement in combating this phenomenon. The results of measuring the impact of sport on the economy can also be viewed as a significant success.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As far as the matter of ‘home-grown players’ is concerned, a short time ago the European Commission was handed the results of an independent expert report analysing UEFA’s rules. The European Commission is at this very moment examining the compatibility of these rules with Community law.</p>
      <p sl="cs">New possibilities for funding sport and physical activities have also been opened up by various EU programmes, especially the lifelong learning programmes ‘Youth in action and ‘Europe for citizens’. We hope that the Lisbon Treaty will soon come into force and we are delighted with the European Parliament’s support for the preparatory actions in the field of sport, which contribute to implementation of the new EU competence in this area.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Allow me to thank you once again for your contribution, support and splendid cooperation in this important, sensitive and very popular area.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Well, Mr Špidla has said it all. An important role has been set aside in sport for employment, for social affairs. Sport does indeed have an important social function, for example fighting problems such as racism. Racism in society is reflected by racism in sport.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am extremely glad of the attention that this White Paper pays to eliminating racism and discrimination, in both professional and amateur sport.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Sport also has many advantages for, to take some examples, social inclusion, integration of migrants or reintegration into the labour market. For this reason I welcome the Commission’s recommendation to direct the Member States to make use of the EU’s existing funds.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Furthermore, sport is becoming more and more professional, and there is a need for good training for sportswomen and sportsmen so that after their careers they can return to society.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have one final point: it is also important to improve the professional qualities of sports managers and for this reason we support a licensing system at European level.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I would like to thank the Members for their extremely pleasant cooperation on this report. I think, however, that it must have taken a great deal of time to achieve this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I find, sadly, that in some matters it does not go far enough. It is very important, in my opinion, to create guidelines to which sporting organisations can commit themselves. When it comes to State support, we should aim for the same treatment throughout Europe, particularly where professional sporting organisations are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I also find that the distinction between the specific characteristics of sport and the economic activities that frequently accompany sport is a little too explicit, because I believe that economic activities – including those that protect sport – cannot have exceptions made for them in the Treaty. That is fortunately also not mentioned in this report. That is also the reason why I wholeheartedly support it. I think it is good that sporting organisations have started talking more than they did formerly about this subject, and that is a significant step forward. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I am convinced that the subsequent legislative development of Article 149 of the Lisbon Treaty will positively benefit sport in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, in territorial terms or, in other words, on the ground, I believe that the European Commission, in exercising its legislative initiative, must act carefully with regard to the different local situations and the differences between sporting disciplines.</p>
      <p sl="es">Its contributions should be general and should respond to an overall European interest, and not to a thirst for interventionism. It must therefore be respectful of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is what the Committee on Regional Development thought. As a result, I welcome the amendments tabled by various parliamentary groups in this same respect and I hope that, this morning, the House can adopt these through a positive vote.</p>

      <p sl="en">Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. − Mr President, I welcome the white paper on sport and I particularly support the emphasis on securing greater legal certainty, because relying on a case-by-case approach in the courts has led to an inconsistency of approach in terms of governing sport. I note the actions that the Commission has outlined this morning, but I would like to ask the Commissioner to comment on whether it intends to propose guidelines to clarify which aspects of sport are governed by EU law and which are exempt and should be dealt with by sporting bodies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another issue which I believe the Commission needs to tackle urgently is that of illegal trafficking of children, especially from West Africa, to the European Union due to demand in Europe for talented African players. This has sparked a growth of unlicensed football academies in some African countries and I am deeply concerned that young children are being exploited by ruthless agents and then sold on to clubs as if they were commodities. Some find themselves abandoned in Europe, having sacrificed their family’s entire savings to pursue their dreams. Stronger action by Member States, European clubs and African governments should be taken to ensure that they do not participate in this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to ask the Commission what deliberations it has engaged in on the issue of sports and intellectual property rights, especially with the growing accessibility of sports footage on the internet.</p>

    <intervention id="4-057" speaker_id="38398" name="Esther de Lange" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs">
      <p sl="nl">I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding report and in particular, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for the attention that he pays to civil liberties, justice and home affairs in the area of sport. In particular, then, I call for the strengthening of cross-border cooperation between police forces, based on the exchange of information, while still respecting data protection, of course.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, it is our opinion that in stimulating the licensing systems, explicit attention should be paid to protecting minors and reducing discrimination, racism and violence.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly – and this has already been said – there is the matter of reducing trafficking in human beings. I am thinking primarily of the trade in children and the exploitation of talented young people, often from the third world, but also of the trafficking of women, in the context of forced prostitution at large sporting events.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the run-up to the new Treaty, the time has now come, Mr President, to translate this report into definitive action. I would therefore like to end with an appeal to the European Commission – and I know that I am now taking up the Feyenoord club song, ‘not words, but actions’ – an appeal for the White Paper and the outstanding words of Mr Mavrommatis to be put into action. As FC Groningen say: ‘let us once again shout for joy’, Commissioner.</p>

    <intervention id="4-058" speaker_id="28133" name="Pál Schmitt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="hu">Thank you, Mr President. Few people know that sport accounts for 4% of the European Union’s gross domestic product and provides employment for some 15 million people. If this statement is true, then it is likely that revenue and employment indicators for sport will be similar in the statistics for individual Member States. This stands in stark contrast, however, to the fact that some countries, unfortunately including my own country Hungary, spend only a tiny fraction of their national budget – something like a half of one per cent – on promoting sports and healthy lifestyles. There are therefore good grounds for asking who exactly is supporting whom? If we take the role of sport seriously, then sport should not just be a profit-generating sector; we should be seeking to ensure that governments not only put their moral weight behind sport but also much greater financial support than previously. In my opinion, the next generation’s health, their physical and emotional health, capacity for work – their sense of wellbeing if you like – is a strategic issue, and so I welcome the White Paper on Sport and the fact that the Lisbon Treaty is dealing substantively with this issue. Let us not forget that sport is an important educational tool; it is important for social cohesion and for maintaining health, and it contributes to our quality of life. In this case, however, the amount spent on sport – barely half of one per cent in some countries – is out of all proportion to the significance of sport as a social phenomenon. I sincerely hope that the ‘Pierre de Coubertin’ Action Plan that forms part of the White Paper will be taken seriously by the Member States and that the Commission will provide the necessary guidance and, where appropriate, economic assistance from the development funds at its disposal. I also hope that from now on no one in Europe will be able to say that they do not really know what we mean when we talk about sport, as the White Paper provides excellent guidance in this regard for all governments and sports ministers. As a sports leader myself, I am delighted that the document also refers to the autonomy, self-regulating capacity and specificity of sports organisations. I congratulate my honourable friend Mr Mavrommatis. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, first I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, for his excellent work and commitment to this report.</p>
      <p sl="fi">To begin with, I want to say that I think it is very important that during the implementation phase of the White Paper the policies on sport as a general-interest, non-profit, voluntary activity should remain priorities in Europe. It is also vital that through this document we are able to say we have respect for the specificity of sport, self-regulation and structured dialogue, and we therefore want to lay down guidelines for the application of European Union law in sport.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Furthermore, there is a crucial link between sport, exercise and public health. Current problems we have in Europe that we are trying to control are metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes and obesity. Healthy exercise enables us to prevent these problems in the best possible way.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Secondly, we need to realise that it is important for the European Sport for All policy to retain national gambling systems. They need to be preserved because they have created a unique opportunity to finance amateur sport, as well as culture, science and research. Other social sectors have thus benefitted from sport. This needs to be taken into consideration in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Thirdly, I want to mention that sport will acquire a firmer legal basis under the Lisbon Treaty. We also have to prepare for this new situation, with a pilot programme and budget headings for 2009 being planned now. We have to move on from words to deeds, and that also holds true for sport.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We can achieve much overall with the document being discussed. I would once again like to thank Commissioner Figel, and, in particular, that great man of sport, Mr Mavrommatis, who has done pioneering work to promote sport’s new march forward in the context of European culture and society.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the development of sport and support for its many facets is rightly considered to be one of the European Community’s strategic aims.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report deals with some very important issues related to regulation of the organisation of sport, and emphasises its economic dimension. I am very pleased to note also the prominence given to so-called sport for all. Supporting this notion is particularly important, because a large proportion of sporting ventures at club and association level are not undertaken for financial gain. For that reason they are in fact in danger of disappearing as the market has become so commercialised. Recognition of the importance of amateur sport is therefore in line with the idea of bringing sport close to the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report rightly draws attention to negative phenomena in the sporting world. I refer for instance to doping and to the exploitation of sports people. Even young sports people at the start of their careers are at risk, and protecting them is a priority issue. Hence the restrictive provisions concerning the transfer of young sports people and the approval of the principles regarding signature of the first contract with the club that trained the young person. This is a step in the right direction, as is joining forces to combat doping and coordinating activities at international level. Guaranteeing professional sports people the same rights as contracted workers is also important. Finally, I should like to congratulate Mr Mavrommatis on preparing a good report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the White Paper on Sport, following on from the own-initiative report on the future of professional football, known as the Belet report, is a substantial and necessary document. It was time for the European Parliament and the European Commission to tackle the issue of sport. However, good intentions are not enough to cope with the scourges and problems threatening our sports. In the face of scourges such as racism, mafia-style groups, violence inside and outside sports facilities, doping and the purchase of young disposable players from Africa or elsewhere, action is needed!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Given the difficulties such as the management of huge sums of money – notably in football but in other sports, too – the existence of agents of all types – agents for players, clubs, coaches – the dictates of ratings, the liberalisation of gambling, we need clear directives that allow for continuity and the development of European sports federations and leagues at both amateur and professional level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sport, the economy, finance, employment, diplomacy: today these are all closely related. Athletes should not have to pay the price even if they are also citizens who can and must act in good conscience. It is up to the politicians to assume their responsibilities. The European Union will have to do so at the Olympic Games in China in order to reaffirm that respect for cultures, for local religious beliefs and for democracy are essential and non-negotiable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will vote in favour of the report by Mr Mavrommatis on the White Paper on sport as it is an excellent report.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The Olympic flame is presently travelling across all the continents of the world, reminding us of the message of sport, for which we are indebted to the Greeks. They were of course the first to understand what a purifying role sport can play in human culture. Sport teaches us that people can compete with one another without causing harm, injury or even death; sport teaches fair play and offers everybody the same chances and the same rights. But modern times have made sport into a business, a milieu pervaded by the negative influences that we already encounter almost everywhere: money, corruption, lobbying, racial prejudice and also the new phenomenon of various performance-enhancing drugs, factors that damage the integrity of sport and reduce the positive potential that sport has for bringing up young people or breaking down barriers between peoples and races.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Therefore I welcome the Commission’s work on the White Paper on Sport and I value Mr Mavrommatis’s report. Both documents warn of the need to protect sport as a cultural value. I would also personally like to emphasise even more the need to support sport at the amateur level too, to create the conditions needed for people to participate in recreational sporting activity, which is not easy, especially in large conurbations, as well as making it financially accessible, which is a limiting factor for the socially disadvantaged. Sport offers children and young people an alternative way of using their free time and being active. It can serve all the generations in the same spirit, so we should also not forget older citizens and should instead look for further ways of making it possible for them to join in sporting activity. Sport is a means of improving physical condition, but obviously it also influences the human psyche. Professional sport is only the apex of a pyramid whose base must be created by sporting activity involving the greatest number of people on our planet.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it will not surprise you, but I do not welcome the conclusions of this report. The fact that it declares ‘sport is rightly subject to the application of the acquis communautaire’ flies in the face of all current evidence. It ignores the most public lament of sports bodies throughout Europe: that the Bosman and Kolpak rulings have left then unable to foster the development of home-grown sports talent. As a direct result, national teams are underperforming on the international stage.</p>
      <p sl="de">Even the president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, believes the rules need to be changed. But if sports bodies thought the current situation was bad, the Lisbon Treaty is going to make things even worse by providing the Commission with the treaty heading it requires to start interfering – I am sorry, legislating – over sport directly.</p>
      <p sl="de">The UK Government’s refusal to honour its promise to hold a referendum on the Treaty means we do not have the opportunity to save sport in the UK from the impending doom of Commission interference. Perhaps the vote in Ireland will save us all.</p>

I accept the publication of the White Paper on Sport with the hope that it will provide the foundations of a future consistent policy. I believe that when we speak of an European policy in this field, we should think, first and foremost, of our children, their health, future and social integration.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The encouragement of sport in the educational standards is an important factor for the psychological and physical development of our children, a major tool for the protection of their health. The adoption of the White Paper and the establishment of an integrated structure at the European level to develop, promote and implement common policies in each type of sport, starting from sport for the youngest all the way to professional sport, not forgetting, of course, people with disabilities, will offer all citizens opportunities for participation and personal involvement in the community and contribute to the encouragement of the intercultural dialogue.</p>

      <p sl="nl">What should have been a memorable moment here this morning, namely the approval of the report on the White Paper, has been overshadowed by the tragic death of one of Belgium’s top footballers. The footballer François Sterckele was this morning involved in a traffic accident. He was one of the greatest talents in Belgian football. I would like to express my sincere condolences to the family and friends of François Sterckele and to the supporters of Club Brugge.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As a young footballer and a young talent, ladies and gentlemen, Sterckele got all his chances in various clubs in Belgium, and there he eventually developed into the top scorer in the Belgian league. He is excellent proof that investing in young talent, our own talent, really pays dividends. That is exactly, ladies and gentlemen, what we want to support by means of this report. For this reason, we support, too, the ‘home-grown’ regulations, such as those applied by UEFA. We also appreciate that the European Commission is prepared to support the training of young players.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Other than that, I would like to advise you to read the annual report of the Deutsche Bundesliga, which has just come out. The German league is, in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, a role model for Europe. Here are a couple of examples: it has very strict licensing regulations, it invests a lot in its own talent and it also has clear rules to prevent German clubs being sold off to investors who have no connection with either the club or the supporters.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The joint initiative of two representatives of the Council, the French and the Dutch Ministers for Sport, is a perfect answer. We expect, therefore, that the French Presidency in the autumn will work to introduce measures securing the future of professional and amateur sport in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I would like first of all to begin by thanking Mr Mavrommatis for his outstanding report and excellent cooperation. I spoke a moment ago as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and now I am speaking as shadow rapporteur for the press.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to underline three points, namely the importance of clear directives, the importance of the lotteries and home-grown players. First of all, I would like us to look at the specific aspects of sport and sporting organisations that require clear guidelines, where European legislation applies. I think that we must then give an answer in place of our hitherto preoccupied, case-by-case approach.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, let us consider home-grown players. We must ensure that professional players of a young age are protected and are trained in an atmosphere of stability. For this reason we support the so-called home-grown players rule so that young people are trained by a club and can get their first contract with the same club. In this way it will naturally be the case that many national players can play in a club, without us discriminating on the basis of nationality, which is not the intention. We must respect the free movement of players, and that is an important principle for us. For this reason we do not disagree with FIFA’s so-called ‘six-plus-five’ regulation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, we come to the lotteries. National lotteries have an important function. You could say that they perform a public service, as they support many social organisations, including sports structures. Liberalising the market has a positive impact, and therefore before any action is taken, its impact and viable alternatives must be carefully examined.</p>

Taking into consideration the great number of employees in the field of sport, as well as the revenues sport generates, we should pay more attention to the manner in which the labour law is implemented in this field; many times, performance is achieved at early ages, but this is only one step away from exploiting minors.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We should make sure that the revenues coming from sport activities are legally obtained and taxed according to the law.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Violence in sport represents another problem. Human lives are lost every year in confrontations between supporters. On the one hand, the police forces and the clubs should cooperate in order to ensure a comfortable and safe environment during the sport events, and, on the other hand, the legal system should toughen punishments for violent acts related to sport events.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In conclusion, Mr. President, I think that Mr. Mavromatis’ report proves that, at a European level, we need a coherent policy and concrete actions in order to turn to good account and make sport more efficient and I hope we will see more initiatives in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the insertion of the new Article 149 into the Treaty of Lisbon constitutes recognition of the major economic and social role played by sport. The detailed report by Manolis Mavrommatis highlights the numerous areas of life affected by sport, and I should like to look at just a few of them.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first is the relationship between sport and health: although everyone is well aware by now that physical activity is essential in order to remain in good shape, there is a worrying tendency in certain EU Member States to reduce the number of hours devoted to sport in schools. This trend, combined with a poor diet, is creating an army of obese youngsters, with the possibility of negative repercussions on their physical condition.</p>
      <p sl="it">Sport is an original and enjoyable way to learn a language. Back in the early 1970s I learned of a very well-organised and widespread system of study vacations in the United Kingdom geared to learning the language of Shakespeare through the practice of various sporting disciplines. Sport ought to support brotherhood among nations, but unfortunately that is not always the case: we regularly witness scenes of indescribable violence inside and outside of stadiums, especially in the case of football.</p>
      <p sl="it">Amateur and professional sport, uncontaminated and unpolluted sport, sport as a personal development tool, an instrument of cohesion and solidarity among peoples: we are still a long way away from satisfactory standards in Europe, Mr President, and the responsibility lies entirely with politics. We can only hope that the White Paper on Sport will act as a wake-up call and reverse the trend once and for all, so as to make up for an excessive lack of sensitivity and too many sins of omission.</p>

    <intervention id="4-069" speaker_id="1191" name="Doris Pack" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Mavrommatis on his good report and his excellent cooperation with all our fellow Members who were interested in this issue, and there were many of them. Sport plays a more important role than had previously been recognised in the Commission and Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, this White Paper and the report are a good basis for developing all future activities and policies in the field of sport, especially since the Treaty of Lisbon finally gives sport the legal basis that it deserves. The White Paper and this report endeavour to strike a balance between competing interests, different types of sport, amateur and professional sport, between the specific characteristics of sport and the requirements of EU legislation, between social and cultural, economic and financial interests, and between profit and voluntary participation in these fields.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe, therefore, that this endeavour deserves our genuine recognition. It opens up the opportunity to promote and cultivate the European model of sport. It thus maintains the specific characteristics of our sports organisations, which, after all, largely work on an autonomous basis and wish to continue doing so, especially as they tend to be highly reliant on volunteers' input.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we must try to support and promote the implementation of self-regulatory mechanisms at national and European level. May I recall paragraph 16 here, which I believe is extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, the report offers greater legal certainty with regard to the application of EU legislation to sport. Fourthly, the role of sport in education is an issue which has been mentioned frequently, and I would remind you of my report on this topic which dates back to 2004.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fifthly, the report discusses economic aspects, including the requisite financial commitment, particularly through lotteries, which has not been ruled out for the various sports here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ten years ago, in my report on the role of the European Union in the field of sport, we called for a White Paper, and I am pleased that we are able to vote on it today.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-070" speaker_id="4239" name="Christa Prets" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, for a long time now, all the sports organisations have been calling for sport to be given greater significance and, indeed, greater visibility than has hitherto been the case, and we are acting on this call today. It will come into even sharper focus with the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">The many aspects of sport — its contribution to society, its role in personal development and fulfilment and in promoting social integration, etc. – have already been underlined. Sport is also a very important factor in promoting health, which is why it is worthwhile investing on a broad basis in sport, and particularly in physical education in schools. That is an investment that really would pay dividends.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are therefore appealing to every minister of education in the Member States to introduce a requirement for at least three hours of physical education in schools per week. That is the minimum, for otherwise, there is little point to it. There are 700 000 clubs and associations which are making an invaluable contribution to our society, and that is why I oppose the possible liberalisation of gambling and the lotteries, for at present around 10% of levies accrued from this industry go into sports, the arts and social amenities, and without this funding these organisations could not survive. I would ask everyone to be mindful of that.</p>
      <p sl="de">The important economic dimension of sport is borne out by the statistics: sport generated value-added of EUR 407 billion in 2004 and created 15 million jobs; there are other figures, too, which prove my point. That means that rules are needed. We need to strike a careful balance between the economic aspects of sport, transparency, sale of clubs, and licensing, as Mr Belet has just emphasised. Here, we need rules which are fair, so that 'fair play' has genuine and practical meaning.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to make sure that there is appropriate redistribution between small and large clubs, so that we can develop the next generation of sportsmen and sportswomen. In my view, there should be a more equitable balance in the media. There really is more to sport than football. Nonetheless, I would like to extend a warm invitation to everyone to come and enjoy the Euro 2008 games in Vienna. That is a major sporting event which I am certainly looking forward to.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in sport we must not let good intentions bring unintended consequences. Economic competition rules cannot always apply. Collective selling of television rights is the financial lifeline for many clubs that would otherwise be squeezed out by the famous. In a utopian world we could watch everything and never pay, but in the real world that would result in little of quality being left to watch.</p>
      <p sl="en">Observance of copyright protects the income that maintains high-quality events. Rising instances of ambush marketing and circulation of unauthorised highlights is as damaging as any other kind of piracy. It is also imperative not to inhibit flexibility in the means of raising income, movement of players or their ability to choose where to sign their first contracts. Finally, we should stick firmly to subsidiarity and keeping decision-making within the industry and close to fans.</p>

    <intervention id="4-072" speaker_id="28372" name="Ryszard Czarnecki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the White Paper refers to long-standing problems such as doping, and to issues regarding financial disputes between television companies over broadcasting rights, which obviously have negative consequences for both fans and viewers. In addition, the White Paper deals with a much more serious problem that constitutes an increasing threat to honest sport, notably football. I refer to betting establishments. They may well represent the greatest challenge to contemporary sport. By way of example I could mention the latest scandal to affect the national football league of the country we are currently in. The Chinese Mafia is said to have fixed the results of Belgian football matches. The forthcoming liberalisation of the market in games of chance, including those related to the world of sport, will create further temptation to infringe the principles of fair play.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I have to say that I do not agree to the European Parliament’s proposal opposing FIFA’s stance on the principle of six players from a given country. FIFA’s proposal is sound. It will be the saving of national sport.</p>

    <intervention id="4-073" speaker_id="28301" name="Tadeusz Zwiefka" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, one of the fundamental difficulties I should like to highlight is the lack of legal certainty. The Commission has not established clearly which aspects of the organisation of sport are covered by Community legislation and which are of a purely sporting nature and therefore fall within the competence of the sports organisations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I share the rapporteur’s opinion that relying exclusively on the European Court of Justice does not provide further legal clarity. The European Commission’s stance whereby regulation of the organisation of sport must comply with the Treaties does not do so either. This is not enough.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I therefore support the appeal to the European Commission to adopt interpretative guidelines that will bring clarity and precision to operations in this field. It should of course be emphasised that any action by the Commission must comply with the principle of self-regulation in sport. It must also respect the structures of the European sport model and the fundamental principles governing the organisation of sporting competitions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I disagree with the views of certain sports organisations that believe that there would be more disputes in court following some kind of consolidation or codification of principles relating to the activities of sport beyond the strictly sporting context, complying of course with the principles of self-regulation. In my opinion, the opposite would be the case. Greater legal certainty can only be beneficial.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should also like to appeal to sports organisations to accept the right of appeal to the common courts. Every individual has the right to appeal to the courts. The competence of tribunals of a strictly sporting nature is not at issue, but the restriction of these rights by certain sports organisations is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I should like to raise another very important matter. Sport plays a very important role in society. The Member States should therefore retain the right to take measures aimed at protecting the right to information and ensuring viewers’ access to television broadcasts of major sport events. I have in mind the Olympic Games and the European Championship or World Cup. Everyone should be able to access such events freely. Before I conclude, I must thank Mr Mavrommatis for his excellent work on this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, sport should, of course, be run by the sporting authorities themselves but, to the extent that it is also an economic activity, it unavoidably falls under employment law, competition law, copyright law, media rights and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem is that these laws have often been drawn up without the specific needs and requirements of sport in mind. Under the current Treaties, there is little leeway to take account of those specific needs. I am glad that with the Lisbon Treaty, there will be a greater margin to allow us to derogate, to make exceptions or to interpret laws with the specific needs of sport in mind.</p>
      <p sl="en">We cannot, for instance, apply competition law in its purely economic sense if that would ultimately destroy competition in its sporting sense. There is no better example of this than the collective sale of TV rights, as is practised by the English Premier League, for instance, with redistribution to all clubs. This is in contrast to Spain where two clubs pick up more than half of the TV revenue just for themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also accept that the UEFA scheme of home-grown players is a proportionate response and is acceptable under European Union law, unlike FIFA’s bull-in-a-china-shop ‘six-plus-five’ scheme.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I should also like to draw attention to an issue related to access to sport for the disabled. The Member States should at least guarantee disabled pupils access to basic physical education classes. Wherever possible, these pupils should also have access to higher level classes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, it should be remembered that sport is one of the most effective methods of achieving social integration. It ought therefore to receive much more significant support from the European Union, by way of special programmes, especially for the organisers of international sporting events for young people, including those that make a particular contribution to integration by involving disabled persons. Sport involves more than physical activity and health. It makes an invaluable contribution to developing the spirit of tolerance, honesty and respect for the principles of fair play. All this is particularly important for the children and young people who are today’s young citizens of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, before I speak I should declare that I have a number of financial interests related to this subject, which are listed in my declaration available on the internet.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, for his concern and knowledge of this subject, especially regarding doping in sport.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, the first draft of his report, before the amendments came in, was probably as good a document on this subject as you will ever find in short form. As ever, though, the committees came in at this point, and the amendments that were adopted in the Committee on Culture ruined just about any good work that was done. For example, the bizarre call for a European police force for sport in paragraph 59, or the talk about ‘financial doping’ in paragraph 16, which is having a snipe against private investment and in some cases inward investment into the European Union. This report unfortunately looks at sport through the lens of professional football. As a soccer referee, mainly at the amateur level, for the last 28 years, I can tell you this report does absolutely nothing to address the problems that amateur football has, let alone those of amateur sport in general.</p>
      <p sl="en">This House says that we are not trying to influence the decisions of governing bodies, but already we have seen in the debate today an attack on FIFA’s ‘six-plus-five’ idea. Governing bodies should watch out. Giving the priority on sport to the European Union is not a good thing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to sports betting, we have heard many views on this. Using this report to try and close down the debate on liberalising gambling and the lottery market is plainly wrong. This debate should go in a different direction and come from a different committee. Those that talk about it should just look at what is happening in Italy, where the gradual liberalisation of the market has grown the amount of money available to all.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have talked about the collective selling of television rights which I am in favour of because it has worked in the UK, but I strongly believe in subsidiarity and surely this should be left to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many good things in this white paper on sport, even if too little mention is made of the Special Olympics and the Paralympics movements. But, overall, this report is an insult to the Irish voters by talking about the Lisbon Treaty as if it were already here and as if their vote does not count. Therefore the UK Conservative delegation will have to vote against at the end.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on a report aimed at giving strategic guidance on the role of sport in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">Sport is a social phenomenon which has always fostered values such as solidarity, team spirit and identity, as asserted by the Declaration on the overall significance of sport, annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty. Sporting activity helps to develop physical, intellectual and social skills, which is why sport should be practised both within the education system and in other aspects of social life.</p>
      <p sl="it">One point that should not be underestimated is the benefit to disabled people of practising sport: all the Member States, local and regional authorities, and sports organisations should guarantee and facilitate disabled access to sporting installations. Sport is having to confront new threats in contemporary society, such as the exploitation of young players, doping, racism, violence and money laundering. The problem of violence arises not only inside but also outside of the stadium.</p>
      <p sl="it">I compliment the Commission on its undertaking to prevent disorder by facilitating dialogue with Member States, international organisations, sports bodies and police forces. It is also important to emphasise the economic side of sport. Discriminatory tax systems applied by Member States in favour of players can result in distortions of competition. Rules therefore need to be adopted to ensure fair competition between sports bodies.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the report’s eulogy of sport is something one can only agree with. Sport means a great deal for society, and it creates many important values to which I can hardly do justice in only two minutes. It also contributes to bringing Europe together. However, just because something is important, that does not mean it is political, and just because something contributes to bringing Europe together, it is not a primary responsibility of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sv">That is something which I think is being lost in this debate, not least if people maintain that more sport-related initiatives should be taken at EU level. That is not what I think. Therefore I do not consider that we need a special European gambling police. I do not think that sports agents earn too much money, and that there should be an argument for us to create special training for sports agents. Nor should we even out incomes between successful and less successful clubs. Trying to limit what the report calls the excessively busy schedules of athletes will probably not get them to resist doping.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, we must examine a number of false assertions made about the gambling market in Europe. There is no connection between private players in the gambling market and match-fixing. On the contrary, some of the biggest scandals we have seen in Europe have affected countries with monopolies. There is no connection between gambling monopolies and a restrictive gambling policy. On the contrary, many of the state monopolies in Member States are some of the largest advertisers. It is not countries with competition that have an unregulated gambling market. On the contrary, it is in many countries with monopolies that gambling services are most poorly regulated and monopolies can most frequently do as they will.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We should not attempt through incorrect facts to keep the EU out of an area in which the EU actually has an important role to play. We have free movement of services in Europe, which should, of course, also apply to gambling services. The Member States’ false figures about gambling addiction often conceal pure protectionism and protection of their own revenue from gambling monopolies. In fact, all this hypocrisy about gambling policy merely shows that it is the finance ministers in the Member States who are suffering from the worst kind of gambling addiction. That is why we Swedish Conservatives find it very difficult to support large parts of this report.</p>

      <p sl="el">However, I am hardly optimistic after today’s debate. Whatever we do and however much we try to put these matters in order, the events themselves show that the situation is pretty dire.</p>

Physical education helps schoolchildren to develop the habit of pursuing a healthy lifestyle. It is a great challenge for many people involved in sport to increase their interest in sporting activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">For example, the Estonian Ski Association has created a year-round system of participation for children and non-professionals, but this has been quite an expensive undertaking. In this connection, I should point out that the funding of sporting activities benefits greatly from gambling. Many sports are subsidised from the profits of state-run lotteries as well as licensed gambling. I think that we have to find some alternative sources of financial support if we do not use that money.</p>

We have heard a great deal here today, but I would like to draw your attention to a few aspects in particular. Obesity is becoming endemic, and our largely sedentary lifestyle is in no small part to blame for this. The situation could therefore be helped, as the previous speaker also said, by making daily physical education classes compulsory in the Member States from primary school level right through to higher education. For this we need facilities, however, and we also need to change the curriculum. As regards facilities, the situation could be improved if the government were to take on a greater role, since at least half of the revenue from sports, accounting for 4% of the EU’s gross domestic product, would need to be reinvested to bring about a major change in this situation. I certainly recommend doing this. I hope that the White Paper will improve the situation. Thank you for listening.</p>

      <p sl="cs">As the vote will begin in a few minutes, I cannot make a longer speech. However, I would like to say a few things and reply to some questions. In my opinion, it is clear from the debate what a complicated phenomenon sport represents in the life of a modern society. The other thing which I am pleased to say is that, following the vote on Mr Mavrommatis’s report, we will have a very solid base for Europe’s forthcoming coherent policy on sport: a base grounded in the White Paper and Parliament’s report.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Understandably, the debate has revealed a whole range of thoughts, which it will be necessary to take up and begin work on in the near future. I would just like to emphasise the things I have listed here and which occur to me as especially significant. One of the problems, which is actually covered in the White Paper, is the education of sportspeople, especially young people, so as to prevent the situation that has been described, where their careers come to an end but they still do not have an adequate long-term future established. It is also equally important to address problems of people trafficking or the risk of trafficking in some cases in sport. Similarly, the Commission must apply itself to the issue of intellectual property, especially in relation to the Internet, which when all is said and done is the business of the Commission; but because I can see that actually the atmosphere is not conducive to long speeches, I shall just quickly answer the questions that have been posed.</p>
      <p sl="cs">First there was the question of the so-called ‘guidelines’. The Commission is of the opinion that, as yet, it is still not the right time to formulate these; nevertheless the Commission considers that attention should be paid to this problem. Of the other issues, I would like to mention the question of lotteries, which is very often cited. Here I would like to state that lotteries fall outside the Services Directive; consequently they are subject to Community law and it is necessary to seek a decision in each individual case. Another important question was the collective sale of broadcasting rights for television programmes. The Commission envisages that a solution will be found everywhere that will contain a significant element of solidarity, as has been mentioned. I think that I have very quickly touched on most of the questions that have been posed. Otherwise, obviously this is just one step, although a very important one, taken by the Commission and Parliament together.</p>

      <p sl="it">I applaud the work of the rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, and welcome the eagerly awaited White Paper on Sport adopted by the Commission. It is a useful and necessary measure, in that sporting activity constitutes such a significant dimension of European society.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would draw attention to the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, emphasising that sport must be valued socially, especially in the case of young people as a means of teaching them tolerance, respect and involvement. I believe that the Member States – backed by clear, transparent Community guidelines and policies – should make suitable spaces available for sport and involve society as a whole, including disadvantaged groups, in order that sporting activity can bring people together and help combat phenomena such as racism and xenophobia.</p>
      <p sl="it">Given that a lack of physical activity encourages diseases such as obesity and other chronic illnesses, I believe that cooperation between the sports sector and the health sector is crucial. The European Union has a vital coordinating role in informing citizens and encouraging them to take part in a range of sporting activities.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to emphasize the importance of physical education classes in the EU schools and secondary schools. For the moment, physical education remains the only discipline in the school curriculum that aims at preparing children for a healthy way of life. I appreciate the EU initiative to increase the number of physical education classes in schools.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Together with the increase in the number of physical education classes, we should also take into consideration two important issues: I refer to attractiveness and the possibility to have differentiated physical education classes. My statement relies on the discussions I have had with pupils and sports teachers in Romania. Unfortunately, the fact that physical education classes are not attractive leads to an increase in absenteeism.</p>
      <p sl="ro">One of the reasons is the absence of an adequate material basis to diversify classes. Another problem is the absence of special physical education classes for overweight or obese young people. Physical education classes have the same degree of intensity both for healthy children and for children with problems. Thus, sometimes, young people are forced to remain off the sports field.</p>
      <p sl="ro">These are some of the problems we find in several European Union Member States and for which we have to find solutions. I invite the European Commission to come up with solutions and even with examples of good practice in the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The report on sport by my fellow Member from Greece is an important document on an issue that is close to my heart. Sport has been part of European culture for many thousands of years. Ancient Greece bestowed on humankind among other things the joy of the Olympic Games. Today many people are concerned about whether it will be possible to protect the Olympics from a boycott, and from political passions that may be justified in other respects. I am pleased to say that in Hungary the key forces in politics and public opinion alike are against a boycott of the Beijing Olympics. As far as I can see, the mood is similar throughout the whole of Europe. It is therefore to be hoped that this time, after previous unfortunate boycotts, politics will not spoil the enjoyment of sportsmen and women and the many hundreds of millions of people who love sport. Participation by politicians at the opening ceremony is another matter entirely. This is a matter for politicians to decide in their capacity as politicians, and neither sport nor sportspeople should be drawn into it.</p>

      <p sl="ro">When speaking about the reviewed Lisbon Strategy, we cannot ignore a sector that employs 15 million people and produces around 4% of the European Union GDP. Indeed, sport can be an important component for our 2 big objectives: economic growth and employment</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I would like to emphasize some budgetary aspects of the European Union’s support for the sport sector. For the moment, we have no clear reference in the treaties in force that would allow our active involvement through programmes and funds. Nevertheless, until the Lisbon Treaty becomes effective, we can still initiate preparatory actions in the Committee on Budget, which, although limited to insignificant amounts, could start very useful projects for European sport from 2009.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I regret that, during this week’s presentation of the new Preliminary Draft Budget, we did not discuss more on the budgetary line that can be established at Chapter 3 – Citizenship of the EU Budget. I hope that, by the first Budget reading in the autumn, we will submit constructive proposals for this field.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Let me first of all congratulate my honourable friend Mr Mavrommatis on his report encouraging European Union Member States to exchange best practice in the interests of preventing violence, racism and xenophobia at and around sports grounds. Taking action to combat the racism that, unfortunately, is occurring increasingly at sporting events is a task to be performed jointly by the authorities in the Member States, sports associations and competition organisers. It is also in their common interests. Some superb initiatives that stand out in this regard include the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)’s campaign ‘Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE)’, and the series of events entitled ‘Racism spoils the game’. The most effective mechanism for combating the racism and exclusion occurring in the sporting arena, however, is the game itself, as it fosters in individuals a sense of team spirit, cooperation and fair competition, as well as reinforcing cooperation and solidarity as social values.</p>
      <p sl="hu">According to statistics, however, certain groups in society, notably the most disadvantaged ethnic minorities, engage much less in sports activities and have less access to government-run sports facilities. For this reason, the European Union needs to establish an appropriate reference framework for promoting equal opportunities in the pursuit and funding of sports. The leadership of sports associations in the Member States, meanwhile, in cooperation with local and regional government, must give priority to participation by disadvantaged groups in their given branch of sport.</p>

I believe that today’s debate sets the beginning of the promotion of a consistent European policy in the field of sport.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Being a member of the Committee on Regional Development from Bulgaria, a country with underdeveloped sport infrastructure, especially in amateur sport, I would like to call upon the European Commission and the Member States to more actively use the European Regional Development Fund and the other financial tools for investment in the urban environment, and for development of sport-related infrastructure and projects.

      <p sl="fi">Sport is competition, but of a sort to which the EU’s laws on competition cannot be applied.</p>
      <p sl="fi">To preserve the specificity of sport, it should be given a chance for self-regulation in the future, in accordance with each sport’s best traditions. As legislators, we need to pass laws which guarantee that politicians and judges keep as far away from sport as possible. This seemingly contradictory requirement is dealt with more coherently in this report than it is in the Commission’s White Paper.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is important for European sport for all and grassroots activity that Member States are able to preserve their national gambling systems, which are an essential ingredient in the specificity of sport. The by-products of gambling are also easier to prevent in countries where the state has a monopoly. In all sports, professional sport and businesses structured around it benefit from voluntary, unpaid, grassroots activity and public funding.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Sport is such an important part of daily life and is also so globalised that it merits the attention of the European Union’s institutions. A joint effort to combat certain related phenomena is more effective than action by individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Doping is a recognised and widespread scourge of contemporary competitive sport. That is why the fight against doping is given precedence in the European Parliament’s report. Members who hail from the former Communist bloc recall how doping can become a nationalised method of breeding champions, sanctioned by the authorities of a country building its prestige on the basis of success on the sports field. The rapporteur made a wise remark, based on the reality of the situation. He stated that on its own, treatment of the symptoms through increased controls will not be effective. It has to be accompanied by measures to eliminate the underlying reasons for this phenomenon. I have in mind a schedule of events that is more than the body can stand and education.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another noticeable scourge of mass sport events is the expression of racism and discrimination. I make a distinction between this and the restrictions imposed by FIFA concerning the number of national and foreign members of a team, for example. Such restrictions are governed by concern for the progress and development of young talent (instead of transfers), and are not an instance of discrimination against players on the grounds of their national origin.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also welcome the attention paid to phenomena linked to the commercialisation of sport and its side effects such as games of chance and unequal access to broadcasts of sport events. I agree that these are important issues too.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, it is great that the EP is discussing the White Paper on Sport. We should pay attention to the need for balancing the policies aimed at the development of professional and amateur sport. Sport excellence costs a lot, but it is equally necessary to increase the funding of mass sport from childhood to retirement age. It is necessary to establish infrastructure enabling the integration of all social groups of citizens.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Sport calls for education from an early age and sport is instrumental in eliminating many other problems such as the abuse of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. We should urge all Member States to set up areas for free sport and areas free of drugs, alcohol and tobacco. I have recently made a public opinion poll which makes it very clear that young people engaged in sport do not use drugs and alcohol. Their behavioural culture is very different; tolerance and solidarity are very important elements that sport nurtures in them. Therefore the involvement of education in sport is of special significance. There is also something else that I would like to share with you: there exist specialised sport schools and it is very important for their activities to be balanced with the work of sport clubs recruiting their athletes. It is necessary to have legislative regulation to this effect for both sport and education.</p>

In recent years the social benefit of sport has been actively promoted in Europe to give everyone the opportunity to participate to the best of their ability in the life of their communities. I am extremely sorry that the same cannot be said for disabled sport. As President of the Physically Disabled Sports Association in Estonia I know how difficult it is to organise sports events for the disabled, to get them coverage in the media, and to obtain resources from government and from sponsors. Our sportsmen and women are aware that equal conditions and opportunities have not been established for them.</p>

Unfortunately, sport and tourism were excluded and I believe this should be corrected. I appreciate as positive the development of sport tourism over the last years, and the promotion of winter and nautical sports.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The existence of sport facilities in hotel complexes or the creation of tourist routes for bikers could have a beneficial impact both on the population’s health and the environment. In great European cities, there are already parking facilities that provide tourists with bicycles, free of charge, during the entire period of stay of the vehicles.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On May 1st, in Galaţi, the town where I come from, I waited for the people who decided to devote their time to participating in a cross-country race at the finish line. I was glad especially for the children and the disabled people who crossed the finish line. Education is essential in promoting sport. In Romania, the construction of several hundreds of sports halls for schools and high schools began in 2001, both in the urban and in the rural environment. I think this type of investment should continue.</p>

This consolidation would be based on the principles of the CAP under the single payment scheme, the financial guarantee of Community funds in the national envelope of each country, and the possibility of flexibility in the Member States on the management of the national envelope.</p>
      <p sl="el">We should aim at the greatest possible area payments per hectare within the bounds of budget neutrality. We should also channel aid to producers who will improve the quality of their produce.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, this has not been achieved. Indeed, in a proposed formation of a restructuring fund, as has been suggested in the report in the framework of the 1st pillar, it is suggested that there should be funding to modernise the sector, especially the ginning industry, as stated primarily in amendments 9, 14, 16, 23, 26, 31 and 39. There is a reconstruction to counterbalance the losses that the ginning industry will suffer as a result of any decrease in production or disturbance in the cotton market.</p>

The same thing which features in his amendment was explained by the communists in Bulgaria and the other Eastern European countries. Therefore I would suggest to Mr. Cappato that he visit Kim Chen Ir in North Korea if he would like to continue in the same vein. There his ideas would be shared and, I am sure, warmly welcomed.</p>

I think the EU’s work in election observation missions is extremely powerful, it is extremely important, and it is conducted with a great degree of professionalism. It contributes to the democratic process and to democratic development in many underprivileged and developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I had the privilege of being chairman of Parliament’s election observation mission in Sierra Leone, a very difficult country, a very poor country, a country that presented many logistical difficulties, particularly weather difficulties in the rainy season, with the mission that was conducted. It was conducted with great professionalism by all of the staff, both EU staff and locally-recruited staff.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was indeed very humbling to see the enthusiasm with which the election was viewed by many ordinary Sierra Leoneans, queuing up for many hours in the rain to cast their votes in a democratic election.

      <p sl="en">In general I think we prefer to improve and increase international trade through the multilateral framework of the World Trade Organisation, but I think we have to recognise the role that bilaterals play in extending trade and the benefits of globalisation throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thought it was particularly important in this report that we highlighted human rights issues.

But in this context it is particularly appropriate, given that Burma is a member of ASEAN.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I did have a real problem with this, because I did initially put an amendment to committee, which was accepted, saying that if particular ASEAN countries did not want to be part of this agreement, we should still go ahead with agreements with those countries that did want to.

I wish to say in my personal capacity, and this relates to me personally as an individual Member and also as a representative of the Pensioners' Party, that I voted against this report on the regulation of lobbies. The reason is this: I am unimpressed by the fact that it is taken for granted that Members of the European Parliament are influenced in their decisions by other people, and that, consequently, regulation is deemed necessary.</p>

I therefore find it very odd that any such possibility can be accepted.

      <p sl="en">So much, I think, is well known outside this Chamber.

These amendments aim to ensure equal treatment for disabled sportspeople in the context of social solutions.

      <p sl="fr">The changes do not modify the fundamental elements of the Agreement. They are merely a reflection of the success achieved and allow a practical adaptation that corresponds to actual needs. That is why, given the average level of catches over the past three years, the reference tonnage has been increased from 55 000 tonnes to 63 000 tonnes. Moreover, in order to balance the situation, the fee paid by shipowners has been increased to EUR 35 per tonne to bring the protocol into line with other tuna agreements, hence reducing the Community contribution from EUR 75 to EUR 65 per tonne. The total annual financial contribution thus increases from EUR 4 125 000 to EUR 5 355 000.</p>

      <p sl="pt">At a time when the crisis of capitalism is deepening and its contradictions are increasing, this resolution and the goals set for the (‘long-term’) creation of the ‘transatlantic market’ are presented as a real escape route, pointing to the increasing liberalisation of the markets in these two poles of the ‘triad’ and pillars of NATO as a ‘way out’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In addition to reaffirming the ‘transatlantic’ strategic partnership, the resolution acts as a genuine roadmap to the liberalisation of the financial markets and trade relations between the EU and the US, by listing the obstacles to greater competition and capitalist concentration, to the joy and benefit of large financial and economic groups.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The resolution, in an (impossible) attempt to hide the true aims, contradictions and consequences of realising the ‘transatlantic market’, highlights certain potential social or environmental concerns.

The new United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has the potential to develop into a valuable framework for improving the human rights situation in the world.

The EU must promote ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court around the world to protect individuals from so-called crimes against humanity and to prevent genocides and other atrocities being perpetrated in future without fear of sanction; it must also help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the UNHCR. I likewise think that the United Nations resolution on the universal moratorium on the use of the death penalty must be put into practice.</p>

Paragraph 94 is a reminder that health programmes, including sexual and reproductive health, should be prominent in the EU´s development and human rights policy, in particular where gender-based violence is pervasive and women and children are put at risk of HIV/AIDS, or denied access to information, prevention and/or treatment.</p>

      <p sl="de">1. The report contains a number of points which are worthy of support. However, it completely ignores the absence of social and economic rights in much of the world, as a result of which millions of people are dying of hunger or lack housing and employment. The report reduces human rights to civil rights alone, and thus neglects the principle of the indivisibility of human rights, as enshrined in the UN Charter;</p>
      <p sl="de">2. The report does not deal with the human rights violations perpetrated or endorsed by EU Member States. However, in order to avoid any accusations of hypocrisy, the EU must investigate and shed light on the human rights violations committed with the participation or compliance of EU Member States in third countries or against third-country nationals; these include, for example, the accusations of torture levelled against troops engaged in the EU's Operation Artemis in Congo;</p>
      <p sl="de">3. War is still the worst of all human rights violations, but is completely ignored in the report. However, with the Lisbon Treaty and the announcements made in connection with France's assumption of the Council Presidency in the second half of 2008, there is a real concern that the EU will be involved in more military missions. Human rights should not be used as a pretext for these operations. This aspect is completely absent from the report.</p>

In other words, our report is an important and very significant list, but it will never be as much as it could and should have been.

The fact that millions of people are deprived of their most basic rights, the fact that – partly as a result of the EU's highly problematical policies – they have less and less food available, and that hunger, disease and a lack of decent housing are their cruel reality, that many people have no access to education, and that workers' rights are being trampled under foot: all this is largely ignored.</p>

The report fails to make any mention of the human rights violations that are occurring in the EU itself and in which the EU is involved around the world, partly as a result of its military and armaments policy and its ever-expanding military missions. Only the human rights violations taking place outside the EU are criticised; the EU's own omissions and responsibilities are ignored. The internal and external effects of the EU's neoliberal policies, with their negative consequences for human and fundamental rights, are not mentioned in the report.</p>

For this reason, everything stated in this report on the success, difficulties, inadequacies and needs for reform of the European Union’s election observation missions (EOMs) is important and deserves our full attention, but it will always miss the essential point: the overall contribution of the various European instruments to the achievement of democracy (in which the EU’s EOMs are obviously involved). This, I believe, is the challenge raised by this debate which, having made us think about it, we must accept. The promotion and protection of democracy are not only part of the DNA of the European Union but are also part of its world vision, both in terms of principles and values and in terms of its own interests.</p>

      <p sl="fr">A partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA), containing enforceable human rights clauses, is a prerequisite for the Union to conclude a free trade agreement (FTA) with any country. A resolution to the problem of banking secrecy in Singapore is essential if there is to be a real prospect of concluding a region-to-region free trade agreement.

      <p sl="pl">I should like to emphasise that for it to bear fruit, an agreement requires the commitment of both partners. In the light of reports on recent negotiating rounds, the prospects for an early and ambitious agreement with ASEAN may be undermined by a lack of negotiating capacity and difficulties in developing a common position. ASEAN would be the EU's fifth most important trading partner.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report supports the concept of a free trade agreement with ASEAN provided that the agreement meets certain key conditions. It is important to ensure that consumer protection is not curtailed or environmental protection reduced.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Negotiating an agreement with a region composed of 10 independent countries is very complicated and time-consuming.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, some 2 500 lobbying organisations are currently active in Brussels. More than 300 of these are representations of local and regional authorities operating as if they were embassies. They include the representation of Małopolska (Lesser Poland) which is my European constituency. I should like to take the opportunity provided by the debate on the report before the House to draw attention to the issue of the relationship between EU institutions and organisations of this type. As they strive to obtain reliable information from European institutions, the representatives of local and regional authorities also supply the most recent data on the situation in their regions. The rapporteur stated that transparency is a two-way street. Following on from that statement I should like to emphasise the importance of increased transparency on the part of the European institutions, and equal treatment of all organisations represented in Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is well-known that the professional lobbying sector – with the aim of influencing EU policy making – is developing fast and constantly in Brussels. It is therefore necessary, at the very least, to lay down rules which ensure that information is provided on the interests represented by lobbyists, although, even so, it will always be difficult to ensure that there is transparency and that unethical practices are avoided. That is why we voted in favour of this report.</p>

I was the author of the first report on this subject more than a decade ago, in January 1996, produced by the then Rules Committee, and the legislations we currently have in place regarding lobbyist are those proposed in my original report.</p>
      <p sl="en">More than 10 years on it is clearly time to modify and strengthen these rules. We failed last time to have a common system for all of the institutions but this now seems possible. For me lobbyists are all those who want to come into the Parliament, Commission or Council to influence the decision-making process, whether employers or employees, consumer groups, producer groups or special interest groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is estimated there are around 5 000 lobbyist in Brussels – seven for each and every MEP. The vast majority do a good job – a very small number do not.

It is normal for citizens to get together to defend their interests. Trade unions, employers’ associations and NGOs have the right to defend their interests to any legislator. The legislator has the duty to listen before making a decision. However, the legislator must remain independent, hence the importance of Members declaring their financial interests.

As parliamentarians who are called upon to make decisions on issues that are sometimes extremely technical, we are the first to recognise the very important informative role played by what are commonly known as lobbyists. Their activity is useful, but their relations with all the institutions must be governed by a strong, coherent framework, and that is why we will vote in favour of this report. I would, however, like to make a number of comments. It is important not to put all interest groups together: the representatives of multinationals or NGOs cannot be treated in the same way as the representatives of democratic local or national authorities. In our opinion, the ‘legislative footprint’, i.e. the reference to the groups consulted, must be compulsory, notably for the Commission. We know how much influence these groups have on the preparation of legislative proposals or the direction of a European policy, and how difficult it is for the legislator to amend such proposals or directions to any great extent. Finally, the financial information requested of lobbyists must be sufficiently detailed to enable us to identify clearly the financial interests at stake and the source of the funding.</p>

The establishment of a ‘one-stop shop’ where lobbyists could register only once in order to have access to Parliament, the Commission and the Council will also simplify the situation. It is normal, too, that sanctions should be envisaged for lobbyists who do not comply with the code of conduct.</p>

Once the Lisbon Treaty comes into force and new competencies are created for the Parliament and the European Union, this tendency will intensify. While the groups of interests with headquarters in Brussels have easy access to the European political process, the groups of citizens and the nongovernmental organizations do not have the same means to make their voice heard when adopting the European legislative acts. It is obvious that we have to facilitate the dialogue between the European institutions and those organizations in the Member States.</p>

This is a sensitive area in political and economic terms. We are aware that lawmakers benefit from the subject-specific knowledge gained from contacts with experts. This is also a type of dialogue with society, and has a kind of reciprocal effect. After all, Members and officials of the European Commission and other institutions do not operate in their own isolated world. The knowledge gained enables them to create better and more user-friendly legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the other hand, the question of unfair influence on lawmaking arises. There are also instances when the law is slanted so as to favour the interests of specific pressure groups, such as pro-abortionists and large corporations. This leads directly to corruption and the final outcome is not genuine legislation but a hotchpotch of provisions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Will we really contrive to make legal provisions stricter and tighten them up so as to prevent inappropriate lobbying and corruption? Sadly, the answer is obvious. We will be unable to do so. It will always be possible to find a loophole in the provisions or a way around them. We should also bear in mind that so-called bad lobbying is also possible through direct contacts in the Member States.</p>

The amendment would have been essential to understand the scale of the debate on lobbying, not just as a reminder to the Commission but also to a wider audience. A good example of this is the environmental organisations, whose resources are frequently compared to those of industry, though in an utterly peculiar way: the budget for a single organisation’s forest campaign might be compared to the totals for the entire budgets of all forest companies. This is to forget that forest companies cannot spend all their money on communications: they are actually engaged in producing timber and paper. It would be more reasonable to compare companies’ budgets for communications, but from that would have to be subtracted the stock exchange release, which is a drain on resources. Then on the other side one would have to calculate the forestry campaign cash for all the environmental organisations. When we look beneath the surface, therefore, the resources used are very often revealed to be on a more equal footing than the image created might suggest.</p>

It is thus necessary to act so that these new interest representatives are clearly identified and so that rules on their activities are laid down and observed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report provides a definition of ‘interest representatives’, together with measures for assessing the implications of a common register for Parliament and the Commission. It also aims to increase information measures with regard to the financial data needed to ensure that political decision-makers and the general public can identify the main driving forces behind a given lobbying activity. I believe that these measures are important steps for ensuring greater clarity and legitimacy of the decision-making process of European political decision-makers, particularly as, in the vote, certain amendments were rejected which would only have served to devalue the correct assessment of this activity, in the name of outdated ideological preconceptions.</p>

      <p sl="en">A parliamentarian always has a great need to obtain relevant information in order to be able to make good decisions. It goes without saying that one person cannot be an expert in everything. In that sense, lobbying can be a valuable addition to information-gathering by providing expertise and relevant impact analyses.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, citizens are entitled to know what special interests are active. How influential a lobby group is does not necessarily depend on financial strength – animal rights activists and other social movements can be at least as successful as industrial interests. Registering interests is, of course, not entirely simple, not least when it comes to defining who or what groups are carrying out lobbying activities. However, as a decision-maker I consider it relevant continuously to monitor who is putting time and effort into influencing legislation. If you have nothing to hide, you also have nothing to be worried about. Trolls are destroyed by daylight.</p>

      <p sl="en">Sport is part of the Lisbon Treaty and will therefore gain a more prominent role in EU policy with the entry into force of that treaty. We Social Democrats would like to emphasise that sport is already a cross-border activity, but that does not mean that European institutions like the Council, the Commission and Parliament should involve themselves in the detailed management of the sports movement. Instead, sport should govern itself as far as possible in order to retain its independence and autonomy.</p>

      <p sl="it">It is a great pleasure for me to vote in favour of the report by Mr Mavrommatis on safeguards for sport. Indeed, I believe that sport is an indissociable element of European culture and citizenship. Given that it is a significant way to promote social inclusion and intercultural dialogue, sport must be regulated at last so as to safeguard young people and protect them from dangers inherent in the sector: commercial pressure, fraud, the exploitation of minors and violence.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, the entire sporting system cannot survive without funding. In many instances funding comes from television rights, so for this reason I believe it is advisable not only to allow media organisations to pay to cover sporting fixtures but also to ensure broad public access, at least to major events.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am pleased to note that the report also contains a reminder of proper sporting conduct and appeals for measures to tackle racism and doping which, quite apart from its possible effects, is the most unsportsmanlike practice imaginable. It is therefore a good idea to have closer cooperation at every level to combat the problem, because doping undermines the very essence of sport: a love of competition, drawing on all one’s resources and performing to the best of one’s ability. Man has always risen to this challenge.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the context of the debate on the role of sport in the European Union I should like to emphasise the importance of local activities. I believe they represent the first step towards the development of a European policy aimed at promoting sport.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I represent Małoplolska (Lesser Poland). In that region, more than 60 000 individuals suffer from diabetes. Circulatory diseases are the main cause of death, amounting to 51% in 2005. These conditions are largely the consequence of obesity and lack of activity. One of the main objectives of the Voivodship's development strategy is the promotion of a healthy lifestyle. Achievement of this objective will involve investment in infrastructure and the construction of new facilities in the area, such as swimming pools, sports grounds and indoor sports facilities. In addition, my region encourages sporting activities by arranging financial awards for the best young sports people. Over 120 young people have received awards so far.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Support for this type of action at regional level should be a key element of the effort to promote a healthy lifestyle across the European Union. I supported the report by Mr Mavrommatis because I believe it raises many important issues relating to the development of sport.</p>

      <p sl="pt">More proposals that we tabled were adopted in plenary, in particular recommendations on: the need to provide ‘dual career’ training – sporting and academic – to young sportspeople to ensure the reintegration of professional sportspeople into the labour market at the end of their careers; the importance of encouraging people to play sports, by guaranteeing access to sport for all and equal opportunities and by investing in the training of teachers and sports coaches as well as in more public sports facilities, with the state having to assume the costs of safety at non-professional competitions organised by non-profit-making bodies; the importance of giving recognition to sporting successes achieved by women and the fight against discrimination in prizes; the defence of career opportunities for women in fields linked to the world of sport, including in decision-making posts, and drawing attention to non-professional sport.</p>

First, the report refers to the Lisbon Treaty, which has not yet been ratified and is subject to a referendum in Ireland in a month or so. The European Parliament’s federalist majority is thus breaching fundamental constitutional principles. The Lisbon Treaty is also 96% identical to the Constitutional Treaty which has already been rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands. It is therefore completely unprincipled to refer to the Lisbon Treaty in this report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I congratulate the rapporteur and am glad Parliament acted on its own initiative to take up an issue of such importance to citizens of the European Union. The section of the report emphasising the importance of the message sport conveys merits a special mention. The message generally reaches us through the well-known slogan stating that sport equals health. As a result of that slogan, millions of Europeans are taking more care of their physical and mental health. That is not all, however. From our earliest years, sport teaches us about fair competition and honesty, and helps us to understand that our so-called role in the match depends on our own commitment, and that all the work and huge effort devoted to preparing for competitions will be rewarded.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Foreign sportspeople take part in sporting competitions. This helps to counter discrimination and teaches us tolerance at the stadiums. Tolerance is a fundamental element of respect for human rights. It is mentioned in all EU documents.</p>

For these reasons, it is important to create a framework in which the Member States can support sports organisations and events. As sport operates to a large extent at national level, Member States must have the possibility of self-regulation. The White Paper underlines this point and is also an appropriate basis on which to deal with aspects of concern to all countries, such as youth development, anti-doping programmes and anti-discrimination in sport.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report, like the Commission’s White Paper, treats sport as yet another area of business activity designed to rake in money. The EU is trying to convert sport wholly into a commodity so that it brings even greater profitability to sports business groups and multinationals. This is why the EU is using the Lisbon Treaty to extend its powers to cover sport.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is tantamount to the systematic dismantling of amateur sport, even at school level. Amateur sport provides raw material for the sports industry and commercialised championships. Young people and the public as a whole are being treated as spectators and customers of sports entertainment organised by the commercially oriented federations. The fine words about the values promoted by sport, the fight against doping, etc. seem a mockery when the desire to emulate is replaced by ruthless competition. Corruption, doping, bigotry and intolerance are integral parts of commercialised sport; they are used to promote the products of the companies that control it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The sporting and physical exercise needs of young people can be met only by creating infrastructures and developing mass popular sport.

      <p sl="en">The White Book on Sport is like a Russian "matrioshka" puppet: the first is amateur sport, the second is professional sport and the last is football (where the big money is). Thus, it gives the impression that amateur sport which is its declared "raison d'etre" is only an alibi for approaching professional sport, especially football, which seems to be the main target. The White Book is also unequal in its approach: tough on extending the existing rules in traditional fields like discrimination, illegal immigration, illegal drugs, and competition to sportive activities, but soft when it comes to devising special rules for them, as if the people involved should not be scared somehow. In any case, the White Book is heralding a new era of active involvement on the part of the EU bodies in regulating professional sport, mainly European soccer. The good news is that it intends to do it by first talking to the people involved.</p>

      <p sl="it">I welcome the report by Manolis Mavrommatis on the White Paper on Sport. Indeed, I recognise the important role played by sport in the life of every individual and society, in that it is a means whereby everyone can overcome personal challenges, discover their own passions and talents, identify with a group and understand the importance of abiding by rules. By extrapolating these values to an international level one can understand why sport is able to break down geographical barriers and promote social intercourse and peace.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe it necessary to point out that any kind of infringement of civil or moral ethical rules in sport – such as doping, deliberately racist gestures or gambling – must be punished, in an attempt to return to the ideals and ultimate purpose of sport.</p>
      <p sl="it">Last of all, I would point out that there is often a tendency to justify the growing importance of certain types of sport to the detriment of others, through huge wage differentials between the players of various sports.</p>

To that extent I was prepared to support the report. Unfortunately, the really big issue, the one concerning the liberalisation of gambling monopolies in Europe, missed the target. Personally, I believe that liberalisation, under controlled forms and with licensed gambling and lottery companies, would be able to satisfy both the interest of consumers in a range of gambling options and the sports movement’s need for resources.
