      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Council meeting on 28 and 29 June is due to take important decisions on measures to help stimulate economic growth and employment. This is a key element of our overall strategy to ensure that Europe emerges from the current situation with increased growth and a stronger economic basis. To put it very simply, Europe needs growth and Europe needs jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The informal meeting of Heads of State on 23 May, as well as the informal General Affairs Council meeting on 10 and 11 June, paved the way for the preparation of a comprehensive package of measures as part of the growth initiative for Europe. I would like to point to some of the various elements that can be included in this package.</p>
      <p sl="en">On economic policy, job creation is a priority for all of us. Growth is not enough in itself. It must lead to new jobs and we need to do more. The Council welcomes the Commission’s employment package, which certainly contains many interesting ideas, not least to promote youth employment and labour mobility. Let me also give a couple of concrete examples of how some of the proposals already on the table can boost employment. First, adoption of the energy efficiency directive can create up to 400 000 new jobs. Second, new trade agreements with third countries may create about two million new jobs, and a reform of the single market will create even more millions of jobs. As you know, there are roughly the same number of unemployed people across Europe as we have small and medium-sized enterprises. If we could only create one more job in each of these SMEs, we would have taken a giant step towards addressing the unemployment issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Danish Presidency has been committed to making progress on all legislative files which have the potential to deliver growth and employment. On a number of dossiers, we have advanced well and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament for a very constructive partnership with the Presidency on this agenda. This applies, for instance, to the case of roaming regulation and standardisation, where the Council has been able to reach agreement with the European Parliament. We are also on track on issues such as venture capital and social entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="en">The June European Council will also conclude the European Semester through the endorsement of country-specific recommendations set out by the Commission in its proposal of 30 May. Our objective is to guide Member States in their structural reforms, employment policies and national budgets with the overall aim of ensuring that fiscal consolidation and growth go hand in hand. I would like to thank Parliament for the way in which it has offered strong support for the growth and employment agenda, as its motions for resolutions confirm.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to step up efforts to boost the financing of the economy. I am very pleased that the Council and Parliament were able to agree on the project bond pilot phase which will start this summer. The Commission has also proposed a EUR 10 billion increase in paid-in capital to the EIB as part of a new EU growth initiative. Furthermore, efforts should be made regarding better targeting of Structural Funds to foster growth and convergence. The Commission will report on this issue later this month.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another key element to our growth agenda is external economic policy. The European Council will discuss how the Union can better use a trade and investment relationship with key partners as an engine for growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second major item on the June European Council agenda is the multiannual financial framework (MFF). As you know, the MFF package is a top priority for us and, from the very beginning of our Presidency, we have been aiming to make as much progress as possible on this dossier. We based our work on the mandate given to us by the December 2011 European Council, and that is to press ahead with the work aimed at developing a basis for the final stage of negotiations to be discussed at the June European Council. We have taken this mandate very seriously.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the aim of the Presidency has not been to reach a final compromise on this package, all our efforts are directed towards preparing the ground for a first serious and substantial discussion in June and delivering a fully integrated negotiating box containing all the elements for the final agreement, which should help lead to the adoption of the MFF at the end of this year. The MFF dossier constitutes a great opportunity to make the EU budget respond better to today’s and tomorrow’s challenges and needs. It is also essential that the next MFF is fully geared towards growth and job-enhancing policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">In putting the box together, we have listened carefully to delegations in Council meetings. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament’s representatives who have taken part in our work. We have excellent cooperation with the representatives of Parliament, and before every meeting at which the MFF has been on the agenda, we have met with Parliament’s representatives, we have told Ministers what Parliament’s views are and we have also met afterwards. It is also important to stress – and I want to make this very clear – that we must, of course, all follow the legislative procedures laid down in the Treaty, including with regard to codecision. It is also important to say that there is no final deal before there is agreement between the Council and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to ensure further progress in the MFF negotiations, thereby fulfilling the mandate given by the European Council in December, the Presidency has put forward a proposal regarding the structure of the budget, including the placement of instruments that the Commission has proposed to place outside the MFF. It is very important for me to say today that this proposal on the structure of the MFF only relates to the placement of instruments. It does not in any way prejudge the size of the budget or decision-making procedures for those instruments, nor does it prejudge the expenditure level for the headings in which some of those instruments are included. Therefore, the Presidency’s proposal does not entail a reduction in the budget or in the degree of flexibility in the Commission’s proposal. The point of departure for the Presidency is that the proposed amounts for these instruments are transferred, with the instruments, into the relevant headings.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just two days ago, we had a very fruitful discussion on this proposal for a balanced package and structure at the informal General Affairs Council meeting in Horsens in Denmark. I was particularly pleased that Members of the European Parliament were present and gave us very useful input in this regard. I noted the emphasis that the European Parliament put on ensuring a transparent budget where as many expenditure items as possible are subject to the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a final note, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the good cooperation between Parliament and the Council on this dossier.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-012-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, you have invited me to prepare the next European Council with you, and to discuss the economic situation and the multiannual financial framework (MFF). I welcome this choice of topics. The MFF is indeed a crucial part of our response to the challenges we face, as it is a tool for investing in jobs and growth, while reinforcing stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now in a defining moment for European integration and for the European Union. We are seeing that even when governments are taking the right steps towards reform, they can be negatively impacted by events beyond their control, or by the lack of a decisive and comprehensive long-term response. We must recognise that we have a systemic problem and we need to articulate the vision of where we need to go, and also a very concrete path for how to get there. I am not sure whether the urgency of this is fully understood in all the capitals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has always maintained that a combination of immediate measures with medium and long-term steps is part of the comprehensive response we need to overcome the crisis. This was precisely the multi-track approach we developed further in our communication of 30 May.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has proven time and again that it is capable of taking immediate measures when necessary. Just last week, the euro area Member States, the Commission and the ECB decided unanimously to support Spain in its effort to recapitalise its banking sector. This has again proven wrong those critics who say that we do not tackle our problems. On the contrary, our ability to react quickly shows our determination to tackle them head on.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we also need the perspective of the medium and long term. In the medium term, we must continue to implement what has been agreed, from the programme for Greece – and let me state here again that I believe Greece should stay in the euro area, assuming that it respects its commitments – to our proposals to address the more systemic issues, from setting up financial backstops, proposing initiatives for growth and reforming the financial sector to building a real economic union for the future, namely, through the steps that we have been taking on economic governance – the ‘six-pack’, which this Parliament has already approved, and the ‘two-pack’ that I hope we will also endorse today. We have been making progress on all of these areas, but I believe that more should be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the longer term, I will urge the European Council to take concrete commitments towards a fully developed economic and monetary union and a process that maps out the steps to take to get there. More than ever, we need a strong ambition for Europe – ambition for the structural reforms that we need now, and ambition for the deeper economic and monetary union that we need to build in the medium and longer term.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council will focus on growth. I will urge it to endorse a decisive commitment towards sustainable and jobs-rich growth. This growth can only come from a combination of sound public finances, deep structural reforms and targeted investment. At national level, at the end of the second European Semester, I am encouraged that Member States have clearly taken last year’s country-specific recommendations seriously, at least more seriously than in the previous year. Great efforts have been made to implement last year’s recommendations. But more needs to be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">To supplement national action on jobs and growth, the European level should also be playing its part, and indeed it is playing its part. On unemployment, the biggest social challenge we face, the Commission has taken a number of measures, including refocusing Structural Funds, our youth employment initiative and adopting a major employment package, which I presented to you here in April.</p>
      <p sl="en">Implementation on the ground is very much in the hands of the Member States, and I will continue to urge them at the European Council to take the social emergency situation very seriously. In some of our countries, we have worrying developments in terms of the rise of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">On growth, the European Council should agree a growth initiative, building on the ideas we have put forward and which were well received at the informal European Council of 23 May. This includes a number of elements.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the reprogramming of Structural Funds, focusing them on growth and competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, boosting investment at European level through increasing the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank, and project bonds – ideas I set out to this House for the first time in my State of the Union address in September last year. Now – it was about time! – they are building momentum. Two weeks ago, we agreed on our project bonds proposal to unlock up to EUR 4.6 billion in a pilot phase and I expect a clear decision on the EIB at the next European Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, we need to realise the full potential of the single market. I would like to see swift approval in the Council and the European Parliament for the measures of the Single Market Act 1, and the Commission will, moreover, present a Single Market Act II in the autumn. As you know, just last week, we presented a communication on the governance of the single market and how to reinforce it, as well as an analysis of the implementation of the Services Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that if the Heads of State or Government agree to these strategic orientations set out in this growth initiative, we should go further in cementing this approach. Many of the decisions that we need in order to deliver results must be taken by the European Parliament and the Council together. That is why, today, I want to propose that we conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the growth initiative. Given the urgency of the situation, it is important to prioritise key decisions. An interinstitutional agreement would set a fast timetable and get things moving. It would also be a strong message about our partnership – the partnership between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. It would also be a strong message about our determination for growth in the European Union. Moreover, it would ensure the required democratic legitimacy and involvement of the European Parliament, without whom we cannot advance and without which the Commission does not want to advance. On these issues that are so necessary and relevant to our citizens, it is indeed unthinkable that this directly-elected body that is an expression of European democracy could be sidelined.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">On the matter of growth, it is highly appropriate that you singled out the European Union’s future budget to debate today. Quick adoption of the MFF would send an immediate signal that Europe is ready to invest in its future, that we are really serious about growth. It would send a strong message on our commitment to stability and responsibility, given the clear link we have proposed between the MFF and the European Semester of budgetary coordination. In other words, adoption of the MFF is a key stepping stone towards the deepening of economic and monetary union, and towards sustainable growth in Europe as a whole. However, the path ahead will not be easy. With reduced spending power at home, some Member States view the MFF as an extravagance to be minimised, and a potential source of savings to repatriate. This is a great mistake. Our budget is a budget for investment and for growth and I believe that we all agree that in current times, we need to combine stability and growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to dispel the myth that the EU budget is a budget for ‘Brussels’, for the EU structures or institutions. No – the EU budget is money for our regions, our cities, our rural areas. It is money for our citizens, our students, our workers, our entrepreneurs, our scientists, our farmers, our innovators. It is money for the unemployed and those who are afraid of being unemployed. It is money for the future of Europe and for all those who want to have a future in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a strategy for growth – Europe 2020 – and indeed we are preparing new initiatives for growth. The important issue now is to link the MFF and the programmes under the future budget with our overall growth strategy. If we agree that for growth, targeted public investment is necessary to complement structural reforms, then this needs to be reflected in our budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">In many of our Member States, EU funds are the biggest and most stable source of public investment. Just as an example, since 2009, cohesion policy has been equivalent to 97% of total public investment in Hungary, 78% in Lithuania, and over 50% in Poland. What would the situation in these countries be without the contribution of the European budget? It has provided stability in times of crisis, but also flexibility in times of need.</p>
      <p sl="en">These figures show that the European Union budget has a major impact for growth. At the same time, the MFF is in line with sound public finances. At around 1% of EU GDP and less than 2.5% of all public spending in the European Union, the EU budget is focused on priorities, and indeed its impact on deficit positions of Member States is minor. A cut of the Commission’s proposal by ‘at least EUR 100 billion’ over the seven-year period, as some Member States are proposing, would have an effect of 0.084% of the EU GDP on public finances and deficits. This is an amount that certainly does not make or break sound public finances in Europe!</p>
      <p sl="en">Thus, the proposed financial framework for 2014-2020 is an essential piece of a medium- to long-term European growth and competitiveness agenda. The new rules governing EU spending will ensure that smart fiscal consolidation, investment funding and structural fund reforms will go together. The proposed new own resources, including the financial transaction tax, will improve transparency and provide new opportunities for fiscal consolidation and growth. This is the best recipe for growth in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can our project be improved? Certainly, and we are very open to listen to proposals. That being said, I am also concerned with some ideas that threaten to unbalance what we have proposed. Take the idea to squeeze all the ‘off-budget items’ into the budget, from ITER to GMES. I fear that this will ultimately lead to further pressure on our margin for growth-oriented investments. I fear that this will endanger the other programmes in the different headings, from competitiveness to cohesion. I can assure you: for all items outside the MFF, the European Parliament will keep its full institutional prerogatives through the normal annual budget procedure. I hope that Parliament’s resolution on the MFF will take this into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now approaching the phase when the big strategic questions will be considered. While figures matter, we first need a serious look at design, modernisation and simplification, as well as the added value of the budget. In this, the Commission shares plenty of common ground with Parliament, which will adopt a resolution tomorrow. We will continue to press for Parliament’s early involvement in the negotiations, as the outcome will have major implications for the Union’s ability to generate growth, to demonstrate solidarity and to deliver on its common Europe 2020 objectives. I know that these will not be easy negotiations, but we are defending – and will continue to defend – our proposals very robustly.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the core of this European Council will also be a discussion on the building blocks for the future of economic and monetary union. As you know, the European Council asked its President, in close cooperation with the President of the Commission, the President of the European Central Bank and the President of the Euro Group, to prepare a report that should propose a way forward. This report will be the start, not the end, of a process – a process that will be vital for anchoring our current efforts to ensure stability and growth in the longer term and a process in which the European Parliament should be involved from the early stages.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me be clear: Member States must pursue the deep structural reforms that are indispensable for Europe’s competitiveness and growth immediately. The longer term vision should not be seen as a substitute for those reforms, and national leaders must leave no doubt about this. But without confidence in the irreversibility of economic and monetary union, our prospects are limited. Therefore, we need a clear and credible commitment to a vision for the deepening of the union, combined with a process which maps out the main steps towards this goal. The process should generate a progressive dynamic. It would start with steps that could and should be taken immediately, leading to medium and longer term steps which might require treaty changes. Greater solidarity and greater responsibility must go hand in hand. Each step towards further solidarity would be accompanied by a corresponding step towards greater responsibility, and vice-versa.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such a commitment will send a clear signal that the Member States and the EU institutions consider economic and monetary union and the euro as indispensable assets for Europe’s future. The main building blocks include moving towards a banking union and a fiscal union. The timing and nature of the process will vary for each building block. Some elements will require a higher degree of political integration with, in parallel, measures to ensure increased accountability and democratic legitimacy. To this end, the whole process must have the Community method as its guiding principle to ensure ever greater coherence, both on principles and on methods and instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Here, a fundamental point needs to be made. The Commission believes that it is essential to pursue this process as far as possible with all Member States. We advocate further integration within the euro area. It is now evident that this is indispensable for the sustainability of our common currency, and we are happy to see that also outside the euro area, in Europe and outside Europe, there is now a consensus that we need further integration in the euro area. But under no circumstances must this be seen as an alternative to the integrity of the single market, or indeed the integrity of the Union as a whole. It must be seen as a mutually reinforcing process. Our economic relations bind us all: euro area members and non-euro members alike, our futures are linked.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why the treaties are clear – and I have to say this because the Commission is the Guardian of the Treaties – there is only one Union; there is only one European Parliament; there is only one European Commission. This is so because fragmentation is not an option. Financial stability and economic prosperity through economic and monetary union, and within it through the euro as common currency, are common goals – for those who are already in the common currency as much as for those who are preparing to join it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must recognise that some countries do have opt-outs. These opt-outs must be taken into appropriate account in the future architecture. But they remain the exception, not the rule. Those who wish to advance must be able to do so. But enhanced cooperation or properly circumscribed derogations can allow for this without creating a risk to the integrity of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now briefly sketch out the main building blocks. Financial integration is one area where major progress could quickly be made, even without treaty changes. Thus, the creation of a banking union appears as a natural priority. I see two major steps. First, we should accelerate the adoption of proposals already on the table. That means adopting the Commission’s proposal for a single rulebook – the capital requirements rules – and beyond that, the proposals we have made concerning deposit guarantees and bank resolution, including provisions to introduce solidarity via obligatory mutual lending between national funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, by autumn, the Commission could be ready to come forward with key proposals to introduce more integrated banking supervision and common deposit guarantee and resolution funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">The full benefits from deepening the economic and monetary union and from creating the banking union can, however, only be reaped with the development of the fiscal union. Here, the immediate step is building on the effective coordination of fiscal and economic policies through the European Semester, including through the swift adoption of the ‘two-pack’ proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Going beyond that, three further steps can be identified. First, we should further refine our financial backstops – the EFSM, the EFSF and its successor, the ESM – to strengthen our potential to intervene in support of financial stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, we need a serious discussion about the joint issuance and mutualisation of national debt in the form of stability bonds. This includes agreement on their preconditions, namely, much more joint decision making in all economic and budgetary matters. We will not achieve stability bonds without a greater degree of integration. In its Green Paper of November 2011, the Commission made public its ideas on how the euro area can move technically towards joint issuance of debt. A road map and a timetable will need to be worked out that also takes into account the need to build the necessary political and democratic momentum.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, other options for a deeper fiscal integration also need to be explored. Fiscal union is much more than just stability bonds. For instance, it also means more coordination in taxation policy and a much stronger European approach to budgetary matters, both at national and EU level. I have already discussed the EU budget in the context of the MFF. In the longer term, stronger solidarity mechanisms could play an even more important role.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have already referred to the need to link the development of fiscal union with the development of political union. A deeper economic and monetary union requires deeper accountability and legitimacy. Making the technical proposals is, ironically, the easier part. But if the technical proposals are made without proper support throughout the European Union, we risk a backlash. Decisions of historic dimension need to be prepared, and the citizens need to be involved in the debate. We must work together to ensure this and we can only ensure it if the Community method remains at the heart of our move forward. I am convinced that this House, directly elected by the citizens, must and will play a crucial role in this respect: the European Parliament is the basis of European democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is one of the reasons why I deeply deplore the recent orientation taken in Council on our Schengen proposals and the European Parliament’s involvement in the relevant legislation.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">This is the wrong signal to send at the wrong time on a core area of European construction in terms of freedom of movement. We need more, not less, parliamentary democracy in our union.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to finish by saying a very brief word on the G20 meeting next week. The EU representatives will be able to report on how Europe is meeting its difficulties with determination. We are not complacent about our difficulties, we will be open about them, but, at the same time, I hope that we will be proud to say what we are determined to achieve. For instance, the proposal we put forward last week on a common framework for banking crisis management and resolution makes Europe the first jurisdiction in the world to be delivering on all the G20 commitments to strengthen the regulation and supervision of the banking sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can expect others in the world to point the finger at the European Union and the euro area as the source of all the world’s problems, including their own. It is always easier to talk about the problems of others in order to distract attention away from one’s own problems. But in the end, we all have challenges. Ultimately, these are common challenges. We need to address them together, also on the global scale.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe’s contribution must be far-reaching reforms. We need reforms in Europe. Europe’s contribution must also be a big step for an ever closer, ever stronger Union of stability and growth. I believe we have the right case to make and I thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that the Member States tackled the real problems and had the courage to answer the real questions. It is time for the European Council to finally adopt tough measures on 28 and 29 June, rather than settle for fall-back mechanisms that are immediately overtaken by events.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), these real questions in actual fact boil down to one: are we ready to make the necessary political leap to make the European Union and the euro area work? This is a question that could not be asked two years ago.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Are we both clear-headed and politically courageous enough to defend and organise shared political sovereignty, or are we going to allow our laws, our policies, our societal choices to be dictated by the financial markets and banks, as we have been doing for two years now, lurching from one crisis Council to the next?</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">We must assume our responsibilities once and for all. What we want is a European Union with a social and fiscal model, and we need to show this. This is a difficult time and, in times of crisis, we move forwards and not backwards.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have to face reality and stop deluding ourselves. The reality is that no country in Europe can tackle global challenges, whether economic, social, demographic, military or political, single-handedly. We see this every day. Each Member State says, ‘I do not need Europe, I do not need Europe,’ and, the next day, it asks for help.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Members of the Council, the reality is that, over the last 60 years, we have achieved peace and prosperity and that this has been possible thanks to a method, the Community method. I believe deeply in this method, just as I am convinced that Europe is the solution and not the problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, ladies and gentlemen, on 28 and 29 June, notwithstanding such important issues as economic governance, the credibility of the euro, and financial perspectives, the PPE Group will, first and foremost, call on the Member States to make a choice, a major choice that will determine the rest: do you want to ensure a future for Europeans and to focus on what is really important, which is to ensure strong political integration through the Community method?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Or do you prefer to keep on pretending that you have economic sovereignty only to find, the day after each summit, the day after each meeting of Finance Ministers, that the decisions taken are inadequate and untimely and that we are heading for disaster? Do you prefer, as you did on 7 June in relation to Schengen, to withdraw to your borders and fall back on your intergovernmental arrangements?</p>
      <p sl="fr">If you go for the first option, Parliament will be happy to work with you to find lasting solutions to the problems of our fellow citizens. However, if the Council stubbornly refuses to agree on the main issues, we will not see the light at the end of the tunnel in the short term.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those are my requests to the Council. I would also like to request that the President of Parliament be finally given the opportunity to debate with the Heads of State or Government all the subjects that will affect the future of Europeans. The President of the Commission has his place in the Council, as does the President of the Central Bank. Is the democratically elected President not as worthy as the President of the Central Bank?</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">The person who represents 500 million Europeans, presides over the only institution elected by universal suffrage, and who leads the institution that legislates with the Council is asked to leave the Chamber after he has given his presentation. What democracy, what transparency can we demonstrate to the outside world? European integration cannot be achieved without the democratic legitimacy embodied by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Barroso, I will end by saying – and I know that you repeat things time and again, as we do, in this Chamber – that we need to continue to make recommendations. We need to continue to table new proposals on social and fiscal union and we must not be afraid to publicise them. Go ahead – Parliament is with you. We are the driving force behind the proposals, and the Council needs us in the difficult crisis situation in which it finds itself. It needs to find solutions and we need to put them on the table, even more so than we have done so far. You can count on us.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I hope that everyone who applauded Mr Daul today will provide evidence when it comes to the ‘two-pack’ that what Mr Daul said is also the opinion of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), for example, and that we really will find the solutions that we need to overcome the crisis. Mr Daul, we will see this afternoon how serious that applause was. Nonetheless, we applaud you for what you said.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barroso, you have offered us an interinstitutional agreement. My group is prepared to go along with that. There is no point in having an agreement, however, unless it has substance. If it amounts to nothing more than us saying that we now need completion of the internal market and austerity, and all that will bring growth – which remains the majority opinion to date, even among governments – then there is no point in such an agreement. Moreover, there is only a point to the agreement if we actually pass real measures at the time of the upcoming summit. After all, am I supposed to say to the many millions of young unemployed people that, although they do not have a job, we can give them an interinstitutional agreement? They will hardly be enthralled by that.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not want to mock what you have said; I take it seriously. I simply want to draw attention to what it is that we really need. We need swift decisions, and swift decisions in the coming days. We have a debt problem, the debts are growing and not reducing because our Heads of Government still have not grasped what this is all about and do not have the courage to tackle what you have proposed and what we have proposed in order to solve the debt problem together.</p>
      <p sl="de">All of a sudden, there is talk of a banking union. If you recall, ladies and gentlemen, we proposed that two years ago. The Commission was moving in that direction, and the government officials and the finance ministers said ‘No, no, no, that is going much too far’ and ‘European supervision of the banks must be reduced – we need more national regulation’. It has taken the Heads of Government two years to think it over. At present, the Heads of Government need two years to arrive at the right ideas. The same is true of other things that you mentioned, Mr Barroso. That is the situation at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="de">We recently had a large conference involving young people from all over Europe which was not linked to any political party. There were a great many young people there who had done something, rather than just complaining that nothing was happening. They had established small businesses, created start-ups. However, what they were asking was where there was currently any demand, where they could sell their products, who was now ensuring that there is growth, who was investing in infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I am saying that, yes, we can talk very earnestly about an agreement, but now is the time for action. Once again, I can only quote from The Economist. You will see it and recognise it. The ship is in deep water and the question is – a question I can only agree with:</p>
      <p sl="de">Please can we start the engine now, Ms Merkel? Yes, we have to start the engine now and not in one or two years, when it is too late.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me now also say something about the budget, which, after all, is an element of the growth strategy. At the moment, a lot of people are saying, ‘We want the growth, but we do not want the budget – or we want a reduced budget’. What kind of nonsense is that? It is precisely in the many elements of the budget that we find aspects of a growth strategy – much more so than in national budgets.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to quote somebody who is not a socialist, but rather a fellow Member of your party, Mr Lewandowski, and that is Poland’s finance minister, who said to me in conversation that everyone is talking about how we must invest more in research and development and not so much in infrastructure and the Cohesion Fund, but we also need resources for growth; we also need ways to invest in all the regions that are still in a very poor economic position.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">That is why it makes no sense to simply cut this budget; instead, we have to use it more efficiently and sensibly. However, if we talk about being more competitive, if we say that we have to do something to make us competitive globally as well, then we cannot cut the budget – which is a small budget in any case, but which is an element of this strategy, and it is an element that we absolutely cannot do without. That is why we have to go down this road together.</p>
      <p sl="de">I warmly welcome the fact that you attended the Friends of Cohesion summit in Bucharest, Mr Barroso – even if you came in for some criticism. The statement could have been somewhat more strongly worded, for, on one side, there are those who want to do nothing but cut and cut and cut again and, on the other, just words. However, a good initiative has been established, because we cannot just listen to those who constantly say that we have to cut resources – we also have to listen to those who are using these resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, a distinction is being made between net contributors and net beneficiaries, as if one were the good guys and the other the poor people receiving alms. The net beneficiaries are not being given alms; they are receiving a good share so that they can expand their economies. I am from Austria, a net contributor country, and I know very well that my country is also profiting a great deal from the fact that Hungary, Romania, Poland and many other countries are receiving EU funding. Let us therefore do away with this division into good net contributors and bad net beneficiaries.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Finally, Mr President, with just a few exceptions, we were unanimous yesterday in telling the Council that the way decisions were made on Schengen is not acceptable. I hope we can retain this unanimity when it comes to the budget, that we will send a clear message to the Council, and also to all those who blindly want to make cuts everywhere, that this is not acceptable. If we cannot reach agreement – I appreciate what you said, Mr Wammen – then we will just have to go to the 2013 budget and update it. We can live with that. I hope the Council can live with it too.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I think that Joseph Daul pinched my text, because I do not have much more to say now after his speech. No, really, for the first time, I have almost nothing to add …</p>
      <a text="(Exclamation from Mr Daul: ‘The groups are going to merge’.)"/>
      <p sl="fr">I do not know if they should merge. Rather, we are going to take the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) back from you. That seems like a good idea.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us be clear, the Council has just agreed on a bail-out of EUR 100 billion for the Spanish banks, and what is the consequence? Let us face it, because it is alarming: it is that the markets do not believe us. On Monday, yesterday, the spreads had gone up dramatically to more than 500 basic points, even nearly 600 basic points for Spain; nearly 500 basic points also for Italy. We have to ask what is happening. Are they mad or are we mad? Are we seeing things properly?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Well, I think we all know the answer in this House – maybe not the ECR and maybe not UKIP, but I think that everybody else can see that unless we find a structural and a global solution to the crisis, we will simply continue fire-fighting as we are doing now. Because that is what we are doing, fire-fighting, and fighting one fire after the other. Greece first, then Ireland, then Portugal, then Spain, and tomorrow, you may be sure, Italy. Not setting up a systemic answer, a structural solution to the crisis and not building a real firewall that can resist.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What do we need? We know what we need. Three things: a banking union with a deposit guarantee scheme, with a single supervisor – what this Parliament already asked for two years ago and was refused by the Council. This deposit guarantee scheme is a proposal on the table and yet the Council is not even able to agree on a common position on that proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second thing we know also: a fiscal union including a redemption fund – the one we will vote on today in the ‘two-pack’, so there is no need for an initiative from the Council or the Commission about that. They simply need to respond to the legislative proposal of the Parliament in the coming days and weeks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we know what we really need, which is a political union with a real economic government. So my plea to you, Mr Barroso, is to say that speeches here, speeches in the Council and recommendations from the Commission are all very well, but what we need now are legislative proposals from your side put directly on the table of the Council and Parliament on a banking union, on a fiscal union and on a political union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is no need to wait for an agreement between France and Germany and Italy and Spain. You have the right of initiative; you can make things happen and move forward. Put your proposals on the table on a redemption fund, and put your proposals on the table for a real banking union. Do it now, in the next weeks, because I am not sure that on 28 and 29 June, our leaders in the Council will agree on a banking union and can agree on a redemption fund.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and own resources, I regret one thing, which is that neither the Council nor the Commission have said one word, one phrase, on something that is the most crucial element of this multiannual financial framework which is, finally, to come back to the initial idea of the founding fathers and to make a direct link between the citizens and the European Union. There is no real democracy in Europe if you only have a parliament with no say in the resources of its institutions. In every parliament, in every country, in every democratic country in the world, the parliament has a direct say on the resources of the country, on the resources of the state. So that is what we need most now in these discussions and in this debate, and I can tell you that there will be no consent from our group to the multiannual financial framework if there are no own resources in this multiannual financial framework.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – I am more of the opinion of David Cameron. Two or three days ago he said something like: ‘Oh, the eurozone needs to solve its problems. We need a real union and real union of the eurozone. We need an economic union in the eurozone; we need a fiscal union in the eurozone; we need a political union in the eurozone!’ That is what David Cameron said. He is now the best of federalists – outside the eurozone, naturally! He stays outside, but he has a message to give us.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is Barack Obama saying? ‘Oh, the Europeans have to solve their problems. They have to create a union’. The problem is not Europe in this crisis, the problem is that there is not enough Europe – that is the real problem of the crisis today.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this debate, in which everyone is talking about a political Europe and European sovereignty, I want to examine the definition of sovereignty. There will only be political sovereignty if Europe has financial sovereignty. Otherwise, it will not work. I would like to give you a brief, very practical, illustration based on the problem we are now facing. Mr Verhofstadt is right: we will only achieve financial sovereignty if Europe manages to obtain its own resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What does that mean? It simply means that, today, the Member States, including the French Government, are saying, ‘We can no longer increase the national contribution’. Fine! Let us accept the situation! It is up to them to decide.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, if, as the Commission has proposed, as we have discussed, we have a financial transaction tax, a European carbon tax, a mobile phone tax, these three possibilities – and I could give you others – would bring in an extra EUR 40 to 50 billion for the European budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From this point on, the discussion becomes completely absurd. Now, we are told, ‘All right, if you have own resources, we will give all these resources back to the Member States’. The Commission’s much-vaunted proposal on the financial transaction tax posits a ‘two thirds/one third’ distribution. In other words, a third will be given directly to Member States, and the remaining two thirds to be allocated to the European Union will be deducted from national contributions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, 100% is given back to the Member States. There is no own resource. It is a resource diverted to the Member States and not a resource for the European Union. This will not enable us to move forward. Furthermore, the Council then tells us, ‘And you are going to further reduce the European budget’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, this is not an abstract debate. It is the very basis of the so-called political sovereignty of Europe. If we accept that own resources are resources for the Member States and not resources for the European budget, where do we go from here? We do not have to accept this sort of horse-trading. We do not have to say yes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The only possibility for Europe to be able to invest in order to create jobs and to sustain the cohesion funds is through increasing the European budget. Let us accept that national contributions are unable to finance it. However, own resources are the way to increase the European budget precisely to sustain the deficits of the economies of the Member States. It is not for the European Parliament that we want own resources; it is for the citizens of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I believe that the fight we are going to get into now, which will be a fight over the question ‘Do we accept that the budget should stay at its current level?’, would be a mistake. The truth is that, if there is no real increase in the European budget which will ensure that own resources become resources for the budget and not simply a return of resources to the Member States, if we do not have this power, this capacity, then, despite all the talk of European sovereignty and the need for more Europe, we will not succeed in delivering the necessary policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is our legitimacy, it is our credibility as Europeans that we are defending. That is why, when it comes to financial perspectives, we must say to the Council and to the Member States, ‘Do not assume that, this time, Parliament is going to lie down. You will see that you will not have any financial perspectives if you do not move consistently. Otherwise, stay at home! You are spending too much money with your summits and that is pointless’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Europe is facing yet another in its long line of crises, only this time, in my view, it is fast becoming a crisis of the legitimacy of the EU itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of us warned that a monetary union with a light touch, which was envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty, could not work and, for a single currency to succeed, significant centralisation of power would be required – a centralisation which, for many of us, was totally unacceptable. That is where the EU finds itself today. It is bringing more centralisation upon itself in what is an increasingly desperate attempt to get ahead of the crisis, which so far it has completely failed to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">When the markets are unimpressed, when the Spanish banks are lent EUR 100 billion, then there is a clear signal that the failure is continuing. This latest Spanish bailout lasted barely 24 hours before it was, as Mr Verhofstadt said, being questioned on the markets. If I can use a somewhat crude analogy, it is a little bit like wetting your pants at the North Pole. At first it feels warm and comforting, but very quickly you realise just how much trouble you are in fact in.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me make two points. First, it would be unacceptable that the measures it is proposed we take should fall upon those who proposed originally to steer clear of this risky venture and, second, those countries who signed up to join a single currency with one set of governing rules should not now be obliged to join a single currency with a completely different set of governing rules. So those countries that are not yet in the euro should be released from their obligation to join.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the last 20 years, the EU has become ever more out of touch with public opinion, and that has shown in many recent elections and referendums. The people of Europe are becoming increasingly worried about centralisation, and about the remoteness of those who are gaining more power in the EU by the day. In no area is this seen more starkly than the management of the EU budget. The Commission talks about synergies, about investments, about added value, and the public just sees waste, mismanagement and fraud.</p>
      <p sl="en">An even bigger budget is being requested. The public just wonders why it is that for 17 years in succession, the budget has been implemented with significantly high levels of illegal or irregular payments. People here are complaining that the concept of value for money is somehow getting in the way of European solidarity. The public just wonders how on earth one can justify wanting even more money when the money already being spent is spent so badly.</p>
      <p sl="en">To win back public legitimacy and regain trust, the EU needs to take reform seriously, it needs to respond to the needs of the people and not impose ideas upon them. Make no mistake, when we are facing so many different crises on so many fronts, we are very fast running out of time.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – I accept that, for a single currency to work, there has to be a whole series of different measures. There have to be significant fiscal transfers from the richer states to the poorer states.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is fine for me to say that as somebody who is quite happily outside the single currency. If I were a German taxpayer, I might have one or two concerns about it.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for this issue of the budget – that somehow a euro spent at European level somehow magically appears from this magical money tree without any impact on national budgets – I just say one thing. It is surely illogical for the Commission – for Mr Lewandowski and Mr Barroso – to be saying to Member States: ‘you have to impose austerity, you have to reduce your budget, you have to get your fiscal balances under control – oh, but by the way, we want more of your cash taken to a European level to spend on your behalf because we know how to spend it better than you do’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States are not sitting there with large piles of cash. They are all running fiscal deficits. What the Commission is saying to them is: ‘We want you to add to your fiscal deficit in order to give us more money because somehow our spending lots of money at a European level will solve the crisis’.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, another one bites the dust. Country No 4, Spain, gets bailed out, and we all of course know that it will not be the last.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I wondered over the weekend whether perhaps I was missing something, because the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, said that this bailout shows what a success the eurozone has been. I thought, well, having listened to him over the previous couple of weeks telling us there would not be a bailout, I have the feeling, after all his twists and turns, that he is just about the most incompetent leader in the whole of Europe – and that is saying something because there is pretty stiff competition! Indeed, every single prediction of yours, Mr Barroso, has been wrong, and dear old Herman Van Rompuy, well, he has done a runner has he not? The last time he was here, he told us we had turned the corner and that the euro crisis was over; he has not bothered to come back and see us since.</p>
      <p sl="en">I remember being here 10 years ago and listening to the launch of the Lisbon Agenda. We were told that with the euro, by 2010, we would have full employment and, indeed, that Europe would be the competitive and dynamic powerhouse of the world. By any objective criteria, the euro has failed and, in fact, there is a looming impending disaster.</p>
      <p sl="en">This deal makes things worse, not better. EUR 100 billion is being put up for the Spanish banking system and 20% of that money has to come from Italy. Under the deal, the Italians have to lend to the Spanish banks at 3%, but to get that money they have to borrow on the markets at 7%. It is genius, is it not! It really is brilliant.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what we are doing with this package is actually driving countries like Italy towards needing to be bailed out themselves. In addition to that, we have put a further 10% on Spanish national debt and I will tell you – and any banking analyst will tell you – that EUR 100 billion will not solve the Spanish problem; it would need to be more like EUR 400 billion.</p>
      <p sl="en">With Greece teetering on the edge of euro withdrawal, the real elephant in the room is that once Greece leaves, the European Central Bank is bust. It is gone. It has EUR 444 billion worth of exposure to the bailed-out countries and to rectify that there will need to be a cash call on Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy! You could not make it up, could you? It is total and utter failure. This ship – the Euro Titanic – has now hit the iceberg and, sadly, there simply are not enough lifeboats.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with the prophesies of doom that have just been made. However, I would like to make it clear that a fiscal union based on the ‘two-pack’ is, in my opinion, tantamount to declaring the old European idea bankrupt. Once again, Parliament is having to catch up with events. That is my concern.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the end of June, a summit will be held and we are preparing for it. It will go ahead, the family photos will be taken and people will behave as if everything will go on as before with a few minor changes. However, we are already right in the middle of the changes. We are still hearing the old fairy stories about the good old EU. It seems, and this is one point which I would like to highlight in particular, that the initiatives are contradictory. One amounts to the introduction of supranational structural policies and the other consists of the increasing renationalisation of policies during the course of the crisis. These are two sides of the same coin, in other words, a fiscal and banking union to allow the EU to continue as a neoliberal project on a new level. This is accompanied on both sides by massive cuts in social services, drastic reductions in public spending and more stringent sanction mechanisms. Part of the logic of this way of thinking is that the parliaments and, in particular, the European Parliament should be marginalised.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I strongly support the protests against the separation and renationalisation of elements of the Schengen Agreement. For this reason, I am very much in favour of Parliament making a clear statement about the multiannual financial framework and not allowing itself to be pushed aside. The Community method must not be replaced by the Union method. This must not happen. The institutions rely on one another and if one institution tries to reduce the power of the others, the result will be the collapse of the idea of the European Union. I would like to make this clear in the light of the multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important for us to talk about the fact that the original EU subsidy policy has now been reinterpreted. Funds which were intended to reduce the discrepancies between the Member States and the regions are now being used to create a multispeed EU – it is no longer possible to talk only about two speeds – and to increase the competition to attract new businesses between the regions within the European Union. The weak must remain weak and the funding will go to areas where global competitive strengths can be increased and market orientation is needed. This is why the macro-economic conditionalities are being introduced and why subsidies for the regions are being abolished if the Member States fail to meet the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact. It is both absurd and cruel for you to penalise the people who live in these regions on several levels. You know exactly what I am talking about in this context.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead, we need sustainable growth which focuses on strengthening the public sector and on public responsibility. This is why I believe that you have the wrong priorities and the wrong conditions. This makes discussion about a different Europe more difficult. Why are you blackmailing the Greek voters? Why are you criticising all the serious initiatives and alternatives that come not only from those on the left but also from academics in several European countries. They are saying that we need to open up a window which will allow us to gain some time and to link the two serious concerns of the Greek people together. They want to stay in the euro area and they want conditions that will allow them to survive and to live normal lives. We in Parliament must commit ourselves to achieving this.</p>

      <p sl="nl">So let us be absolutely clear: the Dutch Party for Freedom (PPV) is against the EU’s own resources and, along with other Member States, is demanding a drastic reduction in the EU’s multiannual budget of at least EUR 100 billion. If we follow this reasoning, we come to the conclusion that democracy is not guaranteed here, but in Member States, where it belongs. Fortunately, each of the Member States has a veto when deciding whether or not to approve the multiannual budget.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If it were up to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, then all of them would continue to enjoy a nice snooze while the importance of Dutch sovereignty is frittered away. However, we do still believe in the nation state that decides if any, and how much, money will be spent outside the national borders.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Blue-card answer. – Mr Surján, thank you for your question. The answer is quite straightforward. The Dutch population previously rejected the Treaty of Lisbon with a large majority. We did not want it then, we do not want it now, nor do we accept it. Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that Europe is going over the heads of Dutch citizens in making decisions and we do not want that any longer.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, about a year ago, Parliament decided by a large majority to adopt the ‘six-pack’. We were forging ahead with a strong sense of cooperation. We agreed that, in order to solve the problems, we needed to put in place active, realistic austerity measures. We are now in the process of adopting the ‘two-pack’ and the cooperation is suddenly no longer working. The compromise in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has failed because some of the groups have stopped collaborating. All of a sudden, we are hearing people here saying things like ‘We simply need to spend more money and our problems will be solved’, but everybody knows that this is nonsense. Where will the money actually come from? There are limits to what can be expected of other groups of Europe’s citizens, in terms of how much they will be prepared to spend. On the other hand, is what Mr Cohn-Bendit just said true? In that case, we must raise taxes and ask the citizens to pay up once again. This is just the same old response, the same old story that has never worked.</p>
      <p sl="de">No, we must take the difficult route, which means saving and making sure that the money we have – and we do still have money in Europe – is spent intelligently and in the right places. Is the money that we have being used where it is needed and is it having the impact that we promised ourselves? Where are the reports on what is happening, the checks and the consideration of whether we are doing the right thing? Qualification measures, spending money correctly, putting incentives in place, creating trust and taking a long-term approach are what is required.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot buy growth. That is simply ridiculous. We have to work for growth. We need to create the right conditions for growth so that people can bring it about and we need to make sure that we stay on the right track.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it makes absolutely no sense to talk about growth if we do not create the instruments for growth. The European Union budget is one of the strongest instruments for providing growth in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not like the national budgets. This is not just another tax burden for the citizens. The EU budget is not just another item of expenditure in national budgets. It is small but it is efficient. It creates economies of scale, it creates economies of scope and it can direct investments at European level at very targeted goals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU budget is currently 44 times less than national budgets in Europe. It costs every European citizen a coffee per day. That is the cost of Europe to European citizens. At the same time, it has decreased over the last 20 years by 20% in relative terms, whereas national budgets have increased in recent years. In 2011, 23 out of 27 countries increased their national budgets. In 2012, 24 out of 27 countries increased their national budgets. So I would argue that, if anything, Europe is becoming weaker because the EU budget is becoming weaker and national budgets are becoming stronger. This is what has happened in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union budget goes back to the Member States. Ninety-four percent of the EU budget goes back to the Member States. For example, I have met a Polish Minister who said that for every one euro invested in cohesion policy, nearly 70 cents go back to the old Member States, to the contributors. From the investments made in cohesion between 2000 and 2006, we have 0.7% growth in Europe and that might reach 4% later on. So when we speak about the EU budget, this is not a budget which is spent badly.</p>
      <p sl="en">By the way, Mr Callanan, the European Court of Auditors said that the UK is one of the examples with the highest error rate in spending EU money. This is not a reason to decrease the EU budget. You have to fix the systems in the United Kingdom. When we speak about own resources, this means that we have to decrease national contributions. That would help the consolidation of the national budgets so we would very much insist on what …</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, as a Member of Parliament’s negotiating delegation for the Medium-Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF), I would like to begin by thanking the Danish Presidency and its Minister for Europe, Mr Wammen, and his team for the sound, open and trusting collaboration that we have enjoyed. You have listened to us, and we have enjoyed a heads-up about what was on the way.</p>
      <p sl="da">This is a major package. It is not, after all, just about the economic framework; it also involves almost 60 different legislative proposals that establish future agricultural policy, the rules for the Structural Funds, for research programmes, for educational programmes, for transport investments and investments in energy. It is thus an enormous complex that is now to be adopted, and it seems to me that you have handled it well.</p>
      <p sl="da">It has been said many times today that the budget is an important tool to ensure growth and jobs, and it is important that we should have this multiannual framework in order to make it possible to plan investments and to provide certainty in respect of the common agricultural policy. But, and it is a big but, 2020, which is the year up to which the framework runs, is a long way away, and there has to be flexibility, as unforeseen events could happen before 2020. We need flexibility both in the shape of reserves and in the shape of the ability to re-jig funds if we find we want to change our priorities at some point in the future.</p>
      <p sl="da">Let me illustrate using the example that, six months after the last time one of these budget frameworks was adopted, the Russians turned off the gas supply to Bulgaria, whereupon we discovered that we needed an EU energy policy. There was no money to support such an energy policy, however. We came up with a solution by finding unused money within the agricultural budget, but it is not certain that we will be able to do so in future. There is thus a need for flexibility, and that will continue to be the case in the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Barroso, we need to achieve three things in the European Union. We must consolidate our budgets, introduce structural reforms and take targeted measures to stimulate growth, for psychological reasons, so that we can give the citizens of Europe new hope and also overcome our common problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Wammen began his speech today by saying: ‘Europe needs growth and Europe needs jobs’. At the same time, Denmark belongs to the club of net contributors who want to cut the European budget. How stupid, short-sighted and un-European! The multiannual financial framework is one of the instruments for growth that we urgently need. We must achieve our common goals: collecting taxes and introducing the financial transaction tax, because it is a fair instrument. We must finally get around to implementing it.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is only fair for the banks at last to contribute to financing the crisis. That must not only be the job of the taxpayers. The responsibility for dealing with the crisis must not be unloaded onto them. The proposal made by Mr Lewandowski is a good one. You have finally realised that we need to make progress with the financial transaction tax now. Two-thirds of it must be used as own resources for the European budget. The Member States will have one benefit from this. They will need to contribute less money to the European budget and, in addition, they will have another incentive. They will be saving their own money and we will be able to finance our cross-border policies jointly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I would like to promote this idea once again. It is not a radical left-wing proposal, Ms Merkel. Mr Lewandowski belongs to your own group of parties and, what is so important, we can implement this proposal in 2012. If everyone were to join in, we would have EUR 47 billion of additional revenue by 2014.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, Ms Merkel and all the other Heads of State or Government, how can anyone be so stupid that they do not want to understand that the European budget is the democratic element which will stimulate growth in Europe, with the involvement of Parliament. We in Parliament and the Council must finally summon up the courage to implement this sensible policy.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, it feels distinctly sad to be sitting in a body, the majority of whose members have lost touch with reality, as is the case with the European Parliament. That majority still think, moreover, that they represent the citizens of Europe. The words spoken here by Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Cohn-Bendit are, unfortunately, not isolated views, but convictions clearly shared by the majority of the European Parliament. The majority here actually believe that it is possible to build some kind of unified, centralised federal state in place of the EU. The demands to introduce own resources for the European budget unfortunately belong to the rhetorical toolbox of this federalist tendency. Giving the European budget its own resources will clearly allow the European Parliament and the Commission to inflate the budget. It will weaken the link between Member States – which are the foundation stones of European integration – and the European level. It will also allow the Commission and the European Parliament to further circumvent the Member States. For this reason, such a principle is unacceptable. I hope that the European Council and those governments that still retain some sanity will say a clear and emphatic ‘no’ to this plan.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, economic union can only exist if the citizens of Europe, regardless of their home State, feel that their State is participating pari passu in such union. Participation pari passu means fair redistribution of European GDP. Participation pari passu means that German citizens and Maltese citizens participate pari passu in the election of Union leaders.</p>
      <p sl="el">As regards States’ debts, where those debts accrued because the system generated debts for one State while, for the same reasons, generating profits for another State, the only solution is to write off those debts. It is also high time the European Central Bank started lending to States, rather than banks. The Union’s needs and objectives cannot be serviced by economies that decimate the prosperity of its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="el">As regards the method of financing the Union, successive adjustments to the system have benefited the most wealthy Member States, because some such countries, which apparently are paying a contribution to the EU budget of over 10%, are, in fact, paying less than 1% of their per capita GDP. A budget financing system based on traditional own resources, in conjunction with the abolition of corruption and discounts, would be the most advantageous, because it is more in keeping with the principles of justice and solidarity.</p>

I regret to say that, so far, you have, in fact, failed to tackle the central issue, which is that the financial sector has become detached from the real economy. Whatever we have decided here, the experts constantly counter this by saying that still no serious boundaries have been imposed on the shadow banking sector, there are still systemic risks, that the issue of ‘too big to fail’ has still not been appropriately addressed – and we need hardly mention the ratings agencies.</p>

We are convinced that the budget is necessary to finance strategic investments in the internal market and its infrastructure, crucially needed in order to boost jobs, sustainable growth and competitiveness. I therefore very much welcome the broad agreement on my report on project bonds.</p>

      <p sl="en">Let me focus on the negotiations on the financial framework. They are complicated, as several different procedures are involved. Codecision on sector programmes, consent on the MFF as such – meaning a veto for the European Parliament – a right for Parliament to be heard on own resources, and, on top of that, an interinstitutional agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not easy, so let us speak clearly. This Parliament, elected to represent the citizens, will not accept that Member States’ leaders take decisions in areas subject to codecision such as Structural Funds, research, agricultural infrastructure, etc., without a full codecision procedure. That procedure can be finalised only when we have an agreement on the financial envelopes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two, the positions on the MFF agreed by the European Council must be negotiated between Parliament and the General Affairs Council in order to get our consent. A fait accompli will not be accepted.</p>
      <p sl="en">Three, Parliament and Council should have fully-fledged negotiations on all MFF-related aspects and programmes before deciding on figures and finalising the MFF package.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I agree with Mr Wammen: nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, but that includes MFF ceilings and legislative programmes as well as own resources.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this debate on the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework is a debate of fundamental political importance, through which Europe, which is in crisis, is making the political choice to plan for the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For us, four priorities have been identified, the first of which is the establishment of the financial transaction tax. For many years, our group has defended the introduction of this tax, the aim of which is to regulate the speculative financial mechanisms which are largely responsible for the current crisis. This tax will bring in new resources without penalising economic or social equilibrium.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second priority, made possible by the creation of this tax, is for the European Union to obtain substantial own resources as a substitute for the contributions of Member States. This will be a major leap forward for the European institutions, which will no longer be held hostage by any particular net contributor country. The EU will be able to commit its own resources in complete freedom.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third priority is to ensure that an adequate budget is available, at least at the level of the debate of our Parliament on the report by its Special Committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 (SURE). The creation of the financial transaction tax should have enabled us to go further, but, at the very least, we must avoid any regression. Less budget would mean less Europe, when what we need today is more Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the fourth priority is to focus our budgetary resources on a central objective, that of accomplishing the ecological conversion of Europe in terms of its agriculture, its industry, its transport, its energy efficiency, and in many other areas. In dealing with the crisis, the European Union has a duty to move forward.</p>

So we do welcome investment in research and development in the single market and in cross-border infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="en">But there are three points which I have to make. First, the budget must be able to demonstrate real added value. Too many of the traditional spends in past budgets clearly have not, and we must understand that quantity of spend is no substitute for quality. Second, it must be fair: we are open to suggestions on new own resources, but I have to say that a financial transaction tax would not be acceptable, nor indeed would the abolition of rebates. Finally, this House would be mistaken to assume that we could increase the size of the budget at a time when all the rest of Europe is facing austerity, financial disciplines and hard times.</p>

We are therefore dealing with a financial racket that needs to be investigated. That is what we proposed in the Spanish Congress: a committee to investigate the racketeers.</p>

      <p sl="es">We should not be paying the proportion of the sovereign debt that is the result of speculation. The speculators cannot be paid for the deals they have done, and we need to rescue the people of Europe and the European project rather than the racketeering bankers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, paying for growth is not like paying for a product. You might pay your money without receiving what you have paid for. In the present MFF, 44% of the EU budget is being spent on sustainable growth. That will go up to 48%. Is it really being spent effectively? Does the EU really know how to spend Member States’ money better than they do?</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s embracing of globalism and neoliberal economics, of open markets and maximised competition will defeat any strategy for growth. As Sir James Goldsmith said a decade ago, the only way the West would compete with the emergent economies in a free market would be by our wage levels equalling theirs.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is all very well to think our research and development will make our industries more competitive, but innovation spreads by industrial piracy by the Far East and industrial treachery by western-based multinationals. The Commission’s Europe 2020 document waxed lyrical about Europe’s talented workforces, but that presupposed that the present populations of Europe would survive and would not be replaced by immigration.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Wammen, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on the streets of Europe we are divided exactly as we are in this House, the only difference being that on the streets of Europe, those who do not believe in Europe grow in number day by day. However, they are not growing in number because of the good work done by Eurosceptics with their propaganda, but because those who say they believe in Europe are foolish and lacking in knowledge.</p>
      <p sl="it">If the Council meeting of 28 and 29 June shows the same lack of awareness, we will strike a definitive blow to the credibility of all those who are counting on the success of the European project. I believe that the leaders of European institutions and of the Member States are at a crossroads and need to take on an enormous responsibility. In just a few days, we risk dispelling a legacy of peace and development which has defined our history. In time, the consequence of this approach and understanding of our own responsibility will result in conflict between our countries. I believe that we all need to understand that 28 and 29 June are important dates. Our time is running out and I would like each one of us to realise this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though our budget is limited, a year’s budget adds up to a figure that can be wasted by the markets in a single day. The multiannual financial framework (MFF) is very important but only if the Member States do not see the budget as a source of expenditure to be cut like all public expenditure, but rather as a resource which can help the economy to grow – an investment – and not as a cost for citizens but as the way to produce tangible results. The figures represent programmes, projects, things to be achieved. Therefore, I say ‘no’ to short-sighted cuts and ‘no’ to infighting between countries, because growth is an opportunity for all European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, the European budget should not be seen as separate, but as complementary to national budgets. A new approach is needed to strengthen links between the European budget and national budgets. In some ways, our budget is the 28th budget of the Member States. This is the only way we can create the global assets that can develop effective policies. We are asking for a more coordinated approach. The European Semester can also help with this.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, as regards Parliament’s role, I say this to the Council: we will accept neither a fait accompli nor a ‘take it or leave it’ approach. We want a preliminary consultation before the formal proposal is presented for approval. Citizens, worried about the future of Europe, express themselves through us and we, as their representatives, want to play a part in taking decisions.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am deeply concerned that, when it comes to economic governance, we are now having a debate, which, I believe, is fair, on how growth can be created which would make the discipline sustainable and lasting and which would make it possible to have balance sheets that balance and to reduce the debt.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, as far as our attitude to budgets is concerned, it is the least creative and the most blinkered that it is possible to have. It entails considering that any money spent at European level would be a bad thing and should be reduced. Nor is there any interest – as Mr Verhofstadt said – or at least not enough, in having own resources, which would enable the European Union to act. These concerns are shared by all of us.</p>

      <p sl="en">On a professional level, however, it is clear that governments have much less direct leverage on growth. Austerity is a direct result of restrictive fiscal policies, but there is no such thing as a growth policy. Government action can have only a very indirect and stochastic impact on growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">In a market economy, most productive investments are undertaken by the private sector. It is only the private sector which can create sustainable jobs leading to increased output and tax revenues. The government can only facilitate this process by creating a business-friendly environment and investing in physical and human infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Budgets are important tools to support private sector activity. The MFF is considered as such. It can contribute to growth only if it concentrates resources on investments and initiatives to improve competitiveness and productivity. The MFF should envisage more spending on research and development, education and infrastructure, and cut back significantly on current subsidies, including on agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, surely I do not have to point out that, under the EU Treaties, the issue of own resources must be dealt with in the new multiannual financial framework (MFF) for 2014-2020. The revenues from the financial transaction tax, for example, provide the Member States with the possibility of reducing their contributions to the EU budget by an equivalent amount. Doing this would clearly take the heat out of the eternal dispute between net contributors and net beneficiaries. Surely it is also clear that Parliament is defending three basic positions: more leeway in budgetary policy – in other words, flexibility; reform of the own resources system; and a stable budget that enables the EU’s political objectives to be financed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to confirm at the very beginning that the cooperation with the Danish Presidency on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) has developed quite well, and I insist that the good experience in this sort of pilot project will finally lead to real negotiations prior to our getting a proposal on the MFF regulation and on a new interinstitutional agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The resolution we will vote on today includes our key messages towards the meeting of the European Council at the end of June. Our basis for negotiations remains the Garriga report from the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges (SURE). We say very clearly that we need adequate financial resources in the EU budget which are linked to better spending; we insist on the Community method; we say very clearly that we are not ready to agree on expenditure without a proper agreement on future own resources; we insist on the unity of the budget as an iron principle; and, of course, we are asking for sufficient overall flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">Here, despite some positive elements in the negotiation boxes on the unity of the budget – although the details are yet to be negotiated and this must also include the additional means which are outsourced at this stage – we are talking about EUR 24.5 billion – the negotiation box on flexibility is still quite empty, and it has to be filled to come to a good solution. And, of course, we have to follow the rules in the consent procedure and to respect the codecision procedure of the 65 multiannual programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say as well that the position of the President of the Commission is, in some ways, understandable, but, on the other hand, there is a huge risk concerning giving up the Community method and going back to national contributions in special instruments. This is a real danger in the long term and is working against the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say as well that we should not only talk about better spending in the budget. Concerning budget consolidation, it is also important that the Commission stop any proposal for EU legislation which means additional bureaucratic burdens and costs for Member States, for regions and local communities, and the legislator has to do likewise.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Mr President, I hope that the Commission will support Parliament’s position this time more than it did last time, in 2006.</p>

      <p sl="de">How, then, can we put this unity of analysis into action? That is where the European budget comes into play – the common budget that is a budget for investment with no compulsion for consolidation, because it has no debts. A European budget with adequate funds, an innovative structure and the necessary flexibility is quite simply our common instrument for leveraging existing growth potential in Europe, opening up new prospects and maintaining our position in the global competition for talent, technologies and market leadership.

One might partly agree with that, but what is your opinion of those initiatives that do not require more money or bureaucracy? For example, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament had proposed that EUR 10 billion in unspent resources should be released from EU funds to combat youth unemployment, thereby creating almost 2 million jobs for young people, and that would be from unused funds. What do you think of this initiative?</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, of course we have to make a very clear distinction, I was talking about legislative proposals. I stress also that within the package of the 65 multiannual programmes on cohesion and agriculture policy, the Commission did not fulfil the request of its own Secretary-General asking for a reduction in the bureaucratic burden, asking for simplification. If ministers in the agricultural sector are telling me that there is an additional bureaucratic burden of 15 to 20%, we have to correct this. We cannot ask for budget consolidation at Member State level and, at the same time, force them to spend more on bureaucracy because we have decided on complicated EU legislation. This is a very important element, in terms of consolidation and progress and legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as the question of unspent resources is concerned, I would like to refer back to the Policy Challenges Committee. The question of carry-overs of unspent funds and reprogramming to obtain better spending for SMEs and to combat youth unemployment are very useful elements. We support this.</p>

That really would be something to celebrate.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have just heard a few things about the Council and the future of Europe that this Council is to decide on, that are to be debated. Listening to what Mr Bokros has said here, I believe this to be very important. The crucial thing as regards everything that we are debating in relation to the multiannual financial framework, in relation to the budget, is whether the private sector is going to invest again, whether the private sector will regain its confidence in the European economy and its prospects. This is the decisive factor. Public budgets can only provide incentives at best. The Social Democrats sometimes need that explaining to them. You cannot buy growth; you can only enable growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it is crucial that the structural reforms that President Barroso mentioned come about. The second really crucial thing is the debt redemption pact; a clear, effective debt redemption pact linked to clear conditions which will relieve the burden on the budgets in the Member States, which at present, despite all their efforts – in Italy, for example – simply cannot emerge from the constraints of their refinancing. We therefore need a clear and effective debt redemption pact.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Wammen, Commissioner, finally, we have a European Council on growth. I am sorry that in December 2011, when the Heads of State or Government agreed on the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, the President of the European Council did not call a specific Council to look at growth, but we have got there in the end.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that we need to call formally on the 25 states to ratify this Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which sends out a message of confidence and solidarity, in terms of both the markets and the people. I appeal to the political powers in France to honour the signature of the French Republic without delay.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have talked about growth, but I think that we also need to talk about competitiveness. We need to talk about the competitiveness of our continent: yes, we need a major infrastructure plan. We do not need EUR 10 or 20 billion; we need investments of between EUR 1 000 and 1 500 billion. We lack imagination when it comes to own resources. Why not establish compulsory contributions for digital measures, energy networks, roads, railways and water? I am proposing once again that we carry out an audit of public spending and pool military, diplomatic and research spending.</p>

However, Mr President, the President of the European Council himself needs to establish a relationship with our Parliament.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, as a member of the negotiating team for the multiannual financial framework, I, in turn, would like to thank the Danish Presidency for the cooperation it has shown. The result of this cooperation has been the negotiation box, among other instruments, in which the relationship between expenditure and income was retained, in keeping with Parliament’s express demand, and which makes this a precondition for the final solution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is also valuable that the negotiating box will now be included on the Council’s agenda, where growth, but also the European Semester and hence fiscal consolidation at Member State level, will be discussed. Because, thanks to our own resources, the proposal before us allows Member States to reduce their contributions and, therefore, to make more room in their own budgets to contribute, with their own resources, to a growth budget, which is essential for the European budget going forward.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is therefore time that we lay down basic principles that will ensure both growth and budgetary orthodoxy. The budget can make an essential contribution to that. I hope that the meeting of the European Council will also be an opportunity to send out a structural signal to the euro and the euro area.

This does not, however, solve the problem of growth. In order to grow, we need a strong European budget, a debt redemption fund, eurobonds, more involvement from the European Investment Bank and more activity from the European Central Bank.

European economic governance and economic and social union are being promoted as an urgent need. The multiannual financial framework must be a strong and effective instrument in the recovery of the European economy and in creating sustainable growth and jobs, stimulating investments, promoting research and innovation and achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion. We need a link between targets and European funds and to place the EU 2020 strategy within a strong multiannual financial framework.

      <p sl="el">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, it is true that Greece has not made use of available European funds. This is the sad reality for my country. Greece needs an overall fast-forward growth plan. It needs pioneering changes of an institutional, organisational and structural nature. It needs an unwavering and ambitious, realistic and democratic plan for restructuring the country, based on the maximum possible social and political consensus. Above all, Greece needs direction from the political leadership and decisive action, which has been missing from the Greek system of governance. This is the proposal for the elections on 17 June: a strong, European, reform movement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am also among those who hope that the Council, at the end of June, will make a decision on an ambitious and very bold action on growth for Europe. Our duty in Parliament is to see that this new multiannual budget invests in new sources of growth, but also in restarting the EU-wide competitiveness machinery and relaunching convergence forces.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a lot of catching up to do in Europe, because the EU machinery for convergence in the areas of the economy, trade and finance has clearly slowed down. This is dangerous, because divergence can become a force for break-up. Without a doubt, the EU budget must focus strongly on genuine investment policies and competitiveness for all.</p>
      <p sl="en">This leads me to the reformed cohesion policy and its founding tools. We must see that they target the most effective sources of growth. We must ensure that the well established pro-catching up capabilities of cohesion policy work for all of Europe and we must also ensure that this policy-powerful convergence machinery works towards reducing competitiveness gaps between south, north and east.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European economy as a whole and the economies of some Member States are slowing down, which is why we should pay increasing attention to growth, competitiveness and development. At the forthcoming European Council meeting, the Member States must make brave and ambitious choices to tackle the path for development together. In many countries, Europe is now seen as the problem; instead, we must make strong and courageous choices to make it clear that Europe is the solution. Therefore, eurobonds, project bonds, strengthening projects and planning for small and medium-sized enterprises must be the issues covered. We cannot put off the problem any longer. Europe must be, and is, the solution to all the problems caused by the crisis.</p>

We think the problem up to now has been tackling each issue as it arises, individually and in isolation. The time has come for us to have a comprehensive solution for Europe; a solution involving – as Mr Daul made clear, in fact – more integration, more cooperation, European policies that are more in step with one another and a reassessment of the Community method. It is crucial that we have growth alongside stability, but that we do not abandon stability concerns. This will require a comprehensive European solution, not a different response for each Member State or region experiencing problems.</p>

This endless speculation about who is going to be next – they will, they will not – has to stop; it has to stop at the next summit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we need a jobs and growth strategy that can be implemented immediately at the next summit, not some Hy-Brasil at the end of the rainbow. For that we need real leadership, not self-serving, nationalistic interests. The Danish Presidency – whom I compliment – mentioned some of the things that we can do immediately, such as the Energy Directive which, if implemented, would create 400 000 jobs, save energy and help combat climate change. We should also help SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I want to say that I agree completely with President Barroso that we need own resources. I would ask our leaders to show statesmanship in allowing us to have own resources and put an end to this endless speculation about the multiannual financial framework.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, European citizens, including Hungarians, blame the austerity measures that have been going on for years on the EU; it is therefore extremely important to have strong cohesion policy at our disposal in the future, because if citizens were to see results in terms of job creation and investment under the cohesion policy, it would reinforce their trust in the EU. I believe it is a major problem with cohesion policy that my home country could lose one-fifth of the support it receives. Therefore, where ‘capping’ is concerned, it is extremely important to define not only an upper ceiling, but also a minimum level, that is, a limit for the amount of funding a Member State can lose, because in the case of Hungary, we are talking about a 20-30% loss, which would be very difficult for the country to handle.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, for many months now, there has been disagreement over cohesion policy and the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020. The people of Europe are finding this discussion increasingly difficult to understand. It may be that many of the Member States’ Heads of Government are tired by the crisis, but are they so tired that they do not see that the European budget is, in fact, one of the most important instruments for stimulating growth? It is the European budget which makes Member States allocate own resources for investment. Every EUR 1 channelled through Structural Funds means that a further amount of between EUR 2 and EUR 5 has to be invested in the Member States from public and private own resources.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Furthermore, the example of cohesion policy proves that the traditional dispute between net payer countries and those which make greater use of EU funds does not have a raison d’être. Recent research shows clearly that a large proportion of every euro spent on cohesion policy in the EU’s Member States comes back to western Europe in the form of increased consumption, higher exports or greater demand for modern technologies and services. So all attempts to reduce the European Union budget do no more than provide only apparent savings and, as a consequence, contribute to a reduction in the competitiveness of the entire Union. I hope that Parliament and the Commission will not give up their efforts to defend cohesion policy and the size of the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="es">This reminds us, however, that a change of tack is required, which means that political union is not solely limited to banking surveillance, but rather a need to reassess the deficit review schedule, mutualisation of the debt, and a budget with the resources to fund strategic investments that stimulate growth and create jobs.</p>
      <p sl="es">It also means preventing a messy exit from the euro by Greece, which is an issue we must resolve within days rather than weeks. Furthermore, it means changing Europe’s image, which is increasingly identified with the so-called ‘men in black’, who threaten sanctions and use a stick, but no carrot, with no stimulant for growth and no hope for young people.</p>

So be it. Why not? It might even be a good idea.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, if you do not raise the ceilings in proportion to what you have put back into the budget, we can expect a double cut, because the Council today, Minister, is unable to identify its negative priorities. The SURE report asked for them but there has been no response.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as a former Member of this House, I know what it means to speak when voting time is coming. Therefore, I will make only two short points.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, a general one. We are all under the shadow of a crisis, but it should not overshadow the basic truths nor justify some unfounded points I could hear on the margins of this very good debate in Parliament. The European Union, which still holds a 20% share of world trade – with the share of Japan and the United States clearly declining – does not deserve the metaphor of a Titanic.</p>
      <p sl="en">We do face problems. They are not national. Therefore, a national answer is not enough. We should transform the emerging mantra of growth and jobs into reality by a more systemic response to banking and fiscal union, which is emerging, including through today’s votes in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second short point concerns the multiannual framework, which is part of the solution, not part of the problem. I can illustrate this empirically with a credible paper from the UK Treasury indicating where taxpayers’ money is going. The UK middle-income taxpayer contributes GBP 28 to the European Union, which is the same as for the fire service. National debt interest servicing is GBP 363 rather than GBP 28. This is the problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European budget is not the answer to the problem, but could be part of the solution, via investment to act as a carrot via the Structural Funds – nobody denies this and it was also part of the anti-crisis resistance in my country of origin – with the stick of conditionality enforcing structural reforms. This part of the answer concerns own resources. Mr Zahradil was wrong. This is not about expanding the budget but about changing the proposal, fully respecting the fiscal autonomy and the sovereignty of the national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the design for the future: more Europe under the Lisbon Treaty with the same amount of money. I am happy to see Parliament’s resolution going in the same direction. Jutta Haug is right. Einigkeit macht stark.</p>

      <p sl="ga">It is difficult, however, to accept an increase in the contributions of Member States to the EU budget when European countries are being forced to cut their own budgets and to implement stringent measures. It is also implied that cuts to the budget of the common agricultural policy (CAP) are being considered, since it is on the CAP that most of the EU budget is spent. Nevertheless, European leaders should not make significant reductions in the CAP.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The CAP represents value for money for European taxpayers, especially in the following areas: security of food supply, high-quality affordable food that complies with high environmental standards, sustainable management of natural resources and measures to deal with climate change.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We face a major challenge: a growing shortage of water, energy and arable land; and, by 2050, nine billion people to feed. To that end, it would be a mistake to reduce the CAP budget and to weaken the ability of European farmers to produce and compete.</p>

With investor confidence in the market in decline and the new Member States queuing up for financial assistance, there are still doubts over the need for such solutions as a debt redemption fund or eurobonds. I congratulate the Commission on the proposals put forward on a banking union and its determination to seek a balance between budgetary discipline and long-term growth and job creation. However, the essential commitment – combating fraud in the Member States – is missing. The situation that has come about is unjustifiable because the Commission does not know the true scale of corruption as the Member States are not providing the necessary data. The fight against fraud must be strengthened and the Commission must take responsibility for the illegal use of funds and their return to the EU budget. While discussing economic recovery, we must not forget that we need to protect our markets from too much third-country influence. Economic operators in third countries take advantage of the openness of the EU market while our economic operators in those countries operate under much more difficult conditions than local operators. We have thus reduced our competitiveness and narrowed the labour and business market for our own citizens. I believe that combating fraud and market protection must become one of the foundations of future cornerstone initiatives and strategies, which would help ensure a more stable and speedy economic recovery in the long term.</p>

These young people will truly believe that we are making this our duty and that the EU budget is not a budget for Brussels when they find a job for which they are qualified and which will allow them to have a start in life.

The financial instruments within the new MFF can also support further cofinancing from private and public investors. I very much welcome the orientation of the new MFF towards growth, development and a sustainable environment. The creation of new, green jobs is important as well. I also welcome the retention of the European funds, especially the Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, which contribute not only to the strategic and long-term development of Member States, but also short-term, rapid and targeted support addressing the consequences of the crisis.

      <p sl="en">As one country goes bust, calling to be rescued by the others, more and more economies are dragged deeper into the mire as they add repercussive economic impacts and bailouts onto the burden of national deficits. The Commission’s programme for more money to be sent to the centre, bound by tighter regulation, with the impetus of closer economic union, forces cash flow to be circulated around the eurozone pulling Member States into a maelstrom of economic destitution and political control. It is the concept of more Europe that has exacerbated, if not created, the entire crisis. If the EU’s reactions have been, as both President Barroso and Prime Minister Rajoy of Spain proclaimed, successful, then the crisis would surely be over. Yet the EU’s actions have been successful in forcing the European project along at a pace by furthering state capitalism. In the USSR, highly centralised government and economic policy inflicted poverty on millions of voiceless citizens. The echoes are chillingly familiar.

The financial transaction tax (FTT) and VAT reform should help to increase the European budget, reduce the contributions from the Member States and give Europe budgetary sovereignty. The guidelines laid down by the former SURE Committee must be followed, particularly the increase of at least 5% and the creation of regions in transition for the Structural Funds.

One the one hand, they want to go further with everything that has been leading to divergence between the Member States: free competition in the internal market, the now-reinforced Stability and Growth Pact, the liberalisation of international trade and common policies created to suit only the few. On the other, they want to weaken instruments that could mitigate or even, ideally, overcome inequalities; the EU budget plays a key role in this. There can only be one outcome: more divergence, more inequality between Member States and less cohesion. What is happening in the Council is a disgrace. The greatest beneficiaries of the internal market and common policies now want to reduce even further their contributions to the EU budget by forcing the compression of the next multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. They want to cut the budget and cut cohesion funding. They also want to seek a greater share of this cohesion funding. That is what results from conditionality proposals, from ‘transition regions’ and from changing the weighting coefficients associated with cohesion. For the others – the weaker economies – the damage from this integration is ever greater while its benefits are ever fewer.</p>

I am pleased to note that today’s statements by the Council and the Commission already showed moderation, because with such a tense mood, it is questionable whether the European summit can be successful. Still, I respectfully ask the members of the European Council to carefully review the efforts made so far, and to only commit themselves to a higher level of integration if it involves openness and preparedness throughout Europe, and especially if, while securing the long-term functionality of the European banking system, it serves the actual interests of at least 500 million citizens.</p>

Moreover, the EU budget should be a strong investment budget.

It should also guarantee fairness in distributing the resources and sustainability. Therefore, it is important to ensure that Cohesion Policy continues to receive adequate funding. Moreover, I am also worried by this new tendency within the European Commission to reduce funding for citizenship programmes. The decrease in funding also concerns gender-related issues, which is a very negative development in the light of the need to combat discrimination and promote equal opportunities policies.

Today, the European Council must not be allowed to share the same fate; the 12 yellow stars should shine with the light of excellence and progress. We need an EU budget that is able to stand on its own feet and is supportive of growth; a budget in which ITER (the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) and GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) are financed from outside the seven-year financial framework. However, if the Council decides otherwise, then it should also allocate the proper financial conditions, and should not once again draw away the necessary funds from R&amp;D lines. I believe that to entrust the Council with the supervision of the disbursement of funds is like setting the fox to watch the geese. Indeed, the decision taken last week by the Council of Ministers demonstrated that the ministers for finance are capable of cutting down the amount of research disbursements for the ongoing year with a single, parochial decision taken by a close circle, even without the knowledge of the ministers for development.

      <p sl="ro">Negotiating the forthcoming multiannual financial framework is a complex, delicate process, which will lay the foundations for the EU’s political and economic activities for the next seven years. Seven years which we hope will be seven years of growth and economic recovery. This is why we need an investment budget which is as substantial as possible and offers solidarity to all Member States. Regional policy, the common agricultural policy, research policy, Erasmus, support for SMEs – these policies have nowadays become the basic pillars of the European economy and are actually the real driving forces of the single market. However, in order to implement them, we need a budget to tackle the following challenges: globalisation, climate and demographic change and the transformation of the economy into one based on new technologies. Negotiation is the art of compromise. However, when it comes to the next financial framework, Parliament has set itself a number of minimum criteria which we will not budge from: • Maintaining the budget at least at the 2013 level • A higher quota of own resources • Parliament must be acknowledged as a genuine negotiating partner. We are all aware that we need this budget, and I firmly believe that we will ultimately find a happy medium.</p>

      <p sl="lv">The EU budget makes up only a relatively small portion – just 2% – of all public spending in the EU. Therefore, it must facilitate the achievement of the common EU policy goals. It will not be possible to achieve them without adequate financing from a stable European budget. That is why I support the requirement – which is also set out in the European Treaty – to ensure adequate revenue obtained from resources that are truly Europe’s own. Before we approve the multiannual financial framework, we must achieve a political agreement on a reform of the own-resources system that would ensure its transparency, fairness and sustainability. Furthermore, in determining expenditure under the European multiannual financial framework, we must strictly adhere to the principles of solidarity, balanced territorial development and fair competition. This particularly applies to the common agricultural policy, where subsidies that distort fair competition are most obvious.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The challenges currently facing Europe mean we need a guarantee of efficient, effective and reliable instruments which will enable us to meet these challenges. Hard times require difficult but emphatic decisions – we cannot continue to be torn between our ambitions and the need to make savings. I would like to stress that the EU budget should be a budget for investment. The right level of investment, based, in particular, on cohesion policy, will allow us to overcome the crisis and ensure that Europe enjoys growth, competitiveness and an accompanying high level of employment. I am certain that a strategic, transparent and sustainable budget will allow us to achieve these goals. By basing the EU budget to a large extent on own resources, in particular on a financial transaction tax, and by moving away from rebates and correction mechanisms, we will be able gradually to reduce the burden on national budgets while also making the EU budget fairer and more transparent.</p>

      <p sl="pl">A European Council summit is to be held in June, and the main item of business will once again be the crisis in the euro area. Putting the economic situation back on its feet requires measures which are effective in macro-economic terms but which are also acceptable politically. The many aspects of the financial crisis and the lack of a firm political response at the outset mean that there is not now an easy and painless way out of this difficult situation. The euro area is still in need of urgent reforms. Some of them have already been carried out – the ‘six-pack’ should be mentioned here, as well as the ‘two-pack’, on which work is currently in progress. However, these pieces of legislation are only an answer to some of the institutional problems involved, and their effect will only be seen in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Meanwhile, the way the financial crisis is continuing to get worse requires action which will have an immediate effect, because the crisis of confidence and pressure from the market are today seriously impairing the Member States’ ability to refinance their debt. The forthcoming summit is an excellent opportunity to make bold decisions. First and foremost, measures should be adopted which do not require treaty changes, that is, steps to make the process of fiscal adaptation more flexible and to improve the firewall to give greater protection to the financial systems of peripheral states. The next stage should be institutional reform of the euro area, by which I mean creation of a common system of recapitalisation and restructuring for banks and a common system for protecting deposits, and development of a plan for at least the partial mutualisation of public debt.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The financial framework for drafting the EU’s annual budgets for 2014 to 2020 represents one of the biggest political battles between the Council and Parliament this year. It is good that Parliament should insist on greater flexibility, clarity and transparency, especially in the forthcoming budget, and adopt a position on own resources, as they are known – on reforming the system in such a way that funds would be amassed directly in the EU’s own budget and, at the same time, the contributions from the Member States could be reduced accordingly. A reformed budget is needed as part of a more integrated monetary policy. A more integrated monetary policy is not at all as novel an idea as one might sometimes think, reading the headlines. When the notion of a European monetary and economic union was only in its infancy, a work group led by the British economist, Donald McDougall, was set up to consider the structures involved in a single currency. The McDougall report, as it is referred to, states that, in general, areas using a common currency guarantee the value of their currency by means of a central or federal budget, which is largely funded by taxes collected by a central administrative body. The report says that, depending on the level of integration, the joint budget should account for between 2.5% and 7% of the Union’s combined GDP. The Union’s present budget accounts for not much more than 1%. The US federal budget, for example, amounts to a good 20% of GDP. Although, for Member States struggling with financial difficulties, calls for an increase in the joint budget understandably sound virtually impossible, we should insist on an open and creative attitude on the part of the governments of countries towards the joint EU budget. It takes adequate resources to implement uniform policies. A commitment to common objectives means that one is also prepared to commit the resources needed to realise them.</p>

      <p sl="el">We understand the budgetary restrictions on the Member States and reiterate that the EU’s long-term budget is a strategic instrument for investment, for stimulating growth and competitiveness and, of course, for creating jobs throughout Europe. As far as cohesion policy is concerned, the message is clear. That policy is the only pan-European development policy and, as such, should continue to be available to all regions of Europe. Cohesion policy is the main means for responding to the crisis, as it makes a decisive contribution to growth and to job creation. Cohesion policy is worthy of and entitled to adequate resources. The Commission proposal is NOT the minimum for us as regards cohesion policy. If we want to achieve growth, as cohesion policy is a development policy, if we want to find effective answers to the crisis, THEN we need the resources to achieve it. For cohesion policy, the minimum is the current financing level, as clearly decided in the SURE report. We do not support an increase in the cohesion policy budget; if we maintain current budget levels and use modern, thematic targeting and are guided by the results of cohesion policy, we shall achieve a great deal more.</p>

      <p sl="hu">For the first time, we are about to draft a financial framework in such a way that is not a matter of free agreement but a constitutional obligation. Our choices have become narrower; we can say either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the framework. Thanks to the work of the Hungarian, Polish and Danish Presidencies, we are continuously in touch with the Council so as to prevent a ‘no’ by Parliament from turning over a hard-fought consensus, seeing as how there are some red lines that cannot be crossed according to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="hu">One such red line is the matter of cohesion policy. Since developmental disparities between the regions of the EU are stronger than ever, Parliament demands efficient and effective cohesion. EU funds spent on cohesion policy must not be reduced; we must maintain at least the level of 2007-2013. This is a difficult task, as the European Commission’s proposal is already envisaging an almost 5% cutback in the total framework, with Member States only being allowed to draw funding to the amount of 2.5% of their GDP. What is more, the basis for calculating the 2.5% ceiling is not future economic growth but the period between 2008-2010, where Hungary suffered serious economic downturn under its socialist governments.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2014-2020 is increasing by EUR 49 billion compared with the MFF 2007-2013. This means it will total EUR 1.025 trillion, with cohesion policy accounting for the largest share, exceeding the common agricultural policy for the first time. The European Parliament and the Committee of the Regions accept some aspects, such as the intermediate regions, the increased allocation for territorial cooperation projects, the creation of the Common Strategic Framework, and continued Cohesion Fund support for countries with a GNI less than 90% of the EU’s GNI. It is important to stress that the June European Council is the first time that the MFF 2014-2020 and the new cohesion policy regulations will be discussed. I consider it essential that cohesion policy levels be kept at the same level as for the last programming period – 2007-2013 – and that the outermost regions have enough funding from the additional specific allocation to tackle their natural constraints.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Council taking place on 28-29 June will deal with economic policy issues, the multiannual financial framework, as well as with the governance of the Schengen system and asylum. In defining and implementing its policies and actions, the EU must take into account the requirements in terms of promoting a high level of employment, guaranteeing adequate social protection, combating social exclusion, as well as the requirements for a high level of education, vocational training and health protection. I think that the EU needs a common agenda on economic growth and job creation, with a particular focus on youth employment. We call on Heads of State or Government to set out and adopt this agenda. In this context, the multiannual financial framework is an effective tool which helps achieve economic growth in the EU. With regard to the governance of the Schengen system, we call for the codecision process to be used and for Parliament to be involved in all the decisions relating to the free movement of persons, one of the EU’s greatest achievements. We are also in favour of Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area, given that both the Commission and Parliament have acknowledged on several occasions that both states meet the necessary technical criteria.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for rising from your seats in honour of the President of the Republic of Peru, President Humala, whom it gives me great pleasure to welcome to the European Parliament.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Mr President, the European Union’s relations with Latin America are particularly important to us. The European Union and this Parliament have traditionally had close transatlantic ties with the United States of America and with Canada, but transatlantic relations also include relations with the Latin American part of the American continent. It is clear to us all that cooperation with the countries of Latin America is becoming increasingly important for the European Union. Peru is a country which, under your Presidency, is putting particular efforts into the idea of regional integration. As President of Peru, you made it clear from the time you took office that you see cross-border cooperation with the states and peoples of Latin America as the way of the future. That is exactly the same idea as that on which the European Union is based: overcoming what separates us and seeking to bring about cooperation between states and peoples in common institutions in order to make economic, ecological and social progress. That is what you have just embarked on, including through your Pacific cooperation. I would therefore like to give you a warm welcome to an institution that shares precisely this spirit of regional cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">President Humala, you and your country are in the closing phase of important negotiations on a tree trade agreement with the European Union, which will have to be ratified in this Parliament. We have made progress and we all hope that this agreement will be able to be concluded to the satisfaction of both sides – that means also to the satisfaction of the Members that you see here.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Finally, Mr President, I am delighted that a man who is standing up for democracy and the rule of law in his country is a guest of a Chamber that is greatly concerned with defending the individual basic rights of all people, wherever they are in the world. Consequently, the European Parliament constantly keeps a very close watch on the human rights situation in all countries. We hope that, in this common spirit of peaceful cooperation between regions of the world, we will be able to build on and expand relations between the European Union and its individual states and Latin America and its individual states – in this case, Peru.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would now like to give you the floor, Mr President. Welcome to the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to express my satisfaction at being here, in the European Parliament, the manifestation of the melting pot of different communities and cultures that make up Europe, a Europe with which Peru has strong ties.</p>
      <p sl="es">Peru, a multilingual and multicultural country with age-old history, has been involved in intercultural dialogue with European traditions since the 16th century. I would like to highlight the efforts of distinguished Europeans to Peruvian causes and issues, such as the learned Italian Antonio Raimondi, the French admiral Petit-Thouars, the German scientist Alexander von Humboldt, and the German researcher Maria Reiche. They are just some of the European names who have supported Peru and the solid bond between our country and the European continent, an undertaking that has lasted through the years and which we value in its current scope.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union is currently Peru’s second most important trading partner, being the main destination for our exports and one with significant investments in Peru.</p>
      <p sl="es">During this century, marked by the increasing globalisation of resources, goods and services, as well as the breathtaking rate of development of new technologies, Peru and the European Union share the common objective and challenge of moving forward down the path of cooperation by acknowledging individual values, identities and projects, whilst sharing the same ideals.</p>
      <p sl="es">Peru is a representative democracy in which macro-economic policies, along with the stable legal framework, have translated into sustainable economic growth and quite a notable social outcome as regards the reduction of poverty, the reduction of inequality, the increase in employment rates, and general compliance with the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our gross domestic product tripled during the last decade, with growth for this year projected at close to 6%, and our aim is to maintain this same level of growth for the next five years, despite the difficult international climate. Different studies have led to the same conclusion: that this trend will continue in the coming years, which will lead to Peru becoming one of the leading regional economies.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this context, my government has set social inclusion as a priority objective, which will come with economic growth; the profits Peru has been reporting, its favourable climate for business, trade openness and investment, will extend to the entire Peruvian society and the poorest sectors of our country in particular.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to include the most disadvantaged populations in the economic loop of creating wealth and worthwhile employment through the modernisation and diversification of our manufacturing, promoting local innovation and using advanced knowledge, supporting our people in education and providing them with the tools to be more competitive.</p>
      <p sl="es">My government proposes to consolidate democracy so that it is able to resolve the problems and needs of the entire Peruvian society, but with a particular focus on the minorities that have been left out or forgotten by the state.</p>
      <p sl="es">Let us be clear: there cannot be development, a democracy or an economy that causes inequality, poverty and exclusion. The big transformation that my government has pledged to bring about is based on the process of social inclusion, which was our main commitment to the Peruvian people. That is, to transform economic growth into development and well-being, to transform wealth into quality of life.</p>
      <p sl="es">Peru is a country with a population of just over 29 million people. Poverty rates have been reduced from 54% in 2001 to 27% in 2012. My government aims to lift over 3 million Peruvians out of poverty by 2016, that is, to reduce the poverty rate to below 20%, and reduce the extreme poverty rate, which currently stands at around 7% in Peru, by as much as possible. My government is committed to a proactive public policy on social investment and development to achieve this. Despite having achieved the Millennium Development Goals, we therefore continue to make the greatest efforts to continue reducing the differences in equality.</p>
      <p sl="es">As such, the budget allocated to social and human capital in 2012 has been increased by 20% compared to 2011. Social inclusion means that a human being can become a citizen and we have created the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion for this undertaking. Through this, we aim to transform social programmes through a single social inclusion policy for our government, where we will clearly establish a set of multi-sector programmes with a view to improving efficiency and focusing attention on the most needy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Within this framework, a set of social programmes have been developed that cover early childhood (Programa Cuna Más), through to young people (Programa Beca 18), up to the retirement age (Programa Pensión 65), and the conditional transfer programme for the most vulnerable families (Programa Juntos) and the mobile emergency medical service (SAMU, Sistema de Atención Móvil de Urgencias) have been extended.</p>
      <p sl="es">Cuna Más is an early childhood programme which is already being implemented. This year, it will attend to over 90 000 children up to the age of three in the poorest regions of the country, supplying them with food and nursery services, education and comprehensive health care.</p>
      <p sl="es">Programa Beca 18 will provide higher education to qualified young people with fewer resources. It is aimed at skills training and the appropriate assimilation of science and technology that needs to be transferred to diversify our manufacturing model. The objective for our first year of government is to reach 5 000 interns and provide 3 000 grants for masters and doctorate courses abroad.</p>
      <p sl="es">Programa Pensión 65 provides an economic subsidy to adults over 65 years of age who are in poverty or extreme poverty.</p>
      <p sl="es">As part of this programme, my government has approved the first list of beneficiaries, comprising 126 787 adults in more than 14 regions throughout the country.</p>
      <p sl="es">This year, my government plans to spend over USD 790 million on social programmes run through the ministry. Other programmes include the Cooperation Fund for Social Development (Fondo de Cooperación para el Desarrollo Social), which promotes the development of local manufacturing, and the Qali Warma food programme (‘child with energy’ in Quechua), the main objective of which is to ensure that food is provided to children in public primary education centres from the age of three years old.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is essential to increase the efficiency and coverage of Programa Juntos given that it is a programme that directly delivers monetary incentives to households in poverty or extreme poverty, on the condition that the mothers representing the household fulfil the commitment of ensuring that their younger children attend health care and education centres. We have extended this programme from 350 000 to 450 000 families this year.</p>
      <p sl="es">Within this framework, the Peruvian State is making efforts to ensure that all sectors of society benefit from the trade agreement with the European Union. The agreement is a significant opportunity for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in both the European Union and Peru. In Peru, these types of companies represent 98% of the total number of companies; they employ 75% of the working population, and generate 42% of national GDP.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition to economic growth with social inclusion, a second aspect I would like to highlight is the sustainable development of our natural resources and the promotion of responsible mining.</p>
      <p sl="es">My government’s main interest is to promote a responsible policy for the use of our natural resources, particularly water resources, which aims to resolve the just concerns and demands expressed by the population in different ways, due to the fears generated by the operation of certain mining projects. We have been working on building a new relationship between the state and the mining sector. This new relationship will mean the involvement of communities and towns in the areas affected by the mines, and will allow us to manage the legitimate uncertainties and doubts that an area’s population may have in a clear and inclusive manner. We will use dialogue as the main tool for resolving conflicts, as well as strengthen our environmental and sustainable development policy, for which we have created the Ministry of the Environment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Latin America in general, and Peru in particular, has specific challenges to ensure social and environmental sustainability through its development model. Some of the most important challenges include: changing manufacturing and consumption patterns; promoting agribusiness and a rural economy that adapts to climate change; integrated management of natural and water resources; a land use regulation policy that ensures security and the integrity of indigenous villages and communities in harmony with national protected areas; and the promotion and development of clean technologies that fit the needs of each of the many ecosystems we have. My country has ratified the main international agreements on the environment. Given that the country is extremely diverse and highly vulnerable to climate change, policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change, to conserve and use the Amazon rainforest sustainably, and to protect biodiversity are deemed to be high priority.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, as well as a being a full member of the Convention on Biological Diversity, and having ratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, we have endorsed the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources, which is currently undergoing legislative approval, and we have recently approved a law that has set a 10-year moratorium on the introduction and production of modified living organisms, destined for cultivation and breeding, based on the precautionary principle of the protection of human, animal and vegetal health and the environment. Peru, however, has been particularly affected by indecision on, and breaches of, the 1992 Rio Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="es">Industry in Peru, including mining, currently operates under a legal framework that protects the environment and includes indigenous communities in decision making by means of a prior consultation mechanism. The law for this was unanimously approved by the Congress, and I know we are the first country in the world to establish a prior consultation law for communities.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">Accordingly, the drafting of this regulation, which has already been passed, involved the participation of organised civil society and the indigenous communities in particular. As such, the indigenous populations will take part in the evaluation of the measures that may affect them. They will be able to express their concerns and their voice will be taken into consideration. This aims to implement improved practices that combine prior consultation with the promotion of private investment.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, we have adopted specific measures for a greater state share in income generated from the extraction of our mineral resources. A new levy on mining was approved in September 2011 after constructive dialogue with mining companies. Those additional resources will be used for infrastructure works in the poorest areas of the country that do not receive benefits from the mining levy. To strengthen the social inclusion policy, the government will promote the creation of social inclusion funds as part of mining or oil investment projects, which will serve to develop education, health, sanitation, drinking water, public services, electricity and agricultural infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="es">We will continue to call on private enterprise, alongside the state, to develop human resources in the regions and generate employment for all Peruvians. The development of a major mining project can take at least four years, which is enough time for the aforementioned companies to set up specialised technical training centres in the project’s area of influence. We also consider it to be necessary for mining companies to allocate an insurance fund that would be used should environmental damage occur. We need to strengthen the corporate social responsibility of all the mining and extraction companies that come to my country.</p>
      <p sl="es">Respect and protection of human rights will be a cornerstone of the Peruvian State’s policy, not only internally, but also in foreign policy. Peru has signed up to, and strictly complies with, the eight main international human rights treaties. My country is currently a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council for the 2011-2014 period. We are committed to building a culture of peace, not only to ensure that acts of terrorist violence are not repeated, but also to initiate a process to establish trust and peace in the country, as well as the consolidation of democracy. Thanks to the support from the European Union, and from countries such as Germany and Sweden, as well as the United Nations Development Programme, and the resources allocated by my government, we hope to complete the construction of the ‘Memorial’ museum (Lugar de la Memoria) by the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, Peru has ratified 67 International Labour Organisation (ILO) agreements on employment. My country is strongly committed to promoting opportunities for worthwhile jobs under conditions of freedom, security and equality, as well as improving social security, strengthening dialogue and driving guarantees for workers’ rights and the freedom of association. There is fluid and constant interaction between the state, the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association and the ILO Conference Committee on the Application of Standards. I would also like to highlight the fact that the country has different national mechanisms to ensure the implementation, monitoring and inclusive dialogue on such issues, such as the National Human Rights Commission, the National Labour Council and the recently established Economic and Social Council. With this support, in our first year, we have managed to increase the minimum wage, a commitment we made during the electoral campaign.</p>
      <p sl="es">The trade agreement with the European Union clearly reflects that commitment in this sense given that it contains disciplines developed under a sustainable development and trade approach, which reaffirm the ILO’s main agreements. I wish to emphasise that my government is firmly committed to working in a concerted manner with the democratically elected local authorities and civil society institutions.</p>
      <p sl="es">My government is firmly committed to that objective and has declared that it will tackle head on issues that affect security, such as narco terrorism and drug trafficking. Peru allocated around USD 100 million of its own resources to combating this phenomenon in 2011. Peru has reduced the growth rate of coca leaf plantations by 2.2%, which, in recent years, had reached an average annual rate of 5%. Peru has also put alternative sustainable development programmes in place that have already benefited 84 000 families, at a cost of over USD 100 million a year.</p>
      <p sl="es">Peru is constantly involved in the fight against drugs and we have to work in unison with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentleman, Peru is a country that respects its commitments and maintains a legal stability that breeds confidence. The agreement concluded between Peru and the European Union, which is about to be signed, is an essential alliance of multiple and reciprocal benefits that will help to promote development with social inclusion, looking to the future of this century.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is an appropriate moment to express my appreciation and gratitude to the European Parliament for adopting the report on defining a new cooperation policy with Latin America. With the support of 640 MEPs, Parliament has acknowledged the need for coordinated cooperation that takes account of each country’s situation and is also based on the most extensive indicators measuring income levels. In the case of Peru, this will contribute to the efforts my government has been making.</p>
      <p sl="es">To close, I would like to inform you that this multilateral agreement process began in the Andean Community of Nations several years ago. Due to several problems, it has been reduced down to two countries: Colombia and Peru. Today, there is a window of opportunity. Latin America is undergoing very significant economic growth, but not everything is perfect. We have our own issues, and one of our weaknesses is that we are countries that export raw materials. We citizens of Latin America need to break down this barrier, to stop being raw material-exporting countries, and to embark on the route you started decades ago: industrialisation, and the fields of science and technology. For that reason, it is important for us that this agreement ensures technology transfer and fair and reciprocal trade to Peru; that both parties gain from this agreement, not in terms of economic lobbies, but that our citizens benefit; that this agreement is a significant step towards the integration of America with Europe. It needs to be understood that America is not only the United States. America is Peru, Chile, Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, Mexico and many other countries, and that America is currently in good shape and an investment opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="es">We empathise with the serious crisis that the European Union is currently experiencing. We can say today that we hope that the dark cloud that is blighting European skies does not reach Latin America. We are blowing from our country to prevent the cloud from reaching us, but we have already prepared for it. We are ready to tackle this crisis and that is important; that is, with this multilateral agreement, we also provide, we bring something to the table, and we wish to work in a transparent, open, and cooperative manner for our mutual benefit, so that both parties benefit. It is a two-way street, rather than a one-way street. That is important to me and that is why I have come here today, because I, Ollanta Humala, have always been critical about free trade agreements. Today, however, having been president for ten months, I have to respect state policies and we have to do well. That is why I firmly believe that signing this agreement will be in our collective interests.</p>
      <p sl="es">I firmly believe that we may progress faster if we go it alone, but that we will progress further if we work together.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has proposed a review of the scheme of generalised tariff preferences that the Union has granted to goods entering the European market from developing countries since 1971. Although the new criteria put in place in order to benefit from the preferences will reduce the number of beneficiaries by about half, I believe that this system continues to represent a real opportunity for these countries to increase their international trade, generating revenue which can be used to increase income and implement policies for sustainable development and the eradication of poverty.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are happy with the arrangement reached in trialogue negotiations for the new scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP), due to both the complexity of the regulation and its political worth and the differences which have characterised the debate. In the current climate, European small and medium-sized enterprises that share industrial sensitivities, particularly in the areas of textiles, tanning and agriculture, must be given the chance to compete in international markets through careful evaluation of the different kinds of preferential treatment given to our main partners by the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">We cannot allow countries that have shown they have a competitive economy, like Brazil, Russia and Argentina, to receive help entering the European market by means of reduced tariffs at the expense of our manufacturing sector, which, for years, has been suffering the consequences of the financial crisis and protectionist choices on the exports and contracts of these third countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are therefore in favour of greater monitoring of differentiation, thus avoiding showing favouritism to countries with offensive interests in strategic European sectors, and we welcome strengthening of the safeguard clause to also cover textile products. We would also like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate that the number of countries benefiting from this scheme is notably reduced. It is right and proper to offer support through favourable trade policies only to those states that truly find themselves in difficulty, concentrating it where our intervention could be of the greatest benefit.</p>
      <p sl="it">According to current calculations, Pakistan should be one of these new beneficiaries. This is a country with a highly developed textile sector, partly thanks to economic and social rules which heavily penalise our businesses. I come from Prato, a city that was one of the main textile districts in Europe and which, in recent years, has seriously suffered from unfair competition from Asia. I am therefore opposed to this agreement including Pakistan, just as I was opposed to cutting import duties for this country because of the 2010 floods. Aid for trade must be targeted, but it absolutely cannot cause the decline of entire manufacturing sectors in Europe, which could occur with the recent invasion of textile products from Pakistan.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I voted in favour of this proposed update to the scheme of generalised tariff preferences. This is a key instrument being used to help developing countries participate in international trade. Trade is vital for growth. Without income from exports, developing countries cannot put into place either the physical or democratic infrastructure which is necessary for sustainable democratic growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">If resources are not available through trade, this funding is only available through aid. Trade, not aid, is the right way forward. Of course, this report is not perfect, but I support the general message from Parliament that trade preferences with developing countries should be maintained and developed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I, too, voted in favour of this report on generalised tariff preferences as a means of promoting economic growth through trade in developing countries. I strongly believe that, since it came into force in 1971, it has had an overall positive impact.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is extremely encouraging that the least developed countries are able to participate in international trade in this way and are thus able to support their own poverty reduction schemes and their own sustainable development projects through the additional export revenue that this generates and by easier access to EU markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, it is also important that we also reasonably defend EU industries, at the same time as providing benefits to third countries. So we must remember to create the right balance in this regard with a level playing field. Politically, I generally support the idea that trade preferences rather than aid handouts are an extremely useful tool for promoting economic development and growth in those less developed countries outside the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">We have now had a bailout of EUR 100 billion and Spanish ten-year bonds were at their highest level since the single currency was launched, so the only impact of this bailout has been to burden every Spanish household with a further EUR 15 000 debt that they did not have last week. Where does the money come from? It has come from the other members of the eurozone, including Cyprus and Italy and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe is giving itself a transfusion; it is taking blood from one arm and pumping it into the other arm, but the tube is leaking. The liquid is coming out en route.

I am pleased that the European Union is giving so much aid to developing countries, and that is greatly to our credit. One of the ways we do this is through trading.</p>
      <p sl="ga">And with regard to trading, I think the changes here are desirable. Certain countries are coming off the list, I think about 80 out of 120 are remaining on it, and certainly some of those countries should have been taken off the list before now, particularly at a time of economic crisis – and Mr Hannan referred to the difficulties in many countries at the moment – when we have to think of our own SMEs, our own companies.

The GSP is one of the main tools which help the EU achieve its foreign and development policy objectives. We must therefore ensure that the latest reform enables it to retain and fulfil even better the specified role. With this in mind, I support the rapporteur’s position on preserving the structure of the proposal tabled by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I agree, in principle, to reducing the number of countries eligible for generalised tariff preferences. However, I think that a special clause is needed for states which have signed a free trade agreement. I also support the mandatory review of the regulation after 10 years. This is a suitable period of time to allow an effective evaluation of the system’s operation.</p>

      <p sl="en">However, I want to make a wider point about tariff reduction and trade agreements relevant to all of us. Here, we see preferential access to the EU single market being given to nations which are not members of the EU but which get reduced – or even zero – tariff walls from the EU customs union. Yet they do not have to sign up to financial contributions to the EU or to a whole body of law, the acquis, and can trade pretty freely. It goes to show how far we have travelled from the 1970s world of high tariffs and menacing trade walls and how much has been achieved by the WTO and GATT in reducing barriers to trade around the world. We can all benefit from much looser trading relations and lower tariff walls.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, one of the biggest myths about trade and international trade is that countries trade with each other.</p>
      <p sl="en">Countries do not trade with each other. It is people and businesses who trade with people and businesses in another country for mutual benefit. What can governments do? They can either get in the way or they can facilitate that trade. The best way of facilitating that trade is by simply getting out of the way. But what do governments and what do institutions such as the EU do? They get in the way with tariff barriers and non-tariff barriers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Surely the best way to help people in less developed countries is to remove all these trade barriers and to make sure that entrepreneurs in those countries can create wealth. Otherwise, if we stop them creating wealth in their own countries, they lose hope and they seek to leave those home countries and they emigrate to our countries, and then we complain about immigration.</p>

The rules that are being proposed here should have been passed at least 15 years ago for there to be any point to them. It is clear that they are no longer of any use today. It is too late for Greece and Cyprus, it is too late for Portugal, it is too late for Spain, and it is probably too late for Italy. It is no use continuing to gloss over the issue: the euro has failed. That is not just my opinion, but apparently it is also the opinion of Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, who gives the euro no more than three months at most. What good is this resolution today going to do? I had no hesitation in voting against this resolution, quite simply because it comes too late, it is wrong and it can no longer mask the failure of the euro project.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this legislative proposal gives rise to confusion because it would give the Commission greater powers of control over the fiscal policy of euro area countries, but with no greater democratic control in return. Greater powers mean states have less sovereignty and this is all very well, but not if control is not transferred to Parliament. The democratic deficit will increase if Parliament does not have a stronger role.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second reason for confusion is the budget cuts and the rigid austerity policy imposed by the executive, with no investment proposals designed to create growth and development except for the amendments which luckily were passed in this Chamber. We have established that up to now, the policy has been disastrous: tax increases, reduced consumption, increased unemployment, collapse of businesses, young people out of work, and so on. It would be irrational and harmful to continue in this direction. Consider the Delors White Paper of 1993: 19 years have passed since then and we are worse off than before.</p>

With the vote on Mr Gauzès’s report, we, as Parliament, have said that we cannot accept increasingly strict surveillance without balancing out these powers in the direction of democratic participation. Parliament must be involved.

      <p sl="it">Today, we have spoken in favour of growth and, at the same time, in favour of recovery. There is a contradiction when we say that we do not want to adopt a report like Mr Gauzès’s, on which I abstained for reasons I will explain, and then at the same time we call for a consolidated European budget and fiscal union. We need fiscal union, we need to monitor the budgets of Member States and, at the same time, encourage growth with the amendments we have presented and voted for in Ms Ferreira’s report.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore believe that we have done something important. We have done it even though Mr Gauzès’s report contains an article – Article 10 – which sends a negative message to the markets, as it concerns controlled default procedures, which we should not even talk about at the moment because we have to show the European public that we want to move forward with the euro and with greater integration.</p>

In any case, we believe that at a time of serious crisis such as that which the European Union is facing, Parliament should take on an even more courageous role than it has so far, and we believe that development, employment and the labour market go hand in hand with a mechanism for surveillance of the budgetary policy of each Member State, because discipline is extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European debt redemption fund could prove to be a useful tool, as could the annual coordinated public debt issuance framework.

I believe that the rules of engagement are important not just for the recipient of the assistance, but also for the party giving the assistance. Naturally, we also have to be in a position to check up on the conditions and the rules of engagement decided on.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think it is also equally important that we establish what actually happens if, for whatever reason, the rules that we previously set are not adhered to.

I welcome it against the backdrop of the financial crisis and sovereign debt facing the states in the euro area. The Stability and Growth Pact needs to be strengthened further to safeguard financial stability and economic growth within the euro area. I should stress the importance of protecting Member States from the potential adverse impact of serious financial upheaval. Combining the ‘six-pack’ with the two new reports is intended to achieve precisely this result.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, when you look at the make-up of the eurozone, what we have is an economic project that was actually doomed to failure from the start – a bankruptcy machine, as some have called it. You have 17 countries, one currency, one set of interest rates, but 17 different spending decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you look at the lessons from successful currency unions, what keeps them together? You have fiscal transfers from the richer parts of the currency union to the poorer parts of the currency union. Therefore, we have a choice. We can keep the eurozone together in its current form, but then you have to have the transfers from the richer countries, Germany and the Netherlands, to the poorer countries. But what will the voters in those countries say? They will ask why they should pay for the less disciplined countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other choice is to allow those countries that cannot economically viably stay in the eurozone to leave in an orderly fashion. The eurozone then does not break up altogether and you have a smaller, more viable eurozone. Failing to choose either course could lead to a disorderly break-up. Actually, it is a course that could be avoided if politicians were to act responsibly.</p>

Mr Kamall of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group is absolutely right when he says that this euro currency was doomed to failure from the start, simply because economies with vastly differing trade balances – think, for example, of Germany, Austria and Greece – were bundled together in a currency area. No country has ever been destroyed by devaluations or revaluations. There are, however, countries in economic history that have been destroyed by their debts coupled with a trade deficit. That is the problem that this report by Ms Ferreira is not in a position to resolve.</p>
      <p sl="de">We simply have to recognise what Paul Krugman said two days ago, when he commented in an American newspaper that the political élites of Europe are always ready to take action to protect the banks, but are not willing to adopt a policy that protects their citizens and puts the economy back at the service of people.

      <p sl="it">Through the votes cast in this Chamber on Ms Ferreira’s report, in particular, on the amendments with which we have started to pave the way for the redemption fund, project bonds and the separate consideration of investments, Parliament has reaffirmed the same concept, simply in the reverse order.

In other words, if we want strengthened governance and budgetary surveillance, we must also introduce forms of issuance which are tied to public debt and the risk must be shared.</p>

I find it extremely regrettable that this review mission for eurobonds and the debt redemption fund was more or less deleted from the report. It seems to me that a lack of knowledge is being covered up with actionism, and actionism can lead directly to disaster.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns honesty. Naturally we need a programme for growth – nobody is objecting to that; but we should deal with this honestly. If people write that they want to invest 1% of gross domestic product every year in a growth programme – in other words, that we would yet again have to pay something alongside the European budget – then they are quite simply not being honest with our citizens.

We see the EU asking for more money from taxpayers, asking for it to spend more taxpayers’ money that they do not have, hoping that it will solve problems when all it will do is increase the mountain of debt. It is time we learnt the lessons.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I abstained from the vote on the resolution on EU trade negotiations with Japan just now, not because we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe do not want to see the agreement in question, but because we believe that the resolution adopted will actually help delay the process.</p>
      <p sl="da">For us in the ALDE Group, there is no doubt that the way out of the crisis is growth and trade, free trade, and now is therefore the time that the EU must get started with the negotiations with Japan on a trade agreement.</p>
      <p sl="da">Today, Parliament voted on a joint resolution proposed by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. We believe that this resolution, in the form in which it has ended up, will delay the start of these negotiations, which is to the benefit of neither the EU nor Japan.</p>
      <p sl="da">Rather than discussing interinstitutional disputes, we Liberals would like to get the negotiations under way with Japan about this trade agreement based on the mantra that growth is something that you trade, rather than buy, your way to. A free trade agreement with the world’s third largest economy has an enormous potential, and I hope that all parties understand that, so that we can get started on negotiating a trade agreement right away.</p>

I think this motion for a resolution clearly underlines once again the fact that trade must naturally be of benefit to both sides. Quite simply, it is also a matter of both sides making a few concessions. As far as I am concerned, this requirement is met in the motion, and I therefore voted in favour and I now also hope that the negotiations will be conducted successfully so that a so-called free trade agreement is not solely detrimental to the European Union.

The scoping exercise which was carried out relating to the potential for EU-Japan free trade agreements has identified many key areas on both sides. Both sides are now prepared to start discussions and this has shown clearly that Japan is ready to commence negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, Japan has already delivered on a number of non-tariff barriers by eliminating them. So, given the fact that Japan has already embarked on negotiations with ASEAN and the USA in these matters, any further delays by the European Union now would mean running the risk of being seriously left behind once negotiations actually start. EU FTAs with countries as far apart as Mexico and South Korea have been a great economic success story, so I hope that the European Union can now conclude FTA deals with India and Japan, which are the two great democracies of Asia.</p>

I think the first thing we have got to do is to congratulate the people of Japan on their resilience and the manner in which they have bounced back after the earthquake and the tsunami of March 2011. As a highly developed economy and as a major global trader and investor, Japan is an important partner for the EU. Japan is the world’s third largest national economy, accounting for around 1.3% of the world’s population and around 9% of the world’s GDP.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is important – and I stressed this when we discussed negotiations on trade relations with China – that Japan remove regulatory barriers to trade as a precondition for launching further negotiations on the EU-Japan trade agreement. I agree with the previous speakers, I agree with Mr Jahr, I agree also with the other two speakers, that what we need to do is to get down to business immediately.</p>

I think its people’s sense of industry, enterprise and willingness to face calamities – as my colleague Mr Higgins mentioned in regard to the earthquake and tsunami last year – are most admirable. Of course, as the world’s third largest national economy, it is important that we trade with them. They are our sixth largest trading partner. We are their third largest trading partner. So obviously the closer the ties are, the better.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the last ten years, there have been four important agreements with Japan. This needs to be developed into a full FTA. There are issues regarding IPR, public procurement and maybe investment that need to be looked at, but Japan has shown a willingness to deal with all these issues.

The car industry is among those hardest hit.</p>

      <p sl="en">All we do by adopting the stance that we have adopted in delaying the start of negotiations is create bad will, or not enough goodwill, between us, and we have to make sure that we do not use that option too often, because Japan has other areas to negotiate with.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ever since Guinea-Bissau gained independence in the 1970s, the county’s political situation has been marked by permanent instability, chaos and constant conflict between the civil authorities and the military. This has resulted in a profound crisis which has affected the whole country and caused high levels of poverty among its citizens. A further cause for concern is April’s military coup, which was carried out on what was practically the day before the presidential election and made conduct of the election impossible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to condemn this shameful incident, and I would like to ask the European institutions to use diplomatic means to stabilise the situation in Guinea-Bissau and restore the civilian administration. Only democratically elected representatives of government can expect international recognition and support for the process of building a healthy state from the bottom up.

      <p sl="pl">Guinea-Bissau is a country which is, unfortunately, a very important link in a certain chain – a chain used by drugs cartels to send drugs to Europe. If only for this reason, it is a country which must attract the particular interest of the European Union, although it should also attract our interest because – as I have often stressed in my speeches, and this is something we probably too often forget – for many people throughout the world, the European Union is a symbol of freedom and democracy. We must be – and people in very different countries expect this of us – an international organisation and a Union which sets standards in democracy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The military coup we witnessed recently in Guinea-Bissau, which brought a halt to the presidential election, is a sad consequence of all that has happened since Guinea-Bissau achieved home rule and became independent from Portugal.

Therefore, I think it is important for the European Union to take action to mitigate a situation which today has reached a critical state.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the negotiation and conclusion of the EU free trade agreement with Colombia and Peru has rightly caused great opposition from trade unionists and from civil society organisations in both Europe and in Latin America. The human rights and workers’ rights situation, particularly in Colombia, remains extremely alarming, despite the claim from President Santos that his government represents a major departure from the vicious anti-worker and anti-indigenous peoples government of President Uribe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colombia still remains one of the most dangerous places in the world for a trade unionist to be active: 55 human rights defenders were killed or disappeared in 2011 alone, an increase of 40% compared with 2010.

This is, in large measure, due to the very effective Presidency of President Uribe, whose leadership brought peace and the opportunity for development to a great many Colombians. I think that our free trade agreement with Colombia opens the way to opportunities for still faster growth of the country, faster reduction of poverty and also – something which should be stressed here, because we must not close our eyes to Colombia’s problems – an effective fight against what is still the greatest problem in Colombia today, the country’s huge production of drugs. If opportunities for trade with the European Union allow many of the people of Colombia’s villages and rural areas to change from producing drugs to some other activity – something we will enable them to do by opening European markets – this will also contribute to fighting effectively against the terrible evil of drug production in Colombia.</p>

We are also asking to be able to participate in the election procedure and to have responsibility for monitoring the representative’s conduct through hearings before the competent committee. The Special Representative for Human Rights should have to provide an annual report on their activity to the Council, the Commission and Parliament.

All the above factors result in unnecessary loss of life and the suffering of millions of people throughout the world. In view of the fact that practically every country in the world is involved in the arms trade, and because the value of this trade is steadily rising in spite of the crisis, it is essential to regulate this area at global level. I therefore support the very important call in the resolution for the speedy negotiation, and urgent adoption and entry into force, of a comprehensive UN treaty on this matter.

On the other hand, however, we are aware that a large part of the arms trade today also supplies a variety of dictatorships and terrorist organisations – organisations which are nothing more than criminal groups.

The presidential and parliamentary elections held in November last year, despite the assistance of the European Union and the involvement of a large number of observers, have given rise to numerous doubts both among the people of Congo and in international opinion. It is also disturbing to hear of violations of human rights, particularly those which have taken place with the involvement of members of the Congolese army. While I do accept the results of the recent elections, I would like to draw attention to the need for continued commitment to the process of establishing a fully democratic political system in Congo. I appeal to the Republic’s current authorities to give attention to the recommendations for reform of the electoral mechanism referred to in the final report of the European Union’s Election Observation Mission, reforms which are being demanded by the opposition. All the irregularities revealed during the course of the elections should be unequivocally condemned. I would also like to call the attention of the Congolese authorities to the urgent need to bring an end to the violence among the civilian population, and to guarantee security and the rule of law. I voted to adopt the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the European Union provided a fairly large sum – over EUR 50 million in total – to finance the monitoring and conduct of the elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Today, unfortunately, while we do accept the results of the elections, we are not able – unfortunately we are not able – to verify that the results are genuine. This is a fundamental problem when it comes to what is, in many ways, a very important country from our point of view. However, there are other problems which are, in fact, more important. I refer to the mass rapes being committed in the Republic of Congo, which we are told are being committed – and this is reliable information – with the involvement of the Congolese army. So it would appear that this resolution was a necessary one. I think the resolution was also hoped for by very many people in Congo, who would like the country to move in a democratic direction – the direction it deserves, and as indeed is deserved quite simply by every country in the world.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I voted for this resolution because Congo has not emerged completely from the spiral of violence and instability which has been affecting it for so long. Clashes continue in the eastern part of the country between the rebel groups and armed forces. The security situation has deteriorated again, causing the civilian population to be displaced. As I have confirmed in other similar cases too, under these circumstances, the priorities must be to stop the acts of violence and deliver emergency humanitarian aid. In order to achieve this, full compliance with the arms embargo is vital.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Democratic progress must also be encouraged in Congo, along with the process of stabilisation. In this regard, the recommendations made by the EU Election Observation Mission must be implemented in full so as to avoid a recurrence of irregularities at future elections.</p>

I believe that this could represent a first step in the right direction. Since controls of the new instruments aimed at combating the credit crisis were performed, in part, by national control institutions, sometimes through the European Court of Auditors, and since it is the responsibility of the European Parliament to represent democratic scrutiny on behalf of the public in this process, it seems self-evident to hear all viewpoints that outline the major challenges Europe must face in connection with the aforementioned stability mechanisms at a common discussion.

Although it is officially part of the so-called Middle East Quartet, alongside the US, the UN and Russia, we do not even have a place at the negotiating table, let alone being allowed to speak. This insignificance does not seem to bother Brussels any longer, because Europe has long enjoyed playing the role of paymaster. It seems that the principle of ‘he who pays the piper calls the tune’ does not apply to the EU, which is always ‘concerned’ or ‘shocked’ at the risks to peace that arise or at existing injustices. Rather than imagining ourselves to be a giant in external policy in the context of the Treaty of Lisbon, it would have been better at the outset to clarify issues surrounding appropriate representation of the European Union at the United Nations, including the speaking rights of its main representatives or the tabling of motions. After all, the European Union is not a country, and the people of Europe do not want it to become one. Since the EU does not deal with these basic problems, I abstained from voting on this report.</p>

It concerns various issues, but the most significant is that regarding EU-UN relations. The intention is to step up further the EU’s role in the UN, both through increased representation in its specialised institutions and agencies, and through the development of stronger public diplomacy. It also focuses on issues relating to maintaining and consolidating global peace and human rights. As regards the former, the intention is to promote the role of ‘mediation’ and strengthen the international criminal justice system. With respect to human rights, it provides for greater efforts at international level to ensure that all the human rights accorded under the UN conventions are considered universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated. Finally, it aims for greater integration of EU development policies at all levels, always taking into account protecting human rights and environmental protection.

It is also important for there to be continued support for action on the rights of the child, free media, religious tolerance and to eradicate torture, including adoption of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on Torture. The Union should emphasise its commitment to the work of the UN Human Rights Council by co-sponsoring statements and declarations. The appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights will raise the Union’s status in the international arena in the field of human rights.

However, in this area, it is particularly important to draw attention to the fact that the new legislative proposal is intended to focus on the import preferences of the developing countries in greatest need.

Several important changes to the scheme should be adopted, with the aim of concentrating import preferences on those developing countries most in need. I agree that preferences should be withdrawn for countries which have an alternative preferential arrangement and countries which are classified by the World Bank as high-income countries. I also believe that the GSP scheme should not apply to certain products if they become too competitive on the EU market. As for poorer countries, I agree that preferences for these should be increased and product coverage extended.

The European Union has granted non-reciprocal trade preferences in the form of reduced tariffs for goods from developing countries when entering the European market through the GSP scheme since 1971. It is part of its common commercial policy. The aim of this key trade instrument is to enable developing countries to participate more fully in international trade and thereby generate additional export revenue to support income growth and the implementation of their own sustainable development and poverty reduction policy strategies. The latest scheme dates back to 2008 and is now due for review. While maintaining this general structure, the new legislative proposal introduces several changes to the import scheme from developing countries, with the aim of concentrating import preferences on those developing countries most in need.

      <p sl="ro">The EU’s scheme of generalised tariff preferences was introduced in the 1970s, with the aim of the preferences granted being for the common trade policy to complement the development cooperation policy for the benefit of the developing countries, providing a system of preferential tariffs granted unilaterally by the EU to products originating from these states. The generalised scheme of tariff preferences (GSP) is based on three fundamental rules: the preferences are general, non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory. This means that the EU offers low customs duties or duty exemptions to 178 countries and territories, granting special benefits to the least well developed 50 countries and to states which implement the labour and environmental protection standards. The GSP system may have a longer-term impact inasmuch as it makes the countries eligible for preferences more attractive as locations for inward processing, encouraging foreign direct investors who would like to export to the EU market in the future. In general, trade experts have found it difficult to identify another positive impact from the trade preferences on GSP exports, apart from the transfer of the revenue which comes with the duty-free import of goods.</p>

While, for many countries, GSP beneficiary status has been bypassed through free trade agreements with the EU, in other cases, being a GSP beneficiary was clearly an outdated legacy no longer in line with the goals of the system.</p>
      <p sl="it">The sensitive issue of the so-called GSP+ countries remains, but this can be dealt with in the light of our experience of this reform, just as there will be ongoing changes to the enforcement of the provisions of the delegated acts, including during the five-year review. Likewise, it is desirable for all possible care to be taken in regional monitoring of the implications of the possible inclusion of parties to free trade agreements and countries with GSP status. I am sure that any shortcomings will be quickly identified, partly thanks to careful monitoring of thresholds and the competition posed by imports. Overall, this instrument has come out leaner and more transparent than before, and is certainly in step with economies undergoing relatively rapid change.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The generalised scheme of preferences (GSP) should, first and foremost, be a tool for development and, in that context, I consider it right that the new GSP regime submitted by the Commission no longer covers high-income or upper middle-income countries. It therefore excludes most Latin American countries and countries such as Algeria, South Africa, Gabon, Namibia and most of the Caribbean islands. Meanwhile, economies as powerful as those of India, China, Indonesia and Thailand would continue to be eligible for the GSP, albeit temporarily. Accordingly, it seems unfair to make GDP per capita the sole eligibility criterion for the GSP, thereby penalising small countries despite the high levels of poverty they may face. The Commission should therefore, in my view, give serious consideration to using a combination of more indicators and criteria. The Commission should also, in my opinion, clearly identify the parties authorised to provide further information on monitoring mechanisms, introduce a transparent system of benchmarks, carry out a clear human rights impact assessment, adapting EU trade policies to protect those rights, and take greater account of the specific role of EU delegations.</p>

      <p sl="da">In order for these countries to benefit from what they grow or produce, this access is necessary. The slimming down to the 80 poorest countries has many positive aspects, as it bolsters the economies and competitiveness of those countries.

      <p sl="da">The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament managed to have a longer transitional period instituted for those countries leaving the scheme. We attempted to obtain a majority in favour of a somewhat more flexible scheme that would take greater account of the inequality in the countries (the Gini coefficient) and other development criteria (the human development index) when deciding which countries to include in the scheme.</p>
      <p sl="da">The agreement represents the best possible compromise, and it is important that negotiations on the agreement have been completed. When it comes to countries that are no longer covered by the scheme, negotiations are to be carried out directly between the EU and these countries. It is, furthermore, a positive thing that the scheme is flexible, so that countries can join if their poverty conditions deteriorate.</p>

However, the global economy has changed a great deal in the past 40 years. Some emerging countries that previously benefited from the GSP, such as Brazil, China and Russia, no longer face the same problems in terms of participating in trade.

The review reduces from 176 to 75 the number of countries that can benefit from preferential access to EU markets.

      <p sl="pt">In 1968, the United Nations conference on trade and development recommended the creation of a generalised system of preferences (GSP) under which countries considered more developed would support developing countries by granting trade preferences. The European Community was the first to implement a GSP scheme in 1971 and it has proved to be one of the key means of cooperation on poverty reduction relating to international trade. Around 176 countries have benefited from the GSP, but there is a need to revise it by introducing new rules, new conditions and more incentives. This report by Mr Fjellner concerns the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council for applying a new scheme of generalised tariff preferences. I voted for this proposal because, without jeopardising the EU’s economic interests, it supports developing countries that defend EU values by incentivising their exports. Although its scope as regards products covered has now been increased, the new programme (GSP+) includes tougher requirements, such as the 27 relating to respect for human rights and environmental protection.</p>

      <p sl="pt">For decades, the EU has been guaranteeing developing countries the chance to export products to the EU without reciprocity. This was not motivated solely by development but also by self-interest, since it stabilised the prices of essential goods, particularly agricultural products and so-called ‘commodities’, in general. Developments have been taking place and distinctions made within this system, seeking to benefit the less developed countries more. However, all this has been jeopardised by submission to the rules of the World Trade Organisation, one of the institutional pillars of international level neoliberalism, and by the emergence of free trade as a means of colonising the economies of developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The new regulation now being proposed will see the EU move from a wider ranging system of trade preferences between industrialised countries or blocs to a more restrictive one. Many countries will be excluded from the non-reciprocal preferences system, which is not unconnected to unacceptable pressure and blackmail to force acceptance of free trade agreements, as is happening with Ecuador. On the other hand, in the interests of the EU powers, benefits are being expanded for some countries, which could have a negative impact on countries like Portugal, where sensitive sectors, such as textiles or clothing, carry significant weight. We voted against.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The European Union has granted trade preferences to developing countries through the generalised system of preferences (GSP) since 1971. This system is one of the key EU trade instruments assisting developing countries in their efforts to ensure core human and labour rights, reduce poverty and promote sustainable development and good governance in developing countries. Thanks to increased trade, many developing countries and export sectors have successfully integrated within the global marketplace. In order to ensure a better safeguarding of the EU’s financial and economic interests and to enhance legal certainty, stability and predictability, the administrative procedures for safeguard mechanisms are being improved. The new regulation is premised on enhanced transparency and predictability, including applicable procedures and rights of defence. I am confident that it will better safeguard the EU’s financial and economic interests and will enhance legal certainty and stability. It is important to bear in mind that preferential access to the EU market is one of several enablers that sustain development through trade. What the new GSP Regulation seeks to achieve is greater simplicity, predictability and better targeting of the EU GSP scheme so as to maximise its effectiveness; all of the proposed modalities are also in line with the United Nations’ priorities for combating global poverty.</p>

This text succeeds on two key issues that are particularly important for Social Democrats: ensuring that the large emerging countries no longer benefit from preferential access to the EU market and facilitating exports from the poorest countries. I am therefore pleased that this new trade regime will, in the long run, enable us to provide better support to developing countries as part of our fight for fair trade, as it officially excludes the emerging countries almost entirely from this scheme.

      <p sl="fr">The scheme of generalised tariff preferences offers preferential duties, notably customs duties, for developing countries. This system, set up in 1971, is a necessary mechanism in an increasingly competitive global economic and trade environment. While Europe is in the midst of an incredibly dramatic crisis, some developing countries have been experiencing significant growth and become very competitive. That is why we need to update the scheme by focusing on the least developed countries and tightening up the eligibility criteria, e.g. compliance with 27 international conventions on human, labour and environmental rights. It is now up to the Commission to apply this tool and ensure a fair balance, in line with the realities on the ground, rather than focusing solely on a mechanical application of the criteria laid down in the different regimes (GSP, GSP+, Everything But Arms).</p>

New rules approved by the Lisbon Treaty under the ordinary legislative procedure should reduce the number of beneficiaries from 186 countries to 80. The so-called more advanced developed countries, which are currently the biggest beneficiaries, accounting for around 40% of preferential imports into the EU, will be removed.

      <p sl="de">As far back as 1964, there were loud calls from some developing countries for trade preferences to improve their economic situation. In 1968, after an agreement was reached, a generalised system of preferences (GSP) was introduced. The European Economic Community introduced the GSP in 1971 and other nations like the United States followed suit. The temporary granting of trade preferences sought to achieve the following goals: an increase in developing countries’ export revenues through diversification of the exported products, promotion of industrialisation and an acceleration of economic growth in the developing countries. Furthermore, the GSP was intended to ensure that the products favoured originated in developing countries. To date, the GSP represents one of the most important EU instruments in the area of trade and it is monitored by the European Commission. However, I am unable to vote in favour of the report because the amendments proposed do not seem to be fully thought out.</p>

All that remained was to adapt it to the global economic situation: some countries that were classified as less advanced have become very competitive in recent years. The new GSP criteria mean that they will no longer be able to benefit from preferential tariffs, while the least developed countries will be able to profit more from them. That is why I voted for the amendments at this part-session. I also welcome the improvements to the follow-up and monitoring of the GSP+, under which the additional tariff preferences are now subject to 27 basic conventions on human, labour and environmental rights. This is an issue that I raised in my November 2011 report: trade can be a means of promoting the EU’s essential values if, and only if, the EU has the ability to ensure that they are respected.

This is long overdue and, as the rapporteur observes, it is the first time that the European Parliament has used the power conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon to legislate on the generalised scheme of tariff preferences. Lithuania’s textile industry, which employs 25 000 people, continues to rank among the cheapest manufacturers in the EU. The changes proposed in the report would help the Lithuanian textile industry to increase its competitiveness. Lithuanian textile manufacturers play an important role in our economy – they export more than 80% of their production. Nevertheless, in recent years, they have not exploited their full potential. The tradition of high-quality industrial production in Lithuania is linked to strategic transport and logistics infrastructure and this means that the Lithuanian sector could do better. I very much agree with my colleague from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that we need to update the tariff scheme so that it reflects the latest changes in the global economy, for example, by withdrawing preferences for EU imports from countries on the World Bank’s per capita income list (including Brazil, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar).</p>

In order for action to be taken swiftly, it should be the Commission’s responsibility to take the necessary decisions, including placing a Member State under the enhanced surveillance procedure. The Council should be able to repeal such a decision by a simple majority vote within 10 days. I also agree with the proposal to create a system of legal protection applicable to a Member State which is at risk of being, in the near future, in a persistent state of default. The Commission should have the possibility, after consulting the Council, of deciding to place the Member State under a legal protection arrangement which would entail, in particular, the suspension of ‘close-out netting’ or ‘credit event’ provisions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Thus far, all responses to the eurozone crisis have only deeper entrenched afflicted Member States in the mire, spread the credit issues virally by inter-relating economies and co-managing bailouts and exacerbated the lack of manoeuvrability held by any one country to steer out of economic turmoil. I strongly opposed the ‘six-pack’ controls brought forward by the Commission and also vehemently reject the latest ‘two-pack’ response which seeks to strengthen EU control of Member State finances via intrusive surveillance. The ongoing economic problems are enabling the European project of federal integration to be forced along at a pace and are being exploited, if not extenuated, to this end. Whilst I agree that growth should be the focus to enable single currency members to climb out of fiscal crisis, I do not believe this can be done with the euro intact and believe the aim now should be to relinquish the single currency, dismantle the eurozone and release Member States to forge necessary and nation-specific courses of action to redevelop trade and industry and tackle unemployment.</p>

The instruments for growth are: forms of debt mutualisation which could take their lead, for example, from the European redemption fund proposed by the German Council of Economic Experts in November 2011; bonds issued by the EU financial institutions, for investment in infrastructure subject to a golden rule excluding them from deficit calculations; the creation of a European system of bank deposit insurance, avoiding ‘runs’ on euro area banks.

      <p sl="hu">As the Member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) responsible for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the report, I believe that the protracted economic and financial crisis has resulted in some Member States finding themselves in extremely difficult situations. In order to combat the imbalances that have developed, the European Union intends to introduce reinforced economic and budgetary control for these Member States, which will be able to ensure that the Member States concerned can solve their economic and budgetary problems. However, we must not forget that the new, stricter control procedures to be introduced could easily entail side effects that could put the economies, societies and labour markets of the Member States concerned in an impossible situation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The application of the new procedures must always be subject to comprehensive consideration of the economic and social problems caused by the crisis. We must prevent existing problems from escalating even further and leading to even greater budgetary problems or causing a slowdown in the growth of the Member States affected and, by extension, the entire EU. The motions for amendments which I submitted in relation to the report, as well as my votes in Committee and plenary, were based on this consideration. After all, we cannot focus solely on the budgetary situations of countries; we must also take into account labour market and social implications, and must bear in mind all fundamental EU documents and all objectives of the EU, including the need to implement the targets for employment rates and for the fight against poverty set out in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Withdrawing funding from countries in difficult budgetary positions could result in the retention of the discrepancies between core and peripheral countries, and such a decision could impact the growth outlook of the entire EU. Any unfounded suspensions and sanctions are contrary to the fundamental values of the European Union and, in particular, the idea of solidarity. Member States should by no means be punished for macro-economic imbalances with withdrawals of funding, and sanctions should only be applied if the European Commission has ascertained through thorough case-by-case investigations that the Member State in question failed to fulfil its obligations. In the absence of a careful and comprehensive examination of the problems, the withdrawal of any amount of Community funding is unacceptable, as it punishes those Member State beneficiaries that hold the key to economic recovery and growing employment.</p>

Some EU Member States have not managed to emerge from the crisis by these means alone and have had to request financial help from the European institutions to obtain the support of certain bodies, such as the European Financial Stability Facility, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. The crisis is an ‘octopus’, whose tentacles threaten to reach a number of European countries. After Ireland, Greece and Portugal, it went on to Spain and is now hovering over Italy. Measures urgently need to be created to check its advance, since we know that the consequences of one Member State’s indebtedness can have an impact on another, and even globally, because the corrective measures are slow acting. I voted for this report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability in the euro area, which sets out new procedures, such as enhanced powers for the Commission and the qualified majority rule.</p>

The serious economic and social consequences which are currently being experienced by many countries could have been avoided in the past by the adoption of effective measures. However, at that time, the European Union did not have the necessary instruments. This situation must be put right with a combination of six pieces of legislation from 2011 – the package on European economic governance – as well as two new pieces of legislation, the so-called ‘two-pack’. We need to strengthen the original legislation. I believe that preventive action is, in any case, preferable to taking corrective measures. A Member State with significant financial problems should be subject to enhanced surveillance, even if such problems are still only a threat. Surveillance must be commensurate to difficulties already encountered or impending and should take due account of the financial assistance received. We should ensure a smooth return to a normal situation for a country that is experiencing or threatened with severe financial disturbance. The consequences of excessive national debt can be frightening. I firmly believe it is important to be able to prevent a Member State with financial difficulties from transferring its problems to the rest of the euro area.

The Stability Pact itself highlights the need to create incentives for prudent budgets, obviously avoiding excessive public deficits and strengthening surveillance. This surveillance allows us to identify risks as well as possible and take responsibility promptly. As the Commission has said, the EU must take shared responsibility, which I think also involves risk sharing. That is the only way we will be able to ensure coordinated and well monitored budgets.</p>

A uniform timetable must be developed for all budget planning which is harmonised with the European Semester. The fiscal pact, the ‘six-pack’ and the ‘two-pack’ belong directly together. They cannot be subject to variations in mood or opinion polls. The defamation of the necessary path of austerity, which was reached by consensus, and the glorification of a growth path is pure polemic. Only when budgets have been cleaned up and reforms implemented can we invest effectively for the medium and long term.

This crisis that continues to afflict the whole of Europe requires the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States to safeguard the stability of Europe and, principally, the euro area. Approval of these rules strengthens the EU’s power of intervention, enabling it to intervene where necessary and making available to it adequate means for doing so.</p>

      <p sl="de">What has already been said regarding the Ferreira report also applies in this case. New rules to limit debts in the euro area countries will achieve just as much as the old ones; in other words, nothing. Moreover, one cannot pass regulations telling a sovereign state how much debt it can have at any particular time. Of, course, it must also be liable for this debt – something that has been suspended since the euro crisis. These rules are designed solely as a basis for joint and several liability in the euro area and, consequently, they are to be rejected in their entirety. Nor is it the task of the EU or of other northern EU states to pass various measures associated with the ‘surveillance’ of budgets that could result in or have already resulted in civil war-like conditions in the southern Member States. We have to deal with the root causes of the problem, which means dissolving the euro in its present form and/or restricting it to the more stable countries. All the other countries could then reintroduce their original currencies and then decide on and implement those measures that, although they will undoubtedly be hard, offer the country in question a chance of recovery. The euro provides no possibility of recovery for the deficit countries. It is merely prolonging the agony and dragging healthy states down into the abyss with them.</p>

The package of six legislative acts needs to be strengthened to ensure, simultaneously, financial stability and economic growth in the euro area. As such, the intention is for euro area Member States to be the subject of enhanced supervision when affected – or threatened – by severe financial disturbances, and for a legal protection scheme to be created to apply to any Member State at risk of being, in the near future, in an enduring state of default or suspension of payments. Excessive national debt can have dramatic consequences, both within the countries concerned and for the other Member States of the European Union.

It should be the Commission’s responsibility to take the necessary decisions, but the Council could repeal them by a simple majority vote within 10 days.

From now on, Member States in the euro area that do not abide by their commitment to limit debt to 60% of GDP and adopt reasonably balanced budgets will be subject to greater surveillance and a public accounts consolidation programme.

      <p sl="pl">The current economic crisis, which has had a huge effect not just on the EU, but also on the entire world economy, has been a major factor in slowing economic growth. The European Union is currently trying to tackle the difficult economic situation. However, the effects of these efforts vary depending on the Member State concerned. The biggest struggle with the crisis is so far being experienced by the peripheral countries of the EU, or what are known as the PIGS countries – Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain – as well as Ireland and also Cyprus, which is more and more often being mentioned in this connection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The ever greater budget deficits and the growth in bond yields of particular Member States (Greek bonds have now reached a level of nearly 30%), as well as the problems facing the banks, have prompted these countries to ask the European institutions for financial assistance. These requests have made the authorities in Brussels decide to introduce greater economic and budgetary supervision of Member States which need financial assistance to help them fight the crisis. The ‘two-pack’, or legislation tightening the Commission’s supervision of national budgets, will mean the European Commission will have very great powers in setting these budgets.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, the placing of ever greater powers in the hands of a single body may, in the long term, prove to be a very dangerous trend.

When, way back in 1988-1989, European leaders took the brave decision to begin convergence of the Member State economies with a view to the single currency, both by completing the internal market and by coordinating the Member States’ economies, it was made very clear, from a pro-EU point of view, that this objective could only be fully achieved by twinning the pillar of monetary governance, under an autonomous European Central Bank, with the pillar of economic governance exercised by Commission, Council and Parliament. Only the two pillars together could underpin the future of the European Union. However, this sharing of responsibilities has to be combined with the sharing of opportunities and economic results. Just as, at the national level, varying rates of regional economic growth are balanced out by single-state governance, including by joint participation in the public debt, the same should happen at European level in relations between Member States, which should evolve, making shared, cooperative and reciprocal destinies a reality.

With the redemption fund, initially proposed by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the States will transfer any debt amounts over 60% of GDP. These pooled sums, totalling EUR 2 300 billion, will be repaid over 25 years, allowing for the creation of eurobonds, which we have desired for many months.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament has proposed establishing a growth instrument to mobilise 1% of Member States’ GDP over a period of 10 years, that is to say, around EUR 100 billion, to be invested in European infrastructure. Although some people talk about financial stability and fiscal consolidation and others talk about growth, we really need both. The Member States are massively in debt and the European Union therefore needs to invest in order to become competitive once again. It should go further, for example, by calling for European savings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We ensured that these tools were effective by reintroducing the Community method. As with the ‘six-pack’, economic dialogue with the European Parliament has been established. That restores democratic legitimacy to the decisions which, for a long time, were taken between governments.</p>

      <p sl="hu">As the Member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) responsible for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the report, I find it important to point out that the European Commission is expecting Member States to take steps which, if not taken with due caution, could lead to a downturn in economic growth and employment in these countries. We are living in difficult times, but we must not forget about such common goals as Europe 2020 or the EU employment and job creation strategy. Both the Commission and the Council treat employment and growth as priorities, since they are the key to enabling Europe to recover from the crisis while implementing strict fiscal measures. The responsibility to find a solution for managing the employment-related and social tensions caused by the crisis also lies with us here in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Harmonisation and stricter control of the budgetary policies of euro area countries is essential to ensuring the long-term viability of the monetary union. However, as I already stressed in my opinion, it is also vital for Member States to be able to retain their budgetary sovereignty, which is one of the most important tools for Member State economic governance. It is exceptionally important for euro area accession to remain a clear goal for all Member States not using the euro, but the stricter budgetary control and coordination should apply to them only after their accession to the euro area. As regards the practice of budgetary monitoring, it must be emphasised that non-euro area countries, too, should be involved in the procedure. It is crucial that the reports be discussed at fora where all 27 Member States are represented; the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would be a suitable choice for this role.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is welcome that some Member States, including Hungary, have already incorporated a sovereign debt ceiling in their constitutions; the Hungarian Constitution states the following: ‘Parliament shall not adopt a State Budget Act that would result in sovereign debt exceeding half of GDP’.</p>

The Member States’ concern for fiscal discipline and correcting excessive deficits has been leading to reduced consumption and, as a result, to many companies going out of business, to the loss of tax revenues, to increased unemployment and, necessarily, to an upsurge in the numbers of newly poor. I voted for this report because, amongst its suggestions, enhanced supervision to monitor and assess the Member States’ plans to prevent excessive debt levels and contagion – because prevention is better than cure, not least because of the sluggish effects of the measures adopted – sits alongside the need to change the direction of the agenda, until now geared towards austerity, towards economic growth and job creation. The creation of eurobonds, the advocating of an ambitious investment plan in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, and the strengthening of the Community method will stimulate smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, so I welcome them.</p>

In this context, the proposals concerning stability bonds – following the pattern already proposed by the Commission and even taking the same name – and the redemption fund are more for propaganda purposes than proposals with any practical effect, or at least none that is not going even further with the Commission’s original proposal on obligations to be met by the Member States regarding their budgetary processes. In other words, the intention is to bring the Member States even further under control, in such a way as to lead to the establishment of relationships of dominance with a veritably colonial air.</p>

I voted in favour of the amendment on the golden rule, which would exclude investments from deficit calculations, and I regret that it was not carried. The way things are now, it is time to take urgent action: no more blind austerity; we have seen that it cannot work by itself.

The proposal contains many important tools for ensuring budgetary discipline among the Member States of the euro area, the importance of which has been highlighted, in particular, by the developments of recent years. During the process, proposals concerning common borrowing and an EU fund for investments corresponding to a percentage of GDP have been put forward, which will only lead to a further build-up of debt. We voted against these particular parts. The proposal from the Commission, on the other hand, concerns tools and frameworks on which it is important to take a decision, particularly given the current situation. We therefore voted in favour of the remaining parts of the proposal.

The Treaty allows the adoption of specific measures in the euro area which go beyond the provisions applicable to all Member States in order to ensure the proper functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union. Setting up a common budgetary timeline for Member States whose currency is the euro should better synchronise the key steps in the preparation of national budgets, thus contributing to the effectiveness of the European Semester for budgetary policy coordination. Biased and unrealistic macro-economic and budgetary forecasts can considerably hamper the effectiveness of budgetary planning and consequently impair commitment to budgetary discipline. By contrast, forecasts from independent bodies can provide unbiased and realistic macro-economic forecasts. At the same time, closer monitoring should ensure early correction of any deviations indicative of the excessive deficits of the Member States. I also believe that with a gradually enhanced monitoring procedure, it will be possible to contribute to better budgetary outcomes to the benefit of all Member States whose currency is the euro.</p>

The text discusses important details, including not only additional data provision and reporting obligations for Member States suffering from serious budgetary imbalances, but also positive technical assistance for these countries, such as ‘reinforced surveillance’ by the Commission and timely Commission recommendations for flawed draft budgets. I did not support the motions for amendments on individual stability bonds and on a redemption fund because, on the one hand, I did not consider them to be closely related to the subject of European fiscal discipline and, on the other, they proved to be exaggerated and not well enough elaborated on several points.

The text by Ms Ferreira, which gave rise to most debate, seeks to strengthen the Commission’s role in examining the budgets of the Member States. As a result, the Commission will be able to ask a Member State to present a new budgetary plan if its trajectory strays too far from the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. The adoption of both reports should allow us to provide broad guidelines for the two rapporteurs who will have to negotiate the regulations with the Member States and the Commission. Nevertheless, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, using unseemly tactics, succeeded in incorporating amendments on the creation of a redemption fund for countries’ debt amounts above 60% of GDP.

The wording alone, which states that ‘the enforcement of budgetary surveillance should always be subject to overarching objectives of the EU and, in particular, to the requirements of Article 9 TFEU related to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection’, expressly bears witness to the fact that, right from the outset, there has been no consideration of this whatsoever.

Tightening both budgetary supervision and the Commission’s role in this supervision, particularly in relation to the Member States included in the excessive deficit procedure, as well as harmonising and increasing the transparency of the process for adopting budgets in the Member States in the euro area, will help enhance the credibility of national fiscal policies, which will improve economic coordination in the euro area and secure it against further shocks which may come in the future. It should also be noted that the benefits resulting from implementation of the proposal under discussion will not be felt for some time. Therefore, we should not stop looking for short-term measures. One such measure is definitely the establishment of a redemption fund. Establishing such a mechanism would mean indirect mutualisation of the public debt of the Member States in the euro area, which, as a result, would reduce market pressure and make it easier to refinance the countries concerned.

Parliament will not only vote today on the strengthening of budgetary coordination; it will also send out a signal that it is time to make progress in the field of budgetary integration as well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A debate on the merits of feasibility and timing of, and conditions for, instruments for joint debt issuance – eurobonds, temporary redemption fund or variants thereof – is in order. We welcome this debate if it is conducted seriously and if the proposals do not lead to more problems than they solve. Confidence will remain the keyword for the coming months and years, the required bridge between savings and growth. Persisting with a European strategy of confidence, i.e. a commitment to sound public finances, a healthy banking system, economic growth and employment and a socially just society: that is the best way out of the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of the excessive deficits of the Member States in the euro area. In defining and implementing its policies and actions, the EU takes into account the requirements in terms of promoting a high level of employment, guaranteeing adequate social protection, combating social exclusion, as well as the requirements for a high level of education, vocational training and health protection. I think that proper attention must be paid to the EU’s strategy for economic growth and employment and how it is implemented by Member States via their national reform programmes. The medium-term fiscal plans contain an updated projection of multiannual expenditure as a percentage of GDP for public administrations and their main components, as well as for multiannual targets and commitments on expenditure, with the aim of achieving the objectives included in the EU strategy for economic growth and employment. It is essential that the common budgetary plan timeline is compatible with the Member States’ budgetary timeframes. Furthermore, strengthening economic governance should include closer and more timely involvement from the European Parliament and national parliaments.</p>

A slowdown in the economy, rising unemployment and the ever greater budget deficits of some of the Member States (Greece currently has the biggest problem, but the signals coming from Spain continue to get worse) have prompted the European institutions to try, to a certain extent, to use the situation to increase their powers, which, in any case, are already considerable. I am thinking here of the European Commission. The proposal to monitor budgetary plans and ensure correction of excessive deficit in the Member States in the euro area is intended to do just this. It is sufficient to mention the ‘two-pack’. Countries which apply for financial assistance should, of course, be subjected to closer surveillance. However, the measure proposed by the Commission does not serve the cause of democracy, and is intended to lead to an ever greater dependence of the Member States on Brussels.

It is also an attempt by the European Commission to include the ideas of the fiscal compact in EU secondary legislation. First and foremost, this alone constitutes an enormous breach of Union law, since the fiscal compact was signed outside the EU legal system and is therefore not enshrined in its primary legislation. However, this ‘setback’ does not seem to concern the Commission or the majority in this House. The goal is to ensure compatibility between budgetary policy and procedures for preventing and correcting excessive macro-economic imbalances through closer monitoring of national reform programmes. In other words, what is being set out here is the continuation of so-called austerity policies with everything they imply – cutting public investment and public services, cutting wages and benefits, and promoting privatisation – beyond the establishment of mechanisms transferring to supranational institutions budgetary policy matters that should be the exclusive competence of the Member States and their sovereign bodies. The proposed debt mutualisation instruments are an attempt to obscure the obvious – and unacceptable – blackmail and violations of democracy included in this package.</p>

Under no circumstances can reports be supported that reinforce the already criticised fiscal compact and ‘six-pack’, and do not give rise to a real anti-cyclical policy and the effective protection of social rights. Essential aspects that we have been demanding for some time are included, however, such as the road map towards the eurobonds, aspects of collective bargaining, the assessment of the social impact of the adjustment plans, and the fact that countries with recapitalisation loans (such as Spain) are not directly bound to macro-economic adjustment plans.

The first report, by Mr Gauzès (Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), French), aims to strengthen economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability in the euro area. The report by Ms Ferreira (Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Portuguese) lays down common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficits of the Member States in the euro area. I regret that the Ferreira report was adopted by a large majority (501 votes to 138, with 36 abstentions), thanks to the support of the S&amp;D Group and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.

      <p sl="hu">I voted in favour of the report because, similarly to its past role in Central and Eastern European countries, the EBRD’s renewed role could now be a decisive influence in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean region. At that time, the aim of the bank was to facilitate the transition to a market economy after the collapse of communism, giving the countries concerned a chance for economic development and a new start. Today, its task is similar, as it now focuses on supporting countries which, after revolutionary sentiments and the fall of a regime, made similar commitments to the principles of multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economy. At the same time, the report is correct in pointing out that since there are major differences between the countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean region and Central and Eastern European countries in terms of their economic and political situations, the EBRD should follow a new approach and a new methodology which take sufficient account of the characteristics of the region. In respect of its new field of activities and methodology, the bank should be encouraged, in particular, to apply appropriate control to ensure that in addition to supporting the private sector, its activities also contribute, in line with Community policies and the Millennium Development Goals, to social justice, sustainable development, the eradication of poverty, the comprehensive protection of human rights and the implementation of international laws on environmental protection.</p>

The Members thus voted in favour of a phased approach adapted to the special situation of the countries of the Mediterranean region. As a result, the EU representatives in the governing bodies of the EBRD should encourage the bank to take measures to promote social inclusion and energy efficiency as well as civic and human rights.

Bearing in mind the fragility of the economies of the new countries and the social inequalities which were one of the root causes of the turmoil of the Arab Spring, the representatives of the Union in the governing bodies of the EBRD should encourage the EBRD to broaden its focus on private sector development, in order also to contribute, through its financing, to the achievement of socially and environmentally sustainable societies, as elaborated in the relevant Millennium Development Goals.

Consequently, capital has been used mainly to support banks, industrial enterprises and businesses, particularly start-ups.

I therefore supported this resolution on the EU’s own resources because, in the budget negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework (MFF), it is extremely important for Parliament to speak with a strong, united voice on the new system of own resources that is to be established. We stress here that Parliament will not give its consent to the MFF unless there is agreement on own resources, with an end to rebates and other correction mechanisms, in order to ensure a more transparent, fair and sustainable budget. We are determined to make the EU budget an instrument for investment and growth, and we are prepared to make full use of our power of codecision to that end.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this European Parliament resolution because, pursuant to Article 311 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Union must provide itself with the means necessary to attain its objectives and carry through its policies, and its budget is to be financed wholly from own resources. The European Parliament has repeatedly called for the creation of new and genuine own resources. Pursuant to Article 312(2) TFEU, the Council is required to adopt a regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework (MFF), acting unanimously, after obtaining the consent of Parliament. The European Union budget’s appropriations are dedicated to stimulating economic growth and creating jobs as well as promoting the EU’s role as a global actor. However, it needs to be stressed that the European Union budget is an investment budget with a strong leverage effect. Despite its limited size, the EU budget pools resources, acts as a catalyst and provides economies of scale and cross-border effects to achieve commonly agreed EU political objectives. Furthermore, the EU budget represents a very strong tool to increase strategic investment with European added value and put the European economy back on track, generating growth and employment while aiming to foster economic and social cohesion throughout the Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is astonishing that while Brussels creates legislation to bind Member States’ spending to tight austerity measures, the call from the Commission is for an ever increasing budget. Nobody is as nonsensical to presume that an increasing EU budget will toll heavily upon national deficits, adding to the very government spending Brussels is demanding be reduced by cutting public sector jobs and services. As a result, people’s lives are deteriorating, in some Member States at an astonishing rate, while the EU builds up financial buffers to be able to swoop in and hand out golden envelopes to struggling nations and by doing so, coerce the general population to perceive the EU as not only a good institution, but a vital one. The raft of legislation being written up in Brussels at the moment is perpetuating the financial crisis for the sake of a Brussels power grab. Whoever has the money has the power. What about slashing the EU budget and, in doing so, cutting the vast contributions made by Member States? To afford the EU’s dreams of becoming a super state and world power, the ability to raise revenue must also be ascribed, despite under the treaties, the EU budget is obligated to be ‘financed wholly from own resources’.</p>

In the resolution, Parliament expresses its support for a financial transaction tax, a new EU VAT and new own resources for the EU as one of the cornerstones for the financing of the next long-term budget. Own resources involve the taxation of citizens. If the EU is granted the right to set taxes, the balance of power between the Member States and the EU will change. We do not want to transfer Sweden’s right of taxation to a majority in the Council and the European Parliament. The EU can meet its commitments, fulfil its new areas of responsibility and, at the same time, create the conditions for jobs and growth by prioritising. More money for the EU in the form of own resources, transaction taxes and new VAT is not a strategy that will help Europe out of the crisis, nor is it the right way to finance the EU’s next long-term budget.</p>

In short, when Europe succeeds, Ireland succeeds. We have to ensure that the EU budget gives us the means to achieve the targets set in the EU 2020 strategy, such as raising the employment rate to 75% and reducing the numbers at risk of poverty by 20 million. The EU budget currently equals just 1% of Member States’ GNI. Those who argue it should be frozen or reduced, and who oppose efforts to introduce new revenue streams, should spell out which EU policies they would cut – CAP, regional aid, education support, development aid, etc.? The treaties state that the EU budget must be ‘financed wholly from own resources’. There are very important issues, including for Ireland, to be addressed but the proposed reforms of the current system, such as by introducing a FTT, could help reduce Member States’ contributions from 75% to 40% by 2020, saving Ireland approximately EUR 500 million annually.

During this very process, European and pro-European ambitions and responsibilities clash with the selfishness of the Member States, resulting in increased national and nationalist sentiment. It is regrettable that the political mentality that always made the common European interest a priority has been lost, replaced by an accountant’s mentality where what is given to the European budget and what is received nationally under ‘community’ policies are continually set off against one another. The EU will only reach its full political potential by boosting its powers on budgets and taxing genuine own resources, including through eurobonds and a financial transaction tax, and boosting its resources, so that they are suited to meet the challenges and political objectives that it aims to pursue and achieve.

In my view, there should be enhanced budgetary flexibility, both within and across headings, as well as between financial years. That would mean that budgetary resources can be appropriately aligned with the evolving circumstances and priorities. Furthermore, the EU budget should be financed by alternative sources of income from, in particular, a proportion of the revenues from a tax on financial transactions or even a European VAT. As the text of the resolution says, without political agreement on the own resources of the EU budget, Parliament is not prepared to give its consent to the next multiannual financial framework (MFF) regulation. Finally, what I would particularly like to see is for the Council to recognise fully the role of Parliament as codecider in these negotiations and to act accordingly. Parliament is determined to make its voice heard and the Council should be ready for this.</p>

      <p sl="es">I voted in favour. Daniel Cohn-Bendit has made it clear that without an increase in the EU budget and its own resources, none of the speeches on political sovereignty have any worth. The current banking, economic and political crisis requires an even more European approach, but a democratic Europe that can apply policies to reactivate the economy. It is therefore essential that the EU budget reflects the true willingness of political, fiscal and banking union. We, the Group of the Greens, request that the EU budgets have their own line of funding through elements such as taxes on financial transactions, on carbon and on mobile telephony. Through these three taxes, the EU’s own resources would increase by EUR 40 billion or EUR 50 billion and policies for growth and job creation could therefore be implemented.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EP adopted resolution on the multiannual financial framework and own resources sends a clear signal to the EU leaders before their first discussion of the 2014-2020 budgetary plan. The EU budget is a very strong and strategic tool to put the European economy back on track and to meet the political ambitions of the EU; however, the budgetary consolidation measures currently imposed on national budgets must be taken into account. Therefore, I welcome the proposals on the reform of the own-resources system as they are aimed at reducing the share of Member States’ GNI-based contributions to the EU budget from 75% to 40% by 2020, thereby contributing to the consolidation efforts of Member States. The next long-term budget should as well provide greater flexibility to cope adequately with evolving challenges and priorities amongst the financial years within the MFF.</p>

In this resolution, Parliament advocates its full right to participate in negotiations; it demands an increased European budget, which should help the countries in greatest difficulties and should create more and better jobs. Parliament reiterates its desire to do away with the major Member States’ under-the-table deals, putting an end to the ‘correction mechanisms’ and ‘rebates’ of the United Kingdom and others.

It is important to stress that the budget is geared towards realising the Europe 2020 strategy, and that around 94% of financial appropriations are geared towards supporting growth and jobs, in particular, the EUR 336 billion spent on cohesion policy and the EUR 80 billion spent on research and innovation. The EUR 50 billion Connecting Europe Facility will be extremely important in financing cross-border projects in the energy, transport and information technology sectors, while the EUR 19 billion for the Erasmus for All proposal demonstrates that the European Union is concerned about the future for new generations.

Even though the austerity policies imposed by the European Union have been undermining economies and social structures, the text submitted to the vote of Parliament dares to claim that ‘94% [of EU appropriations] are dedicated to stimulating economic growth and jobs and the EU’s role as a global actor’ (ibid). Worse still, even though the Council is constantly checkmating the European Parliament in budgetary powers, this text merely asks for ‘the political positions agreed by the European Council [to] be negotiated between Parliament and the Council’ (paragraph 5).

      <p sl="de">In principle, it is a good idea to want to discuss trade negotiations with a strong export power such as Japan and to conclude an agreement on this. Both sides will profit from such negotiations or from the agreement. However, some Members are now complaining that Japan’s duty is too high and they therefore want to defer the negotiations, although it was decided more than a year ago (on 28 May 2011) that we wanted to or should start negotiations. It is not acceptable that some now want to delay this promising ‘cooperation’ even further. It is up to each country to create duties and to specify how high that duty will be. There are duties in the EU, too, which I imagine do not suit everybody. The EU wants to force things upon the countries of Europe, but Japan is not in Europe. It is unacceptable to want to impose rules on a country such as Japan, telling it how high it may set its duty. The EU should not exceed its powers and force things upon a non-EU country. I am therefore advocating that these negotiations be started immediately, in order to expand and increase trade between the EU and Japan for the benefit of both sides. Although I am fundamentally in favour of this agreement, I voted against this motion because it provides for a further postponement of the negotiations.</p>

If that happens, as well as being disregarded by the Council, Parliament will lose the opportunity that it had to tell the Commission in advance about the substantive conditions that Parliament thinks should be included in the negotiating mandate, which would then give it the authority to react if these conditions are not respected, including to threaten to withhold its final consent from the treaty.</p>

The political crisis is diverting attention away from the needs of the population and accelerating the humanitarian crisis. Reports from non-governmental organisations working on the ground are alarming, according to which the illegal government composed of those who carried out the coup continues, with increasing intensity, to violate human rights, in particular, by suppressing civil liberties such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of movement and freedom of association. I consider the arbitrary detention, imprisonment and cases of harassment of activists and politicians who protest against the government of self-appointed putschists to be equally deserving of condemnation. I firmly believe that it is essential that the perpetrators of human rights violations be punished for their actions, and that those responsible for violations of the constitutional order be brought to face justice.

However, neither party should rely on the silence of the international community in the face of the humanitarian tragedy which is currently looming.

The European Union, seeking to contribute to establishing peace in this oil-rich region, supported the two countries’ independence process.

The US, the EU and Israel have exploited the conflict that has been going on since 2005, and which has exacerbated poverty, social injustice, ethnic and religious differences – between the Arab/Muslim north and the African/Christian south – and they have pushed these peoples towards secession for reasons relating to their own geostrategic interests and to taking advantage of the south’s considerable oil and sundry mineral resources. We advocate a peaceful political solution to the conflict, free of external interference, whilst supporting dialogue between the parties and mutually acceptable solutions to the problems of defining borders and sharing oil revenues. ‘Additional peacekeeping forces’ and ‘a continued UN presence’, as this resolution advocates, might not constitute the necessary contribution to a genuine peace and unity process for this region.</p>

However, I am pleased that Sudan and South Sudan are striving to end the violence and demonstrate the political will to resolve the problems that have remained unresolved since the secession of South Sudan. On the other hand, all acts of violence committed against the civilian population, which are contrary to international humanitarian law and human rights legislation, are deplorable. I think it is important to stress that all stakeholders should strive to protect human rights, including the rights of women and people in vulnerable groups, and that those who have committed serious violations of these rights, including sexual violence, should be held to account. From my perspective, long-term stability in the region requires a new, unified, comprehensive international strategy, in which the EU would play a role alongside other global and regional actors, which would focus not only on issues between Sudan and South Sudan and the situation in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, but also on the long overdue reform process in Sudan.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We have warned from the start of the dangers represented by a referendum in the then-region of southern Sudan, fostered by the EU, US and UN, as well as by the majority in this Parliament. We warned that support for destroying the country’s unity would cause confrontation and the destabilisation of both parties, potentially affecting the entire region. Unfortunately, reality has borne out this warning, with the return of the conflict between north and south over defining borders. The US, the EU and Israel have exploited the conflict that has been going on since 2005, and which has exacerbated poverty, social injustice, ethnic and religious differences – the north is Arab/Muslim and the south is African/Christian – and they have pushed these peoples towards secession for reasons relating to their own geostrategic interests and to taking advantage of the south’s considerable oil and sundry mineral resources. We need to advocate a peaceful political solution to the conflict, free of any external interference, whilst supporting dialogue between the parties and mutually acceptable solutions to the problems of defining borders and sharing oil revenues. ‘Additional peacekeeping forces’ and ‘a continued UN presence’, as advocated in this resolution, might not constitute the necessary contribution to a genuine peace and unity process for this region.</p>

On 13 June, Parliament gave the green light to a trade agreement which aims to remove technical and tariff barriers to trade between the EU, Colombia and Peru. It should allow us to benefit from conditions of access ‘equivalent to those of the United States’ in Colombia and Peru. However, Parliament was anxious, before giving its agreement, to ensure that these agreements would have a positive effect on human rights and the improvement of employment and trade union rights, without which they would be suspended immediately. These agreements are therefore based on a reciprocity clause: economic integration is to be the means of combating poverty and strengthening social cohesion and sustainable development.

      <p sl="da">My reasons for voting in favour of the resolution of 13 June 2012 on the EU trade agreement with Colombia and Peru are set out below.</p>
      <p sl="da">Negotiation of the free trade agreement between the EU and these two countries has been completed, but it has not yet been ratified by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="da">The EU has a general policy of not entering into trade agreements with countries that have serious problems with human rights. I am therefore voting in favour of this resolution, as it lays down requirements and offers the governments of Peru and Colombia the opportunity to demonstrate that they are willing to improve their conditions in relation to human rights and workers’ rights. This is particularly relevant in the case of Colombia, as it is the most dangerous country in the world in which to be professionally active.</p>
      <p sl="da">The section of the free trade agreement about trade and sustainable development sets out that monitoring mechanisms are to be established that involve civil society organisations. The resolution makes reference to the fact that the legal framework for this is not yet in place in Colombia and Peru (paragraph 5). Furthermore, the resolution states that Colombia and Peru should establish domestic advisory groups (DAGs) with binding involvement for civil society in order to monitor the implementation of the free trade agreement (paragraph 7) and implement the Victims and Land Restitution Law (paragraph 17).</p>
      <p sl="da">The resolution is the best possible compromise and a necessary step in preparation for the European Parliament’s vote on the free trade agreement in the autumn.</p>

It concerns Parliament’s consent for the trade agreement between the EU and Colombia and Peru. I should like to acknowledge my co-rapporteur for this pre-resolution, my German colleague from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Bernd Lange: we achieved a basis of mutual understanding, which constitutes the roots of this strong support for our report. In this pre-resolution, we acknowledge and support the enormous efforts of the Colombian and Peruvian Governments in recent years to protect human rights, workers’ rights, indigenous populations and the environment, and we call for greater civil society involvement in the practical implementation of these core values – on which we were unbending – and for acceleration of the reforms under way, which we think will make this agreement more applicable and transparent. Although we requested, as an add-on to this resolution, a road map from each of our Andean partners as regards each of these areas, from a strictly personal point of view, I believe the mechanisms set out in the report will, if scrupulously implemented, have the same results. We will vote on assent for the trade agreement in October.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This motion for a resolution, tabled further to an oral question on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, concerns the EU trade agreement with Colombia and Peru. For years, Colombia has been considered a haven for drugs producers and traffickers. Unscrupulous individuals have taken advantage of the poverty in which the majority of the population live to exploit them. Thanks to international cooperation, these countries have started a process of reforms and combating drug trafficking, with very positive results. Colombia has exceeded International Labour Organisation forecasts on adopting the advocated measures and Peru has implemented the United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Despite the improvements relating to respect for human rights and the rule of law, the two countries are aware of the need to continue improving in this area. I voted in favour because I believe this free trade agreement could help these countries to combat poverty and social exclusion, and to replace the growing of narcotics with saleable consumer goods, thereby increasing exports to the EU, the main importer of goods produced in Peru.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU has signed yet another free trade agreement. This is the culmination of a tumultuous process, in which the negotiations started with the Andean Community of Nations (CAN) and ended up being concluded with just Colombia and Peru. The so-called road map for human and labour rights aims to deflect the criticisms of free trade and mitigate some of its most negative effects. Clearly, however, it does not change the essence of this agreement. We seem to be here to assess its practical results. Free trade between two unequal partners is always protectionism for the rich. We cannot ignore the pressures on countries that have hitherto benefited from the generalised system of preferences to sign agreements of this type. Furthermore, this once again proves the EU’s hypocrisy on human rights issues, which are used as a weapon for attacking countries that do not fall into line with its interests, but conveniently forgotten when convenient. That is the case with Colombia, where countless organisations have been reporting clear human rights violations, particularly trade unions. Those organisations and trade unions opposed this agreement and have denounced its negative consequences. We voted against.</p>

Regrettably, disagreements between Andean countries on approaches to a number of key trade issues covered under the foreseen agreement led to the suspension of talks in June 2008. Under these circumstances, the Commission presented a recommendation to the Council in December 2008 with a view to modifying the existing authorisation so as to continue negotiations of a trade agreement with those countries of the Andean Community that are willing to move ahead. In January 2009, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a multi-party trade agreement with those countries sharing our general objective of a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive agreement that satisfies the requirements of the World Trade Organisation. The Presidents of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru confirmed their commitment to negotiate. The negotiations were successfully concluded in May 2010 and, after a phase of legal review, the text of the trade agreement was initialled with Colombia and Peru on 23 March 2011.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the resolution on the EU trade agreement with Colombia and Peru because this agreement aims to open up the markets for goods, services, public procurement and investment, and to promote global economic development. The purpose of the agreement is to reduce poverty, create new employment opportunities, improve working conditions and raise living standards by liberalising and expanding trade and investment between the territories of the countries participating in the agreement. The European Union is the second biggest trading partner of Colombia and Peru. The planned trade agreement provides for total liberalisation of trade in industrial products and fisheries, which could increase Colombia’s GDP by up to 1.3% and Peru’s GDP by up to 0.7% in the long term. An important part of the agreement is devoted to respect for human rights and democratic principles. Failure to respect these would also give rise to the possibility of terminating or suspending the agreement partially or totally. In this regard, we call on both Andean countries to ensure that a transparent and binding road map is drawn up on human and labour rights.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This resolution is one of a number of concerns of Parliament, prior to the ratification of the free trade agreements with Colombia and Peru. This resolution welcomes ‘the Colombian Government’s efforts to fight impunity and the murder of trade unionists and human rights defenders’. Colombia is still the country in the world where the greatest number of trade unionists are assassinated with total impunity (90% of these murders go without punishment), a fate that they share with human rights defenders and the ‘indigenous’ population. Furthermore, these free trade agreements also fail to promote the sustainable development policies which these countries need. In that sense, these agreements are blind to the economy and will make inequalities even worse. I therefore voted against this resolution in order to condemn the hypocrisy of the European Union, which is moving towards the ratification of a free trade agreement with a country like Colombia while, at the same time, claiming to be up to date on human rights and environmental protection. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will be united on this agreement, in particular, in the vote in the Committee on International Trade on 10 July.</p>

Firstly, EU Human Rights have made a mockery of national legal systems which are designed to protect society and forge the equal and fair treatment of its members. It serves to aid criminals and terrorists, undermines the value of incarceration and impinges upon national sovereignty over who is resident within a country. Secondly, while, on the one hand, the EU is prolonging one of greatest financial crises in history, forcing tens of thousands out of work, preventing stocks of essential medicines from being replenished in Greece, witnessing some 25 000 people becoming dependent on hand outs from the Church and using the control of wealth to humble these once strong nations into subservience to Brussels, the Commission wants to appoint somebody to pontificate on European Human Rights worldwide. How about the EU focuses upon Chapter V of its own Charter of Fundamental Rights, being the citizens’ rights to vote, the right to good administration and the right to petition and ask the people of Europe whether they want a continuation of this abhorrent project to create a federal superstate?</p>

For it is not just a function fulfilled by Member State governments across the EU, but also by global organisations such as the UN. If the EU insists on imposing its views on others – which we know the EU does – with the vast resources available to the High Representative on Foreign Affairs, surely this role should be carried out by Baroness Ashton?

      <p sl="pt">The debate on the UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) started in 2006, when the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution supported by 153 countries. The United States was the only UN Member State to vote against creating the ATT. It is very important that the ATT bear fruit, in the context of a restarted arms race and escalating military spending, particularly by the US and the NATO countries, which are increasingly showing their aggressive nature. With the Treaty of Lisbon and the provisions relating to the European Defence Agency, the EU is also entering this race. Regulation of the import, export and transfer of arms will be all the more effective if accompanied by a multilateral and reciprocal disarmament process, particularly the decommissioning of the immense existing nuclear arsenals and the complete destruction of chemical and biological weapons. It is also important to tackle the instruments such as tax havens which facilitate the money laundering associated with the arms trade. We are pleased that the reference to jobs in the arms industry has been removed from the resolution. That is why we voted in favour.</p>

Unregulated arms trading is a contributory factor in armed conflict, the displacement of people, organised crime and terrorism. It is clear that the arms industry contributes to job creation and economic growth; on the other hand, however, the poorly regulated, uncontrolled and opaque arms trade leads to irresponsible trading in weapons, causes unnecessary human suffering, fuels armed conflict, instability, terrorist attacks and corruption, undermines peace building processes, good governance and socio-economic development, and leads to the overthrow of democratically elected governments and the violation of the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law. Moreover, in the field of arms transfers, there are no binding commitments that would unequivocally safeguard such rights. Taking these facts into consideration, I firmly believe that it is important that the Arms Trade Treaty be implemented effectively and credibly. It is important that the Member States, in line with their Treaty of Lisbon commitment, uphold the EU’s positions set out in reply to the UN Secretary-General at the conference in order to ensure a successful outcome from the conference resulting in an Arms Trade Treaty based on solid foundations.</p>

The Congolese Government must commit itself resolutely to a political practice that genuinely respects all human rights including freedom of expression and opinion, freedom to demonstrate and freedom of religion, etc. It is important to strengthen the rule of law, good governance and the fight against corruption and control over the security services. The forthcoming elections included in the revised electoral timetable for the period 2012-2014 must be transparent, credible and reliable, and human rights and fundamental freedoms must be respected.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The presidential and legislative elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in November 2011 were marred by numerous irregularities, fraud and violence. By a large majority, Parliament stresses the need for the Congolese Government to redouble its efforts to guarantee the rule of law and to strengthen the institutions responsible for the proper conduct of the elections. In parallel, Parliament calls on the Commission and the Member States to make the EU’s financial contribution dependent upon the implementation of the recommendations and to support civil society, which demonstrated, through its action during the elections, its commitment to democracy.

Numerous irregularities and cases of fraud were detected. The Congolese Government also rejected all recommendations concerning measures to ensure a regulated and orderly election.

In November, the turnout was 80%, suggesting that there is heightened interest among the population to drive forward the democratic process.

      <p sl="fr">The situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with regard to democracy and the protection of human rights is extremely worrying. While the last presidential elections awarded victory to the outgoing President, the EU Election Observation Mission in the DRC reported a lack of transparency and credibility due to the numerous cases of fraud and irregularities detected. Furthermore, politically motivated human rights violations increased in the run-up to the presidential elections: repression targeted at human rights defenders and journalists worsened, and these people were subject to arbitrary arrests and intimidation. In view of this situation, and given that the EU’s financial contribution to these elections amounts to almost EUR 50 million, I voted in favour of this resolution, of which I am a co-author. Our text commits the Commission and the Member States in particular to make the EU’s financial contribution to the electoral process in the DRC dependent upon the effective implementation of the recommendations of the EU Election Observation Mission, and invites the Congolese authorities to ratify the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance at the earliest opportunity.</p>

I consider it extremely important that the EOM’s 22 recommendations on the DRC be taken into account and applied by the relevant authorities, whilst nevertheless using the principle of conditionality.

Since its independence, there have been successive interventions and attacks from outside or via actors within the country itself, which have pushed it into a series of conflicts that have, almost uninterruptedly, generated immense contradiction between the country’s enormous potential and the extreme poverty in which the majority of its people live. Let us recall the murder of Patrice Lumumba, Prime Minister of the DRC, by imperialist conspirators backed by NATO, the Belgian Government and the CIA. This young pioneer of African unity, a staunch defender of the DRC’s sovereignty and of the people’s dignity and self-confidence, was a threat to the neo-colonialist intentions of the major world powers. More than 40 years later, the Congolese people’s struggle continues. For our part, we will continue supporting this struggle for sovereignty, for the country’s territorial integrity, and for its right to economic and social development.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first thank you on behalf of the Commission and my colleagues László Andor and Algirdas Šemeta for this opportunity to discuss the first real European Semester after the entry into force of the ‘six-pack’ legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission adopted two weeks ago its most important package of economic policy proposals of the year. We put forward country-specific recommendations for the reforms that are needed to deliver stability, growth and jobs in the 27 Member States and for their citizens. The Member States have taken last year’s recommendations seriously. Efforts have been made to implement them, but progress is still very uneven between Member States and more needs to be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">To supplement national action, the European level must play its part. The Commission has put on the table concrete proposals to enhance sustainable growth; some of them have been on the table already for several months. They are about creating competitive services and energy markets, a digital single market, investing in infrastructure, promoting research and innovation, and getting better access to fast-growing markets around the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such growth-enhancing structural policies must be supported by enhanced investment, public and private. We need more cross-border and Community investment in renewable energy and green growth, in transport and communication infrastructure, as well as in research and innovation. To this end, we have proposed an increase in the EIB’s lending capacity. We also welcome the recent agreement on our project bond proposal to unlock up to EUR 4.6 billion in a pilot phase. To support growth, we also need a European budget that has the magnitude and the means to invest in the future. In the talks on the next multiannual financial framework, I count on the full support of this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, with last week’s proposal on bank resolution, the EU is the first body in the world that has fully delivered on its G20 commitments to strengthen the regulation and supervision of the banking sector. This is a very important signal ahead of the G20 summit in Los Cabos, where one may expect some other leaders to be tempted to put the blame for the crisis only on Europe’s shoulders. And, as we said two weeks ago in our policy statement, we are preparing further steps towards a full economic union to complete our monetary union, including through a financial union. The main building blocks towards a financial union should include such common elements as a single rule book, integrated financial supervision, a common resolution authority and a single deposit insurance scheme. All these common and integrated elements should be part of the same overall framework, the overall construct, intended for the 27 Member States, while allowing stronger requirements and deeper integration for the euro area as necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">The basic principle is clear: the sharing of risk in the guarantee scheme calls for an integrated, strong supervision of the banking sector. There can be no further mutualisation of economic risk without deeper integration of decision making. In other words, to move further in mutualisation, it is necessary to strengthen our stability culture. This basic principle should guide the future construction of both financial and fiscal union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission supports a strong involvement of the European Parliament in the strengthened European Semester. In this context, I would like to thank Parliament, especially the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for organising the opportunity to have an economic dialogue on the European Semester on Monday this week. I found it very substantive and constructive and I hope that this sentiment is shared. The Commission stands ready also, in future, to actively participate in any discussion on the outcome of this year’s European Semester. I trust that Parliament will fully engage in the multilateral surveillance of economic policies in the European Union and will be able to ensure that country-specific guidance will be both relevant and ambitious.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Rehn for his presentation on the current status of the European Semester and on his other plans. You can count on our full support. It is really good that we are now half way through the first year of the European Semester and that it has become a very powerful instrument for better aligning our economic and budgetary policies. We have got rid of its non-committal elements and, thanks to this Parliament, the semester also forms part of the ‘six-pack’. Plus, the Commission’s powers have been significantly strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We would like to see transparent debates on the Commission’s recommendations and we would like the Council to really take them seriously, because that was something that was missing in the past. Therefore, it is important that, every time the Council fails to follow the Commission, the Council should come here and explain why it is not doing so and why it has taken a different position. In many previous cases, we have witnessed reverse voting take place.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to praise Commissioner Rehn for the thorough analysis he has tabled concerning the national reform programmes and stability programmes, as well as for his recommendations. It is now time that Member States seriously addressed them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For that reason, it is a real pity that the Council is not attending today’s debate, because it is important that we conduct that debate among the three of us: Parliament, Commission and Council. What I can already see coming is that some countries will try to make deals in order to smooth over their rough edges, and I can also see that taking place in my own country, the Netherlands. We know that we need clear recommendations for all countries, but we tend to think those will not be needed when it comes to our own respective countries! However, if we continue with that train of thought, we will never haul ourselves out of this crisis and that is why we need to take this seriously. I hope that you will persevere in these efforts and ask for a public debate if the Council deviates from your recommendations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to make two points in my two minutes. This morning, President Barroso proposed an interinstitutional agreement on a growth initiative to properly involve the European Parliament in the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">My first point is about democracy. I welcome President Barroso’s proposal, but I would also like to recall that two years ago, this Parliament voted for something much more important: an interinstitutional agreement on the European Semester. We must make the European Semester process truly democratic.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Rehn, you reminded our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Monday that the new economic dialogue provision in the ‘six-pack’ expects the Council, as a general rule, to follow the recommendations and proposals of the Commission. Those recommendations cover essential elements of national policy: labour market regulation, pension systems, collective bargaining practices and so on. It is simply not acceptable that such recommendations are meant to be followed by Member States without the proper democratic involvement of both national and European Parliaments. That democratic deficit needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second point concerns the economic situation. Today, we have voted on the so-called ‘two-pack’, but we have still not made any progress in recognising the importance of public investment as a key part of national budgetary policies. Public investment is now to be increasingly addressed, as you have said, through European instruments, for example, through an increased role for the EIB and the pilot project on project bonds.</p>
      <p sl="en">But these instruments will not be enough to solve the growing public investment deficit across the Member States. Public investment is at least 1% of GDP too low now, and that will not be made up via these instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission needs to provide solid estimates of public investment needs between now and 2020, taking account of existing policy objectives. It then needs to indicate as precisely as possible how those needs are to be met. Only then will we be able to assess whether the proposed instrument will address the public investment deficit or whether, as we believe, we need to go further. We believe that we need to address that deficit systematically within the rules on economic governance through a new growth regulation. Only in that way will we find a sensible balance between austerity and growth.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the road towards a true economic and fiscal union to complement our monetary union is, of course, full of hurdles. The new legislation in force on economic governance, reinforced today with the voting of the ‘two-pack’ in Parliament, has given new tools to the Commission to ensure that Member States choose the right part of a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, but also stick to their country-specific recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a Liberal, I truly believe that reforms of our economy and social system, such as labour market reforms and pension reforms, should be at the heart of regaining competitiveness in the eurozone. But unfortunately, in the past months, we have seen that some Member States have overly contradicted the country-specific recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us take the example of France. It has stated that it will undo the pension reforms and lower the retirement age. This is completely against the spirit of the recommendations given to France to ensure that all workers stay in employment longer.</p>
      <p sl="de">Also in my own country, Belgium, wage setting hampers regaining competitiveness, but socialist members of governments have openly said that they will not address this problem. This is a perfect example of how countries choose not to show solidarity with other countries within the eurozone. As long as Member States keep looking to other Member States to enlarge the competitiveness of the Union and are not able or willing to implement or reform in their own country, the fundamental economic crisis in Europe will not end.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must ensure that Member States finally take ownership of the European Semester and implement the structural reforms needed. We must ensure that, instead of blaming the European Union for everything that goes wrong, Member States are made responsible and more accountable for their policies. The Commission will have to ensure that Member States put into practice what they preach, but how will it make sure that Member States within the Council show the necessary solidarity with each other and commit to the fiscal consolidation and structural reforms as requested through the European Semester or enable the European Union to be the frontrunner in attracting private investment to regain competitiveness and growth? True solidarity implies responsibility from all Member States. Member States should stop hiding behind Europe, but instead use the full potential that Europe has to get out of this crisis.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I believe that the European Semester is a key element of continued economic cooperation in Europe. Unless we succeed in aligning our economic policy guidelines more closely, the euro will come to a sticky end. That is why it is so interesting to see what the reality test looks like now, one year on.</p>
      <p sl="de">In fact, the reality test looks very varied. There are countries like Bulgaria, a true model pupil when it comes to implementing the recommendation, which scarcely anyone would likely have expected. And there are other countries like Slovenia, Slovakia, Malta and Spain, which have so far implemented almost nothing. Overall, the results are rather mixed. Turning to my own country, Germany, which is currently regarded as the model pupil, I can only say, as regards the recommendations of the Commission: Hats off, you have really put your finger on some of the sore points of German economic policy! You say that the low paid should be taxed less and be less burdened with social contributions. You say that we should levy ecological taxes more and burden the low paid less. And you also say we should dismantle some excessive professional regulation. I can only say that you are right. And you also say that the education system in Germany offers too few chances to those who do not come from strong parental homes. You are absolutely right. If I look at implementation in Germany, I would have to say that, in fact, nothing at all has happened in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact that, as regards the assessment of the European Semester by the Commission, one has to look long and hard for it, makes me a little suspicious. One can find the assessment in working papers, where, under the relevant points, the phrase ‘partially implemented’ is written. However, the ‘partially’ really represents a very small part. One has the feeling that you are really looking for something to justify the ‘partially’.</p>
      <p sl="de">We now need two things. First, as regards the test, are the proposals that are not implemented submitted again? The only answer I can give is that, in the case of Germany, that is what you did. Fine, you demonstrated courage. You are also confronting Germany with it. When checking whether implementation took place or not, you hid rather too much behind the small print. I would like to see you have more courage to say clearly who did what and to say it like it is. This enables us citizens, policy makers and the media to really look into the matter and to bring the European Semester project to a successful conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Blue-card question. – Mr Giegold, you mentioned in your speech that some countries were at the forefront of resolving the crisis, while others have barely done anything to this end. The problem is that due to weakened economic competitiveness and economic loss, the magnitude of the austerity measures applied within countries is such that the population, especially in Central and Eastern European countries, can no longer bear them.</p>
      <p sl="hu">My question is this: is this the fault of the population, or is it the fault of the states with their immeasurable corruption, as seen, for example, in connection with the embezzlement of European Union subsidies? What do you suggest to ensure that it is not the people who are subjected to austerity and that it is not the people who have to pay the costs but the governments?

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr Schwab, you are aware of the PISA results for Germany, and they are, quite frankly, not particularly presentable. As far as permeability is concerned, if you grow up in a parental home with parents who are relatively uneducated, then in Germany, your chances of going to university or leaving school with the Abitur are pretty slim. And the Commission quite rightly draws attention to that.</p>
      <p sl="de">That there are job openings in Germany is correct. However, most of them are in the low pay sector. We now have 25% of jobs in the low pay sector. The people who suffer from poor educational opportunities are the same people who get stuck in low paid jobs. Unfortunately, very little is being done by the current government about either problem: the permeability of the education system or the eradication of low paid jobs. The fact that the Commission dares to point this out is truly laudable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in these recommendations, some countries are being told to do what they are already doing and some countries, like France, are doing the opposite of what they are being told. The problem is that the people in Europe see the Commission saying one thing to our Member States but then often doing another thing in the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I have three recommendations for the Commissioner. Firstly, on the EU budget: stop wasting taxpayers’ money on vanity projects and make sure that we really are getting value for money in that budget; secondly, cut bureaucracy for businesses so that they can grow, which should be an urgent priority for the EU; and thirdly, sort out the banks. You will not mend bankrupt banks by burying their problems in a banking union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when this declaration was written, perhaps no one envisaged that, when the time came to debate it, the spread would have been consistently over 500 and, God forbid, even at 600 for Spain and, God forbid indeed, for Italy too.</p>
      <p sl="it">So, we want to combat speculation. This morning, President Barroso extolled to us the virtues of his solution of creating a European banking union. This, however, actually amounts to a way for the European Union to get its hands on our savings. Banking union will not protect European savers. National governments will lose any powers that they have or want to have over their respective national banking systems, whose contents will be poured into an undifferentiated melting pot of debt.</p>
      <p sl="it">In essence, banking union is an attempt, and quite a blatant one at that, to ward off insolvency in the Spanish banking system today by using the savings of the other euro area Member States, even poor Italy, harshly enough. It seems, then, to be a preventive strike against the growing support for the real reform that could solve the problem of this bankrupt system: in other words, banking separation or the Glass-Steagall Act. Essentially, this means separating savings banks from investment banks, which is the only way to prevent savings from being used to plug gaps or being lost when the speculators fail.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in June 2010, the Heads of State or Government of the EU Member States finally acknowledged that the European Community needs a more closely coordinated financial and economic policy. At the summit, they ‘invented’ the European Semester, so to speak. It is perfectly right that members of the Economic and Monetary Union should not simply consider how their policies affect businesses, workers and consumers in their own country. A European perspective is needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">An internal market without a coordinated economic, wage and social policy may tempt Member States to create short-term growth and jobs at the expense of neighbouring countries. Such imbalances can cause monetary union to fragment, both economically and politically. That is precisely the situation currently facing the EU. The German economy has cut the ground from under its neighbours’ feet for years. There has been no stimulus from investment and wage growth. Instead, Berlin has brought the euro area to the brink of collapse with a decade of aggressive export policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore gratifying that the Commission is now slowly wising up to this core problem of the euro crisis in its country-specific recommendations. It is therefore right and proper that the Federal Republic is called upon to invest more in education, research and child care and that the Commission demands that it put a stop to the abuse of so-called ‘mini jobs’ and adapt wage growth to productivity growth. This is a belated but important insight.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope, Commissioner Rehn, that you will put this demand vehemently to the German Government, even though there is no formal procedure for surplus countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, back in October 2010, it was obvious to all of us that the European Semester was a first step towards necessary reforms which would clearly change the face of European economic policy. The European Semester is a very thorough and extensive analysis of the entire European economy. On 30 May, the Commission adopted the global package of its analysis with the country-specific recommendations. It came as no real surprise to us that economic imbalances exist in Spain and Cyprus. However, we can see quite clearly where other Member States still have to do their homework.</p>
      <p sl="de">My first conclusion is that the European Semester has survived its baptism of fire. Together with the ‘six-pack’ and the ‘two-pack’, which are on the table, in my opinion, strengthening the coordination of European economic and fiscal policies is well under way. However, this is not praise; rather it has to be taken as a warning. In view of the persistent national debt crises in Europe, there is an urgent need for thought and action that go beyond these measures.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I firmly believe that of all the instruments and institutions created in the wake of the crisis, the European Semester is, as far as I see it, perhaps the most important, and can also become the most effective instrument for preventing and correcting financial, budgetary and economic imbalances, as well as for preventing another crisis in the future. I hope that the Commission will also take just as firm a line on the way in which Member States are going to implement the recommendations, because what we call the European Semester is basically a continuous process which runs for a year and will be repeated every year.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I would like to use my speech also to stress an extremely important point concerning national parliaments: the role of national parliaments in the European Semester. I would like to tell you that this spring, at the initiative of the Danish Presidency, a meeting of national parliaments took place, which also included a debate on their role within the European Semester. I observed then the desire of these national parliaments to be involved in this process. National parliaments now have the opportunity to get involved directly in seeing how governments adopt the measures needed to implement the recommendations made as part of the European Semester. I, too, believe that it is important for us to continue this exchange of experience between national parliaments, at the European Parliament’s initiative, so that they really feel that they are playing a direct, responsible part in this process represented by the European Semester.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, we already had the opportunity to address this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Monday evening.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to make several comments. The first is that, in these country-specific recommendations that you have just made, we basically believe that the fundamental question that should be settled, were all these recommendations to be implemented, is that of macro-economic imbalances within the Union. When you examine this jigsaw of recommendations, you wonder whether we really do have all the tools we need to correct these macro-economic imbalances, whether, in particular, we can make the management of the euro area as a whole as effective as we would like it to be.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then, when I look at the specific recommendations that you have made for France, a country with which I am well acquainted, I am struck by the fact that at no time did you say that these recommendations had been made on the basis of a document submitted to you by a government since defeated in the elections. In this document, you are acting on the results of five years of Presidency by Nicolas Sarkozy. You say that, over five years, France lost 19.4% of its external competitiveness. The French people’s response to that is to say that they would like VAT to be revised, the pension reform to be revised and the minimum wage boosted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, you say precisely the opposite in the recommendations that you make to this country. That raises an issue of democracy. Mr Hughes has already said this in the name of my group, but I shall say it again in this particular instance. We shall not succeed collectively if, in the Member States, we feel that there is a diktat drawn up in Brussels which ignores the political realities of our countries. You must answer this question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this Parliament, as you know, we are all in favour of integration, of greater strength together at a European level, because we know that only together shall we be able to recover. However, if you do this against the people, against their political choices, we shall go to the wall. You must answer this question, Commissioner.</p>

It is an excellent idea to rap the Netherlands on the knuckles for its failure to help women, the disabled, immigrants and the elderly into work, but that message is not loud enough because the semester does not have an audience. It seldom involves NGOs, social partners, or even national parliaments. Therefore, it does not get talked about so much in the press and voters do not take much notice of what the Commission has said when they go to the polls.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I challenge the Commissioners to carry out a survey among national parliamentarians and to ask them how many of the five 2020 targets they can name. I am prepared to stake a big box of Belgian chocolates that 90% would not be able to name even one. We need to raise the democratic standard of the semester so that Member States define their policies much more in line with the semester, and I am not just talking about goals and sanctions, but about all the other targets too.</p>

However, ladies and gentlemen, facts are stubborn things. European Semester or no European Semester, the figures indicate that over the recent period, disparities between wealthier and poorer countries continued to grow. This leads me to the regrettable conclusion that the European Union lacks a clear and explicit strategy or concept in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We submit that if taking the European Semester, the Cohesion Funds and everything else together, we truly wish to reduce the differences that exist between wealthier and poorer Member States, then we must create jobs.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would say that the European Semester process is undoubtedly doing a good job by enhancing economic governance, on the one hand, and enhancing policy coordination, on the other. I also believe that this year’s outcome demonstrates visibly how much the adoption of the ‘six-pack’ has contributed to the semester progress, especially through giving more power to the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I also believe that this is a learning process for all of us and, on the basis of the experience of the two cycles, let me point to one or two challenges, as I see them, that this process is facing.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my view, one of the issues is certainly the timing factor. I was thinking that maybe further adjustments with regard to the timing factor could be considered by the Commission, for example, better alignment of the timing of the release of the Annual Growth Survey, which targets the entire EU27 family, and the Alert Mechanism Report, which is introduced by the ‘six-pack’ and which targets specific Member States. Perhaps better alignment and sense of timing could increase the efficiency of the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another area which is also important is linked to the fact that forecasts are never perfect. As the Annual Growth Survey is based on the forecast prepared by the Commission and then there are those budgetary adjustment recommendations, I was wondering whether the Commission has already seen any risks, in terms of the changing reality, that do not fully match the forecasts?</p>
      <p sl="en">It would also be interesting, following on from what colleagues have already mentioned, to hear how the Commission sees the proportions between the EU recommendations respected by the Member States and those decisions which are made nationally, irrespective of the recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="en">My very last comment is that what we have seen this year is a visibly enhanced European Parliament role, where again I think the ‘six-pack’ and the economic dialogue have made the difference.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, in its assessment of Slovenia’s National Reform Programme, the Commission wrote that no major structural reform had been agreed to in the previous year. In the interests of strengthening market forces, lasting fiscal consolidation is now more urgent than it was a year ago.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Although I agree with most of the Commission’s analysis, I cannot support it, mainly for two reasons.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Firstly, what I find to be missing is an analysis of the implications of the austerity measures on people’s welfare. Nor is there any pressure for reform of the labour market with a focus on young people and youth unemployment. This is not only lacking in Slovenia’s assessment, but also in most other assessments.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I call on the Commission to include as soon as possible the issue of youth unemployment, as one of the sub-objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, in the European Semester.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Secondly, as a member of this Parliament, I have virtually no impact on the European Semester process, which is currently used to put pressure on Member States and impose long-term policy prescriptions that clearly violate the subsidiarity principle.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We need to open up a political debate on the Commission’s prescriptions; we need to improve the democratic legitimacy of the European Semester and we need to narrow the gap between the European Parliament’s voice and that of the Commission or the Council with an interinstitutional agreement.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Semester will be the time of the year when the European Commission makes country-specific recommendations on the development of economic and budgetary policy. I consider it an extraordinarily positive development that we are moving rapidly from the general macro-level towards country-specific recommendations and also towards criticism.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, I believe that we also need to be careful. The debate we have just had, which Mr Obermayr considered rather country-specific, was, in fact, always in danger of meddling in things that had nothing to do with the European Semester. That is why I believe that we must be careful not to engage at this point in general criticism of specific countries or specific establishments in countries but to quite specifically address issues of economic, budgetary and financial policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also believe that a second point needs to be made. The implementation of what we have achieved in the European internal market acquis is absolutely crucial and relevant for development in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner Rehn, we are going to hold the next debate on this issue straight away. Would it not be helpful, in the context of this assessment of the individual countries through the country-specific recommendations, to raise the issue of the implementation of internal market legislation? Without wishing to give the wrong impression – many other countries are involved, including Germany – I would like to say that Bulgaria, which has just been mentioned, though judged a model pupil on economic issues through the European Semester, needs to catch up, for example, in the implementation of the internal market acquis. However, Europe can only succeed if we take issues of budgetary policy, financial policy, economic policy and internal market legislation together. I would therefore strongly suggest that we investigate the inclusion of issues relating to the implementation of internal market legislation in the assessment of countries in the context of the country-specific recommendations.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has three agendas before it today: the growth agenda, the bank oversight agenda and the sovereign debt management agenda. Dealing with the European Semester involves including all three of these aspects.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the growth issue, I think it is important to stress now that the Commission recommendations cannot just apply to countries with deficits: they must also apply to countries with surpluses too and, if some countries have to squeeze their domestic demand, the others have to free it up.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I also think that, in growth terms, it is essential that the Commission monitor the recommendations of the so-called troika because, when a country enters recession, it cannot carry on squeezing its public investment, its public spending, as if nothing had happened. The troika must revise and adjust its measures in line with results. I want to tell you, Commissioner, that we in Parliament have today agreed on the need to launch immediately an instrument for growth and for anti-cyclical activity to the value of 1% of the European Union’s GDP over 10 years. The second key issue is what is now being called banking union. We in Parliament called for this to be done two years ago in a June 2010 report, but it has yet to be realised. The third issue is that of sovereign debt, which is a precondition for stability in Europe. I also want to say that we have adopted the ‘two-pack’ here today but that we incorporated into it, in addition to austerity, something of the other aspect that has been missing, and that is the immediate setting up of a redemption fund – to use a German term – so that sovereign debt exceeding 60% can be jointly managed. This is a legislative text and we are awaiting the Commission’s support for this initiative by Parliament, so that we can bring under control this horribly threatening spiral that is currently destroying the European Union.</p>

Differences since the launch of the euro and the general functioning of the financial system have drawn attention, in particular, to the fact that we must address the macro-economic imbalances better and more effectively. It is essential that we carry out better budgetary surveillance. We need better economic governance based on greater responsibility for the rules and procedures that we have agreed together. It is equally important to tighten the control of national economic policies at EU level. The current stage of the crisis requires resolute and courageous responses. Member States must, at long last, consider their economic and fiscal policies to be a matter of our common, European interest. All our experience to date clearly shows that we urgently need to coordinate the introduction and implementation of fiscal measures better and, in particular – I want to stress this, Commissioner – to fight tax fraud and evasion more effectively.

In relation to Portugal, for example, the Commission has just advocated wage cuts, plain and simple; in a country that already has some of the lowest wages in Europe; in a country in which millions of workers have become impoverished despite having a job and many others are becoming impoverished every day; in a country in which many have been dragged into the most extreme poverty. It also advocated cutting unemployment benefit, in a country where unemployment has hit historic levels because of the policies imposed by the European Union and the IMF; in a country where long-term unemployment has increased.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, honourable Members, I wish to thank you for your input and for this very serious debate, which reflects the serious economic situation that we in Europe find ourselves in at present.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Unfortunately, there is insufficient time to reply to all the questions and comments that are so well justified in themselves, and which you have asked or made in connection with this debate. This is especially the case since, after me, there will be an opportunity for Commissioners Andor and Šemeta to speak on matters that concern them directly. However, this is also a reflection of the fact that we have every reason to continue this dialogue on economic policy, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for example. On the other hand, I am, of course, ready at any time to return to this House or to this plenary Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Two central questions that were mentioned in this debate were, firstly, that ownership in the Member States is a key issue for the success of this new coordination of economic policy, as, for example, Ms Wortmann-Kool and Mr Hughes pointed out, and, from this point of view, it is worth remembering that the new approach to economic governance and policy coordination has been unanimously adopted by the 27 Member States and the European Parliament. This is a very democratic way of proceeding, as all the Member States and Parliament have together decided and agreed on how the Union’s economic governance should be strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Commission’s role in this new system will be to make recommendations on the basis of an economic analysis, and to consider how the Member States need to develop their own economic and financial policies, from the perspective of sustainable growth, competitiveness and employment. This is the approach that we have taken, and it is worth remembering that, within the context of this new system of economic governance, there is an important act, which emphasises the importance of the economic policy dialogue: as a general rule, the Council will be expected to follow and comply with the Commission’s recommendations. If not, the Council will have to explain why it is deviating from the Commission’s recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This also means the end of the usual political dithering or political trade-offs in the Council, which once led to the erosion of the Stability and Growth Pact, thanks to horse-trading by Germany and France, which Italy, as the country holding the Presidency, supported. That time has now passed and now, by virtue of the reverse qualified majority procedure established with your support, we are in a much better position to ensure that Member States either follow recommendations or have to explain why not, or be otherwise liable for the consequences. In other words, this provides a much stronger European perspective for issues where we need the European point of view because there is so much interdependence among the Member States and the consequences of economic policy, especially bad economic policy, are felt everywhere else in the European Union, particularly within the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The other central issue has been to examine the imbalances in the overall economy from the point of view of growth, a subject on which Mr De Backer and Mr Giegold emphatically focused attention. In this connection, I would like to point out that, in our recommendations, we have looked at the European Union as a whole and considered how we can best strengthen the basis for growth through measures taken in countries with either a deficit or a surplus, and, indeed, Europe is now witnessing a very difficult but much needed attempt to balance the books. In countries with a deficit, there is a need to achieve a surplus in the economy, so that they can bring their indebtedness under control and on a downward path. This will inevitably mean that competitiveness will have to strengthen and that levels of employment will have to improve. On the other hand, those countries showing a surplus will also need to make their contribution to the general effort, and, in this respect, it is important that they introduce structural reforms to strengthen domestic demand, thereby providing support for a boost to the European economy generally.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Mr President, honourable Members, I wish to thank you for a very professional and serious debate. I want to continue it with you, but now I give the floor to Mr Šemeta and Mr Andor.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, because of time pressure, let me respond in a nutshell to my portfolio issues – or rather, I should say, three little nutshells, one of them about the very charming German dialogue which emerged at a certain point in the Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, we believe that on quite a few issues in employment and social affairs, Germany offers very good models and very good practices. Let me just highlight the importance of dual training and the resulting low level of youth unemployment, and the intensity and quality of the social dialogue, which should also be seen as a model for others. It is true that on some other issues which we highlighted in the document, like rising in-work poverty and the so-called ‘mini jobs’ which threaten the segmentation of the labour market, while this is obviously not yet such a serious issue as in some southern countries, it is an emerging problem with implications for others as well. That is why we believe it is very important to reverse this and act against it. There is also a need to act more forcefully on the gender dimension for creating equal opportunities in the labour market for women.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another small nutshell, on pensions. There was a reference to developments in France after the elections. I believe that in some Member States, including France and Italy, very important pension reforms have been designed and implemented, and it is very important to consolidate these reforms. However, we do not judge these developments from the headlines of either the tabloids or the political press, and I need to find out the real implications of the proposed new developments that came out of France. It is about fine-tuning in order to consolidate a reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe I will have an opportunity to discuss this with the Ministers as early as next week in the EPSCO Council and to see what the real magnitude and implication is of the otherwise very impressive slogans that emerged and probably played a role in recent weeks in the political discussion in France.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third point I would like to make is that the country-specific recommendations, together with the entire semester, cover a wide range of issues, but they do not cover everything, and many issues including, for example, youth unemployment, cannot be fully covered. We put great emphasis on youth unemployment in the semester and in the country-specific recommendations where this is relevant, but we are taking many actions which are not covered here. They take place outside, and include the very significant reallocation of the ESF or Structural Fund resources. This is, of course, something to which one should pay attention and not just assume that because it is not highlighted again and again in every single document, it will not make an impact.</p>
      <p sl="en">Similarly, about public investment and other forms of investment in physical, but also in human capital: there are certainly references in this document, but I believe it would be very relevant to link the comments we have heard to the discussion on the next MFF, because these need to be long-term commitments and are part of the long-term structural development of the financial architecture of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as some honourable Members have rightly pointed out, this year’s European Semester puts a special emphasis on tax issues. This is fully justified at a time when the road towards a stronger fiscal union would mean, as President Barroso explained this morning, more coordination on taxation policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">At a time when the consolidation efforts of our Member States go well beyond expenditure, it is important to remember that some ways of increasing revenues are less distortive than others and more pro-growth. Our recommendations in the field of taxation, which go out to all Member States except Finland and Slovenia, are focused largely on five areas which are fundamental to quality tax systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">What do we recommend? First, we recommend tax shifts from labour taxation towards more growth-friendly taxation. This recommendation was given to eleven Member States. We also consider that some Member States could put more emphasis on green taxation and make their taxation systems greener. Green taxation is much less harmful to growth than taxes on labour.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also recommend to some Member States that they broaden their tax bases and also reduce their debt barriers in corporate and housing taxation. It is very important to take this into account because in some Member States, these taxation barriers actually caused high corporate and household indebtedness, which was one of the causes of the current crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we recommend our Member States to improve their tax governance, particularly by intensifying their fight against tax fraud and tax evasion. We are currently preparing the proposals which will be submitted to the European Council at the end of this month regarding how we could better address the issue of tax fraud and tax evasion.</p>
      <p sl="en">A few more urgent actions are needed at EU level to contribute to the growth and jobs agenda. The first of these is an agreement on the savings directive and a mandate to negotiate with the Swiss. I hope that the European Council at the end of this month will give finance ministers strong guidelines and ambitious timing targets towards an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then we have to push for progress on FTT and on ETD, which are both on the agenda of next week’s Council meeting. A lot of technical work has been done and it is now up to the Member States, after this Parliament expressed its support, to accept their responsibility and prove that tax coordination can progress.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, good afternoon to you all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a critical point in European integration: there will be an important European Council meeting in a few days, and there is the choice that the Greek people will make on Sunday … However, I certainly do not believe that this should be a time for pessimism or alarmism. It should be a time to be proactive, responsible and determined. The world is watching us and waiting to see what we do. That became apparent to me again, recently, on the other side of the Atlantic, in Canada and in the United States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should remind this world that is watching us and waiting to see what we do that not all of the world’s problems come from Europe. We should remember that the financial crisis was not born in Europe. It was born very much in the United States with all the consequences that continue to affect us. We must say to this world that is watching us: ‘You can be demanding, impatient, critical of Europe, but be fair and equitable. Be realistic and look at what we have been doing for the last two or three years to learn the lessons from these crises and to restore order to the economic, budgetary and political functioning of the European Union’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Undoubtedly, the time has come, ladies and gentlemen, to state our confidence, as I am doing to you, in our institutions and in our capacity to take the right decisions and to implement them, our confidence also in the capacity of Greece and the Greek people to retain their place and their role in the euro area and in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One thing is certain and it is that we will not get out of these crises by the same route we went in. We are tackling this crisis of confidence, of the markets and, first and foremost, of our citizens, and we must assert our strategy for exiting the crisis and open up new prospects, in the short and in the medium term, for economic and political integration within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What are the problems and what do we need?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We now know that there can be no single currency without solidarity and without joint economic discipline. That is why we need renewed economic and monetary union. We have made progress. Mr Rehn has won the support and the commitment of the European Parliament</p>
      <p sl="fr">We know that the financial crisis and the vulnerability of the banks are at the root of the States’ budgetary problems and the euro crisis. That is why we need to go further and, in particular, construct the banking union mentioned by President Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Whether we are talking about supervision, the single rulebook, or resolution, we must go further than what has been proposed over recent months or what has been proposed just now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Member States will have to be proactive, consistent and ready to make an effort and choose truly European solutions. I am thinking, in particular, of the issue of deposit guarantees, which is currently being held up at second reading, due no doubt to a lack of ambition on the part of Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We now finally know that Europe must be built with its people, and not without them, with the true democratic legitimacy that you represent. That is why, further down the road, there must be strengthened political union, as Chancellor Merkel was saying recently.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, today we are talking about the future of the internal market, which has been, for the last 60 years, the first stage, the first basis for European political integration. The role of the Commission is indeed to propose working for the Union as a whole, the EU 27, on the basis of the Community method, with only one single market including the financial services. This EU27, soon to be 28, is, might I remind you, our foremost asset in working towards recovering growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All current and future reforms are more likely to succeed if the big single market functions better. Neither Parliament nor the Commission has been surprised by all that has been said in this debate on growth over the past few weeks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For two years, we, the Commission and Parliament, have worked together to put this strategy back on track with Europe 2020, the Monti report and then the reports by your fellow Members, Mr Grech, Ms Kalniete, Mr Correia de Campos and Mr Buşoi. Thanks to all these combined efforts, I was able to submit to you, on 13 April 2011, the Single Market Act, with a view to adding this potential for growth and confidence beyond the consolidation of public finances, to reconstructing the bases for growth from a better functioning of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We had worked well together. The Commission finally produced the 12 priority measures of the Single Market Act, which are now in the legislative pipeline and we have even managed to come to an agreement between Parliament and the Council on one of them, namely, standardisation. I hope that, in a few days, we will come to an agreement on a second of the 12 key measures, this time relating to the European patent. European companies have been waiting for this for 30 years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What more should we do, ladies and gentlemen, as we have not yet achieved this return to growth? First, make what we have already decided within the framework of the internal market function properly. I shall call this the ‘quick wins’, a new growth in services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall not go into detail about the importance of the service economy here on our European continent but services do account for 65% of GDP and 70% of total employment. They have been behind the creation of almost 11 million jobs over the last 10 years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If there are positive results from the transposition of the Services Directive, we shall have to go further given the importance of this text for the daily functioning of our internal market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We, in the Commission, believe that we could find between + 0.8% and + 2.6% growth in the internal market if the Services Directive reached its full potential. That is precisely the objective of this partnership for new growth in services, which the Commission adopted some days ago.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First, a more ambitious implementation of this directive, a peer review, through country-specific recommendations in the context of the European Semester that you have just mentioned and by adopting a stricter and more proactive policy towards breaches with the objective of zero tolerance of clear breaches of the Services Directive. Then there is the improvement of a tool that you support, as do I, that of points of single contact. That is the first act of this partnership.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, better functioning on the ground of the single services market. How do we achieve this? By optimising synergies between the different instruments of the internal market: directives on services, professional qualifications and e-commerce.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have carried out ‘performance tests’, as I already mentioned, to see how, in three sectors – construction, business services, which is recruiting at the moment, and tourism – the freedom to provide services could interact better with professional mobility, benefits and opportunities in e-commerce.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we are seeking to guarantee the benefits of the Consumer Rights Directive by combating any discrimination that affects the end users of the services on account of their nationality and/or their place of residence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, this is why I believe that we must be more ambitious and go beyond the Services Directive and the service economy. That is also the objective of this very practical text on the governance of the internal market, adopted by the Commission some days ago. This is not a technocratic concern. You can take my word for it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Not only is legislation which is not implemented useless, it often adversely affects the functioning of the internal market. It harms the principle of competition within the Union, it creates imbalances between countries, and it also deprives the citizens of their rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we want to ensure the proper implementation of all the single market texts. It is a subject on which you have worked a great deal, particularly Ms Kalniete, Mr Busuttil and Ms Bastos.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission, therefore, has just adopted this communication for new and better governance by calling on the Member States, Parliament, the Council, the Commission and our own services to show that we can be more effective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We shall adopt three lines of approach in our work: firstly, targeted action in those sectors with strong growth potential, obviously the services and financial services of which I have just spoken, but also network industries: transport, energy, the digital market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have identified key legislative measures for each of these sectors, and the Commission, with the Member States, is committed to redoubling its efforts to ensure that they are properly, quickly and correctly implemented, for example, with increased assistance for transposition and the use of peer review.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We want to see quick results in these sectors, and we shall apply the zero tolerance principle in the event of any delays in the transposition of our legislation. If problems persist, we shall then deal with these breaches with the utmost speed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second line of approach is to evaluate and monitor the scope of our efforts using the mechanism of the European Semester, spoken of by Mr Rehn. I do not think that this semester should only cover economic governance or budgetary surveillance. I think that, over the same financial year, it should cover efforts towards cohesion and competitiveness. We could then measure the performances of the Member States by means of benchmarks and naming and shaming, and where there are shortcomings, we will provide complementary measures and country-specific recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third and last line of approach, Mr President, is a single market at the service of companies and citizens: better regulation, better use of IT tools, the ‘Your Europe’ portal, better functioning of SOLVIT and, finally, promotion of single market centres in each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall now say a few concluding words on a subject that will involve us over the coming weeks – and I know that Mr Harbour, whom I thank, is very committed to it – which is the second stage of the Single Market Act, which we are drawing up for the end of the summer. The 20th anniversary of this single market should not be an occasion for nostalgia or melancholy, as I often say it is, but an opportunity to be proactive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are going to retain all the advantages of the initial version of the Single Market Act, the competitive social market economy. These four words are important. They are clearly reflected in the 12 levers of growth that we have chosen together. Twelve new proposals that will drive growth and employment, that will deal, in particular, with sectors where the single market does not operate correctly or completely – energy, transport, services – and which, finally, will ensure the social and territorial cohesion of which I have just spoken.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That, ladies and gentlemen, is what we are going to work on and we should be careful to be clear about what we have already decided together and then also to open up public debate, as we shall do on the occasion of the Single Market - Together for New Growth week, which we shall organise together from 15 to 22 October.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I welcome the fact that, with this joint motion for a resolution of all groups in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we have succeeded in putting together a common position of the European Parliament for the forthcoming proposals for the Single Market Act II. I believe that the fundamental issues which, for us as the European Parliament, will be at the heart of the consultation on the various legislative proposals in connection with the Single Market Act II in the coming weeks, have been incorporated into this document with all the necessary consistency and clarity.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that the motion for a resolution also demonstrates that, although the internal market has been part of Europe for quite some time, it continues to have great potential and also growth potential for the European economies – up to 4% for 10 years according to the Commission. That is why I believe it is important that the European Commission makes it clear that the time for talking about the implementation of internal market legislation is over and that it is now time for action. It is important that the European Commission keeps on reminding all those Member States – I think one can safely say almost all of them – emphatically and repeatedly of their obligations and, if these obligations are not complied with, takes legal proceedings against those Member States by all possible means. The Member States contribute to the legislation through the European Council of Ministers. There are therefore no excuses for not implementing internal market legislation correctly and quickly.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I was somewhat surprised when, this morning, the President of the Commission proposed that we conclude an interinstitutional agreement for the implementation of priority areas. I doubt that we need an additional agreement for the internal market. For this area, we chiefly need a European Commission that implements what the Member States have promised. Mr President, I believe that, to achieve this, we need a horizontal strategy, and the Commission has already started along this road with the first Single Market Act. I believe that we need good, credible impact assessments, we need to focus on priority areas and, Mr President, Commissioner, we need real control over implementation through improved single market governance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, on the 20th anniversary of the internal market, the issue of the internal market really deserves the attention we are giving it today. It is one of our great achievements that we can move freely in the European Union, that we can sell our goods throughout Europe, that we have a high degree of product safety, and that we can bring citizens together here in this House, and it is a delight that we are working on it.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore important, Mr Barnier, that you continue on the path you have embarked upon so as to ensure, together with us, that the positive aspects of the internal market are brought closer to citizens and that they recognise what they have gained from the European internal market. That is something that is missing, that citizens do not recognise, because we talk too much about problems and not enough about the achievements of the European Union. It is therefore also important that we concentrate more on what we have enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is that we want to have and also need a social market economy – and I place particular emphasis on the word ‘social’ – so that workers and consumers recognise themselves in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to praise what Louis Grech highlighted in his report by adopting an holistic approach, which we need so that we can really see the internal market as a global concept and not as disconnected small actions that run alongside each other, and with which a philosophy of Europe is truly associated. It is really important to work on this together and we should continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="de">The internal market is good, but there is one thing we should not forget: it must be structured for the benefit of citizens and not just for the benefit of enterprises and the financial world.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, as far as the future of the single market is concerned, I hope that we will have a market that is less non-committal, more disciplined and one with fewer differences in terms of political culture. Many of you have confirmed this. If you have a debt, there are two things that are important. First, not spending more than you are earning and, second, looking for opportunities to earn more and generate income. The single market can help us with the latter.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We must ensure a functioning single market and, to do that, we need courage and audacity. We need fewer stifling rules and a better functioning market in all Member States, on equal terms and with greater uniformity. Experience teaches us that the transposition of directives creates variation within the single market, as a result of which it is a lot more difficult to get a single market to work, especially for the benefit of SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have been arguing for years that we should base our single market legislation on regulations that would have the same effect in all Member States. I have not yet succeeded in that, but I ask you again to make sure that we base legislation for the improved functioning of our European economy on regulations which Member States will no longer be able to transpose in a protectionist fashion, which is indeed the very reason why a transnational economy is not functioning in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The single market must again become an example for the global economy: a market where money is earned, where social security is guaranteed and a market that will address many aspects that ensure prosperity and political stability. We need to ensure, Mr President, that we achieve a single market where entrepreneurs will again feel at home instead of fleeing Europe due to stifling rules and a market where European citizens will again be proud to buy European products.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I see that I still have ten seconds, so I will briefly mention ACTA. ACTA is dead because we have not given enough information to our citizens. However, our own European products are being counterfeited to the tune of EUR 1 billion. We have to ensure that entrepreneurs, and European workers too, feel at home again in the single market.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the end of the year will mark the 20th anniversary of establishing the single market, the objective of which was to strengthen the ties between citizens and Member States. We have seen numerous benefits and new opportunities over this period, thanks to the legal measures which have been successively introduced to improve the way the single market works. The single market has proved to be particularly helpful during the last few years, when we have been fighting the crisis. The free flow of capital, goods and services and, above all, of people, has contributed significantly to improving the situation of the citizens in many of the Member States. Unfortunately, because of administrative and legislative problems, we still are not able to make full use of this tool’s potential. So I welcome the Commission’s assurance that it will continue to view the Single Market Act as one of its most important strategic political priorities, because all measures intended to support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises help stimulate economic growth, which, in turn, brings tangible benefits to European consumers. For there are still a great many hindrances to the operation of these businesses.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Worthy of note is the proposal to improve the function of the single market by means of IT tools which will make it much easier for the citizens to solve problems. Completing the single digital market this year is highly desirable. This also involves the call for the Member States to reduce administrative burdens by an additional 25% over three years and to modernise their public administrations. Full use should also be made of the current opportunities afforded by the Internet, such as online trade and services.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Action to improve the way the services sector works, by rapid and efficient implementation of the Services Directive, is of fundamental importance. The directive does, after all, concern services which generate as much as 45% of the EU’s GDP, and it helps create a steady increase in the number of these services. It is therefore a powerful weapon both in the fight against the crisis and for promoting the systematic economic growth of the Union. A particularly urgent matter here will be the elimination of legislation which creates discrimination, on the grounds of nationality, for example, and which still exists in some Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I understand that our good colleague, Mr Malcolm Harbour, has been very much engaged in this work on the single market. We should certainly thank him for his efforts, but he falls into an error common amongst British Conservatives. Challenged to find even one good thing to say about the European Union, most British Conservatives will cite the single market. They seem to believe that it is a free trade area and they think that free trade is a good thing. But it is not a free trade area. It is a customs union and it is a bureaucratic nightmare of regulation and red tape. Years ago, Commissioner Verheugen estimated that the cost of EU regulation was around 6% of European GDP. Since then, it has got worse and this proposal today adds more burdens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I come to the House today with good news. It is possible to create growth and jobs and prosperity and investment and recovery in Europe but, to do so, we will need to do four things. First of all, we must cut taxes, secondly, we must have a bonfire of the regulations, thirdly, we must dismantle the reckless and failing experiment of monetary union and, finally, we must adopt a rational energy policy and abandon our lunatic obsession with the myth of global warming. I fear that we will do none of these things and we will condemn Europe to a third-world future of decline, poverty and unemployment.</p>

      <p sl="en">I want to ask him to pick up two points: first of all, would he confirm that the antique data he uses, attributed to Mr Verheugen, was actually the total burden of all regulation on European industry, not just EU legislation but the whole of the national Member States’ legislation? I am sure he will find that is true and it would be good if he would stop using that figure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, I thank my colleagues for these interesting questions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the case of ex-Commissioner Verheugen – and I accept, Mr Schwab, that he is no longer a Commissioner but frequently in the European institutions, people retain the title of President or Commissioner after they have finished exercising their duty – he quoted a figure of 6%. Former Commissioner Mandelson quoted a figure for the benefits of trade in the single market at 1.8%.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, Mr Harbour, it is nearly 45 years since I left university but I can still work out that 6% is a great deal more than 1.8%. Thank you very much indeed for that. My answer would be that the single market is indeed a customs union, it is a Zollverein and it has an external barrier. You will recall that all the economic studies that have been done show that free trade areas are generally much more efficient than customs unions. If you wish to point out that it is, in fact, a customs union with the addition of massive and excessive regulation, I will be the last to disagree with you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this act purports, via a package of measures, to boost assistance for small and medium businesses yet I fear, once again, it is nothing more than comforting words to give the appearance of action. The reality is that the European Union is part of the problem, not the solution. Europhiles like Malcolm Harbour tell us that Britain’s future depends on membership of the European Union, that more than half of our trade is with the EU. These are disingenuous arguments. Eighty percent of UK trade is internal, with 50% of the rest being with the EU. That is only 10% of UK trade, for which we have had a deficit since the early 1970s. Yet the EU and its bureaucratic rules and regulations are draining the life out of small and medium enterprises. No wonder the Federation of Small Businesses said to prospective MEPs in the 2009 European election guide, please, no more EU regulations. Malcolm Harbour attended a dinner, as I did.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Barnier, there are 4.5 million small businesses in the UK that account for 99% of all enterprise. That is almost 60% of private sector employment and almost 50% of private sector turnover. SMEs employ an estimated 13.8 million people and have an estimated combined annual turnover of GBP 1 500 billion. The EU has constantly negatively impacted on their ability to service the majority of their contracts, whilst making it easier for other EU countries to trade in the UK. No wonder eight out of ten people want a referendum on Britain’s membership of this corrupt and doomed mess.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, to achieve economic growth, we need a single market which works well, and for that it is essential to have the right legal environment. In many cases, we do have the legal instruments, but full use cannot be made of them because they are not being implemented by the Member States. An example of this is the Services Directive, which applies to services that account for 75% of the Union’s GDP. It’s potential is enormous. I think it is very important that the draft resolution refers to the transposition deficit, because I consider this to be the main problem when it comes to the incomplete functioning of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is important that the European Commission has been working on this, and last week it adopted a package concerning implementation of the Services Directive, noting that over the next five to 10 years, implementation of the directive will generate an additional amount in the region of 1% of the GDP of the entire EU, and if the Member States are more committed to the process of transposition, this will rise to as much as 2.5% of GDP. The Member States must therefore be ambitious in their approach concerning implementation of the directive, but must also concentrate on identifying areas where progress could still be made. This means, for example, that they should make sure no prohibited requirements are, in fact, being applied and, where possible, should remove requirements which are subject to evaluation. I have referred to transposition of the Services Directive, but this also concerns other areas, such as public procurement, for example, on which we are currently working. I welcome the fact that Parliament has taken up this matter in the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Europe is at a crossroads. This resolution is a call for economic growth, but, in my opinion, it is also an indication of the frustration which Parliament – and perhaps also the Commission – is experiencing vis-à-vis the effective completion of the single market. It would be deeply sad if, in the fifth year of this legislature, we were to find ourselves churning out yet another resolution on the single market and debating the same problems that were identified in the first year, amongst others, the fragmentation and inadequate application of rules; lack of proper transposition and information; potential of the digital market; the Citizens’ Charter and the lack of resolution on the top 20 concerns; services and professional qualifications, directives, consumer redress and SMEs’ incentives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once again, we are discussing the potential of the single market, but citizens are tired of rhetoric and instead want to see the realisation of this potential because the single market is very vital for the European Union. Otherwise, for citizens, unless there is this realisation, this will become nothing more than a meaningless, tired buzzword. Time is running short and the continued unity and integration of the market are being seriously threatened. We are already feeling, unfortunately, the effects of protectionism in various ways.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is high time the Council came up with more coordinated, urgent specific solutions and decisions concerning the crisis created, after all, by the irresponsible behaviour of some banks. This Parliament and the Commission – especially Commissioner Barnier – have been making specific proposals and initiatives, yet we seem to move very slowly. Citizens cannot go on being disillusioned at one summit after another.</p>
      <p sl="en">The relaunch of the economy and the single market will need the continued impetus and input and hopefully the leadership of the Commission, and the committed ownership by the Member States. However, and most importantly, it must be a market which is credible, well understood and trusted by citizens, providing Europeans with a realistic and holistic action growth plan in order to achieve a truly competitive, inclusive and social economy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, 20 years of the internal market are indeed a reason to look back on this track record. It is exactly as Ms Gebhardt said: the internal market has brought the European idea, the European philosophy, to the fore, there is no doubt about that.</p>
      <p sl="de">It goes without saying that, externally, the internal market is seen as a success. However, if we look inside the European internal market, we will discover that some have benefited more than others. Germany has a very healthy balance sheet. The German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau has calculated that, in Germany alone, the internal market effect represents an annual amount of EUR 30 billion in relation to the euro. On the other hand, we see that productivity in the peripheral countries is declining. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us take the Single Market Act II and these 20 years of the internal market as an opportunity to consider how we can get to grips with this imbalanced development, these current account differences, within the European Union. If we do not succeed in this, unless everyone sees an advantage in the internal market, the internal market will lose credibility and legitimacy in the long term.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I warmly welcome this very strong package of measures from the Commission, in particular, because, as I think all my colleagues on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have said, much of it reflects what we have been saying and promoting through our work over the last two and a half or three years.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to thank everybody on the committee for their deep engagement and knowledge about this subject. I think the resolution that we produced in response to this and marking out the road for the next phase of the Single Market Act is really important, and I hope the House will pass that with a very substantial majority tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the key aspect of the package that we have in front of us today is that it is a very realistic and practical approach. I quote from what you said, Commissioner, in your governance proposal: ‘we have to make what we have work better’. This is not about bold new legislative solutions and, as a number of my colleagues have said, we have had enough of those. We need to get down to delivering the benefits of what we have already worked on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of us here, particularly Ms Gebhardt, myself and Mr Schwab, worked on the Services Directive. We have been worried that it has not been transposed quickly enough, and we are pleased now that you are now going to put some real pressure on the Member States to ensure that those rights are properly delivered. That is not just about business; it is about consumers, as a number of you have said.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, perhaps the most scandalous aspect of the Single Market at the moment is that, when citizens use the online tools they have on the Internet, they cannot actually buy services cross-border. They cannot buy goods cross-border in many cases because they are refused access to other websites and, in some cases, they are even offered different prices for the same service, depending on where they are making their enquiry. These things are absolutely unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I will just close with this point. You said quite rightly, Commissioner, that the whole single market package must be subject to the deepest level of so-called smarter regulation – better policy making. This is not just true for the Single Market; it is true for everything we are doing in this House.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market may well benefit certain sectors and categories, but I would think very carefully before using the triumphalist tone that we find in this resolution. On the one hand, there may be some opportunities; on the other, though, we need to act with great care and caution, for different countries have their own particular circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="it">For example, the goods and services sector is cited as having great growth potential; the implementation of the famous directive on that subject is also mentioned. I wonder how jeopardising hundreds of very small enterprises, from seaside traders to street vendors, can be thought of as ‘development’. The only likely beneficiary is big business, which finds it easier to exploit the so-called benefits of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="it">We, therefore, are against an internal market that entails the erosion of our strengths and our special characteristic features. We do not feel that it is necessary or even useful to conform to the myth of a single European model.</p>

The Soviet Union came to this painful realisation after resolving on economic growth at every party conference. This resolution has exactly the same placebo quality.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are currently running the risk of losing the credibility of the internal market in the eyes of Europe’s citizens. Nothing makes the failure of EU policy, including in the area of the internal market, quite so clear as the scandalously high unemployment figures. Which citizens have profited from this internal market? Those that have to fight harder every day to keep their jobs, the ever growing number of people who have to do two jobs in order even to survive? This resolution provides no answers in this respect. We are at risk of losing the positive aspects of the internal market because we have no answer to the unemployment that is rising daily, particularly among young people. Unemployment rates of over 50% are scandalous and demonstrate clearly the failure of your internal market policy and your monetary policy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, not only must we enact good legislation, we must also listen carefully to the citizens. I am thinking, for example, of the Single Market Forum held in Kraków, at which the participants adopted the Kraków Declaration. We have achieved a great deal since then, and a great deal has happened in areas about which both citizens and business people made known their expectations, such as public procurements and the recognition of professional qualifications – the Commission’s proposals on recognition are already being worked on in Parliament. We are currently also working on the out-of-court settlement of complaints brought by consumers about purchases made online. Work on roaming, which was also one of the main problems – particularly for young people – has been completed successfully, and many other examples could be mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We face challenges – very serious challenges – such as postal services, for example. There is no rational reason why cross-border postal services are still so extremely expensive. They are a hindrance to the development of electronic trade, which means they are slowing the growth of the European economy. Communication with the citizens is a total failure, and it is essential that we improve the way public consultations are conducted – no progress has been made on this for years. We have now reached 20 years of the single market, and we are holding a Single Market Week. I hope this will prove to be a good opportunity and that good use will be made of it to listen to the citizens and to set, in partnership with them, the priorities of our work.

This is because any growth pact will have to take into account the sacrifices and social benefits linked to it.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to mention two examples that annoy millions of car drivers daily because the internal market has not been realised in this respect. The first example concerns what drivers are obliged to carry with them. We have open borders and we drive our cars across all the countries of the European Union, but we find that all the countries have widely differing requirements as to what we must carry with us. In some countries, you have to carry a set of spare bulbs, in others a high-visibility jacket, in a third country perhaps mud flaps or a respiratory mask, and now breathalysers too. Failure to comply with these obligations has severe penalties. It is time this was harmonised, and I would ask you, Commissioner, to take the initiative for standardisation in this area; I would also ask you to immediately restrict it to a high-visibility jacket, a warning triangle and a first aid kit. That ought to be enough.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second example concerns the registration of motor vehicles that have already been registered in one country and are then transferred to another country. The motorist finds that he has to go through the whole registration procedure again. That means a whole load of bureaucracy and annoyance, and a whole load of new costs. I call on you to implement swiftly the regulation that has already been sent out, so that in future, once a vehicle has been registered once, it is registered throughout the whole of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">You will recall, Commissioner, that for more than two years now, both the Commission and the European Parliament have been working to identify the missing links of the internal market, to identify the issues and the sectors for which more internal market is needed, more internal market for more growth, more competitiveness and more jobs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For its part, the European Council has, also belatedly, finally stated the importance it ascribes to the rapid and efficient implementation of 12 priority proposals for the internal market, the 12 levers for growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Rather than seeking to constantly invent new tools for growth, we would be wise to work with the toolbox that we already have. Thus, we shall seize the opportunity of the resolution, which will be put to the vote in Parliament tomorrow, to send a strong political message to the Member States: faster and more efficient transposition of directives that have already been adopted, more mobilisation and commitment to the newly opened issues – to name but one, the strengthening of the movement of workers – more fluidity of circulation.</p>

What you often refer to – coordination and collective vision – is one such condition. If, in the meantime, however, serious events occur, such as changes to the legal basis for the Schengen measures, then clearly not only is this a political error but it also damages the internal market, by reducing opportunities for free movement.</p>
      <p sl="it">When objectives are set – and I am thinking mainly in terms of growth, which is our primary concern at present – they also need to be qualified. Not any old growth, then, but sustainable and lasting growth. Together, when discussing the development of the economies of the Union and the individual countries, we must safeguard rights: producers’ rights, employment rights, the rights of those who work and hold capital, and citizenship rights, which are also consumers’ rights.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that one of the greatest advantages of the existence of the European Union is the existence of the single market. It is one of few factors which are acting to stimulate the European economy. Since the European Commission says the main factor harming the economy is the weak and late transposition and incorrect implementation and application of EU standards concerning the single market, we are right to ask about the present attitude of the Member States and the destructive effect of what they are doing. We are increasingly seeing a return to national rhetoric and to blaming others for our economic problems. It has to be asked if this is a good route to take?</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, it is not. The recipe for the current crisis is more Europe, not less Europe. Lifting existing barriers to the European market is certain to help stimulate our economy. To achieve this, the will of the Member States is needed. Instead of this, we are increasingly hearing things being said about social dumping, people who are taking away our jobs and the need to limit the free flow of people and goods. We have to ask where this will end? In view of changes in the world economy, a return to closed national economies will definitely not help improve the situation – quite the opposite. The Commission, therefore, should monitor all violations of the single market’s rules, but should also continue to put forward new measures which will facilitate the Member States’ implementation of existing legislation.</p>

It was rightly said that today’s situation in the single market is very beneficial for some Member States due to certain restrictions, while for other Member States it is really damaging. I truly support and welcome your idea that common rules need to be established in the single market as a matter of urgency. As for the second issue, namely, the introduction of public procurement, I would propose introducing public procurement as quickly as possible so that it is possible to strengthen competitive conditions in our domestic single market, and to also use European Union money more effectively. The other issue is that we have to begin to think about defending the single market from third countries, particularly those that do not allow our individual companies to compete on a level playing field in their countries, because we are thus reducing the number of jobs in our own countries and reducing people’s incomes.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, the natural dynamic of free competition within the single market accentuates its divergence. Once placed in direct competition, economies with very different development levels inevitably diverge, unless there are mechanisms for protecting and safeguarding the weaker economies. The stronger economies are increasingly dominating the weaker ones: that has been the story of this integration process. Take a serious look at this and you will see some of the true causes of several peripheral countries’ debt levels. Now they want to deepen the single market and they want to do so by simultaneously cutting the EU budget and cohesion funding – the very instrument that could help to overcome some of the existing inequalities – because of pressure from the very countries benefiting most from the single market. There can only be one outcome: more divergence and more inequality between Member States; in other words, cohesion will increasingly and solely be a dead letter in the Treaties.</p>

In view of the enduring stagnation, however, I think that we should vigorously continue to implement certain administrative measures that would not cost much to implement but that would bring significant economic benefits. In particular, we should finalise legislation introducing a European patent as soon as possible. A single patent protecting innovative products across the EU should be the absolute minimum. I also believe that we should agree and implement common, simple rules for conducting business, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, that would open up for them a realistic route to cross-border business. This means introducing unified, simple and transparent rules for accounting and reporting their incomes and expenditures. It also means implementing transparent and analogous means of certification and obtaining authorisation to trade that are also available to small businesses.

      <p sl="fr">Andreas Schwab, earlier, Ms Handzlik, Ms Le Grip, Louis Grech have expressed our common concern, not by way of making further speeches – this is Andreas Schwab who said this – but by way of taking action. This is the meaning of these two operational documents, ‘Services’ and ‘Governance of the Internal Market’, that the Commission is implementing, particularly to reduce the time periods of infringement proceedings – currently 25 months – to 18 months and, if possible, further still. You can rest assured – this is the meaning of these statements – that the Commission is doing and will do its work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will put in place this partnership, in particular, with this idea of a practical guide for citizens and businesses. However, if the partnership is not respected, if it is broken, then that will not be tolerated. There will be zero tolerance. This is also why it is important to integrate this governance into the European Semester, and to assure ourselves that there is no discrimination based on nationality or on place of residence – I say this to Malcolm Harbour. I have also noted, in relation to these different regulations, what Mr Pirker said and I will speak about this with Mr Kallas with regard to road safety.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Evelyne Gebhardt and Mr Correia de Campos stressed an element with which I agree, which is that of the social market economy: the human aspects and also the presentation of positive points that must be implemented within the framework of the large single market, which is a shared collective area of economic and social life. Mr Correia de Campos, we are carrying out and we will carry out the social impact studies to which we are committed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also think that the overall approach that Louis Grech had, the very first one recommended, must remain our approach. I say to Ms Vergnaud that if she still finds imbalances, which I can understand, in the Single Market Act, there is this second stage that we are preparing, which you will comment on and where we will be able to reach a better balance on any subject affecting consumers and citizens. In any case, I welcome your suggestions towards constructive preparation for the second stage of the 12 new proposals that the Commission will present in September.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Manders, Mr Bielan, Ms Sinclaire and Mr Kelly mentioned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). I have said to you – and I truly promise you that I am committed to this aim on a daily basis – that the large single market must be reconciled with citizens and with small and medium-sized enterprises, who have felt that the large market was not for them. Ladies and gentlemen, when you look at patents, the simplification of public markets, accounting standards, digitisation, Mr Kelly, in markets, or EU authentification, the measures that we are taking in banking – with lighter regulatory measures for SMEs – and company law that we spoke about earlier, an angle, a tailored approach clearly exists for encouraging investment and the work of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Róża Thun mentioned different services which are not covered by the Services Directive. As I speak, 85% of services are not covered by a European text. The Services Directive is undoubtedly the main instrument – it is not the only one – for improving the performance of the services economy on the European continent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall also say to Ms Irigoyen Pérez, who has just spoken, that I do indeed intend to make a number of concrete proposals this year for the protection of consumers, particularly in financial services, in respect of transparency of bank charges and access to basic accounts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A few words to conclude. We are preparing this great week of public debates, from 15 to 22 October, for new sustainable growth, Mr Cofferati. It is the spirit of Kraków that will continue to flourish. For this reason, I would therefore like to thank you and to thank the Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO), Malcolm Harbour, for the support that you provide for all these initiatives, support which is objective and attentive, but also very constructive, helping us to enable the internal market to function better.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Instead of intensified austerity measures and tax hikes that affect the less well off strata of society, what we need is a European-level strategy that is conducive to growth and job creation, with the full utilisation of the opportunities provided by the single market as one of its pillars. The elimination of existing barriers to the functioning of the internal market would not only result in savings for public finances, but would also give a boost to economic growth. The majority of measures aimed at completing the internal market does not require major investments, merely political will and a competent executive apparatus. The economic benefit of such measures, however, can be measured in billions of euro, given that they foster mobility within the European Union, facilitate cross-border service provision, promote small and medium-sized enterprises’ access to funding, encourage innovation and, ultimately, lead to job creation. The ideal functioning of the single market presupposes that European citizens – who have the right, by operation of law, to freely travel, take employment and settle down within the European Union – do not suffer discrimination while exercising these rights. It is the responsibility of Member State governments and European institutions to ensure that citizens are fully aware of their rights and obligations, and can make use of the available options for legal remedy, if necessary. We must guarantee EU citizens working in other Member States the same fundamental social rights as citizens employed in their home countries. The freedom to provide services and the freedom to pursue economic activities must go hand in hand with guaranteed social security.</p>

      <p sl="en">The single market celebrated its 20th anniversary this year. An important aspect of completing the single market, the Services Directive, was adopted in 2006 and was supposed to be fully in place by the end of 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to the Commission’s assessment, full implementation of the Services Directive would increase EU GDP by 2.6% and, in some of the countries most affected by the crisis, national GDP could increase by up to 2.2%. I do believe that such an increase would be highly desirable in order to overcome current problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">Implementing fully the single market and Services Directive would not only boost the economy and increase GDP, but would also mean considerable savings on administrative burdens and bureaucracy, amounting to up to EUR 40 billion. New fiscal discipline rules will be instrumental in ensuring fiscal stability in the future, but we also need to force Member States to finally and unconditionally implement the Services Directive and by that to complete the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Launching infringement procedures should be routine when handling cases where whatever EU legislation is not implemented in the foreseen time and form. As the average infringement procedure takes up to 25.5 months, I would urge the EC to speed up their processing in order to ensure a real effect in due time.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I wholeheartedly welcome the call to strengthen the single market. In my view, however, it should be strengthened in a balanced way. The single market cannot be judged in isolation from other policy areas, in particular, the social area, consumer protection and employment rights. We want an internal market which is fair and which benefits not only European businesses – particularly small and medium-sized ones – but, above all, the core of the market – the citizens themselves. We often hear that it is essential to involve citizens more in the development of the single market. How can we achieve this effectively? In my view, an effective information process can play a key role. This starts with public consultations, when legislation is under preparation. It is essential for consultations to be accessible in all official languages, and for them to be made more accessible and intelligible. The overall process continues by maximising the awareness of consumers when choosing goods and services, when they must have certainty that the legal framework rules out any concept of second-class consumers. Last but not least, consumers must be informed about their rights and how to enforce them, for example, through a functional alternative dispute resolution (ADR) system. I would like to end by joining the call for consistent transposition of the regulations. Insufficient and tardy implementation in national law and insufficient enforcement of regulations prevents a full exploitation of the benefits of the single market. Far from all transpositions are successful. My own country, the Czech Republic, despite some progress, does worst of all in this.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the future of European company law (O-000110/2012 – B7-0117/2012)</p>

    <intervention id="3-484-000" speaker_id="2224" name="Klaus-Heiner Lehne" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my thanks to the Commission, and particularly to Commissioner Barnier, for the very simple reason that in the last legislative period, which ended in 2009, our experience was that – with the exception of a very brief moment of awakening when the proposal for the European private company came – Commissioner Barnier’s predecessor, Commissioner McGreevy, in fact allowed company law to be left in a deep sleep, and we made no progress at all over those five years on this important issue, which also has significance for the internal market. Thankfully, that has changed entirely.</p>
      <p sl="de">We now have a multitude of consultation documents from the European Commission, a group of experts that has debated the issue of how to develop company law further, and now we have a brand new consultation which, naturally, Parliament is looking at too. The Committee on Legal Affairs decided that we did not want to do this in the form of a report, simply because a report requires even more time and is naturally somewhat more detailed. Instead, we chose to put an oral question to the Commission, in order to be able to discuss this topic with the Commission, with Commissioner Barnier, and so that, at the same time, we can make clear Parliament’s position on what should happen now in a subsequent resolution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Just as was the case around ten years ago, it is necessary to develop a new action plan on European company law. This is necessary for a great many reasons. There are gaps in European company law, real gaps, which basically are resulting in the fact that the internal market has not been completed. To mention one example, there is the missing 14th directive on the transfer of company seats, which, in my opinion, is a fairly typical example of such a gap. Parliament has asked twice in legislative own-initiative reports for the European Commission to table specific proposals. There is also the committee of experts convened by the European Commission itself, which has expressed the same opinion on this. Quite simply, it is part of the basic freedoms of the internal market that a company in the internal market must be able to transfer its registered domicile. This is not possible at present, or only under extremely difficult conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">In view of this, however, I must, at the same time, criticise the fact that the position of the European Commission to date on the topic of the 14th directive actually lags considerably behind Parliament’s expectations, and we are convinced that it does not meet the standard of a qualified answer to a legislative initiative either. However, we are of good courage that in the course of the continued work, when we get to the action plan, this proposal will hopefully then be reflected in the action plan.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another important point in respect of company law is the issue of how to develop company law further in order to reduce the burden on companies. Here, the Commission has already tabled very specific proposals, such as on the subject of accounting. However, there is more to do beyond this and other aspects now require clarification in the course of the consultations. We are expecting further proposals from the Commission in this area, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should also like to ask the Commission to revive the topic of the European private company, which, at the moment, is stuck in the Council. If there are individual Member States in the EU – and here I am expressing my own personal opinion – that are intrinsically unable, because of their own lack of decisiveness, to end the deadlock here and take Europe forward, then just as in the case of other projects – in the case of patent law or family law, for example – we must give some thought to using the instrument of enhanced cooperation, so that at least all the other Europeans will be able to enjoy this possibility. I would ask the Commission to give this issue greater consideration.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another outstanding problem is the issue of applicable law; in other words, a kind of Rome Regulation for cross-border problems in company law. I believe that this issue, too, needs further investigation and discussion, and I would ask the Commission to do this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Insolvency law is also closely related to this. In this area, however, it has been announced anyway that we will receive a specific proposal from the European Commission in the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p sl="de">As you can see, a huge amount remains to be done in the area of company law. I am grateful that Commissioner Barnier has taken the initiative here and that we can see that in the second half of this legislative period, we will receive significant proposals, which could then represent progress in the completion of the internal market. Parliament supports both the principle and the approach here. Naturally, we will have to talk about the details, and we will certainly do so. However, for the time being, I would like to give the Commission our thanks. Naturally, we would now be pleased if the Commission were actually to take up our initiatives and turn them into specific proposals.</p>

    <intervention id="3-485-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, thank you to Klaus-Heiner Lehne for what he has said and the initiative that he has taken in this regard. I promise him that on this issue, as on all the others, I am wide awake, Mr President, and proactive, especially as company law, honourable Members, is an important tool for growth. This is about the context of current day-to-day life for all businesses in Europe. Our objective is to create, with this law and with other reforms, the most efficient ‘climate’ for the work of businesses: European mobility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to reiterate that this large market must not primarily or only be for large businesses, but also for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), even for very small businesses. These are very real issues. That is why I was pleased about the success of the consultation on company law. We received more than 500 responses – and the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Lehne, also mentioned the contribution of the European Parliament – from all economic, social and academic stakeholders across Europe. We are analysing objectively the responses that we have received.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At this stage, from what I understand from the responses that we received, and based also on my own convictions, we have very strong support for European initiatives in this area of company law, particularly on two points. Firstly, facilitating businesses’ cross-border operations. I bring to mind the improvement of the transnational merger system, the measures on cross-border divisions, and the rather difficult question of cross-border transfers of company seats.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the codification of company law. We are currently working on this. It is a lengthy process, on which I hope, before my term is over, to be in a position to make you some concrete proposals. Based on these results, Mr Lehne, I am preparing, ladies and gentlemen, for this coming October, an action plan with a series of concrete short-, medium- and long-term initiatives in the area of company law. You will find in this plan almost all of the points that you yourself have raised, Mr Lehne. However, I will come back to a few of them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This plan will cover our thinking on the future of company law and also our current work on corporate governance. Indeed, I am convinced that one cannot separate the two, governance and company law. The two main thrusts are thus grouped together to create this coherent framework. Furthermore, on this point I would like to praise the work already completed with regard to company governance by your Parliament, in particular, by your rapporteur, Mr Bodu, whom I thank.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Naturally, I do not have the intention nor the possibility to say in detail what this plan will cover, but I would like to briefly mention a few of the themes. Firstly, this plan will include initiatives to create greater transparency between companies and investors. We must draw lessons from certain irresponsible practices and behaviours that we have condemned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A first initiative will involve non-financial transparency of companies, with a key element being the obligation on companies to make known their diversity policy on management boards. I will also propose steps to encourage more constructive and long-term involvement of shareholders in companies. In another area, I do intend to suggest giving greater responsibility to shareholders, for example, in setting the framework for salaries in the financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another theme of this plan is that I would like to propose measures to stimulate the competitiveness of European businesses. There is a very strong demand for facilitating the cross-border operations of businesses. In this connection, I have fully understood the sense of Parliament’s resolution on a 14th directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats. There are opinions that are rather diverse on this matter. The question of a new proposal remains open, but it is clear that I would like only to commit to this path on the basis of clear support from Member States and from the European Parliament. In light of the results of our consultation, I will ask my departments to reassess the situation and, if need be, to prepare a proposal for a directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A few words also, Mr Lehne, on a point that you raised, which is the European private company. This is a subject which is blocked in the Council, where unanimity has not yet been reached, despite the efforts of several presidencies, and despite my own efforts. It is an important tool to help small and medium-sized European businesses and I do not wish to exclude any means to enable it to progress, including, Mr Lehne, the route of enhanced cooperation, which can be used if a sufficient number of Member States wish it, and it is this that I will verify. I would like to say that I am willing to support enhanced cooperation on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I am increasingly convinced that Europe needs a regulatory framework that is adapted to the changes in the economic environment, to the needs of present day society. This regulatory framework must allow businesses to grow more easily within the Union, for the good of their shareholders and their customers as well as their employees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am mindful that some recent initiatives in the area of company law have encountered difficulties. This is not a reason for me to close the door and to do nothing more. We will therefore prepare a fairly full and detailed plan, in the spirit that I have just indicated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I also await with great interest the discussions that you will be having on your resolution on the future of company law. It will come at the right time to illuminate our work and lend more robustness, and undoubtedly more ambition as well, to the action plan that I will present to you in a few months.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, modern, well constructed European company law – and I do not have to convince anyone of this – is one of the most important conditions necessary for the single market to function well. I would say it is a sine qua non for the single market to be effective. I am, therefore, extremely pleased that on the question of company law, we are seeing significant progress in the work of the European Commission as well as a growing commitment to the matter. For a long time now, the members of Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs have emphasised that legislation which is appropriate for the current situation and which meets the needs of EU businesses is extremely important for the healthy and dynamic development of the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">When European firms diversify or undertake new forms of activity, by making use of the Internet for example, modern legal measures are required which, above all, relieve the administrative burden and excessive bureaucracy while also allowing businesses to develop their operations in a way which, for them, is clear, transparent and secure. I am certain that consultations on the future of European company law, which have just been completed, will show the European Commission the proper course of action – by which I mean rectifying where possible the inadequate legislation which, unfortunately, still exists in the single market and completing it with new and good legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think, too, that the work currently being done in our Committee on Legal Affairs on legislation affecting the auditing and governance of companies will not, in practice, be able to proceed very far without the adoption of new or amended legislation on company law. I do, of course, realise that initiatives in this area – as the Commissioner has said – may encounter certain obstacles, particularly from some of the Member States. I am certain, however, that the added value of these projects will convince those who are undecided, particularly if the interested parties themselves, by which I mean the people who run Europe’s companies, choose to adopt them. I would like to express to the Commissioner and to all of us my hope that this work can be brought to a successful conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you for your statement, Commissioner. I should like to approach it somewhat differently. Yes, naturally there are substantial gaps in European company law that need to be closed. It is necessary to close them. However, the short-term thinking behind the shareholder concept is one of the main causes of the crisis. The economic and financial crisis has shown us very clearly that this policy has failed. An enterprise must be seen as a social organisation that has responsibilities to shareholders, employees, creditors and society as a whole. Consequently, information, consultation and codetermination are essential if the social responsibility of enterprises is to be more than just lip service. In any event, the competition between national and European legal forms must be ended.</p>
      <p sl="de">You mentioned the 14th directive, Commissioner. As rapporteur for the recent resolution on the 14th directive, I am disappointed at the inadequate follow-up from the Commission. Making reference to the impact assessment carried out by the old European Commission in 2007 is not sufficient. I call on you to take specific measures and to stick to the procedure agreed between the Commission and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to state firmly that the work on the European private company was taken up too early, has not been fully thought out by the Commission, and does not take into account the current requirements of the people of Europe. If we are to achieve our objective of sustainable European company law, what we need instead is a European framework instrument for worker participation. The resolution from the Committee on Legal Affairs tells you to pursue a stronger stakeholder approach in all your future initiatives, in order to safeguard the interests of workers, creditors and members, and to comply with national regulations on protection and codetermination.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the debate on Europe has recently focused on the best way to overcome the economic crisis – that has, of necessity, been the case. Savings and acceptance of financial responsibility have been set against measures for stimulating growth.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the political rhetoric, I think, unfortunately, we very often miss the fundamental question, and that is: how do we intend to safeguard development and prosperity in the EU beyond the crisis? As we all know, prosperity does not just materialise out of thin air. It can only arise when people, using their creativity, create goods and services.</p>
      <p sl="sv">One of the most important things we can do in the political arena to create jobs and growth is to tear down barriers to trade and barriers to enterprise and trade in general, and to ensure that operators and innovators are able to utilise their creativity to develop their businesses.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The resolution we are debating today deals with exactly this. These are positive reforms within European company law, and I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for this sound proposal. These are important steps for strengthening competitiveness, particularly that of small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe. We need to have the courage to keep alive the vision of Europe beyond the crisis: fewer barriers to trade, but more in the way of simple cross-border legislation in the area of company law. Like my fellow Member, Mr Lehne, I would like to urge the Commission to look closely at this and to come back to us with further compelling proposals that are moving in this direction.</p>

    <intervention id="3-489-000" speaker_id="108570" name="Amelia Andersdotter" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, we need to reform European company law. The fragmentation in European company law and tax law is currently creating a situation in which it seems to be more a case of the Member States competing on the European market rather than companies competing with each other for customers.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We also need to rectify the situation whereby companies are using this fragmented legislation for extensive tax planning. We know from discussions concerning the Statutory Audits Directive and the Transparency Directive that many Member States and companies were strongly opposed to auditing on a project basis and instead focused on reporting their investments on a national basis. This will result in the very great risk of assets being moved from the European Union to tax havens in third countries, and it is a situation that cannot be rectified, primarily due to opposition from the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Above all, I am concerned about the fact that the Council’s reactions to the proposals from Parliament have, in general, been poor. We have seen in connection with the transaction tax and the consolidated tax base that as soon as Parliament takes a decision in the right direction, the Council tries to block it. I naturally ask myself how we as Parliament can tackle this and what the Commission can do to get the Council to stop being so reluctant to cooperate.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, I am going to pick up on what Ms Andersdotter just said about competition between Member States and not between individual companies. I find this completely normal as the countries in the European Union differ greatly from each other, mainly due to the fact that, for instance, companies from Mr Lehne’s country, Germany, are much more au fait with the provisions of European company law than companies may be in Bulgaria, for example, which has been a member of the European Union for just five years.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This is why, when talking about a common European framework for European company law, specific features in the newer Member States, which may not be as competitive as a founding state, for example, also need to be looked at. When new changes or a new regulation are planned, a great deal of attention needs to be paid in case companies in a particular new Member State are being repressed by this law and more opportunities are being given to companies from an old Member State, which have the appropriate expertise to operate in the field of company law.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This is why I recommend that the Commission takes into account the individual Member States’ national characteristics and does not introduce complete liberalisation, even though, in order to actually achieve economic growth, companies need to be given greater freedom, instead of us imposing further frameworks on them.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, company law can act as a lever for developing the internal market. In difficult times like these, we now need to work together to find acceptable solutions that can be implemented rapidly.</p>
      <p sl="it">I shall therefore be very clear, Commissioner, as to what this Parliament expects in the coming months; you have already noted certain requirements in your speech. First of all, we hope for a pragmatic and flexible approach to make the legislation clearer and more accessible. To that end, even though a single instrument would offer significant benefits, the directives could alternatively be grouped by sector: for example, by the principles of function, mobility and forms of law.</p>
      <p sl="it">The other priority is to place European company law at the service of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Given that over 90% of European businesses are SMEs, the internal market needs to be the natural environment for them to operate in, not merely a potential option.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lately, Parliament has been waiting, with some impatience, for a legislative proposal to set out the measures to facilitate companies’ cross-border mobility. That is all I shall say, because this subject is so huge that it is hard to cover it all in just over a minute. Nevertheless, I believe that there will be no shortage of opportunities for useful discussions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, as a liberal, I, too, welcome the hearing instigated by the Commission on the future of European company law. This is a key element of a functioning internal market. There are particular problems in respect of the mobility of our enterprises – in other words, the outstanding 14th company law directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats without having to establish a new company. The Commission has been slow in presenting draft legislation because the Member States are unable to agree on a common line, and negotiations are therefore likely to be difficult. Similarly, it is scarcely possible for shareholder rights to be exercised across borders and we are still awaiting harmonised framework conditions in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are also problems with the European private company, where the Member States are again blocking progress, being unable to agree on, among other things, the necessity of cross-border aspects, the level of capital stock and worker codetermination.</p>
      <p sl="de">My final point is that in the current proposed directive on accounting, the Commission has, in my view, made a technical legal error. In principle, the idea of making payment flows from the commodities industry in developing countries transparent is to be welcomed. In terms of legal technicalities, however, this topic does not belong there. If we want to help fight corruption, EU accounting law is not the right place to do it.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, company law is particularly important and, along with corporate governance, can, if the laws are drafted well, provide an incentive for foreign investment. Regardless of whether company law and corporate governance are handled together or separately, I believe that it is vital for European companies to benefit from a flexible regulatory framework. This can only be achieved as part of a code of conduct. Therefore, the ‘comply or explain’ principle must provide the solution, with the tough application of sanctions if deviations from rules are not explained in a transparent, detailed manner.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There must also be a single code of conduct for the whole EU because, otherwise, we cannot call it European legislation. The code of conduct must be specifically applied to listed companies because the only important factor in this process is the number of shareholders. Other indicators such as business turnover or the number of employees are irrelevant from a company perspective. There are obviously also situations when the rules may go outside the code of conduct’s flexible framework. I will mention conflicts of interest as an example. They need to be punished and discouraged in order to protect investors and employees.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I hope that Commissioner Barnier concurs with the idea that we need investment and jobs created by market instruments rather than by stringent regulations, which are regarded by investors as obstacles blocking their path.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the future of European company law will undoubtedly determine the future of the European Union itself. One need think only of the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a sector that has gradually grown stronger but that now, more than ever, needs structural reform.</p>
      <p sl="it">The single European market will surely profit from the perspectives of a European company law with a vision. Clearly, this vision must be imparted by the Commission, and it seems to me that the Commissioner’s comments are heading in this direction. We need an action plan with clear, accessible rules, where reducing red tape is given a high profile, and where company law is there to serve SMEs and business in general.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, we also need to look at other important issues, in particular, data protection, which must be updated and continually monitored and which could add to the burden on business. We need action for SMEs, extra safeguards for businesses to guarantee their rights, and cross-border mobility for companies, which must also be guaranteed and supported through an overarching approach aimed at meeting the requirements of company law, SMEs, healthy enterprise and, indeed, the employment market. We therefore trust that Mr Barnier’s proposals will bring company law in step with the times.</p>

We need a single market where business, too, can benefit from adequate, non-restrictive mobility conditions within the EU. At issue, however, is not only business mobility but also the mobility of the people who work in those businesses. The proposals for discussion therefore need to be drafted very carefully to avoid pitting the needs – or, indeed, the rights – of those who run businesses against the equally important rights of the people who work in them. In other words, a clear distinction must be drawn between business mobility and relocation, which damages local communities.</p>

I would like to refer to another aspect of this deficiency, one we have not mentioned yet – the discrepancy which exists between the practices of many company boards and certain European values. One such value is non-discrimination on the grounds of gender. I would therefore like to ask that when drafting this legislation, room be made in it for the suggestions put forward by the European Parliament in its report on corporate governance. These suggestions refer to the proposals of Commissioner Reding on increasing and, as it were, forcing company boards to increase the proportion of women to 30% by 2025 – the proportion of women on company boards, because, in many cases at present, they are almost completely absent. I hope that Commissioner Barnier, who is sympathetic to this idea and this proposal, will take account of it when drafting the legislation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the economic problems, the crisis and the challenges faced by European companies, their employees, creditors and other shareholders and stakeholders, EU company law needs to focus on a sustainable, forward-looking corporate model characterised by long-term thinking.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am therefore asking you to pursue the aims of a social Europe. As part of that, you need to look at the involvement of workers in corporate decisions. You should also involve the social partners in your initiatives. After all, businesses have a social responsibility towards society and in respect of their contribution to growth and employment. In all your proposals, you must ensure that, as far as possible, existing rules on codetermination cannot be bypassed or eroded. We need the highest possible standards in European companies and we need corporate decisions to involve all those affected.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the Commission’s efforts to support the functioning of the single market using appropriate types of European trading companies is a process that must tackle new obstacles relating to the national company law of the individual Member States. We should not therefore entertain any illusions that the process will be swift, or the solution simple. The fact that small and medium-sized businesses are the most important contributors to economic stability and job creation indicates where the European Commission should primarily focus its efforts. At present, only 23% of small and medium-sized businesses are also developing activities beyond the borders of their own country. According to expert analyses, the EU would gain as much as EUR 6.3 billion if it managed to draw up a specific European legal framework for this business category. From the above, it is clear where the focus of the European Commission’s attention should lie when seeking new, simple business models for cross-border trade in the EU and when improving its company law as currently applicable.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I was very pleased with the proposals that were put forward and with the questions that were put to us, and with their quality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Again, this first debate that the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Lehne, has called for, the resolution, the work that I have confirmed to you, which is quite ambitious, on this action plan, will all help to respond to the many speeches that were made.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank Mr Zwiefka and Ms Wikström for their encouragement – I did hear what they said – to be ambitious and comprehensive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Regner mentioned two points, as did Mr Lehne. I will not be coming to back to the 14th directive. I have told you about the reassessment that we are carrying out, and the new proposal that we were going to prepare, if need be. Ms Regner, you brought up a point that Ms Steinbrück also mentioned earlier, which is a sensitive one, that of worker involvement. The protection of workers is a sensitive subject, and the area of worker involvement is an issue to which I personally, as part of my political engagement, have long been very alert, as have you, Mr President.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is clear, moreover, that it is on this subject, Ms Regner, that the text on the European private company (SPE) is currently being blocked. I hope that it will be unblocked and, in any case, I have confirmed to you that I was willing to support a proposal for enhanced cooperation which would allow progress on this subject, if a sufficient number of States agreed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Andersdotter mentioned taxation. Clearly, when one talks about businesses, about the level playing field, about the single market, it is evident that these fiscal inequalities, or sometimes tax competition within the market itself, feature among the key points. That is why I am grateful to you for observing that the Single Market Act, which we spoke about earlier and which we will speak about again in September, contains a ‘taxation’ chapter, which my colleague, Mr Šemeta, proposed along with energy taxation, harmonisation of the bases of the corporation tax system and, in addition, the financial transaction tax.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Stoyanov mentioned national and sometimes regional particularities. I endeavour to take account of these particularities in all laws that we propose up to the point at which, Mr Stoyanov, the single market is called into question. You cannot ask anything else of me in my mission as Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services than to eliminate fragmentation, and to allow the free play of fair and equitable openness in inter-company transactions – this is the point mentioned by Mr Paška – to facilitate cross-border employment, trade and communication. I take account of particularities, but my rule and my mission are nonetheless to construct, patiently and with you, the single market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Iacolino mentioned, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as did Mr Stoyanov. I have spoken a great deal about these and I would like to remind Mr Iacolino that in all laws that we propose, and this will be the case for company law, I endeavour to take account of particularities. Here, the issue is a cross-cutting particularity: – 21 million European companies are small and medium-sized enterprises. I know that the growth that we are waiting for, that we must rebuild, will not come from decrees, nor from speeches, but from the regions and small and medium-sized enterprises, provided that through our laws, through simplifying our texts, we promote the most favourable climate for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Baldassarre, I can confirm that the action plan that we are preparing will carry forward this very ambitious and difficult project of codifying company law, and we will also – I say this to Ms Kolarska-Bobińska – deal with the question of diversity, which I am working on in management boards, though not exclusively, with my colleague, Ms Reding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Thein mentioned transparency. The draft that I submitted on country by country and project by project transparency has been well received. It is the object of work by your Parliament and by the Council of Ministers. Why did I use both texts, Ms Thein? Because the directive on transparency and the directive on accounting standards allow both listed and unlisted companies to be dealt with. Our ambition, which is quite bold – I saw that it was well received, particularly in Africa – is that 600 listed and unlisted companies should be required to declare what they pay and to whom in the area of the extractive industry and in the area of the logging industry.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On this, I am also minded not to increase, as Ms Thein wished, the burden for small and medium-sized enterprises, but we do have a duty to encourage transparency. This is a just cause.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I again thank Mr Bodu – I said this earlier – for the report that he presented on corporate governance. I am aware of his concerns on conflicts of interest. I am also aware of his desire not to add any burdens through unnecessary regulation – that is also my intention. I will always favour agreement over constraint. Sometimes, however, as we clearly saw with the financial crisis, Mr Bodu, we are required to build or to rebuild a new regulatory framework where we had unduly deregulated and eliminated any form of governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, I will not forget the question of employee involvement, the question of employee shareholding schemes and of everything able to create conditions for better social cohesion within companies. However, it is not necessarily in this text on company law that we should deal with these questions – I have spoken about this with Mr Andor and also with Mr Šemeta. I think, undoubtedly like you yourself, Mr President, that social cohesion is one of the keys to growth in business and in society. I would also say this to Mr Cofferati, who questioned me on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I thank Mr Lehne, Mr President, and the members of your committee for having placed this question on the agenda. I have shown you evidence of determination on the part of the Commission at this stage. We will now move forward quickly and precisely with the preparation of this action plan.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a robust and systemic solution must be found – and very soon – to the financial and economic crisis. A major consequence of this crisis is the excessively high unemployment. Unemployment now stands at 10.3% in the 27 Member States of the EU, a level we have not seen since the 1990s. Within the euro area, the level of unemployment is even higher, reaching 11% of the workforce.</p>
      <p sl="en">To find real solutions to Europe’s current crisis, we need a jobs-centred approach. The employment package that the Commission presented in April shows how employment policies can ensure that job creation drives economic growth. The package also outlines ways to rebalance EU economic governance by strengthening the coordination of employment policies. We need the strong support of the European Parliament on both these issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission package seeks to reorient European employment policy along three main lines. First, we support measures to create jobs and boost the demand for labour across the economy. We identified the green economy, information and communication technologies, and the health and care services as the three areas that can generate the most job opportunities and for which a detailed action plan is presented.</p>
      <p sl="en">We propose concrete demands and interventions to support job creation, such as hiring subsidies for newly created jobs, a budget-neutral tax shift from labour to environmental taxes and greater support for business start-ups, self-employment and last, but not least, the social economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, the package seeks to make labour markets more dynamic through balanced and fair reforms, notably investment in skills and the removal of obstacles to free movement of workers and worker mobility. We need to secure transitions in the labour market by making sure that transitions pay.</p>
      <p sl="en">A more dynamic European labour market will help to reduce existing skill shortages and mismatches. This is why we also need to invest in skills and to create new tools to anticipate and monitor skills development at the EU level. The Commission is also committed to improving mobility by removing obstacles, such as those affecting the portability of pensions. We are also proposing to transform the current EURES system into a genuine EU employment tool able to match jobs and jobseekers across borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, the package aims to strengthen EU governance of employment policies. In particular, we want to reinforce monitoring of Member States’ employment polices so that employment and social concerns do not lag behind economic concerns. We also seek to involve the social partners in the process of implementing reforms and monitoring wage developments at the EU level.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, the package also sets out a stronger link between Member States’ labour market reforms and investment through EU financial instruments and, in particular, the European Social Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament’s support for the package is critical. It will provide an additional political impetus for employment to be considered among the cornerstones of our ‘European growth pact’. I am looking forward to this debate today.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission recently published the draft employment package. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I welcome this draft package, and I would like to begin by stating that we, for our part, support all of it, just as we support the proposal for a decision that was discussed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as Parliament’s initial response to this draft employment package.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Over the course of the debate, my colleagues will go into more detail. Let me just highlight some aspects I consider important. Above all else, I welcome the realistic approach with which the Commission has launched the draft package itself. We unfortunately share its opinion concerning the inauspicious signs that cast a shadow on this effort, whether it is youth unemployment or rising unemployment rates, and what I find particularly distressing is what is described in the recently published evaluation of Member States’ National Reform Programmes, namely, that the Member State concepts known to us so far do not seem to be sufficient to ensure the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is therefore definitely welcome that the Commission intends to provide medium-term policy guidance in this regard and I believe that it has set the priorities in respect of the potentials lying in the green economy, the health and social services sector and information technology correctly. I certainly welcome the proposal to reduce the tax wedge on labour, and would like to point out that the Pension Portability Directive should be adopted as soon as possible, while the barriers to mobility with regard to Romania and Bulgaria should be eliminated; we definitely welcome the growth initiative referred to in the text. Thank you, Commissioner; my colleagues will continue to elaborate the rest of our observations.</p>

    <intervention id="3-508-000" speaker_id="1985" name="Pervenche Berès" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament wanted to organise this debate based on the employment package that you have placed on the Commission’s table and which we feel it is important to talk about here today, in plenary, at a time when the European Council may well mention a growth initiative, alongside other weighty matters which will be on its work table. With regard to that growth initiative, we think that your voice – which says that this growth must create jobs – should be strong, hence the importance of this debate that we are organising today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When we look at the expectations of Europeans, at the time when the unemployment rate is approaching an historic record, it is not so much stabilising financial markets, but keeping or finding a job that concerns them more than anything. It is this expectation that we must respond to, especially when it comes to the youngest citizens. This hope bumps up against the realities of a social situation that is intensifying by the day. How, indeed, can we fail to foresee the spectre of a lost generation when we know that 5.6 million young people are unemployed, that one young European out of five is looking for work and that the situation may not improve before 2016, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO).</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Commission repeats that it will take some time before guidelines produce effects in terms of job creation. However, for this to happen, the guidelines must be the right ones. It is striking to see that in the national reform programmes that the Member States have sent to the Commission, ultimately, their commitment to present their national employment plans has not really been followed up with results. Many have not implemented this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to retain two proposals from this employment package that you have put on the table that we think are right at the heart of the discussion that we need to have. Firstly, the taboo that you have ended when it comes to the minimum wage. You said that the minimum wage is an important element in the debate for combating poverty and social exclusion, for combating social dumping, and for putting forward the question of aggregate demand, of stimulating internal demand. It is a major topic if we wish to solve the problems of internal imbalances within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Next, there is a second proposal that you seem to support, for which you know that Parliament will give you its backing, and that is this idea of a Youth Guarantee, which means that no young person would be without employment, education or training after four months in the labour market. This is a major proposal. If we want to commit to specific proposals that go beyond mere words, we must move forward on this in the coming months in terms of financial perspectives and the conclusions of the next European Council, and we will be by your side to do this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you, Commissioner, for the process into which, together, we will be able to breathe life so that we may correct a strategy which, for too long, has been one of austerity and which is leading us towards disaster.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this employment package makes a lot of very welcome suggestions for Member States to take on board in their policy proposals for getting out of the current crisis. These touch on a number of key areas, including youth employment and unemployment, education, training, skills development and labour movement, to name but a few. It also points to areas of potential growth such as green technology.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I think the cornerstone of what the Commission is aiming to achieve in the job-rich recovery is, in my view, a structural change to labour markets. I do not think we should just go out on a limb and make changes without really looking at what we are doing. I think the Commission should carry out an impact assessment on current EU labour market laws and come forward with some reform proposals. I know that there is a lot of fear that such reforms might have a detrimental effect on workforces and social labour rights. These fears are very understandable but, if we do nothing, we fail to address the growing unemployment rates, particularly amongst young people, and the lack of competitiveness that we are seeing in some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Clearly, we need a sensible, pragmatic and socially responsible balance when we make these reforms, but it is only by making serious structural changes now that we can bring forward and build a solid foundation for growth in the medium to long term. A sustainable and competitive European economy based on real economic performance – not endless public borrowing – is the route to creating jobs and reducing our unemployment rates.</p>
      <p sl="de">Labour market reform may be necessary, but it is not, in itself, sufficient. That is why I particularly welcome proposals in this employment package to boost entrepreneurship and tackle youth unemployment, in particular, providing opportunities for young people to develop valuable skills. New businesses, of course, are the employers of the future, and we must ensure that the rate of creation of new businesses is maintained. We need to identify and address the barriers to potential entrepreneurs. In the ALDE Group, we will engage positively with you, Commissioner, to bring forward this package.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, having a job is the foremost concern for hundreds of millions of Europeans. As far as I am concerned, creating jobs should therefore be our highest priority. The Commission’s communication ‘Towards a job-rich recovery’ is a step in the right direction. I am really enthusiastic about the idea of a labour market monitoring system, about an important role for employment schemes in the semester and, of course, I am especially enthusiastic about the focus on ‘green’ jobs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have read the working paper on ‘green’ jobs with great pleasure. We could almost have written it ourselves! One hundred to two hundred thousand additional jobs for every percentage point reduction in our consumption of raw materials; now, that should encourage every government to embrace a sweeping green policy. Still, I do not have much confidence in that actually happening.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Our Union is currently taking a huge leap forward: economic governance, a banking union, fiscal union, political union, but when it comes to the social dimension, it continues to remain relatively easy-going and non-committal. How can we force Member States to pay attention to social issues when we have an excessive deficit procedure, but not an excessive unemployment procedure, and when a budget deficit of more than 3% can lead to sky-high fines, but 50% youth unemployment does not? Where countries are called to account because of excessive labour costs, but not because of wages that are below the poverty line.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We need to move on and we need to move towards greater integration. But now that we are breaking all kinds of taboos anyway, why not break them at the social level, too? Bring on that directive for the European minimum wage, bring on those penalties for excessive unemployment or poverty and bring on that initiative to make 2020 targets binding. I wish you all the best!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, unemployment is a very major concern and I welcome the Commission’s communication on the job-rich recovery, but I totally reject calls for more harmonisation of European employment legislation, any attempts to establish European minimum wages and any calls for the EU to have controls and sanctions in the national labour markets of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">European growth plans do not create jobs; it is businesses and entrepreneurs who create jobs. We must not introduce measures that create unintended consequences and actually stop entrepreneurs and possibly those who are self-employed from growing their businesses and starting to provide employment for others.</p>
      <p sl="en">SMEs and micro-enterprises currently provide 90 million jobs in the private sector in the EU and they have huge potential for job creation, for growth and for innovation, and we must do all we can to help them rather than hinder them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, during the second World War, the Royal Air Force was very concerned about the losses amongst its heavy bombers, so it sought to protect its air crew, first by putting armour around the pilot and then, when they needed more protection, armour around the navigator and more armour around the bomber. Yet they found that losses continued to go up. They finally realised that they had put so much weight of armour into those bombers that they could scarcely fly. They then removed the armour, the planes flew higher and faster and the loss rate went down.</p>
      <p sl="en">For decades now, the European Union has been loading regulation on labour markets. It has done so with the best of intentions – to protect workers – but the effect is to create a labour market so overloaded and inflexible that it simply cannot fly. On top of that problem, we are now looking at green jobs. Colleagues ought to know that there are credible studies from several European countries which show that every green job costs two or three or four jobs in the real economy because green energy is so expensive that it actually restricts growth in the rest of the economy and costs jobs. What we need for jobs is, first of all, deregulation and, secondly, to abandon our green aspirations.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, this package by the European Commission advocates, inter alia, reducing the burden on companies from workers’ social security contributions; that is, it advocates cutting labour costs and decapitalising social security systems, thereby paving the way for its privatisation and the robbery of the workers by these means. Yet into what does the European Commission say that company start-ups should be channelled? Into this new sector of opportunity that they call the social economy and social companies, which means replacing the public services that they ordered shut down, transforming the peoples’ rights into business opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Commission also advocates pegging wages to productivity; a magic formula for loading responsibility for a company’s performance – which, as we know, is based on a range of factors – onto the shoulders of the workers. This package of measures presents us with other pearls of wisdom, such as the need to introduce flexible working hours, the implementation of time banks and the creation of conditions favourable to worker mobility; in other words, they are promoting emigration as a solution to the lack of jobs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">How can anyone applaud a European Commission package promoting job creation when the same package advocates public sector layoffs in several countries. The European Commission may now be attempting to have a social rhetoric, but its policies have exacerbated the recession and, with it, unemployment. We call for an end to the policies of neoliberalism and so-called austerity. Europe needs a recovery that includes public sector investment and increased wages.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, unemployment in the EU has risen markedly as a result of the enduring crisis. At the same time, the Member States are drifting further and further apart.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is the master plan for more jobs? Regions need tailored solutions. Across Europe, there is widespread agreement on the way to go: promotion of SMEs, flexicurity, green jobs, recognition of professional qualifications, effective use of regional funds, the Cohesion Fund and the European Social Fund (ESF). We need more mobility to create new jobs, but we also need to secure stable jobs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Illegal labour must be stopped once and for all by means of stricter controls, which will result in millions of euro in increased revenue for the budgets. Precarious jobs and dumping wages must be prevented in favour of fair pay. The agreements on minimum wages belong in the hands of the parties concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us not abandon our young people. In my report on justice between the generations, I called for a European youth guarantee. After four months’ unemployment, we need apprenticeships, additional training and jobs. The European investment pact is intended for all the generations, but this must not be financed by taking on more debt, which would undermine the fiscal pact.</p>

      <p sl="es">Your communication is not enough, however, Commissioner. The problem is too serious for the measures announced by the Commission. I will briefly make two comments given that I only have a few seconds. The first is that this communication has to overcome the contradictions between the EU’s public policies. You cannot request, and rightly request, for example, that funds are reused when Member States that have problems do not have funds to cofinance the actions, as other EU policies restrict the spending of this money on training or productive investments. Labour reforms cannot be requested at the same time as applauding labour reforms that destroy jobs. Above all Commissioner, we need a real guarantee from Europe for young people, a European guarantee; do not leave it to the Member States, as those in most difficulty will not be able to do anything. The EU has allocated EUR 100 billion to saving five banks in my country. Use EUR 10 billion, 10 times less, to save five million young Europeans. That would be genuine action.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, ‘Towards a job-rich recovery’ is certainly an inspiring title for any communication and indeed, the Commissioner’s words were inspiring today when he said that we must ensure that employment and social concerns do not lag behind economic concerns. Now, of course, the challenge is to make those fine words a reality and to ensure that our plans and programmes deliver European added value.</p>
      <p sl="en">One very important proposal is the creation of a European investment package to be undertaken by all Member States to deliver sustainable jobs. I think this package would send a clear message to citizens that we are seriously attempting to rebalance the current austerity measures or the current austerity approach with the Europe-wide pact for investment and jobs. I know that, when 60% of Irish citizens voted for the Fiscal Treaty, they did so in the expectation, among other things, of a growth and investment pact.</p>
      <p sl="en">This resolution also calls for upskilling and retraining of workers and one current instrument to achieve that at European level is the European Globalisation Fund. Therefore, I am appealing to Member States not to block its continuation but to work together to ensure that the EGF contributes to European added value by upskilling redundant workers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, we are all saying the same thing: the employment situation in Europe is catastrophic. With one quarter of young people under 25 unemployed, there is a lot at stake for the new generation, which refuses to be a lost generation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has opened up the way with its employment package, which is designed to create 17 million jobs by 2020. However, it continues to lead us towards disaster by driving through austerity plans which increase unemployment and condemn the most vulnerable to the worst kind of hardships.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet, an exit from the crisis is simple. We must transform our economy ecologically and socially. To that end, we need to develop green, sustainable and non-outsourceable jobs through targeted investments in green, innovative industries. We need to invest in life-long training and in promoting the social and solidarity economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, it is necessary to promote decent work, taking into account the objectives of the International Labour Organisation of improving rights and working conditions, and to reaffirm the vital need to increase the minimum wage so as to put an end to the scandal of poor workers and to fight social dumping.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have the means to end the scourge of unemployment. Yes, it is possible! What, then, is lacking? All that is lacking is the political will. That is your responsibility! Mr Barroso accorded high priority to the issue of youth and youth unemployment in particular. What is the youth unemployment situation now, three years later? There are no specific proposals. There is nothing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Action needs to be taken and it needs to be taken now.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, one of the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy is that by the end of 2020, 75% of people between the ages of 20 and 64 will be in work. This, in turn, is meant to contribute to lasting economic growth in the Union. Another aim of the strategy is that by 2020, 17.5 million new jobs will be created. It is an exceptionally ambitious project in view of the situation today in the field of public finance and the economies of individual Member States, and also in view of unemployment across the Union, which instead of falling, is rising – from 9.5% in 2010 to its current value of 10.2%. This means that in the last few years, 6 million jobs have disappeared. Something else which is a cause of concern is the prospect of introducing the climate package, which may lead to a situation in which, in my country of Poland for example, half a million people lose their jobs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The motion for a European Parliament resolution on ‘Towards a job-rich recovery’ does, of course, contain worthy objectives – among other things, it plans to create jobs by promoting entrepreneurship and self-employment – and another very important matter is that it calls on the Commission and the Member States to increase investment through public procurement. In the current circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, we have to ask a question about the future budgetary framework: is it not the case that reducing the EU budget and, inter alia, spending on cohesion policy, will exacerbate the economic crisis?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I very much like your proposal regarding the productivity-aligned wage policy. When it comes to the minimum wage, however, you have given in to Chancellor Merkel, and I do not believe you when it comes to increasing employment in health care. How are new jobs supposed to emerge there when the Commission has already forced southern and eastern Member States to reduce their hospital capacities by a half? How are jobs supposed to arise in health care when the Commission requires some Member States to reduce their expenditure on health care further in the new country-specific recommendations for the European Semester? I fear that this point in this plan is pure gesture politics, not a real initiative for new jobs. On the contrary, there is already a shortage of drugs and medicines as a result of the austerity measures, and not just in Greece. I feel that if we are constantly designing new rescue packages for the banks, then we must now work for a rescue package for people and, in particular, to secure medical supplies in the crisis countries.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the speech given by Commissioner Barroso at the presentation of the package contained in the Commission communication on a job-rich recovery in the European Union reminded me of the words of a famous American investor, who said recently that jobs are not created by employers, but by consumers. In working to get the EU on the road to economic growth, we need to remember this. We should therefore also place great emphasis on measures intended to stimulate internal and external demand, giving support to Member States in a variety of ways, including when creating incentives for employers and when increasing support for new enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should also give attention to non-standard forms of employment, which often give rise not just to very high segmentation in the labour market – where some workers have extensive rights, and others have none at all – but can also increase the risk of poverty and social exclusion. Therefore, it is important for the Member States to take a responsible approach to linking job flexibility with job security and appropriate remuneration, so as not to cause the emergence and development of groups of working poor.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the other hand, the Member States should devote a great deal of attention to measures intended to help workers. The Member States should use social investment as a means to activate their citizens and supply them with instruments which will help them react flexibly and proactively to constantly changing economic and social conditions. Priority treatment should also be given to the problems being faced in the labour market by young people. I would like to reiterate how important it is to invest in education and training and to provide young people with the skills required by the labour market. The recently published Commission communication contains many good and necessary measures. I hope that very soon, the Commission will bring forward specific legislative measures which will put these ideas into effect.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, the employment package is a good package; it just needs to reach its target audience in time. We have wasted a full two years. The European Parliament has called consistently for something to be done about employment. If we waste another two years before everything that is said and written is done, I fear it will be too late.</p>
      <p sl="el">Second point: the labour market – let us be honest – is suffering because long-term policies have failed and now we have the crisis. We need to take account of that because, according to the Eurobarometer survey, the crisis had a massive impact in 2011 alone.</p>
      <p sl="el">A few simple figures: one in five Europeans and one in two Greeks are afraid of losing their job. A few more figures: five in ten Europeans and eight in ten Greeks are afraid that, if they lose their job, they will be unable to find another job within six months.</p>
      <p sl="el">This is the reality and I trust and implore you to consider the question of flexibility, the question of elasticity, not only in connection with work, but also when appropriations are being allocated. As we are always talking about competitiveness, we need to understand once and for all:</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, that competitiveness cannot be seen as an issue that relates to each Member State separately; it is an issue that relates to the entire European Union, if we want a strong European Union and a strong euro. Therefore, given that we are constantly hearing about wage cuts, on the one hand, if we want to improve the competitiveness of certain Member States, my thought is this: why not increase wages in Germany, for example, in order to help boost the competitiveness of other States in trouble.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the economic stagnation in which the European Union finds itself is forcing us to think about suitable stimuli to revive economic growth. Although I understand the consolidation measures and proposals for the reallocation of the Structural Funds, I cannot help feeling that the Commission is overlooking some of the root causes of the current situation. One of the reasons that European workers are losing their jobs is that our European companies, which we often support through various stimulus measures, are moving production to other parts of the world, and the resulting profits to tax havens. Just look, Commissioner: are there any major European car manufacturers that have not built up their production capacities in China, Brazil, Russia and elsewhere around the world? Do you wonder that their European plants no longer achieve the sales they used to and that their European employees are losing their jobs? And I ask you: do the proceeds from such business end up as tax revenues of the EU, or in the overseas accounts of shareholders or senior managers of these companies? Let us therefore also consider, Commissioner, what sort of economic environment we must be creating in the EU if our traditional European manufacturers are gradually relocating elsewhere in the world to do business.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, there is a fundamental contradiction in your choices. By linking budgetary surveillance, namely, reducing social and public expenditure, while banks are being supported and financial markets satisfied, to the issue of employment, it is as if you wanted to mingle fire and water. Moreover, it prevents economic recovery in the European Union, as the wealth that is created is forever receding.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Employment and work can only be increased if wealth is redistributed. This involves improving workers’ remuneration and pensions and finding a new way of producing wealth through the ecological transformation of production, which would create millions of jobs in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, it would mean replacing the European stability mechanism, which is, in fact, an austerity mechanism, by a European fund linked to the granting, by the European Central Bank, of a new loan subject to the creation of jobs, training and ecological progress. It would also involve promoting European public services for European public goods in activities relating to water, energy, transport, health, the environment, training and culture, without which what you are promising will not be achievable.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Europe has already lost 6 million jobs since 2008. The economy in my country, Portugal, is suffering an unprecedented contraction, and unemployment among men, women and young people is reaching historic levels. According to Bank of Portugal forecasts, the situation will get worse over the next two years. It is in that context that we support and welcome the initiative of the new employment package; our congratulations to you, Commissioner Andor.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Persisting now and always with the basic premise of the need for economic growth, the Member States will really have to focus their efforts on job creation. The means for this should include subsidies for taking on staff by reducing the tax burden on a workforce, which will create new jobs, and support for company start-ups and entrepreneurship, but also for small and medium-sized enterprises that do not lay off workers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">National employment policies must also take into account that the areas with the greatest job creation potential are health care, information and communication technologies, and the ‘green’ economy. As the communication says, there is an urgent need to reduce the gap between the qualifications provided by education and the skills demanded by the job market. Another solution for combating unemployment is worker mobility. It is also crucial to use the Structural Funds to create jobs, and the European Employment Services portal is important as the instrument par excellence for recruitment and job offers in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that one of the key messages from the recent Irish referendum is that stability and growth are two sides of the same coin. Irish voters endorsed stability, but sent a very clear message in favour of the growth agenda. We now need to make real progress on an investment programme for real, sustainable and quality jobs: a plan which will respect the rights and dignity of workers, promote social justice and fight inequality, in-work poverty and social dumping; a plan which will protect vulnerable workers such as part-time workers, domestic workers and those trapped in the black economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such a plan should also address the need for investment and growth industries such as the green economy and creative industries. It should ensure that finance is made available for SMEs, the backbone of the European economy. We need specific actions to tackle youth unemployment, including a binding European youth guarantee. We also need to adopt a quality charter on internships. Too many young people are on their fourth or fifth unpaid internship with no job in the offing.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate you as the Commission’s proposal on the employment package is very important. It is an ambitious and difficult challenge in the context of the current crisis, but we have to achieve the objective of the Europe 2020 strategy and create new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="es">To achieve this objective, the job markets need to be reformed so that they are more dynamic and inclusive, with workers trained in appropriate skills so they are more resistant to economic adjustment processes, and make full use of their potential for job creation during growth periods.</p>
      <p sl="es">Hiring needs to be stimulated through tax incentives that: promote and support self-employment and business start-ups, back innovative sectors with a high potential for job creation, improve the job market situation for the most vulnerable groups, such as young people and women, and fight against informal or non-declared employment.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is also important to note, however, that despite the high unemployment rate, there are increasingly more vacancies to be filled due to a lack of personnel with the appropriate skills. This gap needs to be filled by better planning for the needs of the job market and encouraging geographical mobility. In this sense, decisive progress needs to be made towards the creation of a European job market.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, there are two objectives that we must collectively work towards. The first is to create new jobs. We know that the group to target as a priority is young people, and we know that the most important tool is training. An investment in training is an investment in growth and social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="it">Yet there is a second major issue, which is less talked about: the regularisation of illegal work or, as it is euphemistically called, informal employment. These people are being exploited. They are working without contracts, without employment rights, and even without citizenship rights, because they often reach us without residence permits or the normal conditions that apply to others. The result on the ground is not only great suffering and exploitation but also a distortion of the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why I believe that the two aspects must be tackled together, giving each its due importance: creating work for young people while regularising work that is already being done outside the law.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, unemployment is a leading European problem which is having painful repercussions on social cohesion and the real economy in the Union. Every measurement records an historic high in numerous European countries and, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey, 45% of European citizens are worried about the shortage of jobs. In other words, the European Union faces a massive challenge, with employment now in a state of emergency. Clearly, the insistence on extreme austerity measures in certain countries has resulted in an unprecedented increase in unemployment. In my country, Greece, one in four citizens is already excluded from the labour market, long-term unemployment has topped 55% and youth unemployment is close to 53%, condemning the most promising members of Greek society to inertia or emigration. At the same time, the deregulation of labour relations has not only failed to maintain employment; on the contrary, it is recycling poverty and recession.</p>
      <p sl="el">Economic governance as a whole therefore needs growth-oriented content. Economic sustainability cannot be sought in isolation from the pulse of society. Furthermore, measures to support employment are an important social investment. Finally, I should like to point out that Member States such as Greece, which is receiving financial support, should not, under any circumstances, be excluded from the procedure to attain the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy. We therefore need a policy mix that will safeguard fiscal restructuring and, at the same time, pave the way for growth with new, viable and high-quality jobs. You are well aware of that, Commissioner, given your particular awareness of the issue, and you are well aware of that Mr President, because you keep a close watch on society and its problems.</p>

This includes youth unemployment, but also the employment situations of other vulnerable groups of society in addition to young people, such as the elderly, often even people aged 45-50, women, including those who have or wish to have children, as well as people with disabilities and members of various minorities. The draft lists a great many tasks. I would like to highlight only two special issues right now: the first is the role of social enterprises, which provide valuable assistance in mitigating the social consequences of the crisis in health care and social services. These need European-level framework legislation, simplified access to financing, as well as education and training opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The second is eliminating the deficiencies in the functioning of the internal market. The mutual recognition of qualifications, simplified administration in social security, pension portability and non-discrimination are all needed in order to ensure that the internal labour market is truly functional, while guaranteeing social rights on the basis of free movement and employment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European plan to overcome the current challenges does not acknowledge consolidation of European finances or job-rich recovery, as certain populists are trying to make our citizens believe. Of course, we have a responsibility to achieve both objectives. In my opinion, this statement by the Commission takes an important step towards this. I welcome the fact that the potential of the green economy and the service sector is recognised, that the dual system of vocational training is to act as a kind of model for future structures, that the youth guarantee is being realised, that lifelong learning is also being implemented for the increasingly important group of older workers and that the increased use of fund resources is defined very clearly here. In other words, it is now a matter of implementing the measures announced. I recognise all this in the statements by the Commission and by the Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I should also like to say something about the legitimate goal of avoiding a lost generation. Again, it can only be done via the two pillars and by implementing justice between the generations and solidarity between generations. It goes without saying that this begins with resolving the biggest problem that we currently face, and that is unemployment. However, this naturally leads immediately to the reduction of responsible debt. I do not want us to play these off against each other in the slightest. Instead, we should realise both. That should also be the objective of Parliament’s work.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Opportunities for work may be found in support products and health care services, as the Commissioner and the Commission have recommended in their statement.</p>

In your document, you foresee 8 million jobs by 2020. That is indeed possible. However, in order to achieve this, the Commission must provide the industrial policy framework, and this must be a long-term framework. Specifically, this means that if we do not have an ambitious directive on energy efficiency, then there will be no demand for construction workers and other workers to insulate buildings. That means you have to work shoulder-to-shoulder with your colleagues, so that we can provide this industrial policy framework. Otherwise – and I will say this to you now – what you have said will remain an unfulfilled prophecy.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I think that job creation is the most important way to solve Europe’s most acute problems: poverty and unemployment, particularly among young people. It is also the only way to return to a path of growth. We need to invest in promoting enterprise, and we also need to eliminate the bureaucratic and legislative barriers hindering development of the small and medium-sized enterprise sector – and it is this sector which accounts for 70% of all jobs. Another problem is the way in which education is not related to employment. It is surprising that, in spite of the continued high unemployment, we are not seeing a fall in the number of jobs available. Young people, often with a tertiary education, do not hold the qualifications being sought by employers, neither do they have the know-how needed to start their own business. I think these matters call for new measures at every level: local, regional, national and European.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Treaty establishing the European Union lays down our employment objective, and there are so many reasons for taking a serious approach to this subject. I would therefore simply like to make an observation: in the last plenary debate, you said something about youth unemployment that is incredibly important and which is relevant here; that is, that it is necessary to keep the bigger picture in mind, which is demand-oriented macro-economic policy. After all, the unemployed cannot solve the problem of unemployment on their own.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first of all thank you and the honourable Members for this very rich discussion, which has been extremely constructive for me, too, and which sent very clear and concrete messages to the Commission about the employment package and also the way forward – namely, that we do not only have to produce a good document but we also have to take care of the implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is what we are working on, on many issues, and not just on youth – where I am sure you are aware of the action the Commission has already taken – but also with regard to wider employment policies. In that spirit, I will be meeting the social partners working group next week and will seek its cooperation on all the different aspects of the employment package.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, let me highlight the importance of many remarks concerning the wider context of employment policy, because you cannot detach employment from the wider economic landscape. One third of unemployment across the EU is a consequence of the crisis and, in some Member States, it is about one half, or even more.</p>
      <p sl="en">So if we want to produce results in terms of job creation, we are strongly bound to the crisis response to the financial crisis, the financial sector, how to deal with public debt, how to deal with the private financial sector. The sooner there are proper solutions in those areas, the sooner we will have a better macro-economic environment in which to address employment policies too. It is also true that without this, we still have to go forward and find more direct solutions for job creation and to help the unemployed people.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we speak about the wider context, it is important to point to the question of investment and the situation in the real economy. I fully share the views expressed by Ms Harkin on the importance of investment, and on the importance of industrial policy by Ms Schroedter and Mr Paška. The Commission is working on reinforced industrial policy and, indeed, the human capital dimension of industrial policy, the capacity of regenerated industry in Europe to create and sustain jobs, is absolutely fundamental.</p>
      <p sl="en">The employment package should be seen as a building block of a new economic paradigm. If you look at how wages or the role of demand is put forward in the employment package, or to give another example, the role of employment governance in the EU with the involvement of the social partners, I believe these open up new opportunities and the capacity to focus better on all levels and more efficiently on job creation and quality jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of you – I do not need to list all the names – underlined the importance of helping young people, and we had a separate discussion on this last time here in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can tell you there is a lot of action taking place. I was in Italy last week where Structural Funds have been substantially reallocated in order to benefit young people just in Sicily, which is one region. The size of the reallocation exercise is close to half a billion euro, and this is not for the entire country but just for one of the regions where the situation is most serious.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we in the eight Member States where youth unemployment is the worst are working on reallocation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent ongoing work to prepare the youth guarantee, on which I had the views of Ms Berès and others, should indeed produce a result in close coordination with the Council before the end of this year. We will have opportunities to see whether our concrete solutions can match, to produce the best and most effective outcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also before the end of this year, as envisaged in the employment package, we should produce the quality framework, on which there is ongoing consultation with all the stakeholders.</p>
      <p sl="en">The role of enterprise and micro-finance was rightly stressed by Mr Bennion and Ms McIntyre. This, too, is indeed a possible direction that is often forgotten because the young generation may not be aware of the real opportunities in countries – let me mention Italy again – where the previous generation was successful in running SMEs. This knowledge does not necessarily transfer to the new generation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once again, this is a task for human capital building. Once again, the task is to spread the knowledge of enterprise and to support micro and small enterprises directly through better access to finance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Within the world of enterprise, I think there was rightly an emphasis on the role of social enterprise. Ms Göncz, for example, stressed this in the context of social inclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully agree with making progress in this area in close cooperation with Michel Barnier, who spoke before me in the Chamber. Our DGs also work with the representatives of the Member States. Last week, there was a seminar in Brussels for Member State representatives to promote social enterprise and the social economy in the general context in all Member States; this also has a capacity for including disadvantaged groups in the labour market, such as people with a disability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, to support all these measures, whether for youth or for the social economy, we cannot avoid the question of the financial instruments. There is an ongoing debate in Parliament and in the Council on the next MFF. We should not focus just on the current reallocations. We should also focus on secure funding for the financial instruments that can directly help the people. This is primarily the European Social Fund, which needs its secure minimum share, as you saw in the Commission’s proposal. And I could not agree more with Ms Harkin concerning the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). I think discontinuing the EGF would be really problematic and I hope I can rely on the support of this House in the struggle to save the EGF for the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">With EU unemployment hitting record levels and forecasts of a dramatic economic outlook for the months ahead, we, as socialists, should come up with a set of concrete measures to boost jobs for the citizens of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU needs a dynamic and inclusive European labour market and we need investments for job creation, mainstreaming of the ILO’s decent work agenda, protection of labour law in SMEs, combating of illegal work and forced self-employment, and minimum wages to fight in-work poverty and social dumping. Moreover, we should continue to fight to obtain some other important aspects which are essential for the wealth of the citizens like: solidarity in taxation systems, coordinated collective bargaining as a factor for social cohesion, and the fight against in-work poverty through living wages.</p>
      <p sl="en">To accelerate job creation, we need proposals towards a European Investment Plan, a coherent European industrial strategy and investment in public services, based on new sources of revenue, including a financial transaction tax and eurobonds, giving priority to investments that promote a sustainable economy, quality jobs and social justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I appreciate that the EC sent a strong message to governments to lift restrictions on labour market access for workers from Bulgaria and Romania.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Referring in its communication of 19 April on employment to the importance of the minimum wage and decent working conditions, the Commission distances itself from the austerity strategy and deregulation of the labour market which certain European states continue to pursue. The austerity meted out to workers, as we have regrettably seen in Greece and Spain, has only had disastrous results, causing unemployment and poverty. The proposal tabled by the European executive can also be improved by introducing more specific aspects with a political direction. The European Union needs to draft urgently a common investment plan in which priority will be given to investments generating high-quality jobs and to those made in the education, health or research sectors. In order to support these investments, Member States have no other option but to show their solidarity. The financial transaction tax and pooling part of the public debt are a must in order to prevent a repeat of the tragic story of a Europe torn asunder.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The draft resolution of the EP – Towards an Economic Recovery –is highly specific and describes all aspects and problems of unemployment and the possibility for economic development and growth. The problem is that we are describing the problems very precisely; we know about them and are even proposing solutions, but it is taking us a long time to implement the solutions in practice. If we want to solve unemployment, we cannot continuously come up with solutions on our own initiative; rather, the Commission should propose across-the-board legislation that would allow us to address the areas of education, employment, support, mobility, productivity, and the use of unused funds from the Structural Funds. Joint assistance to States whose economies are in trouble is necessary, but it is very difficult to explain in, for example, my country, Slovakia, where the minimum wage is EUR 327, that we must help, say, Spain, where the minimum wage is twice that of Slovakia. Therefore, the measures for economic growth must be adopted rapidly and applied in the individual Member States.</p>

      <p sl="de">I expect the European Commission to finally learn the lessons of the crisis. There are some good ideas, but there is a lack of commitment. I welcome proposals such as support for start-ups, the overdue consultation paper on the quality framework for internships, or the youth initiative to give young people some career prospects. However, well-intentioned proposals do not reduce youth unemployment. Improving the quality of work and strong codetermination must remain key elements of European policy. I reject the idea of the uniform contract of employment, which is another attempt to erode protection from termination of employment. I also take a highly critical view of a new tripartite pay monitoring committee at European level. The EU Treaty excludes the possibility of intervening in wage setting. It must stay that way. Along with the trade unions, we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would warn against using the crisis to undermine the autonomy of the social partners.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am perplexed by the title of the Commission’s report: ‘Towards a jobs-rich recovery’. I ask the Commission: is there such a thing as a jobs-poor recovery? Governments, not least the European Commission, cannot create jobs. They can only create the conditions which allow jobs to be generated. And it is patently obvious that the EU is not doing this. By diverting energy towards ‘creating a jobs-rich recovery’, the EU is heading towards a ‘jobs-poor spiral’. It should focus its effort on cutting red tape and on strengthening the single market. Only when it is easier for companies across the EU to do business shall we shall see a turnaround in the recent shocking EU unemployment figures. The Commission must learn that regulation is a barrier to growth and jobs, rather than a catalyst. I take, for example, EU rules on the sugar industry, which – because they are so inflexible and applied even more inflexibly – have already cost jobs in my constituency of London and are threatening a further 4 500 highly-skilled jobs across the European Union. The Commission should stop strategising on how to legislate more and focus on how it can legislate less and – with any luck – better.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by János Áder, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (COM(2010)0781 – C7-0011/2011 – 2010/0377(COD)) (A7-0339/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-545-000" speaker_id="28252" name="Richard Seeber" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, today I have the honour of representing our former fellow Member, János Áder, who dealt with this report. I should like to take this opportunity to thank him and to wish him all the best in his new job. As you know, he is now the new President of Hungary. It is particularly important for Hungary that we have someone who has such strong ties with the European Union and here in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">This directive is an adaptation of the Seveso II Directive, and it is concerned with preventing major chemical accidents, such as have occurred here in Europe in Seveso, Schweizerhalle, Toulouse, and so on, or if accidents do occur, initiating appropriate protection measures for the population and the environment. The Seveso II Directive has been very successful. It now needs to be aligned with the regulation on the classification, labelling and packaging of dangerous substances and mixtures, known as the CLP Regulation, which will enter into force on 1 June 2015, and with it its Annex I, which lists the relevant dangerous substances for the establishments. That is why this adaptation is now necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Europe, we have around 10 000 chemical establishments that directly produce these substances and are affected. At this point, I should like to add that it is important that we keep our strong chemicals industry in Europe. We have just been discussing jobs. We need this industrial base if we are to be able to offer jobs long-term. At the same time, we must naturally ensure that the environment and also people are protected from the dangers that such establishments present.</p>
      <p sl="de">The revision should also serve to enhance the level of protection, not decrease it. That is why we must work to improve implementation and, naturally, also to enable the establishments to compete on equal terms.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our approach to harmonising the terms on which the establishments compete was, naturally, to try to reduce the overall administrative burden as far as possible in all the Member States. This is indeed a major challenge for us Europeans. Many of our global competitors have very lax regulations and, of course, this makes things very difficult for our enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another reason for the adaptation was the Aarhus Convention. As you know, this is a convention that the European Union has also signed up to for improved public access to information on access to the judicial system. In this area, we have been able to make substantial improvements that will give people living in the immediate vicinity of such establishments better access to justice and also enhanced information rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">The main problems have been with the Council. In particular, we tried to have inhaled substances included. In the main, this was accepted. There are time-limited exemptions only for seven substances. In the case of substances that affect the skin – or toxicity category 3, to put it in technical terms – we succeeded in getting three substances included, while the rest are not. Nonetheless, as part of the agreement, the Commission will investigate whether they can be included in the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament also considers it important that we prevailed in respect of the alignment of Annex I. The ordinary legislative procedure will be used here, not the delegated act planned by the Commission or the implementing act planned by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point, I should like to express my heartfelt thanks once again to all the shadow rapporteurs that our strong position in Parliament has enabled us to assert ourselves against the Council and the Commission. We have achieved significant improvements. I would like to thank all those involved once again, and repeat my good wishes to János Áder as he takes up his new position.</p>

    <intervention id="3-546-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="John Dalli" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, we stand on the threshold of a first reading agreement on the revision of the so-called Seveso Directive on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr János Áder, who is today represented by Mr Seeber, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for the excellent work carried out on this proposal; and, in absentia, congratulate Mr Áder on his new responsibilities at the very highest level in his home country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Industrial accidents often have serious, even devastating, consequences: workers are killed; the public is exposed to chemicals resulting in immediate injury or long-term health impacts; water sources are polluted; companies may have to close. Some well-known major accidents like Seveso, Bhopal, Toulouse and Buncefield have taken many lives and cost billions of euro.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Seveso II Directive, which dates back to 1996, addresses this by setting rules for operators and competent authorities of Member States. Rules focus on accident prevention, through safety management, inspections and land-use planning. When accidents do happen, Seveso seeks to limit the consequences for man and the environment, through appropriate information and emergency planning.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is satisfied with the compromise text on which Parliament is invited to vote, which aligns the directive with the new international rules on the classification of chemicals and significantly improves the EU rules on accident prevention and control.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me explain why. Firstly, the rules on inspections are far more detailed and effective than before, imposing inspection action plans covering all establishments and ensuring follow-up by operators. Secondly, the rights of citizens are better guaranteed. Citizens will have easier access to more information, including on inspections, and their participation in land-use planning projects will be better guaranteed by strict procedures. Finally, in case those rights are not respected as they should be, citizens will now have the right to go to court, in line with the EU commitment under the Aarhus Convention.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that this will allow citizens to exert the necessary pressure on operators and competent authorities to implement – in the best way – the Seveso legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The way the scope of the directive has been defined was a major issue in the negotiations, and will now reinforce the level of protection of citizens and the environment as the rules will now also apply to establishments handling substances with inhalation vapour toxicity, which were previously not covered. However, we consider that there is a need to deepen our knowledge regarding substances displaying dermal toxicity. The Commission is therefore making the following declaration, announcing its intention to further analyse the consequences of accidents involving such substances: ‘The Commission acknowledges that the compromise reached on its proposal implies an improvement of the level of protection of human health and safety and of the environment as compared with that provided by the current Seveso II Directive 96/82/EC. The Commission intends to undertake a further analysis of the likelihood, risks and potential consequences of major accidents involving dangerous substances classified acute toxic 3 dermal. Depending on the outcome of the analysis, the Commission may present a legislative proposal to also include this category within the scope of the directive’. This may lead to a legislative proposal to amend the scope of the directive on this point, if deemed necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, the European Commission can support the compromise package in order to reach an agreement on this directive at first reading.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, is this nothing more than a facelift? Or, given the accidents and natural disasters we have experienced since 1996, are we progressing towards greater safety for people, the environment and society, without pointlessly encumbering industry? It was to try to achieve this goal that I agreed to be rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After listening and exchanging opinions with others, we were keen to propose amendments which, without calling the industrial process into question, would bring about greater safety for citizens and the environment and give new rights to those who are the first to be exposed –the employees of companies in the chemical and transport industries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Quite frankly, our views were given scant regard. Once again, money overrode the human aspect, and progress will be marginal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The problem is that there is still a gulf between the lofty principles discussed and the harsh daily reality on the ground. This is true of industrial installations and storage facilities and for the transport of dangerous substances. To evade the so-called Seveso legislation, companies have chosen to reduce stocks of products classified as dangerous, leaving in storage tanks these same products which, maybe tonight, will sleep somewhere near you while waiting to be delivered tomorrow morning with all the risks that that entails. This cannot be allowed to happen. Meanwhile, we were being led to believe that we would be better informed and better protected!</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, major contradictions emerge. How can security be strengthened when, day by day, employees are being placed in an increasingly precarious situation and are not always trained as they should be? How can security be guaranteed when some countries use their laxity to carry out environmental dumping?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the amendments to the Seveso II Directive stem from the need to align it with the regulation on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, and not from an increase in the number of major accidents, so I most definitely agree that there is no need to change the Seveso II system.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I do, however, consider the addition and clarification of provisions relating to providing information to the public, public consultation and participation of the public in decision making to be of particular importance. It is very important that this information be complete and relevant. We do not want to overwhelm the public with unnecessary information, but we do want the information to be clearly worded and easy to understand. Keeping the public informed is vital in building trust as well as in raising public awareness of the correct action to take in the event of a major accident.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Annex I is a key element of the Seveso II Directive and is essential for setting the scope of the directive. Therefore, amendments to Annex I should be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure, and here I agree with the principal rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="sl">We are living in a time where we have the knowledge and the skills to prevent such accidents with the best available technologies. We can also support safety with the use of powerful information technologies.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Are we sufficiently aware of all the ways in which we can prevent accidents? It is for this reason that I welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur. It might be appropriate perhaps to flag up the clear impact of accidents on animal health.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Legislation by itself does not bring change for the better. We need to focus more energy on communication concerning prevention methods and emergency situations.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Inhaling vapours and aerosols containing hazardous substances may cause serious long-term consequences but, in the short term, we may not even notice them.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Environmental health, human and animal health, the health of nature, once lost is lost forever, and we will know it when we lose it. It is very difficult to restore something to its original condition once it comes into contact with harmful substances.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Áder, Commissioner Dalli, the Danish Presidency and all of the other rapporteurs from the various groups for their excellent cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It was important to my group that we maintain, and preferably increase, the protection of people and the environment when revising this directive. I think we have succeeded in that aim. All Seveso facilities are required, under the Seveso III Directive, to develop a Major Accident Prevention Policy (MAPP), which is to be implemented by means of a Safety Management System. This applies unless the Member States decide differently on the basis of a risk analysis. This is a step forward.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This agreement tightens up the requirements relating to internal and external emergency plans, the requirements relating to the carrying out of inspections by the Member States and the requirement to take into account ‘domino effects’ – that is to say, external circumstances that could aggravate the accident – and it improves the information provided to the general public somewhat. Certain information concerning the establishments is to be available electronically at all times, even for those establishments with the lower safety classification.</p>
      <p sl="sv">My group would have liked to have gone a little further when it comes to protecting the environment and people, however, by extending the scope of the directive. We would also have liked to have improved the information provided to the general public. The fact that ordinary legislation will now be required in order to amend the criteria that govern which establishments are covered by Seveso III is not an optimum solution, either. However, in view of the fact that the Council was not able to agree to amend this via delegated acts, this was the only option.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Nevertheless, we think that, overall, this is a good agreement and we will vote in favour of it tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it took us long enough to finally manage to agree on a more ambitious Seveso III Directive. However, we can be pleased overall with what we have managed to achieve in the agreement at first reading during the Danish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The tragic experience from major industrial accidents in the last few decades, such as Bhopal in India in 1984 and Toulouse in France in 2001, highlighted a pressing need to revise and update European Union legislation in this area.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Although the Council was not as ambitious as Parliament on the issues concerning the scope of the directive and public access to information and justice, we managed to stand up for the need for higher standards of access to information, including online information. We also successfully reached agreement on exempting certain substances so that they are managed using the codecision procedure and not by delegated acts.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Mr Áder also introduced greater flexibility compared to what was envisaged by the Commission with a prerogative for Member States. The final report has provided major improvements regarding the scope of the directive and the provisions on exempting substances, although I personally regret that we were unable to go further on the requirements for access to information and company inspections.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We can be pleased, on the whole, that this new, improved directive reinforces a few important proposals for protecting health and the environment, as well as for transparent information and the rights of European citizens to have access to information.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Áder and wish him all the best in his new role as President of Hungary.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I think it is unfortunate that the Council is not here, as I think it ought to have tried to defend publicly what it stood for in the negotiations, namely, a cynical zero sum game in which the reclassification of chemicals will not result in any increase in protection. Instead, we have a zero sum game concerning the number of facilities that we want to be covered by the directive, rather than considering the health benefits and protection against accidents. It was unfortunate that the Council took that attitude. In the end, however, we obtained an agreement that will, in fact, work better in many ways, as Ms Westlund and others have mentioned. It was particularly important that we did not exclude whole categories of chemicals, as the Council initially wanted to do.</p>
      <p sl="sv">On the other hand, there are a number of tasks that the Commission still has to do, including investigating the requirement for insurance. This is something that I think is extremely important for the Commission to get on with now. It must not be the case that the costs are passed on to the general public when these companies cannot manage to keep their facilities intact, clean and in good condition. Instead, this is something that they must insure themselves against. This must not be a burden borne by taxpayers.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, more and more people live close to factories and businesses that work with dangerous substances and chemicals. That involves risks to their lives and health and irreparable damage to the environment.</p>
      <p sl="da">From 2015, there will be stricter rules for the roughly 10 000 businesses that are subject to the new Seveso Directive. The object of the directive is to prevent and control accidents involving dangerous chemical substances and provide citizens with information. That is a good thing. However, as a result of the opposition in the Council, the opportunity to protect citizens and the environment in the event of an accident has not been exploited to the maximum extent. Our populations must be kept safe, even if they live close to a business that uses substances that are dangerous to inhale or that can be dangerous in some other way in the event of an accident.</p>
      <p sl="da">The most positive thing with the proposal, however, is that the citizens of the EU now have access to more information. All high-risk businesses must draw up a prevention policy and continuously improve their level of safety and make this publicly available on the Internet. I therefore support this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we agree with the rapporteur that parts 1 and 2 of Annex I cannot be changed through delegated acts. We want to ensure that the scope is not excessively widened without adequate counterbalancing exemptions, for the result would be a disproportionate increase in costs given the likely environmental and health benefits. Moreover, a significant increase in administrative costs due to the need to align with the Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation would especially affect users downstream and small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are therefore well aware of the concerns expressed by the European industrial associations that are calling for option B to be selected. This would involve leaving the scope of the Seveso II Directive virtually unchanged, for it is well established and has been shown to work effectively. The broad-scope or open approach has been used for every new environmental regulation affecting industry. We believe that it is a poor way to legislate, because ideology ends up predominating over practical realities. We support the idea of extending the directive’s scope – in Article 2 – to offshore platforms and the associated oil and gas pipelines, along with carbon capture and storage (CCS) plants and salt cavities.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, industrial accidents with dangerous substances are, unfortunately, a reality of our times. Information for the public and their participation in decision making is not just a right, it is a necessity: only an informed population can limit the dangers and only a population that decides to do so can protect itself from abuses. Prevention and limitation of the consequences are the first priorities, so I welcome this proposal. However, when we see that even recently, in Hungary, the poorest of the poor were abandoned following the toxic sludge spill, and when we see that, in the chemical accident in Bhopal, India, hundreds of thousands of victims were left to their fate at the same time as the company was operating and making a profit in Europe, we cannot remain ignorant; we cannot forget. There is also a need for these companies to be held financially and criminally responsible, and for even more transparency.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, unfortunately, the development of environmental policy is often such that new environmental requirements are only adopted when there is some sort of major accident. The aim of environmental legislation should not only be about response but, above all, prevention, in order to stop such accidents. In future, we must go further and apply the so-called precautionary principle. The directive being debated today is especially intended to ensure that legal requirements are in line with technological progress. Sadly, it is regrettable that we are not ambitious enough and are so far trying to catch up with reality. For instance, offshore hydrocarbon exploration, extraction and transportation do not yet fall within the scope of the directive. It probably makes little difference whether a tanker is carrying oil or gas or, for instance, ammonia. In every case where there is an accident, the damage is significant. However, I am very pleased about the inclusion of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention in this document. In my opinion, citizens have the right to obtain information, participate in decision making and have access to justice. I believe that all of this will ensure a high level of environmental protection. It is important for citizens to receive information about actions in the event of a possible accident and for them to receive information about the date objects are inspected. I would like to give my congratulations to the rapporteur Mr János Áder, who I believe has done a great job and would like to wish the Hungarian Presidency good luck.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Seveso, Enschede, Toulouse – these places are synonymous with major disasters that result not just in environmental disaster, but also in loss of life and the destruction of private property. That is why we must do everything we can to reduce the risk, as well as the likelihood, of such accidents being repeated.</p>
      <p sl="de">How do we do that? Firstly, we must allow even unscheduled inspections, and it must not be simply routine. The people who live close to such industrial establishments must be very well informed of what is going on there, what happens there. In the event of an incident, we must make sure that the situation is clarified promptly. This is very important, because it can save human lives.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think the Council has not done itself any favours here. I also think the Council should be here for this debate in Parliament. Apparently, however, other things are more important. I think the Council might have saved face if it had explained why this legislation has been watered down. That is what I would have liked to see. However, strong legislation in this area will also create confidence. This confidence is needed when the Member States plan large infrastructure projects. At such times, there are always major reservations among the population. Strong legislation here, such as we have achieved today, creates confidence; and that is only possible where there is the greatest possible degree of transparency. It also requires authorities to be better networked with each other, to cooperate more with each other; we also need more communication, and dealing with such large, dangerous establishments must never become routine. We must not allow that to happen.</p>

It is not a straightforward task to ensure that the environment and citizens are protected without being disproportionately restrictive, and there was always a chance of double regulation, which I believe we have now avoided.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to particularly thank the Commissioner for his additional declaration today. Investigation and analysis of real-time information is always welcome to facilitate evidence-based policy making and legislation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, amendment of the Seveso II Directive is an essential step towards being more effective in preventing disasters such as those which occurred in Italy, France and Japan, costing many lives. They destroyed public and private property and damaged the environment, resulting in costs of the order of billions of euro. The directive is important because it places obligations on operators and on authorities in the Member States to prevent accidents and limit their consequences. The European Union should systematically tighten legislation on inspection and risk analysis. Revision of the directive will improve coordination of legislation and will therefore put an end to the unnecessary duplication of inspections. It should also be pointed out that sub-contractors should be subject to special supervision, because it is often they who are negligent, as we saw in Hudson Bay. The European Parliament, which represents the citizens, should be able to play a full part in this decision-making process, so I support the view of the rapporteur that amendments to current legislation should be made under the ordinary legislative procedure.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Commission should also keep Parliament regularly informed about industrial accidents and the responses made to them. Public opinion must also have easier access to transparent and reliable information about possible dangers and what to do if an accident should occur. The Internet is an effective tool for making people aware of these issues. It should be put to use as quickly as possible, starting with an information campaign regarding the new classification of toxic substances and the hazards they pose to life.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, there was a major fireworks disaster in Enschede in the Netherlands 12 years ago. It claimed the lives of 23 people and made the headlines all over the world. Last year, we had a major fire at Chemie-Pack in Moerdijk, a company that had long provided insufficient information. It was all simply down to inadequate enforcement. Also, when it comes to the fireworks disaster in Enschede, people knew for a long time what was going on in that company; they had been given free rein for a very long time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Every time a disaster of this kind happens, we go modifying legislation. However, we first of all need to properly supervise enforcement, because that is the most important element. I think it is a good thing, though, that this directive has now been revised because, indeed, transparency for the citizens, knowing what happens within a company, is extremely important and does, indeed, inspire confidence. In particular, the fact that such information is now also available on the Internet is very important right now. It provides our citizens with easy access to this kind of data.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, the fact that a single body is not in charge of the provision of information and that the municipalities or authorities do not always have the expertise to carry out proper inspections continues to be a problem. We really have to work on that. We need more support for the authorities to carry out inspections properly and we also need to inform the emergency services thereof. We need to ensure good provision of information for the citizens so that their faith in us can be justified.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, we are debating a very important directive. Accidents involving dangerous substances are rare occurrences. However, when they do occur, the repercussions are tragic for citizens in the area and long-term and affect numerous generations. We have managed to improve the legislation; however, there are issues which we did not have the courage to address. We did not have the courage to include, for example, oil drilling platforms, despite tragic experiences in numerous countries of the European Union, despite the tragic experience from the accident in Mexico and despite the tragic repercussions on the economy, marine life and citizens. I think that citizens often expect more from us, from all the European institutions, and I truly hope that next time, we shall include platforms and be more responsive to public demands.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, we Austrians were indirectly affected by the toxic sludge disaster in Hungary in 2010. The population was extremely concerned and felt very insecure. I therefore welcome the Seveso III initiative, even if, like the previous speaker, Matthias Groote, I agree that some Member States tried very hard to water it down.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would really urge you to be responsive to the population here. We need this transparency; we need the information. What we need, above all, is to be covered financially. We cannot allow all these precautions and, in the event of a disaster, the costs of that disaster to be passed on to the public. I really feel we need emergency plans that involve the population; emergency plans that really deal with the concerns of those living in the vicinity. In conclusion, all life is chemical, but dangerous chemicals need to be kept under control. Seveso III could have been an opportunity to take somewhat more stringent action in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would like to thank my fellow Members, especially Mr Áder and Mr Seeber, for their valuable work on the revision of the Seveso Directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As we debate the Seveso Directive, my thoughts turn to the accident that occurred in France, AZF – you will recall – in Toulouse. On 21 September 2001, a stock of ammonium nitrate exploded killing 31 people and wounding a further 2 500, who are still traumatised to this day. The damage caused was unbelievable. This was not due to the lack of risk assessment management. It was due to the subcontracting of subcontractors, that is to say, untrained people. The training of employees is also the best form of security.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any event, give or take a few minor details, I am pleased with the final result, in particular, the essential advances in the management of industrial risks, against which we need to protect our citizens in the race to underinvestment in safety features by integrating the requirements of the Aarhus Convention. This is very important for informing citizens in the interests of transparency, and it is a sine qua non of the organisation of an effective risk management plan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have one reservation, Commissioner, which is that there is no assessment of the financial consequences of a major accident and proof of the capacity of companies to address them. That, in my opinion, is a shortcoming of this directive.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council was the main stimulus for the revision of the Seveso Directive. Although, in the revision of this directive, the Commission introduces a new, more sophisticated classification system that distinguishes three categories of toxicity and differentiates between five possible routes of exposure, and proposes a tightening of the existing rules for inspections, some areas of safety protection are not adequately covered in it. In particular, regulation of accountability relationships in the use of subcontractor services is missing, as are provisions on the transport of hazardous loads and their temporary storage in areas which are not covered by the directive. Another serious deficiency of the draft is that there is too much scope for granting derogations to Member States. A number of disasters in recent years have drawn our attention to the fact that, in order to guarantee the safety of equipment, it is necessary to take account of natural risks that are not included in the draft, in addition to the technological risks. I therefore consider it highly necessary to support all the draft amendments of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy which address the shortcomings of the draft submitted by the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I believe that the debate has made it clear to us that while we are not happy with this compromise, that is the nature of compromise. Perhaps we could have gone further, but it was mainly a case of blocking by the Council. The debate has also clearly shown that we have to pay attention to good implementation. I believe it is one of the main problems of European environmental legislation that we sometimes create very good law, but that some Member States are very slow and lax in implementing it. That is worth drawing attention to here, in the case of Seveso III, because it is specifically concerned with human lives that are put at risk if they live close to such chemical establishments. There is a certain danger potential, and that needs to be properly managed.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has also been made clear that the instruments available, such as emergency plans and so on, should be as precise as possible and should involve the public, so that every citizen knows how to react in the event of a worst case scenario – if such an accident occurs. Well thought-out plans can save a great many human lives. We all know that time is of the essence here; as is, of course, the training given to safety personnel, both those in the establishment itself and those from the area affected.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also key that trust is built up in the population, so that the population feels included, and, of course, prevention is also important. In the case of prevention, too, the management of the establishment is key, as is the local management in the area concerned. We may consider ourselves lucky that, with the ordinary legislative procedure, we have ensured that Parliament is fully involved in the adaptation of this Annex I. We have to make sure that we are not pushed aside here. We have succeeded in that. I would therefore like to end by reiterating that overall, I believe the compromise is in order. Naturally, we might have wanted to go further, but for the sake of agreement with the Council and the Commission, we can accept it.</p>

I know that Mr Seeber has dealt with the procedure in Parliament very well, having taken this over from János Áder. My question is simply: we are now concluding this at first reading, as we do for as much as 65% of our environmental legislation. My question to the rapporteur is whether we might not perhaps have been able to achieve greater transparency, even though the Council took a blocking attitude, if we had taken it to a second reading? This is a fundamental issue. Richard, I realise that you took this over. However, I would like to hear the current rapporteur’s view on this.</p>

The agreement of the shadow rapporteurs also demonstrates that we have, in fact, achieved the best compromise.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Entering into force in 2015, this directive will increase the safety of the operation of plants working with hazardous materials, thereby ensuring better protection for citizens and the prevention of accidents. I supported the approach advocated by the rapporteur in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, namely, that the level of health and environmental protection should be at least equal to or higher than the current level. To achieve an equal level of protection and prevention throughout Europe, Member States must arrange for the exchange of best practices and the sharing of necessary information. This would allow for a quicker identification of the causes of accidents and the mitigation of negative consequences. It is important to note that in the future, any extension of the scope of the directive must be preceded by impact assessment. The stipulation that amendments to Annex I must be made in an ordinary legislative procedure is an important aspect with regard to the role of Parliament in the legislative process. In the interest of citizens, operators must inform and cooperate with local authorities and must assume liability for any accidents. A reduction in the administrative burdens of small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector can be implemented only if an appropriate level of protection is maintained. In the interest of preserving the health and safety of citizens and preventing disasters, facilities covered by the Seveso Directive must, without exception, comply with the best available techniques.</p>

      <p sl="ro">History provides us with too many examples of devastating industrial accidents involving hazardous chemicals, which claim lives and destroy the environment. Although EU legislation has progressed, in order to reduce the frequency and impact of these accidents, the accident which occurred in Hungary in 2010 made us all realise that improvements and revisions to EU regulations are still required so as to reinforce the protection provided to communities and the environment against these potential disasters.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I have been opposing for several years a mining project in Romania which, in the event of an accident, would affect, through cyanide pollution, a vast area which is valuable in terms of both the environment and biodiversity, and of its culture and history. The general public are quite rightly concerned by the fact that initiators of such projects refuse to be transparent and give the public access to objective, balanced information. They must be bound by law to provide accurate, complete information, thereby guaranteeing transparency.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome the fact that this report emphasises the point about informing the public and the rights of citizens to know about the potential hazards on their doorstep.

      <p sl="hu">The 2010 red mud spill in Hungary demonstrated that no matter how strict the rules for hazardous establishments are, negligent operation and inadequate state monitoring can still allow accidents to happen. It also proved that compensation for accidental damage is only guaranteed if the operator has comprehensive environmental insurance. I welcome the fact that in his report, Mr Áder proposed the introduction of mandatory insurance in the European Union. Depositing industrial and mining waste cannot be considered a final solution. The amounts deposited should be reduced to a minimum, and efforts should be made to recycle the waste generated. Red mud could yield considerable quantities of iron ore, as well as chromium, copper, nickel and other valuable metals. The available procedures to extract these are not yet economical. The European Union should therefore support research into more efficient and more economical ways of recycling industrial and mining waste, including red mud.</p>

The legislation in question reinforces the policy not only for preventing chemical accidents, but also for the manner in which the responsible operators and authorities respond in the event of accidents, so that a high level of protection is ensured for human health and the environment. Apart from operators having to implement a number of measures with the role of continually improving the activities preventing major accidents, tighter standards are also being introduced for carrying out inspections at industrial installations. It is of paramount importance for the general public to be able to access information about their legitimate concerns over the safety of the environment they live in, as well as information about the nature of the response in the event of accidents involving hazardous substances.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, all forms of gender-based violence constitute an unacceptable violation of fundamental rights and a clear obstacle to gender equality. Female genital mutilation is one form of violence against women that is particularly unacceptable. It is degrading, it violates fundamental rights, it violates the right to health and it violates children’s rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">An estimated three million women and girls in the world suffer female genital mutilation every year. Up to half a million women living in Europe have suffered genital mutilation already and many thousands are at risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">Female genital mutilation can, under no circumstances, be justified by cultural or religious traditions and practices. It has both immediate and long-term consequences for the health of women and can cause death. The Commission is determined to take concrete action and develop a strong policy response to tackle the issue of violence against women in Europe. Female genital mutilation is of particular concern. The Commission has already said so in its strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015.</p>
      <p sl="en">The lack of reliable and comparable data is a huge challenge. My colleague, Vice-President Viviane Reding, has asked the European Institute for Gender Equality to assess the reliability and comparability of data available in Member States and to identify data gaps. On this basis, the institute will report on the state of play with regard to this phenomenon, and of the replies drawn up in the Member States. We should get a report in the second half of 2012. Its results will help us to take even better informed action in this field.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2011 and 2012, the Commission has made funding available for combating harmful practices through the Daphne III Programme. Financial support will be granted for the implementation of transnational projects to grass-roots organisations working to prevent such practices by raising awareness and changing social attitudes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although there is no specific EU-wide legislation on female genital mutilation, it is criminalised in most EU Member States, either through specific laws or under the general criminal codes. A large majority of EU Member States have also included the principle of extraterritoriality in their criminal provisions, thus enabling prosecutions to be brought for female genital mutilation that has been committed outside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is taking measures in the criminal justice area and has proposed legislation on the rights of victims of crime. The aim with the Victims Directive is to ensure that all victims across the European Union have a basic set of minimum rights, that they are treated as individuals and receive appropriate treatment. This instrument notably aims at ensuring that the needs of victims are individually assessed and that the most vulnerable, including victims of female genital mutilation, receive specific treatment appropriate to their needs. The Commission proposal, with changes proposed by the European Parliament, will significantly improve the situation for women as victims of violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU also addresses the issue of female genital mutilation in its external actions. It supports advocacy and lobbying initiatives for promoting and protecting women’s rights and prohibiting harmful practices. The Commission and the European External Action Service systematically raise the issue of female genital mutilation in their dialogue with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. In this framework, we underline the need for African states to ensure that female genital mutilation is legally prohibited and that legislation prohibiting female genital mutilation is effectively enforced.</p>
      <p sl="en">We strongly support the United Nations General Assembly’s planned resolution to ban female genital mutilation. It is crucial that the countries with the highest occurrence of female genital mutilation, in particular, in Africa, take ownership of this resolution. The European External Action Service is currently preparing a campaign, under the EU human rights guidelines on violence against women and girls, to draw attention to the need to step up efforts to eradicate this practice, particularly on the African continent.</p>
      <p sl="en">Female genital mutilation is an extreme and unacceptable practice. The Commission is determined to combat it and to help empower women inside and outside the European Union through legislation, financial programmes and a range of other means, including support to grass-roots organisations.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the battle against genital mutilation continues. Politics and civic engagement must defeat this social scourge, which scars millions of women for life. The Union must treat this crime in a coordinated manner with uniform severity and penalties.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some partial success has already been achieved. The mutilations are, at last, considered a blight, a form of child abuse, a violation of human rights, and a form of gender-based violence. Great credit must go to the women of Africa for their courage in believing in a struggle that is often fraught with danger. Structural changes have now been made in the cultures of origin to recast the role of women. The problem has not died out, however, not even in the European Union, and these clan traditions are still perpetuated in clandestine fashion on too wide a scale.</p>
      <p sl="it">The institutions must not let up in their campaign against this blight, to eradicate this crime. That is why points 6, 7 and 8 of the resolution call on the Commission to take a series of steps to keep up the pressure in the war against this scourge. A global strategy to combat violence against women must include common actions against genital mutilations, including information, especially in education programmes for girls, in EU countries and third countries alike. We have endorsed this with our support for the resolution on the fight against female sexual mutilations perpetrated in the Union, as voted through with a large parliamentary majority in February 2009. I recall that I was the rapporteur, and I also recall, sadly, despite what the Commissioner has said today, that we still cannot intervene effectively enough to make this offence punishable to the same extent in all 27 Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, female genital mutilation is a vile expression of unequal power relationships between genders; a form of violence against women and of violating their human rights that cannot be tolerated for cultural, religious or any other reasons. It is therefore crucial to incorporate the fight against female genital mutilation into a general and coherent approach to combating gender-based violence and, specifically, that against women, as well as into the struggle for universal respect for human rights. By allocating adequate funds, the European Union, Member States and partners can coordinate on financing innovative programmes and disseminating best practices that meet the needs of young women in vulnerable situations, providing them with easy access to these programmes and services. We also need to support civil society organisations and the awareness raising, mobilisation and training programmes that they carry out in at-risk communities, in Europe and on other continents.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to follow the recommendations of this European Parliament resolution that they incorporate women’s rights and the emancipation of women of all ages throughout European external policy, in line with the 2012 gender action plan. It is crucial to involve national, regional and local authorities, as well as civil society in third countries.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the scourge of female genital mutilation is one of the crudest expressions of gender inequality.</p>
      <p sl="es">Men own women in some cultures and they maintain that position on three premises: the use of force, their dominant position in society, and superstitions and myths.</p>
      <p sl="es">Prevention of genital mutilation therefore requires combating the arguments used by men to justify this form of violence, through education. These efforts should focus on the victims.</p>
      <p sl="es">Women throughout the world should learn that genital mutilation is unacceptable, for basic self-respect, and men should understand that this aberration underscores their insecurities and fear of failure. We must therefore act, Commissioner, in a firmer and more emphatic manner against this phenomenon, to eradicate it through a combination of EU law and continuing to help with education and awareness.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, this resolution which, I hope, we will unanimously vote in favour of tomorrow because it is so self-evident, forms part of a United Nations-wide strategy of an international call for the prohibition of genital mutilation. It is very important that, through our resolution, we are able to support this international strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Several years ago, a number of women, including Chantal Compaoré, who is the First Lady of Burkina Faso, undertook to make this call at international level. As has been said, other European countries agreed to the ban a long time ago. We must therefore be able to move forward on this matter, and our resolution may contribute to this at the UN General Assembly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Above all, we have to realise that, although the ban is an extremely important step politically as a signal, this obviously does not mean that we need not work to the full extent with the women and groups of women who employ these practices. This is not a practice employed by men but, unfortunately, by women. We must be able to support programmes through prevention and guidance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If there is a general ban, taken up by the United Nations, there will be a monitoring and support strategy, as there is in other matters, in the case of anti-personnel landmines and others. It is very important if we are to eradicate this scourge for all women, everywhere, in the long term.</p>

So I am glad we are having this debate today, because FGM is carried out on women who live here in Europe. FGM is illegal in the UK and the law extends to protect citizens even if they are taken abroad for this procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">All Member States must take firm action to combat this illegal practice. We need to ensure that Europe is doing all it can to safeguard girls and women, thus setting an example to the developing world.</p>

      <p sl="sv">I would like to emphasise that the fight against female genital mutilation, both in Europe and worldwide, must go hand in hand with stepping up the work for increased equality between men and women at all levels of society. This also means strengthening women’s sexual and reproductive rights and their right to decide on matters relating to their own body and their own sexuality.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In Europe, we must be careful not to single out particular cultures or groups; instead, we must work at strengthening the position of girls and women within society as a whole, in both majority and minority groups. Targeted efforts to prevent female genital mutilation are also necessary, however, in cooperation with women’s organisations and other key players.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I would like to emphasise the fact that, in this resolution, we are clearly urging the Commission once again to present a proposal for an EU strategy to prevent violence against women, as a cohesive strategy like this will enable us to take effective and forceful EU measures to combat female genital mutilation in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am voting firmly and with conviction in favour of Parliament’s resolution to combat the brutal practice of female genital mutilation. Fighting this inhumane practice means not only opposing a barbaric act meted out to 140 million women, 500 000 of whom are in Europe, but also battling to end the heinous discrimination to which the female sex continues to be subjected.</p>
      <p sl="it">Female genital mutilation has irreversible consequences for a woman’s mental and physical health. Infections, the risk of contracting AIDS, birth problems and the compromising of future pregnancies are just some of the consequences of this violent imposition perpetrated using rudimentary, unsterilised instruments. Furthermore, given that the practice is inflicted on girls under 15 years of age, it must be considered no less than a violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, the European Commission needs to recognise this crime in order that financial resources can be allocated to combating it. The support of all civil society is needed. Thus, Member States will be able to act together in concert against the continuing violence against women worldwide.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would first like to pay tribute to all the mutilated women and girls who have had the courage to tell of their suffering.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is important to know exactly what genital mutilation is. We always think of the excision of the clitoris, but there is also infibulation. Allow me to describe it to you. The labia majora are also removed, the vulva is sutured with string or with acacia spines until scarring occurs covering the vagina and the urethra.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To permit urination, menstruation and the evacuation of vaginal secretions, a small reed stem is introduced during suture, leaving a minuscule orifice in the scar tissue. According to an eye-witness account, the worst thing is menstruation and urination. It takes one hour, sometimes two, to urinate. Later, when these girls have their periods, they have to introduce a small stick into the vagina to open up a passageway to allow the blood to flow out. Young girls squat and contract the bladder to urinate. They roll about on the ground and it is very painful.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have met gynaecologists in Brussels who discovered women giving birth having been infibulated and the husband refused to allow them to remove the infibulation. That is happening here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This ownership by men of their wives or, more precisely, of their sexual organs, is not part of Muslim tradition. It is a millennium-long custom which corresponds, in our Christian tradition, to the chastity belt, with which the crusaders girded their wives before leaving to deliver Jerusalem into the hands of the infidels.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, centuries later, over and over again, the same battle is being fought by women for their freedom. Even today, the same religious obscurantism in cruel patriarchal systems perpetuates, before our eyes, these forms of torture, from which all taboos must be lifted, and I thank the Commission for taking up this issue.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, female genital mutilation is so horrific that it is almost beyond words. Nearly three million women are subjected to this each year. That is more than 8 000 women a day, 240 women every hour or five women during this minute that I have at my disposal for this speech.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is difficult to imagine the pain involved in this. The statistics are extremely depressing. According to the data, 180 000 girls in Europe are in the risk zone for being subjected to this barbaric practice. It is now high time the world acted to get a global ban on female genital mutilation in place. This ought to be the common foreign policy’s number one priority within the area of human rights. It is also the aim of this resolution. Many of us who have signed this resolution were involved in ‘The Vagina Monologues’, which was performed here in the European Parliament earlier this spring. This is further proof that the fight against this abuse reaches beyond party boundaries, across countries and beyond ideologies. It is now time to put a stop to this barbaric practice.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In the context of decentralised cooperation, I had the opportunity to work with associations in Africa and came face to face with the reality of female genital mutilation, about which Ms De Keyser has just spoken.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our resolution stresses the importance of relying on local authorities and NGOs. Taking into account the realities on the ground is essential in the fight against these practices. For example, in any programme to combat female genital mutilation, it must be borne in mind that, for the women who practise it, it is a professional activity. It is sometimes their only source of income, and I know from experience that many of these women are more than willing to abandon the practice if they are offered reintegration into the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I particularly wanted to share this testimony with you, as it is my personal experience.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would like to join with my fellow Members in speaking with a strong voice to help put an end to the torture that is genital mutilation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the discussions that will take place at the UN General Assembly must not allow us to forget what is happening in our Member States, and we must remind them of their obligations. I will therefore focus on a particular aspect, which is complementary to those that have been addressed by my fellow Members. It is estimated that 500 000 women and girls living in Europe suffer the life-long consequences of genital mutilation and that 180 000 of them are at risk each year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Genital mutilation is recognised as a form of persecution linked to age and gender and, on the basis of recent developments in case-law, it has been established that a girl or a woman seeking asylum because she has suffered, or is likely to suffer, genital mutilation may be eligible for refugee status under the 1951 convention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet, a number of Member States sometimes adhere to a, let us say, restrictive interpretation of the reasons for an asylum request. However, Member States must assume their responsibilities, because it is not acceptable for the approaches taken by them to be fragmented.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I have been denouncing female genital mutilation since I became a Member of Parliament. This silent and accepted crime is suffered by millions of women and girls throughout the world: 70 million, I repeat, 70 million. An unbearable figure for those who stop to examine the terrible consequences of these practices, hidden under the guises of psychological, health, and religious reasons, all of which are false. The truth is that circumcision, preferentially practised on 14-year-old girls, and even those aged one year old, can lead to death by haemorrhagic shock and, at best, cause and bring about strong psychological consequences from the trauma.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should strive with all our efforts in Europe to eradicate this violation of human rights, which infringes on the right to equal opportunities and puts health at risk.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is, ladies and gentlemen, abuse, cruelty and torture against girls, and this degrading treatment also occurs in Europe. We must therefore activate all the available prevention mechanisms in our legal system and encourage our judges to act to prevent the genital mutilation of girls in Europe, punishing those who carry it out. EU law has to speak with a single voice to combat the mutilation on our soil.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, I call on civil society and NGOs to become actively involved in education and prevention campaigns. There is still a long way to go, but we are a large group who will not give up, as we owe it to the 70 million mutilated women.</p>

Female genital mutilation is an internationally recognised abuse of human rights, child rights and women’s rights, but it can only be addressed if we recognise the holistic rights of women. Those include sexual health and reproductive rights, the right of a woman to decide what to do with her own body.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, we received good news last year. The UN campaign against the mutilation of women and girls persuaded more than 6 000 communities to give up the practice of mutilation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">However, the figures are still horrendous. In Egypt, for example, 97% of girls were formerly circumcised, and still the figure is around 72% to 91%, depending on the various sources, although the authorities in the country have been trying to deny that the practice takes place since the end of the 1990s, which leaves open to interpretation the number of operations for reasons of health.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The problem is huge in southern parts of Egypt, in particular. We have to remember that the custom takes place in Christian, Muslim and animist communities across Africa and western Asia. The prevention of mutilation requires comprehensive social change, and the EU must continue to support those who are fighting against it.</p>

I believe that, now that we know what is going on, we have a particular responsibility to deal with it. We must establish that it is nothing to do with religious practices, but that in reality, it is a gross violation of human rights. On this issue we must adopt absolute zero tolerance; we are talking about causing physical and psychological harm to these women.

      <p sl="pt">Violence against women, of which genital mutilation is an example, is a reality and constitutes a serious human rights violation. The figures show that the majority of women will experience some form of violence during their lives. EU legislation needs to be strengthened, ideally with a directive, so that this type of violence is considered a criminal act in all EU Member States. National legislation should provide for legal aid, social and workplace guidance, and access to health care. Only by really understanding the situation in Europe will we be able to combat this scourge effectively. To this end, it is essential that we create a domestic violence observatory. Knowledge of the problem is essential if we are to be able to adopt the best strategies for prevention, intervention, protecting the victims and punishing the perpetrators. Prevention is key. The main challenges are eliminating stereotypes and myths, and changing representations of gender and the values that have been perpetuated by the existence of unequal relations in the family, in schools and in society. Awareness raising and mobilisation by civil society constitute a pivotal strategy for changing practices and behaviour.</p>

Intentionally damaging female genitals for non-medical reasons – performed with primitive tools and without antiseptic precaution – is an obvious violation of fundamental rights and since it mostly affects girls younger than 15, a violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. No religious, cultural or traditional convention may justify its serious adverse consequences on girls’ mental and physical integrity, including the irreparable damage of affected organs, painful sexual intercourse and childbirth, infection, shock, the transmission of HIV, tumours and complications after pregnancy and childbirth. Effective sanctions need to be introduced against perpetrators, enabling law enforcement officials to mobilise all available instruments for combating this practice. Taking into consideration the nature of genital mutilation, the close cooperation of national authorities and institutions with civil society, women’s rights organisations, and representatives of affected communities – such as religious and community leaders – is essential for eradicating this form of violence against women.</p>

Regular, unannounced, annual inspections need to be carried out urgently at all stages in the life of a medical device. The conditions of accreditation of notified bodies must be harmonised and the traceability, transparency and monitoring of medical devices placed on the European market must be strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I wish to draw your attention to a fundamental point: the need to find a balance between protecting our European patients and supporting innovation and research. We must bring together safety, transparency, consistency and flexibility. The first consistent approach is not to treat medical devices like medicinal products. There are three fundamental differences: a difference in nature, a difference in time to market, and a difference in terms of market flows.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, it is clear that the introduction of a market authorisation for the highest-risk medical devices would only result in administrative burdens, additional costs, longer times to market and, above all, it would stifle innovation. That is something that needs to be assessed depending on the case.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I agree with nearly everything that is in the resolution before us this evening. I am looking forward to hearing Commissioner Dalli tell us how the revision of the Medical Devices Directive will take on board the lessons we can learn from the PIP scandal which, as Ms Auconie has said, has affected so many women in the European Union and beyond.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I want to talk tonight about something a little wider than our resolution. It is about my amendment on advertising. We do not allow prescription medicines to be advertised in the European Union, yet we do allow magazines – women’s magazines mainly – to publish adverts like this: pages and pages of glossy, full colour adverts urging women to get breast implants. Two countries have already banned this kind of advertising – France and Belgium – but in the rest of Europe, this is pretty normal stuff. I wonder, Commissioner, whether you could tell us if anything can be done about it at European level.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you look at the websites of these same companies, they have these frequently asked questions about breast surgery on them. It tells you how much you will pay, and how to get a loan to have the surgery. It does give you some facts about the surgery, but nowhere does it say that 30% of women will have to have a new implant within 10 years, and that nearly all implants have to be replaced at least every 10 to 15 years. In other words, if you go at the age of 32, which is the average age for having a breast implant, for the rest of your life, you will have to have another implant and then another implant, and so on. I looked at three reputable companies. Not one website mentioned this fact – not one. I do not think that is good enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">When people have major surgery it is a risk to their health and I do not think there is enough information out there. We need informed patients. Commissioner, I do not know what your competence is, but as we have laws on advertising prescription medicines, I consider it about time we regulated this industry, which is encouraging people to take risks. Many women who have been surveyed were not aware that this meant repeat operation after repeat operation.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, in this situation, I think it important that we manage to point out that product approval needs to be much, much better in future than it has been hitherto. That is something that we are all well aware of. I would very much like to emphasise that what particularly needs to be the case from now on is that there must be transparency, there must be openness, there must be access so that independent researchers and doctors, too, can come in and check trial data. In other words, it must be impossible, where there are human trials, for the industry to cover up the results. It must be possible, at any point in the process, to come in and evaluate the following questions. Have there been any harmful side effects? Is this actually an improvement? Is there, in fact, no improvement? Are we ripping off society by producing new devices where the old ones actually worked perfectly well already?</p>
      <p sl="da">I believe that it is absolutely crucial that we should have that transparency and I very much hope that Commissioner Dalli will support the idea of it now being the patient, the people, the citizens, who are put at the heart of things, rather than the industry.</p>
      <p sl="da">In addition, I hope that we can bring about a situation where, if there is deception with the results, which is something we have seen with the medical industry – and I am not, now, talking about the breast implants; what was done there was illegal, after all, but there can be a great deal of other deception – it must be treated as a crime, not just as something that can be sorted out by means of fines.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, I would like to say to my fellow Members and also to the Commission that, if the industry gets a sniff of the idea that there is a prospect of there being real, actual, true transparency and access to the unprocessed data, it will bring a highly formidable lobbying arsenal to bear against us. We will have to face all kinds of accusations of how we are destroying their opportunities, reducing chances for patients, destroying competitiveness and destroying options for research and innovation. I thus very much hope that we are able to withstand the pressure we are all going to be facing, so that we can actually come up with something about which we can hold our heads up high and that we can show to the Americans (unless we are going to adopt their system) and say that what we have come up with is even better!</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, six months after the PIP breast implant scandal hit the headlines, the European Parliament is finally getting round to addressing this appalling case of medical malpractice.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is staggering to comprehend how PIP, once the world’s third largest supplier of breast implants, could disregard the law for almost ten years.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important we learn from public health incidents such as this. However, it is also vital that we examine all the facts before drawing conclusions on how a system might need to change to prevent such malpractice happening again.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, we must stress that the PIP scandal does not illustrate a failure of the current compliance system. This was a criminal offence that involved manufacturers placing a substandard product on the market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although the committee resolution contains plenty of positive measures that will improve the regulatory framework for medical devices, the text also includes demands for a pre-market authorisation. This duplicates existing laws and standards and is needlessly disproportionate in my view.</p>
      <p sl="en">Paragraph 22, for example, tabled by the Greens, calls for toxicology assessments on all medical devices. Do we really think that by nitpicking over the toxicity of everything, from elastic bandages to pacemakers, people will stop breaking the law?</p>
      <p sl="en">Care should always be taken not to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut and I caution against knee-jerking responses that could fundamentally alter a regulatory system that has been protecting patients for more than 20 years.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group has therefore tabled an amendment and several requests for split and separate votes, in the hope that we can iron out these inconsistencies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, it is true that six months have already passed since the Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) scandal. The most unbelievable thing is that, for 10 years, a private company could have managed to operate in the market and give women from 71 countries silicone implants that should be used for construction and manufacturing mattresses.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This affected many hundreds of thousands of women, as has already been mentioned: it is estimated at around 500 000. We are talking about estimates because there were failings, serious failings, with this process. We know that what happened with this company was criminal activity, fraud and a matter for the courts. However, we also know that this is a fraud that should be monitored by the courts and the courts will deal with it. Nevertheless, there has been a failure of the law; a legal vacuum that we should tackle. We are responsible for that area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For 10 years, we did not manage to identify what the criminals managed to identify, so there was a vacuum in terms of monitoring, in terms of traceability, in terms of files, in terms of records; everything failed. However, the people in charge of this company managed to put into practice something that we failed to monitor, so this process does not just concern the issue of the lack of information in this regard and, in fact, all those issues relating to breast implants: those are very important, but there is also the humiliation of thousands of women and the humiliation, in particular, of those women who had to undergo tests to know whether or not they had the correct implants.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are talking about a public health issue and we cannot be lax as regards public health: we monitor so many unnecessary things – we even monitor the authenticity of replacement car parts – and it is still not long since we adopted a directive on this. We have to monitor that which is essential to people’s lives. The revision of the Medical Devices Directive is good news, but it would be better news if we did not have to do it. However, now that we are going to do it, let us put in place transparency, monitoring and penalties with conditions and traceability because, unfortunately, even if penalties are applied, they will not benefit the women who suffered from this problem, so states should accept full liability.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate and the vote on the resolution come at a particularly propitious time because, if approved, the resolution can provide useful guidance for the medical device review.</p>
      <p sl="it">The breast implants issue has highlighted the deficiencies in the current system for certifying compliance with essential health and safety requirements. In my view, the review proposals from the European Commission and Commissioner Dalli rightly seek greater controls on medical device manufacturers and greater rigour from the competent authorities when issuing authorisations. I also agree with the need to avoid creating excessive bureaucracy that might block the use of innovative products for years. I believe that it is important to ensure rigorous, efficient and swift controls at European level.</p>
      <p sl="it">The thousands of women who have undergone breast implant surgery need to be made aware of the risks that they may face. They should be offered screening and medical advice to check for any damage and to prevent the implants from rupturing. It is important to set up a register to identify people who have been implanted with particular medical devices, so that information can be provided in good time if the devices need to be checked, altered or replaced.</p>
      <p sl="it">Introducing an ‘ID card’ for implants would enable users to obtain information about all the potential risks to which they may be exposed and which checks are advisable over time. It is vital, within a cooperative EU framework, that Member States make specific commitments to eliminate or minimise the recurrence of such serious events as that associated with the PIP silicone implants.</p>

    <intervention id="3-613-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="John Dalli" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, during the last 20 years, the medical device regulatory system has, overall, provided for safe, reliable and performing devices in Europe and has provided the flexibility needed for the high number of medical devices and the short life cycle of these products. It has also proven to be a system that is cost-effective and SME-friendly. It has put Europe in the forefront of innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">For months before the PIP case, the Commission was reviewing the Medical Devices Directive, because we found that it needed quite a number of improvements. The PIP case is indeed appalling. It is a case of fraud which went undetected due to weaknesses in the post-market phase. Nevertheless, the case has highlighted a number of weaknesses in the regulatory framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to provide a rapid answer to European patients’ concerns, I have identified, and shared with the European Parliament, a number of actions to be taken immediately, together with the Member States, on the basis of the current legislation. This includes tightening market controls, in order to provide a better guarantee of the safety of medical technology, especially high risk devices. I have therefore written to the Health Ministers of all the Member States to ask for their support, and together we are now putting these actions in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the longer term, the revised medical device legislation that the Commission has been preparing – independently of the PIP case, as I said – will also take on board the experiences of this affair. The Commission intends to adopt its proposal shortly after the summer break.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of improvements were already foreseen to reinforce the system. These improvements will contribute to avoiding cases like the PIP implant case. To mention but a few: we want to strengthen the designation, monitoring and functioning of notified bodies and ensure that this is carried out in accordance with the same high standards across the EU; and we want a stronger role to be given to competent authorities, both in pre- and post-market phases.</p>
      <p sl="en">The system can only be efficient if we make the best use of the limited number of experts available. This is why the Commission foresees a pre-market scrutiny mechanism to be put in place for high-risk devices, and other devices where necessary, but on a case by case basis. This mechanism will allow a committee composed of Member States’ experts to check certain notified bodies’ assessments before the devices can have access to the market.</p>
      <p sl="en">The advantage of doing so will be twofold. First, it will ensure an equal level of assessment by notified bodies, in particular, with regard to clinical evidence. Second, it will allow Member States to be informed of products coming onto the market so that they can ensure targeted controls of these products. This mechanism has the advantage that scarce resources and expertise are used to ensure efficient and proportionate pre-market control and reinforced vigilance and market surveillance. Last but not least, we want to improve the traceability requirements for medical devices, for instance, by means of a unique device identification and a single registration system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the PIP case, the Commission performed a ‘stress test’ of the medical device legislation in order to identify additional possible shortcomings of the regulatory framework and address them in the context of the upcoming revision. As a result of the stress test, additional measures will be included in the Commission proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">These proposals will concern the audit activities of the notified bodies. Particular attention will be paid to the obligatory unannounced visits to the manufacturer, testing of products and rotation of auditors. Information will be given to national authorities with regard to negative outcomes of such audits. Measures should also be put in place to enhance the reporting of incidents by health care professionals and patients. Patients’ awareness should also be improved through, for example, implant cards providing appropriate information.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is where I believe that the transparency of the market should be enhanced, by giving all interested parties the right information not only – as Ms McAvan has said – about costs and benefits, but also about the duration, durability and consequences of the implants or whatever other device they are using, because this is not only a question of implants and there are other devices in use.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe everybody needs to know all the implications of using such devices, because some people really do think that once they go through a procedure, it is a once in a lifetime procedure, which, in many instances, is not the case. This has to be continuously put in front of our patients, or our consumers, in the way we are suggesting. These cards have to be given to every single patient who undergoes any type of procedure involving such implants. In this way, patient awareness will be greatly improved.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do believe that the set of measures already foreseen, combined with additional measures deemed necessary in the light of the result of the stress test, will considerably reinforce the system, favour innovation and ensure that only safe and performing medical devices are placed on the European market, for the benefit of European citizens. I have taken note of the points raised by Ms Auconie and I must say that all her points are, in fact, included in the proposal that we will be presenting, as I said, just after the summer.</p>

      <p sl="it">Nevertheless, it is equally clear that this scandal has strongly highlighted the need for a careful reappraisal of the current European legislation on medical devices. Unfortunately, this fraud has revealed the deficiencies that we have discussed thus far in this Chamber and that the Commissioner has set out so clearly that I do not wish to dwell on this aspect in the little time I have available.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that all necessary steps should be taken so that we can offer the best to our citizens. I believe that this scandal, which has taught us many things, can also be a springboard for further progress, and I echo what my colleague said earlier. Information for patients is highly inadequate. The emphasis is always, exclusively, on the upside, with allusions to a kind of eternal youth and a promise of beauty, even though no implants are completely risk-free. I believe that this should be clearly communicated to people, especially girls, for we know that some very young girls are seeking this kind of operation, and especially as regards purely cosmetic surgery. Therefore – and I see that you firmly agree – I urge that we move fast, for time is at a premium, and this change is long overdue.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, we had the Mediator scandal some time ago. We now have the breast implant scandal, which, as you said, Commissioner, unfortunately highlights the shortcomings of health security in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The breast implant scandal is a case of fraud that went unpunished for 14 years, from 1996 to 2010. During that time, 500 000 implants were placed on the market, 8 000 implants were removed, 48 cases of cancer were reported, and 3 500 complaints were lodged. These are frightening, shocking figures. Commissioner, how, despite warnings from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the numerous complaints and convictions for ruptured implants in Great Britain and France in particular, could national and European agencies miss such a fraud?</p>
      <p sl="fr">This tragedy immediately made us think about improving the European regulatory system for medical devices, as you explained just now. Commissioner, today we must build a system capable of preventing scandal, but it must be a new system. You told us about the new legislation to come into effect this autumn. As co-author of this resolution, I am, of course, pleased with that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, Commissioner, you seem to want to take into account many of our concerns, as set out in this resolution. In that case, why make an exception that is unacceptable to a large number of MEPs here in this House? Why not introduce a market authorisation for medical devices in class III, those that are highest risk? Commissioner Dalli, can you explain your position to me?</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I hope that the reform of EU legislation on the control of medical devices and implants is as complete as the proposals contained in this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have learnt a lot of lessons from the PIP implant crisis, and a large number of the solutions are on the table. It is imperative that data is exchanged, warning systems are set up for EU-wide notification of any incidents, mechanical and clinical tests on the implants are improved, and transparent and improved information is available to patients.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need a penalty system that applies to suppliers that sell dangerous merchandise and to professionals along the trade and health care chain who do not collaborate with this effort towards transparency, monitoring and control. They are ethical and scientific demands along the same lines as it being fair to arbitrate compensation for the victims of this episode.</p>
      <p sl="es">There also things that are not easy to express aloud and to add here in a week in which financial voracity continues to swallow up our efforts to save the European project, which also contributes towards citizens’ well-being through issues such as the one being debated now. Let us remember that the alarming price difference between the products manufactured by PIP and those on offer from its competitors did not prompt enhanced control. The price, however, was the basis for PIP’s success in the implant market, and this had repercussions on the patients, the women.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am sure that through these controls, European medical organisations will allocate the means to prevent this from ever happening again, but it is the Commission’s responsibility to urgently implement a monitoring and control system, and Parliament’s responsibility to control the content for compliance with this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is a very important debate, but while we are talking about this particular scandal, we have to recognise that the European medical devices industry has been very innovative and has helped patients a great deal.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I welcome the balanced approach of the Commission in relation to improving our regulatory system. I am against paragraph 7 because it will overdo things and take away the possibility of the industry being innovative. What we are trying to strike here is a balance between what is good for patients and improving the quality of life of those who need medical devices.</p>
      <p sl="en">Could I just say on a slightly different theme, picking up on the point made by Ms McAvan, that we have had a debate on female genital mutilation and we are now having a debate on breast implants. Sometimes these are used by very young girls who chose this process and who, as Ms McAvan pointed out, do not understand the consequences of it. While the debates are not linked, it is interesting that, on this occasion, we are having them both tonight.</p>
      <p sl="en">My main point is, however, that with regard to the progress made for people who have had hip implants or knee implants, and whose quality of life has been improved by the European medical devices industry, we need to allow this to flourish and grow. We need to better regulate the notified bodies, as has been suggested, and not stifle innovation.</p>

This case of defective breast implants shows that this regulation needs further revision. I am talking about Brussels I, the regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. There are at least 60 victims of the defective breast implants in Austria who have tried in vain to bring an action via their consumer organisation in Vienna. They have not succeeded in doing so because of a gap in the regulation on jurisdiction.</p>
      <p sl="de">We could improve the situation of these victims and many others if consumer organisations representing the victims were also able to utilise the more favourable consumer jurisdiction.

There are many, many legal loopholes and therefore we need to go further. As well as control, monitoring and protection, of course, more information is needed. The scandal surrounding these implants, which affects over 30 000 European women, teaches us that the suppliers that introduce these unhealthy products need to be punished.

      <p sl="de">However, I am also convinced that only a minute proportion of the breast implants are actually being used as medical devices in the sense of medical treatment, and that the majority are used in cosmetic surgery. We are talking here about a market worth around EUR 700 million. My question today is therefore – and here I am following on from what Linda McAvan said – to what extent, as those responsible for health, we can justify the fact that a large number of Europeans, primarily women, have such a distorted self-image that they believe they will only really be a woman if they have such implants.</p>
      <p sl="de">When you look at the fact that around 22% of young people in Europe, primarily women, suffer from eating disorders, and that the image of a young person conveyed to us in advertising and in the media – the image of a proper woman or a proper man – is an image that needs to be corrected if the upshot is that a large number of these people believe they can only restore their feelings of self-worth by means of surgical procedures, then we also need to give some thought to restrictions on advertising for the purposes of preventive health measures.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this issue stems from the failure of the French authorities to regulate its manufacturing industry. Typically, ‘France has a take it or leave it’ approach to regulations that it expects other countries to adopt.</p>
      <p sl="en">In June 2000, US medical regulators posted a warning letter on the Internet about problems at a breast implant maker in southern France. The French authorities did not pay this much attention. The French health authorities acknowledged as much in a 175-page report published on 1 February this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Radical change is needed in Europe to ensure proper surveillance of medical devices. France has shown itself incapable of regulating itself and should have external checks.</p>

      <p sl="en">We all agree that patient health comes first and foremost in our policy deliberations. This is exactly what we are doing too when we insist that we must continue to have a flexible system that delivers innovation as fast as possible to our patients, because that is also a function of patient health.</p>
      <p sl="en">Being able to use innovative products at the earliest possible time – and in Europe we deliver innovation about three years before our American counterparts with their own system – is a benefit to patients that we cannot put aside.</p>
      <p sl="en">So when I was asked by Mr Pargneaux why I would not be pushing for pre-marketing authorisation, this is why: because I do not believe we need it. We do not need to go the way of pre-market authorisation. We have a system in Europe that has worked in the past. We are enforcing this system so it works even better. We are ensuring the competence of all the bodies that are involved in the authorisation process and this is the package that we will be proposing to this Parliament and to Council just after the summer.

      <p sl="en">We have been deliberating, we have been studying and we have been stress testing what we have done because of the PIP case, and we will be coming forward with a formal, concrete proposal in a few months time, around September.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we talk about authorisation, what we are saying here is: let us continue to keep the flexibility that we have in Europe; let us enforce and make sure that whoever is involved in the process is competent to do so; let us make the competent authorities in the Member States more involved in what is happening in their own countries within this process, and then let us have a Europe-wide expert group that will ensure the consistency, all across Europe, of a standard level of authorisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The PIP case is not about authorisation. The PIP case has nothing to do with authorisation. The PIP case is a fraud which could have happened under the most robust authorisation process you could possibly have.</p>
      <p sl="en">The PIP case is an indication of the weaknesses we have in our processes: not necessarily in the legislation itself, though the legislation will be strengthened as well, but more in the way it was being implemented in market controls after authorisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As some of you have said, competent authorities in Member States simply let the medical devices that were in use in their countries not be subject to any kind of controls, and this is what is wrong.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was unbelievable to hear – and I am an accountant by profession, so for me it was even worse – that all audits held by the notifying bodies on companies were all pre-notified two months in advance! It is unbelievable that this could happen!</p>
      <p sl="en">This was all due to their interpretation that this was what was required in our legal process – which is not the case. In fact, in the letter I have written to the ministers, I have told them that this is not the case, that non-notified audits are provided for in our legislation today, and they should also be making sure that this is happening with marketing controls today. We do not need to wait two years until this legislative process that we will be launching very soon is finished.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are pushing for transparency; transparency not only in the information that is given to everybody who might be deciding on making any type of procedure, but transparency also in the vigilance aspect so that all incidents that happen within the medical devices sector have to be reported back. A database will be set up to put all this information together so that we can really take the necessary actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The traceability of medical devices, which we are also proposing and will be proposing, as was mentioned here again today – and I am pleased that it was because this is also a very important aspect – and especially of risky medical devices, would also be part of the proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, we are keeping our word on this. We will be coming back in September with a robust proposal that will drastically improve our safety issues – and without going overboard, without overreacting to an incident and trying to find a way of transmitting the sense that we are doing something by really doing something where it is not indicated that it needs to be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem of the PIP fraud was not authorisation. It lay in market controls, and this is where we need to really put our foot down and really ensure that we introduce a robust market control procedure.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The sale of defective silicone gel breast implants by the French company PIP is an absolute scandal. It is inconceivable that such a situation could continue for several years, that 400 000 breast implants were sold worldwide, without any reaction from the control and supervision chain. In the future, more stringent safety tests must prevent such a tragedy occurring again and help avert a situation where thousands of women are facing difficult situations in which their health is put at risk. European cooperation and the exchange of information in this regard must be strengthened.</p>
