      <p sl="hu">Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is my task today to give you a brief summary of the achievements of the Hungarian Presidency. My task is easy, because when you kindly invited me here six months ago, I had the opportunity to present the programme of the Hungarian Presidency, which can be found in this volume. There were, there are concrete objectives set out in it. Six months later it is easy to compare the accomplishments with those objectives. If we were to base the evaluation of our work on this alone, we could say that the Hungarian Presidency has fully delivered on the objectives set out by ourselves and confirmed by you.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to Belgium, who took the Presidency before us, for doing an excellent job and for doing excellent preparatory work for our Presidency. I would also like to express my thanks to President Jerzy Buzek, because as I mentioned here in January, our aim was to have a Parliament-friendly Presidency. Friendship needs two parties, and I received unfailing support, cooperation and friendship from your President, Mr Jerzy Buzek. I would also like to thank the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who is present here today, because for a presidency to be successful, the current Council has to do a huge amount of work. I would like to thank Mr Barroso for giving me the opportunity to have very open and honest meetings and professional cooperation on the most difficult issues. I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament in general, but Mr Daul and the members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in particular, because you all know that although the Presidency aims to separate its work from political affairs, and especially from home affairs, this cannot be fully achieved at all times. For this reason the Presidency always needs a kind of political background, and the PPE Group and Mr Daul provided the necessary political background for us to be able to focus on our work. Thank you for that.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, you may remember that the Hungarian Presidency set a strong Europe as one of its primary objectives. I have always believed that Europe can be stronger than it is now, or was six months ago. When 13 years ago, I was able to participate in a European Council meeting as Prime Minister for the first time, I can recall that those meetings were held in the spirit of optimism; ambitious plans were drafted, and the meetings were full of vitality and momentum. Remember that 13 years ago, we were excited by the fever of reunification; we celebrated the creation of the single market and single currency, and the idea to make the EU the most developed region in the world by 2010 did not seem at all ridiculous; in fact, we took it very seriously. I personally remember a European Union that was not on the defensive, was not tormented by crises, was not tormented by itself, and was not full of doubt, but had a clear vision of the future and worked purposefully towards it.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, fellow Members, as a short summary of the Hungarian Presidency, I can say that today the European Union is indeed stronger than six months ago. It is stronger, although it received three blows in the solar plexus during these six months, namely the deepening crisis in the eurozone, the Japanese nuclear disaster, and the challenges resulting from the changes in North-African countries. These all required rapid responses and dedication from the Hungarian Presidency The EU was able to respond swiftly and effectively to these situations without us having to amend our six-month programme.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I claim that Europe is stronger than six months ago. However, our voters strongly disagree with this statement. In my opinion, the reason for this is that we, who are working diligently in the inner sanctuary of the EU, can feel the progress we have made in the past six months; the citizens, on the other hand, only encounter the deepening crisis of the eurozone and the Greek crisis in news headlines. Europe may become stronger, but it will still not make the impression of a strong community, no matter how much we consolidate the foundations of the EU, until we can provide a solution to the Greek crisis, one that is clear and comprehensible to the citizens and ensures success instead of only taking measures and decisions to gain a few weeks or months. This is why I encourage you and I hope you can find a solution to this issue as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is stronger now than six months ago, mostly because it now has the necessary means to avoid future crises, means that it did not have six months ago. The European Semester, one of the big challenges of the Hungarian Presidency, is up and running, and we can proudly say to European citizens that we now have the means in place which will help us prevent the single currency from running into difficulties such as those of today.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I should mention here the history of the ‘six pack’, as well, which is more than 95% ready at this stage, and if we manage to dot the i’s and cross the t’s, we will complete the crisis management mechanism as well. We set up the ISM system required for crisis management, and the most important relevant decisions were made in the last six months. Europe is stronger today also because we have a Roma strategy, a strategy which did not exist previously within the EU, and which is not only important from humane and human rights considerations – although it is important from these points of view as well – but also because it gives us the opportunity to involve millions of EU citizens in the EU labour market, and become economically stronger this way. The Roma strategy is the first document which not only sees a challenge in the existence of the Roma community, but also a great opportunity and a power resource for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The European Union is stronger now than six months ago, because the second macro-regional development programme, the Danube strategy was born. This is the first of its kind that not only includes Member States, but also establishes the framework for cooperation between six non-EU countries and eight Member States. If we can put flesh on the bones – and we stand a good chance to do so because the intellectual preparations are completed – then it can become a success story of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="hu">And the European Union is stronger now than six months ago, because five hours before the end of the Hungarian Presidency we managed to conclude the accession negotiations with Croatia. I would like to inform you that this decision not only concerns Croatia, but opens up a promising perspective for other countries of the West Balkans. To summarise our partly presidential, partly neighbourhood experiences with the region, I prepared a memorandum regarding the issue of the West Balkans and the enlargement of the West Balkans, the enlargement of the European Union in the West Balkans, which I have already submitted to the leaders of EU institutions, to President Buzek and the Prime Ministers as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Another reason why the European Union is stronger today is because we can now protect our borders more efficiently than six months ago. We have made the decisions that create the necessary capacities for the European Union for border protection and migration prevention, and we have made important steps towards deepening and enlarging the Schengen Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to remind you that the tasks of the Presidency also include playing an important part and being an efficient means in the course of interinstitutional cooperation and sometimes conflicts arising between our complicated legislative bodies. I would like to remind you that we have done this work as well. As regards cooperation between Parliament and the Council, we brought several dozen dossiers and codecision dossiers to a conclusion. I would also like to inform you that we have come to an agreement on how to involve Parliament in the preparation of the multiannual financial framework. I personally made efforts to ease cross-institutional tensions. I met with President Rompuy 13 times, I had official talks with Mr Barroso 13 times, and met with President Buzek nine times with the specific purpose of facilitating interinstitutional cooperation. During our Presidency I personally visited every Prime Minister, and I strove to pave the way to prepare joint decisions during these bilateral negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, let me express my hope that Poland, the country that takes over the Presidency from us, will continue to enhance the reputation of Central Europe. Let me express my hope that Hungary did great preparatory work for the Polish Presidency. Taking all into consideration and looking at us from a mid-term historical perspective, let me conclude without the slightest immodesty that the Hungarian Presidency may, and the Polish Presidency following us certainly will convince you that the decision taken 10 years ago and implemented seven years ago, that is, the enlargement of the EU to include Central Europe, was a wise decision. It made the EU, our community, stronger, more colourful, more viable and more creative. Thank you very much for your kind attention.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Prime Minister Orbán, thank you for the account you have given us. As we know, the Hungarian Presidency came at a very difficult time for the world and for the European Union. You mentioned the threats that emerged during the Hungarian Presidency. Our response to threats is always what matters most. This was the first Hungarian Presidency, and thus the country’s first experiences in this area. This is why we listened so attentively to the Prime Minister’s speech, and we will now hold a debate on what he said.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">As an additional point, I would like to thank you for the memorandum you sent to me and to the prime ministers, chancellors and presidents of the EU Member States. This memorandum sets out a vision of measures to be taken in the Western Balkans, and I believe that this vision is very important. I would also like to make one very important comment to the House: Mr Orbán referred to the Western Balkans as representing the conclusion of Europe’s reunification. There was a reunification back in 2004, and now we must complete this process. Prime Minister Orbán also very briefly outlined the situation in the individual countries, and presented a strategic programme which should guide our actions. I would like to add that the European Parliament has always been in favour of enlarging the European Union to include the Western Balkans, although they must of course meet the criteria first. The most important point for us is that these criteria are met, and I am sure we agree on this, Prime Minister Orbán.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would now like to ask the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, to take the floor.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-012-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, Prime Minister and distinguished Members of the Hungarian Government, distinguished Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, while confronted with very testing circumstances, Hungary has risen to the challenges and delivered a very competent Presidency of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">More generally, the European Union is today better able to deal with the opportunities and the difficulties before us. I would therefore like to thank Prime Minister Orbán and all his team for their commitment and their hard work. During the Hungarian Presidency of the Council the European Union achieved the first European Semester, concluded negotiations with Croatia, supported the democratic movements of the Arab Spring, approved a new European strategy for the Roma and launched the new strategy. This is in fact a good result.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want also to underline the openness for dialogue with the European Parliament on the next multiannual financial framework. As you know, last November I suggested launching a structural dialogue, and this was the case during Hungary’s Presidency. We have met several times – President Buzek, Prime Minister Orbán and I – to exchange views before the Commission finally approved the proposal that is now before you. It is a budget that we believe is realistic but ambitious, and that is all about investing in future growth. This practice of consultations – Parliament, Council, Commission – has now been established, and Prime Minister Tusk has already confirmed to me that the Polish Presidency will follow suit. The dialogue is launched. It will continue and bear fruit.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are reflecting the lessons of the crisis in our policy making. After much hard work we have both the plan and the tools needed to get Europe back on track and to ensure it stays on track. This is no small achievement. At a time when some call on us to retreat into national shells, we have in fact developed a clearer sense of our interdependence. We have chosen to recognise our interdependence on the key issues of the day, particularly on the economy, but also on migration.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the economy. Growth has been high on the Hungarian Presidency agenda and will remain so for the current Polish Presidency. In today’s economic climate the stakes are very high. While 1.8% GDP growth is now expected for the European Union in 2011, unemployment is still unacceptably high, especially amongst our young people. The divergences in competitiveness between our Member States are still too great and countries such as Greece are walking a tightrope. This means that in the longer term what is at stake is the future of our social economy, our common currency, the euro, and our role in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the Commission’s six legislative proposals on economic governance are essential and will have far-reaching consequences for our Union. After marathon negotiations between the co-legislators, final agreement on the economic governance package is within sight. I urge Parliament and the Council to go this extra mile and deliver, sooner rather than later, on this very important package building on the excellent job done by the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="en">From our side the Commission will continue to work hard on delivering in areas where it matters most for growth. Take, for example, the 12 priority actions under the Single Market Act. The Commission will ensure that all our proposals are on the table by the end of the year with the hope that they can be approved by Parliament and Council by the end of 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very pleased to see early fruit, especially in the area of intellectual property, where the Commission has presented a comprehensive strategy for reform and where already last week Member States agreed on the two regulations implementing enhanced cooperation to create a common European Union patent. This agreement has eluded us for decades and the Hungarian Presidency made a critical contribution to breaking the deadlock. The end result will reduce the cost of patents in Europe by up to 80%, covering 25 Member States. This is a key step in becoming more innovation-friendly. It is of great economic value. We will put an end to the unacceptable situation where obtaining a patent in Europe costs ten times more than in the United States. This shows how European action can complement national action to boost competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another important issue during these six months was migration. Migration is also an emotive issue, and the European Union has faced a difficult and challenging situation linked to the south Mediterranean events of last spring, but let me say once again that we have acted as a Union to protect both freedom and security.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is of great importance that we have strengthened Frontex with agreement on the new regulation two weeks ago. We have also been able to face difficult situations related to Schengen governance and national actions aiming to put at risk basic principles of the European Union, such as the free movement of persons and a common European space without borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will now come forward with its concrete proposals for a European-based monitoring and evaluation system supplemented by a European safeguard mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">On asylum, the European Council has agreed that we must complete our common European asylum system by 2012. The Commission proposals are already on the table. I remain confident that we have the momentum we need to complete this goal.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also pleased that the Hungarian Presidency has delivered a big step forward for the Roma people. The Commission’s framework for national Roma integration strategies is endorsed by the European Council and will help us to end centuries-old exclusion in four key areas: education, employment, healthcare and housing. I commend the robust and sensitive handling of this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now note the outstanding progress towards Croatia’s accession. Negotiations were formally concluded last week, and we now look forward to signing the accession treaty by the end of this year. In the Commission’s view, Croatia could become the 28th member of our Union by 1 July 2013. We have been strict but fair, and will continue this same approach until accession. I believe it will lead not only to a stronger European family but to further peace, reconciliation and stability in the Western Balkans. Let me pay tribute to the strong support we have received in steering this process and in giving a practical meaning to the European prospects for the region. I really welcome the strong commitment of Hungary regarding the future of the Western Balkans.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also given definition to the Danube strategy helping to connect, protect and develop in partnership with six of our neighbours. The overall aim is to improve the quality of life for the 115 million people living in the Danube region.</p>
      <p sl="en">This year has also been a very important year so far for neighbourhood policy. Neighbourhood policy is more than ever at the top of the Union’s agenda. We have actively managed the situation faced by our southern neighbours, not only supporting politically the Arab Spring, but also on the ground in very concrete humanitarian terms, including as regards its direct impact on European Union territory and defining a strategy for democracy and co-prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, let me say that we must keep focused on investing in our future. The Hungarian Presidency has helped us in this respect and their close collaboration with the new Polish Presidency will serve the Union well. It will ensure continuity in the Council’s work and allow as well for constructive exchanges with the European Parliament. We have been able to move forward with the European agenda during this six months. I am sure that during the next semester we will be able to build on these achievements to ensure important successes for our Union.</p>

    <intervention id="2-013-000" speaker_id="4342" name="Joseph Daul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian Presidency of the Council has shown how the rotating Presidency has continued to play an important role in our decision-making system. We have to recognise the importance of the advances that have been made in these last few months on a number of fronts. Firstly, there are the advances on the economic front, with the progress that has been made on governance and the success of the first-ever European Semester. Secondly, there is the common policy front, with the measures taken concerning social cohesion, the common agricultural policy, food security, the single market, the Danube strategy and, of course, energy policy. Thirdly, there is the external front, with the accession of Croatia, but also the expression of our solidarity with our Japanese friends and with the peoples of the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me inform you, Mr Orbán, of the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on most of these points. First, I want to thank the Hungarian Presidency. In particular I would thank the Minister of State for EU Affairs, our former fellow Member Mrs Győri, for the enormous efforts she has made towards taking the governance package forward and, in particular, granting Parliament’s requests for the Community method to be applied.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have been successful on 90% to 95% of our requests. I am very disappointed that, because of the stance some people have taken, we cannot reach a conclusion this week as planned. Without economic governance, ladies and gentlemen, there will be no stability for the euro. Without a stable euro, the chances of Europe winning the battle for growth, and thus the battle for employment and social cohesion, are next to nothing. The PPE Group is convinced of this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">President of the Council, I also want to emphasise the progress that has been made on common policies since January. There has been progress on the cohesion policy, with the agreement reached in February on the strengthening of this device in the coming years. There has also been progress on the common agricultural policy, with the agreement reached in March on the broad outlines of the reform, against a background of worrying increases in the prices of raw materials as well as ever greater challenges in relation to food security. Thirdly, there has been progress on energy and innovation, strategic themes to which an entire meeting of the European Council was devoted at the start of February, one month before the Fukushima tragedy. Finally, there has been progress on the single market, which will be consolidated further thanks to the Single Market Act.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On all these major topics, the Hungarian Presidency has made progress in spite of a difficult political and economic environment. I would add one important element to that, namely the policy on the Roma, on which you, Mr Orbán, have been able to conciliate the Europeans and propose specific actions. I am particularly grateful to you for that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will end by mentioning the advances made in the area of external affairs. I have already had the opportunity to welcome the progress made by Croatia during the last few months; it is only because of this that the 27 were able to give it the green light for its accession in accordance with the timetable that President Orbán wished for, starting in January.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This accession is good news for the Croatian people. It is also good news for the peoples of the Balkans, who must be able to rely on a concrete European perspective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The events that have occurred in the Mediterranean, too, have dominated the Presidency to a great extent. Europe has managed to give a clear demonstration of moral solidarity, but has also shown real solidarity with its southern neighbours, and it has also managed to resolve the problems that arose concerning the economic refugees who immigrated to the Italian coast.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time – and I am particularly happy about this – the Schengen area has been opened up to Romania and Bulgaria, not in order to do them a favour, but because they are respecting the rules that apply to everyone. This shows that European solidarity has to be earned and that effort is rewarded.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I thank the Hungarian Presidency and wish all the best to the Polish Presidency.</p>

    <intervention id="2-014-000" speaker_id="2295" name="Hannes Swoboda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, President of the Commission, Prime Minister, a rotating presidency has two tasks. Firstly, where current affairs are concerned it has to make progress on the dossiers and bring them to a conclusion where possible, and secondly, it should set an example to the rest of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where the first task is concerned, Prime Minister, I should like to extend my warm thanks to your political staff and officials, because many issues have been resolved positively. The Croatia dossier – which was, of course, particularly close to my heart – was dealt with well, as was the Roma strategy. I would like to thank you warmly for this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where the second task is concerned, however, I have some criticisms to make. Substantial criticism has been expressed here in Parliament of both the media law and the Constitution. You may say that these are internal matters. However, you know very well, Prime Minister, that in today’s Europe internal policy is also European policy – after all, that is the very point of Europe – and that European policy also has a corresponding impact domestically. This criticism by Europe is therefore entirely reasonable. You did, after all, have to amend the failed media law – even though the European Commission was very mild in its judgment of this act. Where the Constitution is concerned, you know that the Venice Commission has criticised not just the process, but also some essential content of this Constitution. Even the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Ban Ki-moon, has expressed significant criticism.</p>
      <p sl="de">Prime Minster, you are always saying that you want to connect with 1949. In the meantime, however, there was 1956. As a very young man in Austria I experienced this revolution, with its great aims of pluralism, freedom of the media and freedom of expression. It would be good to connect with 1956 again; to connect with the year of great revolution and of such freedoms, which are European values and European aims. That is not just a criticism that is made of your government by the socialists, as you are always saying – in your capacity as leader of the Fidesz party, at least. You yourself were present a few days ago when Hillary Clinton made some highly critical statements in the Hungarian Parliament at an event honouring Tom Lantos, an outstanding Hungarian-born member of the US Congress. Like many others in her country, Mrs Clinton called for vigilance where democratic development is concerned. We all need to be vigilant – not just in Hungary, but in view of developments in Hungary in particular.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yes, you have a two-thirds majority. In theory, that means you can do what you like. However, in the European model of democracy what your critics are saying and what the opposition are saying also counts; not just what the two-thirds majority is saying.</p>
      <p sl="de">Prime Minister, you have expressed your thanks to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – but only to that group. That is your prerogative, although it is the first time in all the many presidencies that I have experienced that a presidency has thanked only one party – its own party. A democracy, however, includes not just those who support you, but also those who express criticism. At least, that is what we understand by European democracy. I would like to see you moving somewhat closer towards the goals of pluralism, freedom of the media and freedom of expression. As Tom Lantos – that great Hungarian – said both in America and in Hungary, it is right and important – particularly in view of the responsibility that Europe has – to say yes to pluralism, to freedom of the media, to freedom of expression and yes, too, to criticism, because criticism is part of democracy just as much as those who support you, whether or not you have a two-thirds majority. Majorities are there to be utilised, but they must also show due regard for their opponents and critics. At least, that is our understanding of European democracy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Hungary has not only conducted an excellent presidency of the Council, but it also has a very modern democratic Constitution. I should like to ask Mr Swoboda whether he thinks that Mr Ban Ki-moon, who leads an organisation made up mostly of dictatorships, should not concern himself with the dictatorial constitutions that exist within the UN rather than that of a country which is a shining example of democracy.</p>

    <intervention id="2-016-000" speaker_id="2295" name="Hannes Swoboda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr Posselt, firstly, Mr Ban Ki-moon was supported by many democracies when he was elected as Secretary-General. Secondly, I mentioned a moment ago the Venice Commission. As you very well know, this Commission includes a great number of people who have nothing to do with social democracy, but instead are more closely aligned with your own party; representatives from Poland and other countries. Democracy is not a party-political issue, but rather a matter of how you see things personally and politically. That is what I was appealing to, and that is what I am saying to the Hungarian Prime Minister.</p>

    <intervention id="2-017-000" speaker_id="28242" name="Alexander Graf Lambsdorff" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, my group is of the view that the Hungarian Presidency has achieved some truly important successes. This was a difficult presidency, with the financial crisis, Fukushima and the developments in North Africa. We have your government to thank, Mr Orbán – particularly your foreign minister, Mr Martonyi, who is sitting alongside you, and also your Minister of State for EU Affairs, Mrs Győri – for the fact that really outstanding work has been done here. This is particularly true as regards economic policy. What has been achieved in terms of stabilising the euro has undoubtedly been a great success, although it remains an important task. The adoption of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and also the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) – these are great and important achievements. The implementation of the first European Semester, the coordination of Member States’ budgetary policy – this is progress par excellence when it comes to preventing the indebtedness that has been commonplace in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one outstanding matter, which you yourself have mentioned: the so-called ‘six pack’ – the economic governance package. Our group will insist on this and we will continue to insist that we strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact, and consequently we will also stand firm on the issue of the reversed qualified majority. I believe it was right to postpone the decision for the time being and to continue the negotiations. Joseph Daul has said here that we need a convincing economic policy package if we are to have a stable euro. We feel that the Stability and Growth Pact is key to this. It needs teeth, and that is why the negotiations should continue.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are a few other policy areas in which you were very successful during your Presidency. Croatia has been mentioned, and the conclusion of the accession negotiations. I can only endorse what Mr Swoboda has already said: this is a most significant step forward for the whole region. After three years, the directive on consumer rights has at last been finalised. Progress has been made on the energy efficiency plan. One further very important matter from our point of view, and also in the view of Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises, is the European patent, which President Barroso has just mentioned. A whole raft of really noteworthy successes achieved under your Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">Prime Minister, when we met in Budapest we said to you that we would assess your Presidency fairly, but that naturally we would also look at what is going on in your country. From the point of view of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, we regret that your Presidency has been overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the media law. We would have liked to have seen a different media law. Although the Commission brought about some amendments, to our way of thinking these were not in the key areas. We would also like to have seen the Constitution being drawn up by the process proposed by the Venice Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that this watchfulness of each Member State – including my own, by the way – by the rest of Europe must continue if the European Union is to make progress. Freedom dies little by little – whether it is freedom of the press or freedom to travel. In a quarter of an hour customs officers will take up their places on the German-Danish and Danish-Swedish borders in order to reintroduce border controls. That is a development against which we might have wished the Presidency to have spoken out more strongly. This whole area – freedom to travel, asylum policy, revision of the Dublin II Regulation, the attack on the freedom to travel within the Schengen area – is where we would have liked to have seen greater commitment from your Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall your Presidency has been a successful one, but we would have preferred it not to have been overshadowed by the criticisms that I have mentioned.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Prime Minister, I must admit that sometimes there are certain things I do not understand. You told us just now, ‘Europe is strong, Europe can act, Europe must act, Europe must act as a force that must assert itself amid difficult political and economic circumstances’; and everyone applauds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then I read: ‘in 1848 we did not bow to orders from Vienna; in 1956 and 1990, we did not bow to orders from Moscow, and nor shall we bow to orders from Brussels today’. Who said that? Was it Václav Klaus? No, it was Viktor Orbán, speaking to an audience in March this year. Mr Barroso will then ask why Europe is not well received in their country. It is because there are politicians who say one thing here in Brussels or Strasbourg and another thing in their own country. This is what damages Europe and brings Europe down, and Mr Orbán, you are one of those politicians.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The situation is quite clear-cut:</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">the situation is quite clear-cut, you know: you have done a fine job, as have your civil servants. This is very interesting. We are witnessing a case of nationwide schizophrenia, with unbelievable national cynicism to boot, in that in Hungary, they are undoing all the work that is done in Strasbourg and Brussels. You will tell me that this is not important. Am I right? Thank you, you are most kind! I will continue: ‘It is our expectation of all demonstrators that they should not seek to destroy the State’s goals, which serve Hungary’s interests. We will therefore always take explicit action, within the bounds of legality, against these kinds of demonstrators, in order to protect ourselves against foreigners.’ Who said that? It was Viktor Orbán!</p>
      <p sl="fr">Who said:</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘we are Hungarians, we have our own way of dealing with this; we can be unpleasant, if necessary, so that’s the right approach, I think.’</p>
      <p sl="fr">János Kádár, 1985: there is your problem, Mr Orbán.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the one hand, you were someone who fought for freedom in 1989 and then, all of a sudden, you came – and this is something strange and extraordinary – you came, distrusting yourself, because you are against the dictator of Brussels, but, since you are President of the Brussels dictatorship, this means you distrust yourself. You should be far more distrustful of yourself, Mr Orbán. So you would understand the reaction of Europeans now concerning what has happened in the press in your country. Two left-liberal newspapers wanted to merge. The European Union, Mr Barroso, then approved this merger, but your independent media council, which you control, refused the merger, as these are opposition newspapers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have a radio which is free, Club Radio. As if by chance, its frequency is being taken away, and, as if by chance, a Catholic radio station will get Club Radio’s frequency. Of course, you will say to me that this is an accident of history and that we do not know why it always goes one way and not the other. Therein lies the problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You then said just now, quite rightly, that it is a … – ah, you can shake your head; I know that everything that I say is true. You are making a mockery of this, though, because you wanted to give us a great nationalist speech, and then all the Hungarians will be saying that at least they have shown Brussels how it is.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have fought for freedom. I did not hear much from you when countries such as Egypt and Tunisia were fighting for freedoms; you were quite laid-back on that issue. Then, when people were receiving China, for example, we heard nothing from the great freedom fighter; you were quite relaxed then. So stop constantly telling us stories.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then, the issue was mentioned just now of what is happening in Europe at the moment regarding the problem of borders and what Denmark is doing. As a matter of urgency, the Presidency of the European Union and the Presidency of the Commission must say that all of this has to stop immediately. The Schengen agreements are the Schengen agreements; they are European law. No single country, whether it is Hungary or Denmark, has the right to call European law into question unilaterally.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">If we need to change European law, Mr Barroso, it will have to be changed in codecision with Parliament, and let us see if you get a majority in favour of changing Schengen, Mr Barroso.</p>
      <a text="(The President interrupted the speaker)"/>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commission President, Prime Minister, Hungary surely deserves recognition for the way it has handled the Presidency, and I would particularly like to mention here the Secretary of State, who spent many long hours with us. After Slovenia and the Czech Republic, it was the next new Member State to take the Presidency of the EU, and it did not have an easy ride.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In internal politics, Hungary faced, for example, an unprecedented shock to the eurozone, while in the area of external relations it faced unprecedented social and political changes in North Africa and the Middle East after decades of stability, and these were challenges that would have tested the nerves of far more experienced players. It is also necessary to applaud the fact that Hungary maintained internal political stability throughout the Presidency, unlike my own country, where the opposition irresponsibly toppled the government during our Presidency, thus harming my country’s image within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would nonetheless like to register one complaint, not about the Hungarian Presidency but rather about the overall role of the new EU Member States, which is also reflected in the performance of the Presidency. I do not entirely agree here with Prime Minister Orbán, as I took the view that the expansion of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe will give the Union new dynamism, new impulses and new experiences. In my opinion, that has not happened yet. In my opinion, the new Member States very quickly settled into the comfortable trajectory of the old hands, with everything which that entailed, including the European jargon and the federalist ideology, and the Presidency of the EU increasingly becoming a kind of technical-organisational exercise in administration, and not a matter of political leadership.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I dream of a day when a Prime Minister will rise from this place and say: ‘We need a new European paradigm, we cannot continue with a 50-year-old, dysfunctional, obsolete concept of European integration. We must look for a new concept.’ Of course, when someone like that is found, Mr Cohn-Bendit will boo him and call him anti-European, but I am quite sure that, outside on the streets, the citizens and voters will applaud him.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I would like to confess to a liking for Hungary and Hungarian culture, and I was therefore curious as to how Hungary would implement the motto of its programme, which was a strong Europe, Erős Európa.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I have to say that I was disappointed, because I participated in several trialogues or tripartite discussions between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, and I detected a complete lack of preparedness and an absence of any real opinion. As Mr Zahradil said, it is about continuing with a kind of comfortable, well-worn stereotype. If I could make a summary, then, of the results of this Presidency, I would say, in contrast to those expressing their thanks here to the Hungarian Presidency, that it was ‘a zero Presidency, a zero Presidency’. This is a great disappointment for me, because it was a Presidency which encountered real challenges, both in the internal and external spheres.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Where did Mr Orbán’s group or team implement that strong approach? The strong approach was implemented against his own media, the Hungarian media, the Hungarian intelligentsia and Hungarian citizens. That is where the strong approach was implemented. I believe there is an unjustified complacency prevailing in this Parliament, and that we need to talk things over genuinely and find other ways. The new Member States, including my own country, have so far squandered the opportunities they had. The awakening will clearly not come until we encounter even greater challenges. In such circumstances, perhaps the words of the great Hungarian poet Endre Ady will be remembered, from his poem ‘In need of Mohacs‘, or ‘Nekünk Mohács kell’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr Orbán, you are one of the few European leaders who has a grasp of history, believes in the nation state and champions democracy. I would say Hungary is lucky to have you. You have shown you are not prepared to be bullied by these EU nationalists. When you say that previously Hungary was dictated to by Moscow, and now it is Brussels, and you say that you are going to stand up to it, you actually mean it. So I think you have proved to be the secret weapon of the Eurosceptic movement. Your six-month tenure in this presidency has indeed been historic, because in the last six months the peoples of Europe have finally woken up to what a completely undemocratic and failing project this is.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have been some real highlights in your six months. In particular, one thinks back to the Finnish general election and the stunning success of the True Finns party. Who can blame ordinary taxpaying voters, in Finland or elsewhere, for saying that they do not want to go on bailing out this failed project called the euro? Well, hard on the heels of the Finnish result we had the third catastrophe, the third casualty; Mr Barroso’s own Portugal needed to be bailed out. Then of course we were back to Greece for the second bail-out, with people out rioting on the streets. But perhaps to cap it all, the real highlight of your presidency was that the Danes tore up the Schengen Agreement. So, all in all, I would say that you have had a remarkable, superb six months in office. More has happened to reawaken democracy and the future of the nation state perhaps than ever before.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think there is a growing realisation, both here and elsewhere, that the worm has turned, and we have seen the beginning of the end of this extremely dangerous project. Mr Orbán, jolly well done!</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to analyse and assess the half-year Hungarian Presidency from two aspects. Looking at issues first from a broader perspective, I will assess the European Union, then I would like to analyse the issues from the Hungarian point of view.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The European Union, as always, is faced with two choices: to be the nations’ Europe, an economic alliance in which the sovereignty of Member States is accepted and their independence is respected, or to be the United States of Europe, where Member States are practically considered colonies. Unfortunately, the Hungarian Presidency subscribed to the latter and supported further centralisation, which will make it more difficult for Hungary too to restore its sovereignty in the future.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians voted in 2004 in favour of the European Union because they expected that Hungarians living in the Carpathian Basin would be reunited within the borders of the EU, that they would be able have unhindered contact, and would belong to the same community again. Let us suppose the Hungarian Presidency is a symbolic presidency and has little room for manoeuvring from a national aspect. Mr Prime Minister, in spite of this you should have mentioned at least symbolically the Slovak language law, the Beneš decrees or the Szekler territorial autonomy, which you put off, while on the other hand you still fought tooth and nail to protect a defective media law and you created a Roma strategy; and the problem is not the creation of a European Roma strategy, but that along the road you did not set up a Hungarian strategy.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-025-000" speaker_id="23821" name="József Szájer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Prime Minister, a few days after the end of the Hungarian Presidency the initial feeling is relief, because we, Hungarians took the Presidency of the EU for the first time, and as you might know, we are a proud nation and we live up to what we have promised. This is what we did this time as well. We kept the rules of the club we joined, and responded to the criticisms raised previously here in connection with the media law by subjecting ourselves to common EU law, as we do not seek special treatment.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw the attention of Vice-President Swoboda in particular to this. I will read the introduction to the Hungarian Constitution in English:</p>
      <p sl="hu">‘We agree with the members of the first free Parliament, which proclaimed as its first decision that our current liberty was born of our 1956 Revolution.’</p>
      <p sl="hu">In other words, our Hungarian Constitution does commemorate 1956; the Constitution is based on these foundations.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I consider the worldview of Cohn-Bendit a bit unusual; by the way, he seems to have put in an appearance in Parliament only for the duration of making this speech. He reckons that public servants do an excellent work. The only Roma MEP and one deaf MEP are sitting among the Hungarian Members of the European Parliament, so everything is all right, except there is one problem with Hungary: the Prime Minister, who leads all this, who leads his party and the country as well with the same determination. This is a very peculiar worldview, but there might be a hidden contradiction in it. We Hungarians act as we speak, and the past period has served ample proof of this. We will definitely not comply with conditions that this European Parliament is about to adopt in its decision in a few hours’ time, in which they call for loosening the stringent criteria on the budget set out in the Constitution in order to avoid indebtedness. The European Parliament wants us to do just that. If we consider this as a Brussels or Strasbourg dictate, then it is a dictate that we will not abide by. I would also like to draw Mr Swoboda’s attention to the fact that Prime Minister Orbán expressed his thanks to everyone, to the whole Parliament, for the work accomplished, but just happened to highlight the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in particular.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, the statement I made during the Hungarian Presidency remains valid today, that is, all Hungarian patriots, including the Members of the European Parliament delegated by the Hungarian Socialist Party have a share in the success of the Presidency. It is not our fault, it is not the majority’s fault that the balance sheet of the last six months is uneven: it shows professional success and political failure at the same time. The conclusion of the accession negotiations with Croatia was due to the excellent professional attitude of the Hungarian diplomats and officials, and can be considered as the greatest achievement; furthermore, the adoption of the Danube and Roma strategies and the conclusion of the first European Semester were also successful. While we achieved only partial success, we made great efforts to promote the legislative package on economic governance. It is an unequivocal and unprecedented failure that there was no summit organised in Hungary for Heads of State or Government during the Hungarian Presidency, and the Eastern Partnership Summit was cancelled as well. It is a pity.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The overall domestic policy of the Hungarian Government has cast a shadow over professional achievements. Thus, the political benefits which could have been reaped from the presidency were not exploited. The adoption of the media law, the demolition of the democratic rule of law, the adoption of a constitution supported by only one party, and Eurosceptic presidential statements provoked justified international incomprehension and criticism. The Hungarian Government became isolated in many respects during the presidency. The international appraisal of the country has unfortunately deteriorated. It is worth noting, and I will say it slowly, so that everyone understands it: it was the German, French and Luxembourgish Governments with a right-wing majority who voiced the first criticisms about the media law, and it was the German Government with a right-wing majority that raised concerns about the constitution; therefore, the distorted statement that the European left-wing attacked the Hungarian right-wing government has no grounds whatsoever.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Prime Minister, Parliament has no ambitions to lecture anyone; that is not European etiquette. No one has the right to cane or rap knuckles, either. However, everyone has the right to express their worries and concerns if they think that common European values are in danger. Your government has received many warnings in the last six months. It is unfortunate that the Hungarian people could not live through these six months proudly with their heads held high, as this is something they really rather badly needed.</p>

It is especially important to represent and promote our core European values of human rights and freedom of expression. Therefore, Prime Minister Orbán, I welcome the way you put the Roma issues on the table, but I regret that the Hungarian Presidency failed to show the same commitment to these values from a domestic perspective.</p>
      <p sl="en">In a way it is ironic that the Hungarian Presidency has done such a good job in extending our EU family and our values to Croatia. As the Vice-Chair of Parliament’s Croatia delegation, I am extremely pleased that Croatia’s accession negotiations have been concluded during the presidency. Thanks to Hungary, the enlargement process has been kept alive and moved forward, a great and historic achievement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also pleased that Hungary, despite the difficult circumstances, has skilfully and with conviction steered the energy dossiers, including such issues as nuclear safety – with stress tests following Fukushima – transparency and integrity of energy markets – with the REMIT regulation – the Council conclusions on energy efficiency and the energy road map.</p>

If you think of the unwillingness of some Member States to find a common European solution, then one can only complement this Presidency of the Council on its internal arrangements. Prime Minister, I would like you to pass on that compliment to your Minister of State for EU Affairs, Mrs Győri, who was present here day and night and really set a good example. On that count I must take issue with Mr Ransdorf. How is a presidency supposed to make sensible proposals if it is constantly blocked, particularly by the large Member States? There are many examples of this. In view of these challenges the Presidency has really done well. Let us look at the applause given to Mr Farage or the words of Mr Zahradil or of Mr Swoboda, of Mr Cohn-Bendit – where are these gentlemen now? All four have disappeared. They had their say, but did not even want to wait to hear your answer. That is hardly a fair way to treat people, or to treat the Hungarian Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="de">Naturally, you had some domestic policy problems to resolve. Of course there were debates. Mr Swoboda’s contribution, however – which did not even go into the agenda of the Hungarian Presidency – I see as nothing more than a diversionary tactic. To Mr Cohn-Bendit I would point out that, as capable as he is, not even Mr Orbán can solve all the world’s problems from China to North Africa. The Presidency has done a good job, and bearing in mind the fact that there have also been complaints regarding how Brussels wants to regulate absolutely everything then I cannot readily take issue with your comments that have been quoted here – for the Commission in Brussels often acts as if there had been no changes in the challenges we face. It just potters along exactly as before. If we have succeeded in stemming the tide of nationalism from some Member States and in limiting the nannying of our citizens, then this Hungarian Presidency has trodden the right path and been a great success.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Orbán, first I want to thank all the Hungarian teams with whom we have done a good deal of work on economic governance. However, if you have no objection, Mr President, I do not wish to talk to you about that, nor to you, Mr Orbán.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I was enormously struck by the fact that Otto von Habsburg died just as the Hungarian Presidency completed its term. If we think back to what the Austro-Hungarian Empire was at the start of the twentieth century, I see his death as a signal which should make us vigilant. Our Member States and our structures are fragile. All those who fan the flames of nationalism, giving people the belief that it represents the solution for the future, should look at the fate of some past empires, and quite important ones too. Even the Roman Empire was one day engulfed by the storm.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that what we are trying to build together by orientating ourselves towards the future is infinitely more important than the narrow conservatism espoused by certain nationalists.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will finish on a humorous note. Mr Prodi always used to say to those who compared the dictatorship of Brussels with the dictatorship of Moscow that he would like to know the date on which they joined the Soviet Union.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to thank the Hungarian Presidency for its efforts, as you have performed work that is crucial to achieving an agreement on economic governance. We are 98% of the way to agreement.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Orbán, your aim was a strong Europe, but you can only achieve that with a strong team. I would therefore like to offer a special word of thanks to the State Secretary, Mr Kármán, your Finance Minister, your ambassador and, last but not least, Mrs Győri.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At the beginning of your Presidency, you said that you wanted to take this Parliament seriously and you have proven that to be true, as many of our wishes have come to fruition. I do not need to reiterate these at this point. However, this Parliament also wants to ensure that the Council takes decisions when they need to be taken. That is why that last 2% – the obstacles that we still need to overcome – is so important, as it is crucial that we are able to ensure effective decision making. Our collective effort needs to be focused on building on that 98% and overcoming those final obstacles.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I know that what counts is the result. We have not reached 100% yet, but you have put in place crucial preliminary work. Without your preliminary work it would not be possible – and I hope that it will be – to reach a final agreement in September.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Progress has been made on various matters, particularly with respect to the Roma, but, unlike the previous Presidency, which made a decent amount of progress on social affairs concerning the homeless, the minimum wage and the fight against child poverty, your Presidency is coming to an end without having dealt much with social affairs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You did, however, mention the priorities of growth, employment and protection of the European social model.

      <p sl="fr">You subscribed to and participated in the dominant idea on the right which says that the only method of relaunching the economy is to cut budgets, and social spending in particular. One striking example is the internal decision you made to close the Pikler Institute, which, starting in Hungary, developed an internationally recognised pedagogical method, and which has participated in the fight against child poverty.</p>

As Greeks, we recognise that, without help, we would have very serious problems and we therefore undertake to honour our commitments and to cooperate with each presidency and with the European Commission.</p>

That was the time when I realised that we had started with a serious handicap. Minus 100 metres can mean a significant handicap in a short-distance race, am I right, Hungarian Socialist colleagues? They drew plans, but did not consider that we take our objectives seriously, and would like to realise them as well. We had to overcome a couple of hurdles; our words are misinterpreted even today.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Hungarian Presidency decided upon a strict timetable and ambitious goals, and stuck to them until the very end even in the hardest times. This was the first Presidency to live through a change in the institutional system, but was able to coordinate the codecision procedure while maintaining a Parliament-friendly Presidency. The Presidency worked with perseverance in order to launch the European Semester and create the ‘six pack’ on economic governance. The Roma strategy is the key to elevate social groups lagging behind. We rallied the countries along the Danube again into an alliance with a view to launching successful economic and political cooperation. The accession of Croatia is approaching; in fact, it is at an arm’s length now. We have the right to say that the Hungarian Presidency has worked hard for success. It is a great pleasure to see that others are also satisfied with the work we have done, and I have to say that we owed this service not only to Europe, but to Hungary and its people as well.</p>

So far no country holding the presidency has managed to achieve all of the objectives it has set itself. Seen in the context of the past few years, however, the Hungarian Presidency has been very successful. It can boast of concrete achievements, such as the conclusion of negotiations with Croatia and the legislative package on strengthening economic governance. The Presidency also succeeded in raising awareness of the problems faced by the Danube region, and work started on a joint strategy on the Roma.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One of the Hungarian Government’s initiatives also merits our attention since it demonstrates how well European Union funding can be used to promote the fundamental democratic value of life.

I am thinking here of the accession negotiations that were begun with Iceland, the conclusion of those with Croatia, and also the strategy for the Danube region.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the debate we have just had clearly demonstrated how important European integration is today, and how important a role the rotating Presidency still plays.</p>
      <p sl="en">The motto of the Hungarian Presidency was ‘strong Europe’. We do indeed need a strong Europe. I think that many of the achievements which have already been enumerated here strengthen our Union – economic governance, the first-ever European Semester, financial services oversight, better protection of consumers, the Roma and Danube strategies and the conclusion of the accession negotiations with Croatia, just to mention a few.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we should not be distracted from these achievements and from the purpose of today’s political debate, let me also respond to the various comments made by honourable Members on the Hungarian Constitution and the Commission position on this issue. This is a serious matter and one which requires careful analysis before any conclusions are drawn.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new Constitution will enter into force on 1 January 2012 and will require the adoption of implementing measures. The assessment at this stage is that the Hungarian Constitution does not create issues of compatibility with Union law. Its legal effects will be fully evaluated when the implementing legislative, administrative and judicial procedures are in place. The Commission is following very closely the work of the Venice Commission, which issued its comprehensive opinion on this issue on 20 June, following a request from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. We are currently analysing this opinion. Against this backdrop, I assure you that the Commission takes its work as guardian of Union law very seriously and will remain vigilant vis-à-vis Hungary, and indeed any other Member State, and will not hesitate to make use of its prerogatives if necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us now turn to what made this Presidency such a turning-point, the decisive steps made in terms of strengthening our economic governance and our common economic policy through the European Semester. As several speakers highlighted, the current crisis brought home very clearly the message that our economies are interconnected, our future is linked together and the EU is a shared economic space, not 27 separate economies. The crisis showed what kind of effects we may feel if one country is not performing well. This formed the basis of the EU 2020 strategy and our first European Semester.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to thank the Hungarian Presidency for the successful European Semester and the successful discussion on the country-specific recommendations, which have also been endorsed by the European Council. This created the best possible conditions for the transition from the European Semester to the national semesters. We know that the reforms will be successful only if they are owned by the national governments and implemented on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like to make just one comment on the economic governance package. I think that both Council and Parliament have made tremendous progress. We are very close to the successful conclusion of this very important governance package. It would, of course, be highly appreciated if we could go the extra mile required and conclude the very important negotiations on this package as soon as possible. A sincere word of thanks goes to the Hungarian Presidency, who really put a lot of energy and negotiating effort into bringing this package so close to fruition.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the Hungarian Presidency, the priority from day one has been to conclude the accession negotiations with Croatia. This was a great success which sends a very important signal, not only to the Croats but to all the peoples in the Western Balkans, because we have reconfirmed that their future lies within the European Union. We have also reconfirmed that enlargement is a credible process from the point view of both sides, both in terms of preparations and of the European Union’s commitment towards the Western Balkan nations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Hungarian Presidency was instrumental in helping to shape new policy in our neighbourhood, where we support ‘deep’ and real democracy and where we are ready to support reforms which consolidate this positive development in these regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to conclude with two very important strategies. The first is the Danube Strategy where, I believe, we will replicate the success of the first macroeconomic strategy the Commission unveiled, the strategy for the Baltic Sea Region. I believe that, through common cooperation and the expertise offered by the Commission, we can really help this region achieve new economic successes and new economic prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the important work on the Roma strategy was very well received. We clearly demonstrated that the Roma issue is a European one, and that we need to seek a solution at European level. This is an issue which must be tackled by all institutions and by all Member States. Therefore the interconnection of policies at European level and national concrete action plans are very important and, I believe, will bring positive results for the Roma minority.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to thank, also, the partners with whom I have been working almost on a daily basis, Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi and State Secretary Enikó Győri. They, out of the whole Hungarian Presidency team, probably spent the most time in Parliament. I think they did a great job and I would like to thank them very much for their cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, I would like to reiterate that the Hungarian Presidency expresses its thanks to everyone in the European Parliament, as well as to Mr Jerzy Buzek, President of the European Parliament, who supported our work all along, and I repeat, I would like to express my thanks especially to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and their leader, because the Hungarian Presidency would not have been successful without their outstanding political support. Let us talk straight. The Hungarian Presidency was in the centre of attacks by the international left-wing right from the start. This could have paralysed the Hungarian Presidency, and could have made it impossible to achieve our objectives. It took a lot to endure the attacks of the international left-wing. We needed the help of the PPE Group and their leader, and I am grateful to the Members of the PPE Group because they stood by us and helped our work.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, we heard a few personal remarks as well, to which I feel obliged to respond not for personal reasons, but in the interest of Hungary. Please allow me to talk straight again. It is a cheap trick to say there are civil servants who do their job right and there are bad leaders. I encountered these arguments dozens of times during my 21-year career as an MP. These arguments are heard, these arguments are used by the opposition when the government is undeniably successful in achieving something, and the opposition cannot deny it either, but does not want to admit the success and attribute it to the leaders, therefore it rather delegates it to the corps of civil servants. This reasoning would even seem funny if it was not so tiresomely boring.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Regarding Mr Tabajdi’s remark about governments in Europe which, in his opinion, expressed their concerns and criticism about the Hungarian Constitution – what I am going to say is not addressed to Brussels, but rather to the national governments: no European prime minister or European government is in a position to tell us, Hungarians, what kind of constitution we can or cannot have. This is for our nation to decide, and we will decide about it in due course. Similarly, I have to say, Mr Tabajdi, that we do believe in peaceful, sober, and calm debate, but you know the Hungarian saying: give as good as you get.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, now I would also like to respond to Mr Cohn-Bendit’s remark driven by undue attention to my person. First of all, I would like to express my thanks for the flattering attention to my political activities including my speeches delivered in Budapest. I would like to reaffirm my opinion that Brussels is not Moscow. I would, however, like to make it clear that I will always protect Hungary against remarks, even coming from Brussels, which can be interpreted in Hungary as if you were to tell us what we can do and what we cannot do. You, Mr Cohn-Bendit, are in no position to tell us what to do, and I have to say that I can only raise the popularity of Europe in my country if I make it clear to Hungarians that you will never be the one to tell them what they can and cannot do.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It seems that a significant difference remains in our coexistence and political debates, and I would like to draw your attention to it. We are both, beyond doubt, rebellious personalities. You rebelled against a civil democracy, I rebelled against a dictatorship, and this difference, oddly, has survived between us, and I regret to see that you follow the European left-wing tradition that claims that if people do not vote for them, then there will be no democracy, because they were left out of the government. This reasoning is well-known in Hungary.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me now to express my thanks to Eurosceptics for their supporting remarks. They practically supported my work all along, for which I am grateful, but I need to clarify one thing: the Hungarian Government and I personally are not Eurosceptics ourselves. We are not sceptical in general. This is a question of personality. We are optimistic and confident people who would rather believe in things than be sceptical about them. This is why we believe in European integration and cooperation, and I belong to a generation whose grandparents explained to them clearly that if there was no European integration, no European cooperation, then sooner or later there would be war in Europe. We take this seriously, and for this reason will always persevere like a nation that suffered a lot during two world wars. We will always hold on to the spirit of European cooperation and integration. I would also like to make it clear that I have always appreciated your work here. I belong to a religious community whose fundamental slogan – for which it seceded from the Catholic Church – is that the church has to be reformed constantly, therefore your provocative and critical remarks are very useful for the EU, because the EU has to be reformed constantly as well, and provocative and critical remarks are in fact needed, so I thank you for the support you provided for our work.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Concerning the Constitution, firstly, I would like to make it clear that the European Union respects the constitutional and national identity of its Member States. This is enshrined in the Treaty on the European Union and the case law of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. Therefore we insist that the Hungarian Constitution be drafted by Hungarians. At the same time, I would also like to make it clear that the Constitution is centred on life, family, nation and human dignity, which is a way of thinking that is welcomed with support, sympathy and delight by millions of Europeans. While some are critical toward the Hungarian Constitution, there are people in the European Union who consider life, family, nation and human dignity very important, and are happy that there is a new Constitution that places emphasis on these values, and we are proud to see that millions of Europeans agree with us, and consider the Hungarian Constitution a great achievement.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, finally I would like to read out three sentences from the beginning of the report of the Venice Commission that you have so frequently referred to, in order to clarify some misunderstandings between us. I quote from the report: ‘Hungary has adopted a new Constitution which aims to meet the general features of a modern Constitution within the framework of the Council of Europe. In particular, the Venice Commission welcomes the fact that this new Constitution establishes a constitutional order based on democracy, the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights as underlying principles. A particular effort has been made to follow closely the technique and the contents of the ECHR and to some extent the EU Charter.’ End of quote. I have to say therefore that the Hungarian Constitution as a whole is a modern, democratic European constitution in its nature and political character. Hungarians, using their rights as enshrined in the Treaty, will draft the necessary rules and details in the Hungarian Parliament. I thank those who wished us strength and good health for this work.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Finally, I would like to repeat that it was a great pleasure to cooperate with you in the past period. It was a great pleasure not just when you supported us. I have to admit to Mr Swoboda as well that even debating with you was a great pleasure, and I had the opportunity to meet many critical, but fundamentally amiable MEPs even from the left wing of Parliament, with whom we share European ideals.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for your cooperation, I wish you every success, and ask you to support the Polish Presidency just as you supported us.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The most noteworthy internal controversies, which have had repercussions on discussions in Parliament, include the range of attacks on freedoms and fundamental rights, especially as regards the media law and the review of the Hungarian Constitution, which represents a setback to the rights of women, workers, intellectuals and the Hungarian population in general.</p>

The Hungarian Presidency played a full role, at a technical level, in formulating a decision on these issues, endorsed at the European Council meeting just held in June. However, the Commission’s package of legislative proposals on economic governance has failed to be adopted at first reading during the Hungarian Presidency, with the European Parliament’s vote on this item being postponed until July. On the external relations’ front, the conclusion of the accession negotiations with Croatia and the setting of a definite deadline for signing the Treaty of Accession undoubtedly mark a success for the Hungarian Presidency. Unfortunately for Romania, the Hungarian Presidency has been overshadowed by a lack of firmer commitment about accession to the Schengen area. Other dossiers where noteworthy progress has been made and which I would like to congratulate the Hungarian Presidency on are the adoption of the EU strategy for the Danube region and the EU strategy framework for Roma inclusion. The Hungarian Presidency has been actively involved in the process of concluding these dossiers and ensuring that they had the desired high profile.</p>

      <p sl="de">At EU level – and that is, after all, the context in which a presidency of the Council should be assessed – the Hungarian Presidency achieved quite a lot. Particular highlights include the fact that it addressed the problem of the Roma people, made progress on development of the EU border protection agency, Frontex, and was able to achieve agreement on the European patent. Moreover, it made a start on a series of other activities such as the strategy for the Danube region, the European Semester, the start of accession negotiations with Iceland and the quasi-conclusion of those with Croatia.</p>
      <p sl="de">The staccato of criticism faced by the Hungarian Presidency in respect of the media law, for example, showed once again that the Brussels machine cares less about democratic legitimacy and more about conforming with the EU establishment, and that it is not above dragging domestic policy matters onto the European stage in the context of the presidency. It is worth noting how well-regarded Mr Orbán, with his patriotic government, has remained during these turbulent six months – which were not just overshadowed by controversial domestic policies for which Hungary was roundly criticised, but which also saw the Japanese nuclear disaster, the Arab Spring and the aftermath of the debt crisis. Brussels would be well advised to finally recognise the value of democratic legitimacy and to accept the will of the people – whether we are taking about referendums on EU matters or the domestic affairs of Member States.</p>

I will confine myself, as a member of the Transylvanian Hungarian minority and a Romanian citizen, to expressing my appreciation and thanks to the Hungarian Presidency, and to Prime Minister Orbán in particular for the attention that they paid to the issues of minority communities and Europe’s cultural, ethnic and religious diversity, and for the support they provided for the European integration of countries in the West Balkans, namely for the accession of Croatia and the admission of Romania into the Schengen area. Going beyond appreciation, I would like to apologize to the plenary session of the European Parliament, because while the Hungarian Presidency tried to do its best to find a way out of the crisis in the extraordinary circumstances of the global economic crisis, the post-Communist Hungarian left-wing, namely the Members delegated by the Hungarian Socialist Party ‘exported’ their frustrations with domestic policy and their party policy conflicts to the EU and to Parliament especially, and with the assistance of their misguided foreign supporters they had the gall to hinder and set back the dedicated work of the Hungarian Presidency by all means possible for cheap political gains, betraying Hungarian national values and ignoring common European values.

      <p sl="sk">The Hungarian Presidency has certainly been successful in completing the accession talks with Croatia, in outlining the Roma strategy and in introducing the European budget semester. Frankly, however, that is no particular credit to Mr Orbán, as any country would have done the same as a matter of routine. What Mr Orbán has really brought to European politics is confusion and uncertainty. The speeches about Brussels dictating in the same way that Moscow did resemble the views of the most hardline anti-Europeans, to say nothing of your other anti-European outbursts. Mr Orbán, you are annoyed with Europeans because they do not go along with your Hungarian nationalism, or your expansion at the expense of your neighbours. On the contrary, Europeans are a barrier to your attempts to subjugate minorities in other states, and to extend Hungarian laws to neighbouring states. Europe is a barrier to your attempts to gradually change borders. In connection with the adoption of the new Hungarian Constitution, your Presidency of the EU has brought only an attempt to destabilise Central Europe and an attempt to reduce the importance of the EU as a whole. This is all down to the egotistical nationalistic aims of Fidesz policy. This is unacceptable for us Slovaks, just as it is for all genuine Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item, which is of very great importance, is the report (A7-0170/2011) by Mrs Lepage, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2001/18/EC with regard to the possibility for the Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their territory (COM(2010)0375 - C7-0178/2010 - 2010/208(COD)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-065-000" speaker_id="97076" name="Corinne Lepage" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, you are correct, this is an important report because our fellow citizens attach a great deal of importance to this subject.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First and foremost, I would like to give my very warm thanks to the shadow rapporteurs, who were enormously helpful to me in the drafting of this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The aim of the Commission’s proposal is to permit Member States, if they wish to do so, to prohibit the cultivation of all or some genetically modified organisms (GMOs) within their territory. The initial proposal did not establish any kind of grounds on which that could be permitted, and this led to a number of criticisms from a legal point of view.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It has therefore been my objective to define common rules at European level which will enable us to supervise the opt-out process. Some subsidiarity is required, but we really must supervise the process in such a way as not to unravel the Community policies that we have had so much trouble introducing. However, this is also about responding to the wishes of the Member States, the various regions in Europe and the even larger number of citizens who do not want to allow the cultivation of GMOs to develop within their own territory.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have therefore established three categories of grounds which could allow the cultivation of GMOs to be prohibited. The first grounds, on which all the groups are in agreement, are environmental grounds supplementing those that are evaluated at European level. They supplement them because they deal with local or systemic aspects of the use of GMOs in a given agronomic context. One example of this is the resistance of weeds to pesticides used with GMOs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second category of grounds has to do with socio-economic impact. Should we not know and take into account the cost of contamination, or of measures that need to be taken to control it, for conventional and organic farmers?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, there are grounds associated with land use and with town and country planning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While we are very much aware how important it is to give full effect to the environmental decision voted on by the Council in December 2008, which calls for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to have better expertise on GMOs, we would like to maintain centralised management while leaving the Member States some room for manoeuvre. This of course implies that EFSA must improve its work in managing conflicts of interest within the GMO panel and in risk evaluation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, we are proposing a change of the legal basis, namely replacing Article 114 with Article 192, which is designed to secure the measures taken by the various Member States. The objective here is to avoid leading the Member States into decisions that they could not later defend in good conditions before the courts, should they be taken there by producers of GMOs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we think it is essential to make it obligatory to develop coexistence measures. At the very least, if a country wishes to authorise the cultivation of GMOs, it should take the measures necessary to protect other sectors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety passed a satisfactory report, but it was necessary to move towards compromise solutions to make the vote in plenary possible. I am very disappointed by the position taken by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and by its rapporteur, because we were actually very close in our positions and yet we could not find a compromise solution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The amendments tabled on behalf of my group, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, are compromise amendments which, I hope, will manage to obtain the support of all groups, and even from the majority of the PPE Group. These are amendments which, I think, are a fair compromise between the need to respond to the wishes of Europeans and of the Commission and the need, at the same time, to maintain a centralised system without actually dismantling the single market. The important thing, however, is actually to allow Member States, the regions and the citizens, if they wish to do so, to act as they see fit.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have said much this morning about democracy. The report that has been submitted to you here is indeed orientated towards European democracy. We cannot act as if we do not know what our fellow citizens want. We must do this through the law, taking into account the relevant economic, health and environmental requirements. Furthermore, the demand for democracy is a fundamental imperative for all of us as MEPs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, about a year ago I presented the proposal on GMO cultivation to Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. The key message of the proposal, which is limited in scope, would allow Member States to restrict or prohibit GMO cultivation on their territory or on part of their territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me first congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Lepage, for her very active work and also thank the shadow rapporteurs of all the other political groups for their involvement. The draft report reflects the important work undertaken during the last months.</p>
      <p sl="en">I certainly welcome your efforts towards clarifying the grounds on which restrictions on cultivation may be justified. The possible grounds to be invoked are, by definition, open. That is why, in order to avoid restricting Member States’ flexibility, the Commission’s proposal referred only to grounds other than the assessment of adverse effects of GMOs on health or the environment. I understand, however, that specifying these grounds in the proposal itself would enhance the proposal. I can therefore support this approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the concrete grounds being considered, I certainly welcome the fact that they are largely inspired by the list that the Commission developed at the request of the Member States at the Environment Council on 20 December 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">A fundamental point for discussion between co-legislators is the formulation of environmental grounds. As with any other grounds, these would need to be substantiated in line with the reality of the territory in question. But it should be made explicit that these environmental reasons or policy objectives are distinct from risks assessed according to the GMO legislation. This is essential to preserve the EU authorisation system, with the Member States playing an active role during the risk assessment prior to an EU-wide authorisation, but without duplication at national level once the authorisation is given.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to emphasise that the proposal aims to give Member States a choice not to cultivate. Where there is an identified risk, it is not a matter of choice, but instead there is an obligation to act at EU level – and the existing legislation provides for precise and restrictive measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of amendments concern articles of Directive 2001/18/EC other than the proposed new Article 26b.</p>
      <p sl="en">In its proposal, the Commission favoured a targeted amendment to deliver specifically on Member States’ requests for an opt-out clause. It did not touch other articles.</p>
      <p sl="en">While we could consider, in an overall agreement, some of the amendments modifying other articles, there are two particular amendments that warrant careful attention.</p>
      <p sl="en">Accepting Amendment 12, relating to Article 22 on free circulation, could weaken our argumentation in the event of EU or WTO litigation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Similarly, as regards Amendment 24 on a general mandatory system of financial liability, it is questionable whether this proposal to introduce an opt-out clause for cultivation is the right instrument to address financial liability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, Article 114 of the Treaty does not seem to be the appropriate legal basis for imposing an obligation on Member States to adopt financial liability systems. I consider, however, that Article 114 is the appropriate legal basis for this proposal, whose centre of gravity is the approximation of laws in Member States for the establishment of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by underlining that Parliament, the Council and the Commission need to continue working in an effective and productive manner to build bridges between opposing views on GMO cultivation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I remain committed to working closely with the two co-legislators with the aim of reaching agreement as soon as possible.</p>

    <intervention id="2-067-000" speaker_id="96959" name="George Lyon" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is my pleasure to speak on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which also considered this. I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and Ms Lepage too for her good work in trying to bring both the reports together into an agreed position.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission proposal, of course, is not about whether you are pro-GM or anti-GM. The legislation will give Member States, for the very first time, a proper legal base to ban cultivation of GM crops. It will give them the power to do so. From the Commission’s point of view it will hopefully free up the stalemate in the current authorisation process, and bring to an end Member States’ illegal use of safeguard clauses to introduce bans on GM cultivations, which the European Court of Justice has found against on a number of occasions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Agriculture Committee’s approach to this was to rather reluctantly support the Commission’s proposal but with a number of safeguards. We wanted to reinforce the view that the principle of proportionality should be taken into account when Member States think about introducing a ban on GM cultivation. We also believed and insisted that the freedom of choice of consumers and farmers should also be taken into account by Member States when considering a ban, and at no time was any legal advice given to us that this would be at odds with the legal basis we were working on. We also insisted that farmers and growers must be given proper notice of a ban to give them time to adapt, if any Member State decided to introduce a ban either in one of its regions or across the whole of its territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also insisted that Member States introduce as an absolute requirement co-existence measures to protect non-GM growers. Before going further and using the new powers that we are seeking to introduce to put a blanket ban, or a regional ban, in place, the first step should always be that Member States should use co-existence measures as a first step in trying to protect non-GM growers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we agreed that Member States could use wider environmental grounds to introduce a ban provided – and this is very important – that they did not undermine the current EU-wide authorisation process. The environmental grounds that they use for introducing a ban must be distinct. Otherwise we threaten to undermine the EU authorisation process which I think is very important.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope we can make progress on this issue. I notice the divisions in the Council so I suspect it will not be easy, but I hope that the Commission, Parliament and the Council can make this small adjustment and this giving back of a small amount of power to Member States as a way to break the current logjam, and I hope we can make progress on that.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude for the work done in this report. However, I have to say that an agreement between the political groups has not been reached.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is a very significant report because it breaks the unity of environmental policy that has always existed in Europe. The break is a result of requests to which the Commission, of course, has rightfully replied.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is not totally united either. However, we have reached some basic agreements in which we understand, firstly, that the legal pillar cannot be changed as it puts the internal market in danger. The internal market is one of the most important values that we have achieved. It safeguards agriculture and our negotiations before the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Therefore, we want a report that, within the uncertainty it creates, is well-founded on an adequate legal construct.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, we seek to strengthen the scientific nature of decisions. We have a large body, the European Food Safety Authority, which we cannot weaken by returning to taking decisions only from the criteria of national authorities. Therefore, we support the fact that decisions should be taken on a case by case basis, that they should not be subjective, and that we should also bear in mind we are now subject to grand populist policies and media pressure that can often make us lose sight of clear and objective scientific values.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, we want to say that is necessary to safeguard agriculture in Europe. It is necessary to strengthen Europe. I want to add something more: certain forms of nationalism are the greatest and most dangerous form of euroscepticism. I believe democracies based on national parliaments have been talked about here, and we must take into account that the joint European policy is also democracy and it has produced a major environmental policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, the Group of the European People’s Party officially supports the report although there are groups, such as the Spanish delegation, that think differently. It is obviously going to support the Commission’s Dalli report but it is not going to support the Lepage report if our amendments are not adopted.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, after dealing with nuclear energy we are now broaching another sensitive subject: GMOs. It is immensely tricky to find a perfect balance between those who would like to show a red light to GMOs – seeing them only as a danger – and those who want to give them a green light, seeing them as cause for hope. The rapporteur, Corinne Lepage, has managed this delicate task very skilfully and prepared a balanced report, which received broad support during the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety vote.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the moment, the Member States and the Council cannot find common ground on which approve or reject GMOs. Governments feel the scepticism of public opinion and try to transfer responsibility to the Commission. At the same time, there is no consensus behind the removal of any safeguard clauses if Member States decide to introduce them. The EU is, therefore, in a hypocritical situation where the Council does not approve GMOs, but some Member States cultivate them.</p>
      <p sl="en">GMOs approved for EU-wide use should be cleared for cultivation in the Union, but they are banned in some Member States. This report will bring more legal certainty for Member States and could help to break the existing deadlock. Usually our group is a proponent of a Community approach, but in this particular case we should not have a one-size-fits-all policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The inclusion of complementary environmental reasons – as well as a list of social and economic grounds for the restriction or prohibition of GMOs by Member States – will make this report more legally solid. This report should not in any way prevent Member States from cultivating EU-approved GMOs if they so wish, nor should it hamper research. But each country has to solve the problem of co-existence and take all necessary steps to avoid the unintended presence of GMOs in their territory and in their neighbouring countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, let me start by congratulating my colleague Corinne Lepage for the great work accomplished. There is no consistency or consensus at the EU or national level, nor among the European public opinion, about the cultivation of GMOs. I believe that this report goes in the right direction as it draws a solid and common European framework under which Member States will be able to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs in their territory.</p>
      <p sl="de">Those saying that such an approach would create an obstacle to the European internal market are wrong, and they tend to forget that, when it comes to such a controversial and still debated technology, affecting European territories, the landscape, biodiversity and regional specificity, the level of discussion should be left as close as possible to European citizens. The conservation of our environment and the protection of public health go before freedom of choice for farmers or the free circulation of goods within the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are deliberating on an important piece of legislation. We will shortly be deciding, in the manner of legal stakeholders, the conditions under which the Member States may restrict or prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) within their territory. We are arguing for a regulation of liability under which the polluter pays for the damage that results from the deliberate release of GMOs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Member States can prohibit or restrict GMOs on the basis of additional environment-related grounds, such as the prevention of pesticide resistance amongst weeds and pests, the maintenance of local biodiversity, scientific uncertainty concerning the potential negative effects of GMOs, the socio-economic impact and the excessive costs of coexistence between conventional organic and GMO agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Essentially, the matter at hand is the protection of the autonomy of farmers and consumers against the idea that everything that is technologically possible may be done and against the conviction that everything in this world can be bought.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, in my opinion, Mrs Lepage’s report goes far beyond the framework of the Commission proposal, as the Commissioner has also emphasised here. It is clearly motivated by opposition to genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), and under the aegis of strengthening the role of nation states tries to prohibit GMOs even where the Food Standards Authority approves a product and scientifically verifies it. We know that genetically-modified foods are becoming a normal product in the rest of the world, and our initial caution may worsen and is worsening the position of our farmers on the global market. This report would be fair if, on the other hand, it also allowed EU Member States and citizens free cultivation of genetically-modified foods that have not been approved at European level. However, the report only increases existing restrictions. I cannot vote for the report unless the proposed amendments which slightly liberalise it are adopted.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, when the Member States finally obtain the authority to keep outside their borders this junk – namely genetically modified organisms (GMOs) – that the European Union wishes to authorise, it must not be a mere pretence of authority, as it was in the original Commission proposal.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We do not need to be fobbed off – or, as we say in Dutch, we do not need a dead sparrow. We get enough of that with all the pesticides that we have to spray on GMOs. Let us be honest, apart from the health, environmental and socio-economic grounds as the justification for the Member States to ban the cultivation of GMOs, this piece of legislation is superfluous. If one Member State decides in favour of GMOs and the next one against, that destroys the competitive position of European farmers. It is then just a question of waiting for a case at the Court of Justice and a bright judge who dares to say that it cannot be authorised right across the European Union. This issue must be resolved.</p>

      <p sl="it">Our motto is ‘United in diversity’, is it not? What is there to fear if an individual Member State, in accordance with the will of its citizens, bans or at least partially reduces the use of products resulting from the cultivation of GMOs? I cannot see where the problem is, if we want to talk about democracy, rights and protecting consumers. Lega Nord has always kept consumers close to its heart; we are only scared of the aversion to origin marking on food product labels and the desire to thwart ‘Made in’ labelling.

Where we part company with the Commission is over the way in which the Europhiles, as always, are seeking to exploit such genuine concerns and real problems by pushing for federal European solutions.

At the same time, I support the rapporteur, Mrs Lepage, who is attempting to make the grounds more specific and to include more of them.</p>
      <p sl="de">The factor which unified the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) was our desire for greater legal certainty. This has been achieved in particular by introducing the public order argument, which complies with the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). That is one important reason. Nevertheless, the members of the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) in the European Parliament are in favour of the report by Mrs Lepage because it points in the right direction by listing the specific grounds which allow the Member States to oppose the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We all know that the assessments carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are controversial to a certain extent, both with regard to their timeframe and their regional and local balance. Therefore, the call for the recognition of other scientific grounds is a legitimate one. The Member States should have a far-reaching right to ban GMOs on their territory. For this reason, this report represents a move in the right direction.</p>

For this reason, it would be wrong for Brussels to force the Member States to accept GM crops. It would not be the right thing to do and it would not be accepted.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that Parliament and the Commission are moving towards transferring the responsibility and the competence for this area to the Member States. Each country must decide for itself whether or not it wants to introduce genetically modified plants into the environment. It is rather regrettable that we do not have unity within Europe, but that is the reality of the situation. I think that this approach is the right one because the countries which do not want genetically modified organisms (GMOs) should not be forced to use them. Now we need legal certainty concerning the grounds on which GMOs can be opposed. The Commission has referred to some of the reasons, but these are not enough. A number of gaps remain. Mrs Lepage’s report fills precisely these gaps in the environmental aspects. We have totally different ecosystems and different approaches to the environment. This report is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope it is successful.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will be supporting it in any case. What we also need is freedom of choice for farmers and for consumers. Mr Dalli, we urgently need a regulation concerning the distance between GMO fields and conventional crops. First of all, though, Mrs Lepage’s report must achieve a majority in plenary tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I believe that our decision today marks a black day for the European internal market. We are giving up on the concept of the internal market as a result of what is simply a reflex opposition to technology. This is obviously the latest fashion in the EU. We have criticised Denmark today for wanting to leave the Schengen Agreement for populist reasons. Essentially, we are now behaving in the same way. We must be fully aware of what we are doing. We are allowing the European Food Safety Authority to continue authorising genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on the internal market, but, at the same time, we are giving the Member States the legal means to deviate from these authorisation criteria. I hope that this will not set a precedent for other internal market decisions which are due to be made in future. We should pull ourselves together at this point and remember that we must not give up on the European idea at every opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to say a big thank you to Mrs Lepage for her sterling work, which I hope will receive our support. I was interviewed on the radio this morning by the BBC on account of today’s debate and there I mentioned the main argument put forward in favour of GMOs, namely that it will solve the problem of world hunger. That is what we must do. That is the future – a new green revolution. It is a strong argument. It makes an impression on us, and I do not believe that it is only Monsanto and SynTech that support it. I have to say that GMOs are part of the problem, not part of the solution.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is only a few months since we received the report from the UN’s Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Olivier De Schutter, and he made it quite clear that we should take a very different approach. We should focus on small-scale farming and genetic diversity instead of creating large industrial-scale farms. They will have precisely the opposite effect. They will be detrimental, and therefore I think that we need to quash this argument and be honest in what we do, and we also need to stop producing fuel for cars when we first and foremost need food for people.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, this report does well in pointing out some of the many weaknesses in the area of evaluating the risks associated with the cultivation and spread of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). There are also weaknesses in terms of assessing the effect on health and other socio-economic effects. If it is certain that these weaknesses have implications for the cultivation and spread of GMOs and that, in line with the principle of precaution, they should be banned, it is also certain that the same should apply to their authorisation, marketing and consumption. There is no valid reason for this not to happen: the market and business cannot take precedence over protecting health and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is another aspect to take into account, however. Risk assessment, which is something purely technical or scientific, is one thing, but it is quite another to make decisions about whether a risk is acceptable. This is a political decision and, for the good of democracy, it is one in which the people should have a say, through the political structures that they oversee, and which are close to them.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the proposal is well-intentioned, but it does not go far enough. According to Eurobarometer surveys, 61% of EU citizens feel uneasy about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and ultimately the majority of the citizens should be able to decide about what appears on their plates. Therefore, the consequence must be an EU-wide ban. Another argument in favour of this is that genetically modified seeds do not stop at national borders. Birds, insects, wind and water can transport them throughout the entire EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU must also stand up to the US and the World Health Organisation (WHO). In the past, the Court of Justice of the European Union has proved that Europe can go its own way. I am thinking here about the decision against importing US cattle that had been treated with growth hormones. We are not here to represent the interests of the US agriculture lobby. We are under an obligation to protect our citizens from risky technologies.

The European Commission, it seems to me, has evaded its responsibilities and transferred them to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would have hoped that we could enhance the scientific expertise of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and that we could do so by performing an environmental and health assessment at Community level. Once this had been achieved, we could have had a clear idea of the Member States’ room for manoeuvre under the current regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Admittedly, the assessment must be carried out on a case-by-case basis and according to a scientific approach. How can we explain to Member States who do not have the resources needed to carry out their own assessments that they will not receive a sound assessment from EFSA? That is why I would genuinely have wanted us to enhance the scientific expertise of the agency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With the criteria proposed in the report, we can imagine that the Member States will be able to invoke all kinds of grounds in order to prohibit the cultivation of GMOs.

It is not up to us, here and now, to take a position for or against GMOs, but simply to try to find a legal and pragmatic solution that allows us to go further with the common approach that we are hoping for, over time, and following a calm, unbiased discussion.</p>

Unfortunately, GMOs are already legal right around the world. This will have transnational consequences, including in countries that have tighter restrictions in this area. Therefore, this legislation that we are adopting is absolutely crucial. Unbeknown to them, citizens are eating genetically modified meat and dairy products because farmers are giving genetically modified feed to their animals.

Seen in this way, one of the problems it poses for the European Union is of a legal nature, since effective, clear and correctly implemented regulations are essential to ensure the safety of consumers at the same time as observing the principles of the single European market. The results of Eurobarometer surveys carried out last year show that public acceptance of GMOs is low in all EU Member States, and yet governments want to take autonomous decisions to allow transgenic food to be cultivated on their territory. The fact that scientific research into such food is still in its infancy is a significant factor which radicalises opinions on the cultivation of organisms of this type.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Against this backdrop, the solutions proposed in the report we are debating together are a compromise and comply with the principle of subsidiarity. We should give Member States the opportunity to take account of their own unique situations, in particular at local and regional level. They should have the right to place a ban on the cultivation of GMOs in cases where this is justified by environmental and agricultural protection considerations. At the same time, the procedure for approving the cultivation of individual genetically modified organisms should remain within the jurisdiction of the European Food Safety Authority. In this connection, particular emphasis should be placed on research which forms a basis for the expert opinions necessary for decision making and risk management.

The promises were of harvests offering bumper yields and strong drought resistance, requiring less chemical treatment. The reality is that we have ended up in a situation where a few companies own an ever-increasing share of the seeds and crops used to produce food and receive huge profits from the sale of the chemicals required to grow these crops. This situation is gradually turning into a monopoly of food resources, while also having serious repercussions for biodiversity. In addition, we still do not know the full facts about the effects of genetic manipulation. National governments must have the right to halt the cultivation of these crops if they pose a danger to the environment or based on socio-economic reasons. Indeed, the legal right to restrict cultivation entails, at the same time, assuming responsibility.</p>

Unfortunately, at this time we do not have sufficient scientific evidence concerning the long-term environmental and ecological effects of growing these crops. This undermines the perception of the technology, and makes consumers sceptical. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has recently been to the United States, where we saw an excessive trust in genetic technology, while excessive mistrust is more typical of Europe. This technology is stigmatised in certain countries in a populist manner. The ambivalence of the European perspective is reflected by the fact that 90% of European soy feed imports originate from GM production. It would be worth considering the application of this technology for biofuel production, but unfortunately no unambiguous research has been carried out yet on long-term environmental and health effects.

The principles contained in Mrs Lepage’s report defining the rules under which individual Member States may limit or ban GMO production on their territory are a step towards finding a truly responsible way to take decisions over this issue.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me thank Parliament once again for its active and efficient handling of this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start by reacting to some of the comments that were made during this debate. First of all, I do not share Mr Häusling’s assessment on the competence of EFSA to decide on GMOs. I believe that we have the competence, but naturally the processes need to be strengthened and are always susceptible to being strengthened. This is, as you all know, what we are doing now. On the other hand, we have to understand that EFSA’s decisions are not instructions or edicts requiring Member States to cultivate GMOs. They are statements on safety from the health and environmental perspective. Therefore we need other processes when it comes to cultivation.</p>
      <p sl="en">On these processes again, I would like to comment on what Ms Grossetête said, with which I totally disagree. Ms Grossetête said that the Commission, through this proposal, is avoiding its responsibility and passing it on to Member States. I would suggest that it is completely the opposite. Cultivation comes at the tail end of a process which starts from the authorisation phase. At this authorisation phase, where Member States have total competence to decide on whether to authorise GMOs or not, Member States are on record that they have never decided one way or the other, thus passing the responsibility from them to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time we have countries who are opposing this proposal who are today prohibiting cultivation in their own territories through safeguard clauses which are illegal under the European directive. It needs to be said that, every time the Commission tries to take action against these safeguard clauses, it is always blocked by the Council. I think it is time that we stopped this situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to look at some positive elements of these proposals. I believe that having this provision implemented would put more pressure on the biotech industry to persuade consumers and their representatives about the benefits of their products, and to ensure that risks are reduced and benefits are increased. The objective of responsible innovation which we are pushing is not an economic benefit but it is a citizens’ benefit.</p>
      <p sl="en">May I remind you that the proposal addresses the long-standing demands of some Member States for more subsidiarity on GMO cultivation. The swift work of Parliament gave us additional impetus to work hard with the Hungarian Presidency towards a compromise proposal which could have been the starting point for discussions and a possible agreement. Unfortunately, despite the substantive progress achieved under the Hungarian Presidency, it was not possible to open discussions with Parliament before today’s vote. Whilst many Member States continue to emphasise the importance of the Commission’s proposals, others keep asking for extra time and further clarifications. We must double our efforts to find the necessary common ground, thus accommodating those who want to cultivate GMOs and those who may wish to restrict or prohibit cultivation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I remain committed to working with Parliament and the Council on the clarification and possible improvement of the proposal, to reach an agreement as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I will use my thirty seconds to thank all those who have taken the floor to say that taking scientific factors into account is part of the compromise, that this is not about emotive questions, but about the right given to Member States to prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) within their territory, because that is what their citizens want.

      <p sl="lt">We cannot argue with the opinion of those colleagues who said today that the European Parliament has a strong and clear position on the cultivation of genetically modified crops in EU Member States. There is also persistent opposition among European citizens to the release of GMOs. More than a million signatures have been gathered against the cultivation of genetically modified crops. I believe that the European Parliament’s position today reflects perfectly the mood in society. We still lack reliable, objective and unbiased information on the long-term impact of genetically modified crops on the environment and human health, therefore we must respect the will of our citizens and allow Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs on their territory. In this context, the issue of the labelling of GMO products is also very important. These products and their derivatives are already on the market, therefore it is necessary to ensure that there is very clear and understandable labelling of such products, which hitherto has not always been the case.</p>

      <p sl="it">I have some reservations about the possibility of allowing the Member States to prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for reasons other than protecting human health and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="it">To my mind, this possibility risks setting a dangerous precedent as an exception to the uniform functioning of the internal market, and also risks creating a market in which some farmers – and not others – could use products that, according to data from the Commission, guarantee 12.5% higher average yields and a significant reduction in production costs. This loss of competitiveness would translate into fewer jobs and lower growth for agricultural producers, who would have a limitation imposed on their freedom to conduct a business without any consideration being paid to the collective interest.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would point out that the global food security situation is troubling: we need to increase global agricultural production by 70% before 2050. In this context, I think it would be unwise to impose further restrictions on the only technology that guarantees both increased production and environmental sustainability. Instead, I think we need to strengthen and improve it. In addition, I think it would be worth increasing investment in research and experimentation in the public sector, so that it does not remain at the behest of multinational corporations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I am opposed to the proposal outlined in the report. Making Member States responsible for decisions on permits to cultivate genetically modified organisms is a step in entirely the wrong direction. A single decision on the basis of scientific criteria should be taken on the cultivation of such crops within the European Union, and be binding upon all the EU Member States. Equal conditions for competition must be a feature of the single European market. Allowing the Member States to decide whether or not to cultivate GMOs will disrupt the balance of the market, and make any talk of fair competition between European farmers out of the question.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I fully support the call contained in the regulation for Member States to have the possibility of limiting the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), because I believe that currently we do not have enough long-term scientifically based proof of the effects of GMOs on the environment and human health. I am in favour of developments in science and new ideas, but I consider that currently we do not have enough knowledge regarding GMO cultures in order to embark on their widespread use in farming and food. In the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we have had lively debates on GMO cultivation in the EU and the rights of the Member States to impose restrictions in their territory. We have not been able to come to an agreement, and have understood that the best solution is to let each Member State make its own decision on whether to allow GMO cultivation. I am certain that this is the right decision, because it would not be correct for the EU to impose a decision on the Member States on an issue of such public sensitivity. This would only serve to create negative feelings towards the European Union and encourage Euroscepticism. Finally, I should like to add that GMOs are not a solution for world hunger or a magic wand that will make food cheaper and more accessible. For this reason I should like to call upon fellow Members to discuss how to make organic food more accessible. Unfortunately only a narrow sector of society currently has sufficient financial means to buy organic food, which is healthier and environmentally friendly.</p>

      <p sl="de">The adoption of the report means that we now have a common procedure which grants the right of self-determination to the Member States with regard to the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Each country should be able to decide for itself whether or not genetically modified seeds will be sown on its fields. Austria is opposed to the use of genetic engineering. Austria produces high quality foods and, therefore, its agricultural industry is highly valued by consumers, who want to see sustainable, GMO-free food production. As a result, guaranteeing a ban on the cultivation of GMO crops is a key issue for Austria’s future. The original Commission proposal was unclear about whether this ban is compatible with World Trade Organisation rules and whether coexistence can be excluded. Compliance with strict coexistence regulations is important in order to ensure that farmers are not made responsible for costly liability issues. Member States must be able to prevent traces of GMOs occurring unintentionally both in conventional and in organic crops. As a representative of farming communities, I support Parliament’s efforts to guarantee legal certainty.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The Member States need a clear legal framework for the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which does not undermine the legislation now in force. This draft also suits EU citizens, who do not want GMOs to be cultivated on their land. In view of the fact that there is no prevailing consensus in Europe regarding GMO cultivation, Member States must share responsibility for the way that GMOs will be released into the environment. The risks connected with the environment and the threat to biodiversity may be high, and the monocultural nature of genetically modified crop cultivation also represents a risk. In some countries today there is already a problem with so-called ‘superweeds’, the creation of which was helped by artificial resistance against herbicides. It is therefore necessary to maintain the precautionary principle very consistently in the case of GMOs. There is a need to resolve the current situation, where none of the studies required under current legislation are available. We must therefore strengthen the powers of the state in the event of a lack of relevant data on the impacts on a national, regional and local scale. It is necessary to respect the rights of Member States as far as GMO use on their own territory is concerned, as this issue relates to the principle of subsidiarity, while not affecting regulations on the internal market and the free movement of goods and products on the territory of the Union in any way. I welcome Parliament’s decision, and I call on the Council to accept this decision as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, I consider the adoption of this report and the creation of the agency to be extremely important, precisely because of their aim to ensure the functioning and security of Europe’s IT systems 24 hours a day. Large-scale IT systems cannot be administered in a haphazard manner, and responsibility for this cannot be granted to those who do not possess the necessary competence. I am naturally very happy about the selection of the new agency’s location, as it was Tallinn, the capital of my home country Estonia, that was selected. Here in little Estonia we have excellent knowledge and experience in this field.</p>
      <p sl="et">In my opinion it is a good compromise to divide the seat of the agency among two European Union Member States; thus, the headquarters of the agency will be established in Estonia, and the necessary servers will be located in France, here in Strasbourg, where we are today. One of the roles of the nascent agency could certainly be to raise awareness in the area of IT systems and their security through the organisation of training sessions. I supported the adoption of this report, and I have waited for this result for a long time. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I regret to say that I do not entirely share the enthusiasm that previous speakers have expressed with regard to the fact that yet another agency is now being set up in the EU system. Firstly, we as parliamentarians are responsible for the way in which taxpayers’ money is used. We are still waiting to see what added value the existing agencies bring, and consequently we do not know what added value the future IT agency will bring either.</p>
      <p sl="da">Throughout the EU, we have a whole series of competent research institutes, universities and other institutes that would easily be able to carry out the task that the new IT agency is now being assigned – and without the need to establish new facilities, new frameworks and new institutions. I have therefore voted against setting up this new agency, at least until we know what the added value of the new agencies and, in particular, the existing agencies might be.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, it is important that universal services should be available to all and that they should be more uniform throughout Europe. It is not acceptable to have large differences in quality and price between Member States, and concrete steps should be taken in order to level out those differences.</p>
      <p sl="et">There are, for instance, great differences in the area of e-services, Internet quality and price, so that in one Member State there is nearly a complete absence of decent e-services and the Internet is of poor quality and expensive. We must learn from each other’s experiences and achievements, and move towards a more uniform level of services. Despite some quality-related problems, the single European emergency number 112 is a good example in this area. I supported the adoption of this report.</p>

A single emergency number makes it possible for those needing immediate assistance to contact the appropriate services rapidly, regardless of where they are. I am therefore pleased by this service’s increasing significance, efficiency and availability, and I believe that we need to continue to support it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another provision which is worthy of note is that concerning the retention of current emergency numbers, which are deeply ingrained and widely used in some Member States, so as to avoid confusion. I agree that linking political strategies and technologies may contribute to the development of new public services using highly developed and specialist applications, such as e-administration, e-health and e-education. The proposal to involve local and regional authorities in technological investments is also important. I therefore support this report.</p>

Perhaps my main concern is that, in times of austerity, European citizens look to the EU to help provide a safety net and, while the actions we can take at European level are limited, nonetheless the universal service obligation is a mechanism which can support citizens where market forces have failed. Indeed we have plenty of examples of that happening in recent times, especially where the financial markets have failed European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said, circumstances have changed and therefore, in that context, we do need to re-evaluate how appropriate existing legislative provisions are for universal service. We need to ensure that the real needs of citizens are met.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, 112, the European emergency number; it is a great idea, but we must ensure that Member States provide timely, accurate and reliable location information on the 112 service. If we can do that, then a full-scale promotion of the number, a European emergency number, is warranted. Like the universal service obligation, it can be a safety net for citizens.</p>

      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, there are still significant amounts of red tape seriously hindering the freedom of SMEs.

      <p sl="it">Instead, it would be appropriate for the renewal criteria to be tied to the development of the areas and the professionalism of the traders, which obviously derives from how long they have held the concession, as well as to an assessment of the investments made over the years.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, improvements to consumer protection law are a key tool facilitating a more rigorous enforcement of provisions protecting the interests of the various parties in intra-EU transactions. The obstacles that stand in the way of cross-border cooperation between individual countries need to be abolished, and an analysis needs to be carried out of the additional legislative solutions which are necessary, in order to mount an effective fight against traders engaging in unfair practices which disrupt the efficient functioning of the internal market. This will make it possible to establish clear rules governing the actions of public authorities as regards the identification, monitoring and elimination of violations of consumer protection regulations. In this regard, it is particularly vital to improve the effectiveness of the CPC network’s actions by aiming to eliminate flaws in legislation, for example those which mean that a given activity is prohibited in the consumer’s country, but not in the supplier’s country. Improving the quality of consumer protection laws is one of the most important objectives for the European institutions. We can only develop and extend the EU internal market by increasing consumer confidence. I therefore support measures aimed at enforcing consumer rights more effectively throughout the EU.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I do not want to conceal the fact that I take a very critical approach to this report and have therefore voted against it. I am concerned that it will result in a patchwork of different regulations in the individual states. There is no possibility of any countries going it alone because products containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are already being sold on the internal market. Therefore, Europe will be turning its back on a technology which has enough potential that it is worth researching into it in more detail.</p>
      <p sl="de">Genetically modified (GM) crops offer significant opportunities, but also involve risks. This is why we need to have an honest debate on this subject in society and in the business community. For this reason, it is particularly important that we carry out thorough research into this technology and continue to develop it in a responsible way. However, in order to achieve this, we must have permission to do the research. With good reason, Europe has put in place one of the world’s most stringent approval procedures. No products containing GMOs will come onto the European market unless it can be guaranteed that they are completely harmless to human health and the environment, because the safety of people and of the environment are our highest priorities.</p>

I myself would like my country, Finland, to be able to decide on as wide a ban as possible, if it so wishes, and not to have to ask for permission separately for each crop.

What we are doing here is supporting a proper legal basis whereby Member States, if they choose, can ban the cultivation of GM crops. We are trying to give some legal certainty and it makes no sense if we have one case after another in the Court of Justice. We want to ensure freedom of choice for consumers and farmers and we are trying to do this in a reasonable, practical and workable way.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was happy to see some amendments carried from my own group, in particular Amendment 44, where it states that the long-term environmental effects of GMO crops, as well as their potential effects on untargeted organisms, should be rigorously assessed. Also paragraph 47, which came from the ALDE Group, was voted through and it allowed grounds such as the maintenance of local biodiversity and the need to ensure seed purity to be used. Today we have applied the precautionary principle and that is wise. Finally, we asked the Council and Commission to ensure that necessary resources for independent researchers on the potential risks of GMO would be in place, and I think that was a good move on our part.</p>

As a result of their control over these seeds, farmers are forced to buy the seeds, causing prices to rise dramatically. They are forced to buy them from these same corporations, as they have no other choice. The environment also suffers through the loss of biodiversity and the growth of weed resistance, which leads to the use of even more harmful pesticides and the crushing of sustainable farming.</p>

However, it should be recognised that a significant proportion, 21% of Europeans, welcome GMOs and say they believe that GMOs should not have damaging effects on future generations. Like statements that GMOs will resolve the issue of food shortages, the negative or positive impact has yet to be proven either way scientifically. This means that it is impossible to find a one-size-fits-all solution for Member States. The approach in the Member States also varies, therefore the proposal to allow countries themselves to be given the opportunity to restrict the cultivation of GMOs on their territory is completely correct.

There are potential long-term cumulative effects, direct and indirect effects, effects on human health and also environmental effects. As we know, there are also three main reasons, or three categories under which we assess GMOs. These are: environmental issues, including pesticide resistance issues; secondly, socio-economic reasons, as there are costs for decontamination; finally, land-use planning and land management as such. It is necessary to assess the safety risks, as well as the rules on the coexistence of different varieties.</p>

The European Parliament should maybe turn its attention to those countries where democracy is really being violated, such as Poland, for example, where independent journalists who are critical of the authorities are sacked from their jobs, where at 6 o’clock in the morning the special services enter the home of an Internet user who operates a portal which is critical of the authorities, and where the leader of the opposition is ordered to undergo psychiatric tests.

The ongoing decarbonisation of the energy sector, which reflects an ambition to entirely eliminate CO2 emissions, may result in a significant economic recession, both in developing countries and in highly developed countries. An increase in energy prices, resulting from necessary changes to the way in which this energy is obtained and associated investments, may contribute significantly to worsening the economic situation of industrial regions. The ambitious standards already in force for exhaust gas emissions from various types of motor vehicle increase transport costs, and mean that manufacturers need to spend more on innovations.

Why is the European Union implementing such a policy, and what are the consequences? It is merely resulting in production being transferred from Europe to countries outside the European Union, which means that jobs are transferred and taxes lost. Yet intensive, CO2-emitting production is still going on in China, in India and in South American countries, which means that there is still just as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as there was before, if not more.

There is no scientific evidence that humans have a decisive impact on global warming. Nature itself regulates climate change; sometimes the climate is warmer, and sometimes it is cooler. This is why Greenland is under a layer of ice today, contrary to what one might suppose from its name. One eruption of volcanic ash can in many cases cause more CO2 emissions than the annual emissions of the national economies of several European countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Why are we bleeding ourselves dry, when Europe emits only 15% of global CO2, and the rest of the world has no interest in reducing its emissions? For countries such as Poland, where 94% of energy is generated from coal, it would be suicidal to adopt this package. It might mean that the amount Poland has to spend on reducing CO2 emissions exceeds the total net amount it receives from the EU Structural Funds. I hope that today’s decision is a step in the right direction: as we are abandoning the 30% target, we should also abandon the 20% target.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the cohesion and structural policies are extremely important tools with which to even out disparities in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fi">One important thing is that, although the number of errors and cases of abuse has fallen, it is still very significant. The money has not been returned, and, in some Member States, the figures are quite staggering. This needs to change, and money has to be used far more efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The whole notion of structural policy will obviously lose credibility if people are constantly reading about these cases of abuse. There is considerable loss of reputation regarding how all this works, and I therefore hope that we can continue to pay close attention to efficiency and better budgetary control.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the report by Mr Pieper is certainly worthy of praise. I think that many countries such as Italy, which end up being both major contributors and major beneficiaries of the cohesion policy, will see this report and this work as hugely important.</p>
      <p sl="it">The revision is designed, above all, to improve the assessment of results, controls and conditionalities. This approach is certainly worthy of support and is also significant, as long as the budget structure and above all gross domestic product as the main criterion remain in place.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are two aspects that I cannot say I agree with. Firstly, there is the surreptitious insertion of the use of additional languages other than those of the proposing or programming entity: I sought an oral amendment to paragraph 5, which makes it mandatory for programmes and projects to be presented not only in the relevant national language but also in English, French and German. This is not acceptable.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the current threshold for obtaining assistance between the objectives of convergence and competitiveness is clearly set at 75% of Community GDP. I completely agree with the rapporteur’s view that a new general category based on funding and based on a GDP level of 75% to 90% is contrary to the key philosophy of EU cohesion policy, which ought to support the weakest regions by means of a horizontal approach.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In connection with the introduction of a new category of regions, there is also no plan to increase resources, which could result in a situation where converging regions that are struggling the most with structural, economic and social problems have to make savings after 2013 in favour of more developed regions to which the convergence objective would no longer apply under the current criteria. This would have a negative effect on as many as 50 regions, in which 72 million citizens live, causing inequality between the regions to persist.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I want to congratulate the rapporteur because I believe that a well-funded cohesion policy sends the right message to European citizens when the word solidarity and the principle of solidarity have certainly been sorely tested right across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular today I am pleased that we supported Amendment 34, which calls for the creation of regions in the intermediate category. This will help to avoid unequal treatment of regions that no longer come under the convergence objective. Given the extremely severe impacts of the economic and the financial crisis on citizens and on regions, it is very important to ensure that we have an appropriate and a proportionate response. Furthermore, in certain regions the impact of the economic and the financial crisis has been particularly severe, for example in my own region, the Border, Midlands and West of Ireland. In that context it is crucial that the most up-to-date information is used so that policies in place from 2013 onwards reflect and react to the actual situation on the ground, not the situation of a few years ago. It makes no sense to use out-of-date information, so we must ensure that we do not do that.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, when talking about cohesion policy having greater added value for the European Union and expressing doubts as to whether some projects could be implemented at national or regional levels, we must see the bigger picture. The reality is that a lot of European Union Member States have yet to achieve the European Union average. I come from Lithuania, a country which has been receiving assistance since it first joined the Union in order to eradicate these disparities, and I can see how my country is changing. In Lithuania, it is precisely EU money that is helping to implement a large proportion of new projects that are improving people’s quality of life, whether we are talking about the environment, transport or social affairs. Nevertheless, we still have a long road to travel before we reach the EU development average. However, if we simply rely on our own efforts and money, it will not be possible for us to take this road. A sufficient level of financing must therefore be guaranteed post 2013 for those Member States that recently joined the European Union – only then, by showing solidarity, will we ensure balanced development in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a few years ago I ran a workshop in the Côte d’Ivoire which was attended by young centre-right African politicians. One of the things that we talked about during this workshop was the whole issue of aid. One of the issues that they were most united in opposing was this idea of direct budgetary support. Many of the young activists there said to me that the problem with direct budgetary support was that it actually kept corrupt governments in power. What they wanted was more accountable aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">And so we had an interesting discussion about aid. They said that they would in fact rather have less aid so they could help themselves. I explained that the EU and the British Government were insisting on giving more aid and we had a debate about what it should be spent on. They asked for help so that farmers could meet EU sanitary standards, investment in infrastructure, investment in land and property registers, lending capital to entrepreneurs, and mortgage finance so that people could leverage the equity in their home and create a property-owning democracy. The debate should be focused on helping people to help themselves, rather than helping corrupt governments stay in power.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have voted today on the report by Mr Goerens and I believe that this report is moving in the right direction. For the first time in the history of the European Union, we have done away with the unquestioning belief in budget support in the field of development aid. This means that for the first time we have stated in a report that we should not simply give money to administrative bodies, to states or to governments without sanctions and without criteria that can be monitored. This is the right way forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, in my opinion one thing is missing. This concerns an amendment which I have tabled and which was unfortunately voted down. The amendment stated that we in the European Union must impose sanctions when a state can be proved to have disregarded the criteria which form the basis for the provision of development aid. We must change this situation so that we can maintain our credibility and make it clear to our voters and our taxpayers what we are spending development aid on.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Sosa Wagner because it effectively highlights the strengths and weaknesses in the European Commission’s approach to revitalising energy infrastructures: the need to identify the infrastructures required, the criteria for selecting projects of European interest in view of financing that will attract and boost private investment, the urgent need to deal with the dangers in Eastern Europe of relying on a single source which, as we have seen in recent years, can cause serious supply problems, and lastly the opportunity to invest part of the EUR 1 000 billion over 10 years provided for by the Commission for the reduction of pollution, combating climate change and improving supply quality for clean and safe energy.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the major challenges that we are facing in the field of energy are, of course, fairly familiar to us all: climate and security of supply. The challenge with regard to infrastructure has perhaps not been so prominent in the debate. Our energy infrastructure is outdated and it is simply not designed for supplying green energy from many different energy sources. Without a modern infrastructure we cannot build as many windmills and biogas installations. There is no point if we cannot get the energy out to the end user – that is self-evident.</p>
      <p sl="da">At the same time, we have the problem that our infrastructure is not linked together across our borders. After 30 years of underinvestment, we need to make a quantum leap – a leap that will require EUR 230 billion by 2020, which the market will have to provide – quite simply because there is not enough public money for it and because it is in fact the market’s responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is to be welcomed that this report has been drafted, but one cannot help but notice its significant shortcomings. The report lacks concrete and tangible incentives for the construction of the Nabucco gas pipeline. This is an extremely important project, which if implemented would provide us with an opportunity to gain independence from Russian energy sources, and which would give us a great deal more certainty as regards Europe’s energy security. Unfortunately, if we do not move from words to deeds, and if the European Union does not involve itself with the development of this project, it may never happen. This could mean that the European Union’s energy security suffers a significant setback, which will also have economic ramifications, since gas which comes from a monopoly holder will be more expensive, and so creating competition is also justified from the point of view of the market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report makes no mention of the construction of a Sarmatia pipeline, although this is a good idea, and it makes no mention at all of the huge reserves of shale gas in Europe, for example in Poland, even though their extraction would mean that the European Union gained independence in terms of energy security. It is worth extracting this gas, and it is worth thinking about related infrastructure for the future.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I welcome the balanced and comprehensive report provided by my colleague Sosa Wagner, which reflects important aspects such as the unconditional nature of an assessment of the environmental impact of new projects. In addition, the call to ensure that third countries meet international environmental and other obligations when implementing new energy projects, has not been forgotten. Proposals are put forward on how to move towards an efficient and flexible European super-grid that reduces CO2 emissions.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would nevertheless underline that in order to establish an integrated and competitive European internal energy market by 2014 at the latest, it is not enough to simply implement legislation and guarantee regulation. An EU internal market cannot function fully or efficiently without the full integration of energy islands into the EU power system through new interconnections in infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is therefore necessary to provide a consistent inventory of existing and lacking infrastructure and to establish measures, facilitating the full implementation, in a physical sense, of an integrated energy market by 2014. Missing infrastructure should be one of the important criteria for determining the hierarchy of projects of European interest.</p>

I have to say that this is very interesting, and I strongly disagree, whereas I could perhaps reach agreement with some of my fellow Members in another area that also concerns sovereignty, namely that of social welfare provision. This De Rossa report is clearly an echo of Radio Tirana: the development of one big European socialist welfare state. As a Liberal, I have to firmly reject that. I therefore also chose to vote against the report today, which – even if the worst of the thistles have been weeded out – in spirit is nevertheless heading in a completely different direction, namely the socialist direction.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because it thoroughly examines the definition of social services of general interest. They are not an expenditure, they are an investment as far as people and distributive justice are concerned. Therefore, Member States are urged to provide universal and standardised access to them, and to ensure that it occurs under the same conditions in boom times and at times of economic downturn.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is because, in line with the above, this report emphasises the impact that the delivery of these services has on the economy through the jobs they provide, the gross domestic product they generate and the environment they provide in order that other sectors, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), can function. Delivery of these services is essential for equality and to achieve a work-life balance. Lastly, there is the impact created through the commitment to the social economy when liberalisation of these services is the chosen option.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is better for capital to be simply a tool of social services providers rather than their ultimate goal. In this way, it is guaranteed that the surpluses are reinvested in quality and innovation, and in improving the service.</p>

EU legislation takes responsibility for lost, delayed or damaged baggage.

I regret the frequency with which such situations arise and I believe that policy makers should pay close attention to them and seek to mitigate their impact whenever possible, in such a way as to prevent workers from being left without a modicum of social protection, while also ensuring that this does not preclude, but rather encourages, their reintegration into the labour market.

I would like to stress that the total amount of EUR 14 181 901 requested may be vital to the reskilling of many of the 1 356 workers who have been made redundant, with a view to their professional retraining in future-oriented and innovative areas of work that will allow the workers to build on their technical knowledge and work experience, especially in the areas of energy technology, construction and landscaping, and robotics.</p>

In the meantime, some of the redundant workers have found work again. That is a good thing, but the many redundant workers who have not found work have not received a penny for the further training and retraining that they were promised.

      <p sl="pt">This report endorses the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) to assist three countries – Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Croatia – which in September 2010 were affected by severe rainfall followed by flooding that caused huge losses. In some cases, this forced people to abandon their homes and resulted in significant damage to public infrastructure, businesses, homes and agriculture. As the total losses remain below the normal threshold for the mobilisation of the EUSF, the request was examined on the basis of the criteria for an ‘extraordinary regional disaster’, set out in the relevant regulation. We recall that only a few months earlier, in May and June 2010, two of these countries, namely the Czech Republic and Croatia, had suffered exactly the same disasters which led to the mobilisation of the EUSF, as the criteria for classifying the event as a ‘major natural disaster’ were fulfilled.</p>

      <p sl="en">After the severe floods that hit Europe in the summer and autumn of 2010, Slovenia, Croatia and the Czech Republic requested financial assistance from the European Union Solidarity Fund, which will be used to mitigate and remedy the damage caused. The total direct damage caused by these floods in all the countries concerned amounts to more than EUR 700 billion. The Commission has proposed releasing resources totalling EUR 19.54 million from the EU Solidarity Fund. Slovenia requested assistance from the Solidarity Fund in connection with flood damage resulting from the intensive rain, which inundated 137 Slovene villages and caused widespread damage to infrastructure, businesses and private property. Croatia requested assistance from the Solidarity Fund after the intense rainfall lasting from 17 to 22 September 2010 caused major floods. The disaster resulted in considerable damage to infrastructure, agriculture and private property. The Czech Republic requested assistance after unusually heavy rainfall in the north of the country caused rivers to swell at the beginning of August 2010, forcing the inhabitants to abandon their homes and causing damage to infrastructure, private dwellings, agriculture and businesses. Once it had verified that all of the applications met the criteria for entitlement within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, the Commission proposed mobilising the Solidarity Fund in order to mitigate the destructive consequences of the natural disasters in these countries.</p>

The natural disasters which struck the three European countries resulted in loss of human life and considerable losses for Europe’s regional economies, which will have an adverse social and economic impact. Unfortunately, the losses of human life are irreplaceable. However, even in this context, it is obvious how important it is to make a commitment at European level to provide a rapid reaction force and guarantee well-coordinated, prompt action from the intervention teams. Information and education campaigns on the preliminary action to take, during and after disasters have occurred, as well as efforts to encourage people to think prevention must feature among the measures for managing disasters at Member State level. I come from Romania where more than 900 000 fellow citizens live in areas at high risk of flooding and which was among the countries badly hit by severe flooding in 2010. As a European and Romanian, I support the policy of solidarity in every area. However, particularly when we are faced with disasters, solidarity is not an option but a necessity.</p>

On 25 March, the Commission presented Draft Amending Budget No 2/2011 to the 2011 general budget, which aims to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) in order to mitigate the effects of the intense rain in Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Croatia during the summer of 2010. The conditions of eligibility to the fund are detailed in Council Regulation No 2012/2002 establishing the EUSF. Furthermore, it must be noted that the objective of the fund is to repair infrastructure and that since it is a tool of refinancing, it cannot be used to compensate private damages. The direct damages have been estimated by the Slovenian, Czech and Croatian authorities at a total of EUR 19 546 647. In the case of Slovenia, the direct damages exceed the normal threshold for mobilising the EUSF and can qualify as a ‘major natural disaster’. Meanwhile, in the cases of the Czech Republic and Croatia, direct damages do not exceed the normal threshold. I voted in favour of the proposal so that these countries can benefit from EU solidarity.</p>

To this end a way of funding assistance needs to be found, and, according to the rapporteur, the European Economic Recovery Plan, in the area of energy, should finance the coverage needed for the mobilised funds.</p>

The new body will be responsible for the operational management of the large-scale IT system used to control EU external borders (Schengen Information System II) and for database-exchange systems to be used in pursuit of a common visa policy (Visa Information System) and the comparison of asylum seekers’ fingerprints to facilitate the examination of asylum applications (Eurodac), as well as other future systems in this field. It will be important that the agency keeps these systems functioning 24 hours a day, seven days a week, ensuring a continuous flow of data exchange. Member States are responsible for entering the data into the systems. The agency will be based in Tallinn (Estonia), and I would like to congratulate Estonia on being able to host this important body.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report, because before establishing an agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, some important questions in this field need to be answered. Firstly, why do we need to establish this new large-scale agency? There is plainly no other solution. It would be quite wrong to assign the entire responsibility to the Commission, especially in view of the protracted problems that have occurred in recent years regarding the development of the systems. Furthermore, the Commission itself has repeatedly pointed out that its running of Eurodac is merely a stopgap solution and that it does not consider itself equal to assuming direct management responsibility for large-scale IT systems. We therefore need to establish an agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, because an executive agency would not provide a solution. In that case the legislature would be denied the possibility to shape the agency and exercise its democratic scrutiny. Executive agencies are set up by the Commission entirely under its supervision and responsibility. The Commission lays down their tasks and appoints their managing bodies, including the director. An executive agency has a limited life and would thus be a temporary solution.</p>

If we restrict ourselves to the current criteria for ‘public policy and public security’, the Member States will continue to act unilaterally, interpreting these criteria broadly in the case of increased migratory pressures. If this happens, we run the risk of conflating immigration and insecurity when we need to respond to migratory pressures. By contrast, the proposed device aims to create a mechanism enabling controls to be reintroduced at borders only under exceptional circumstances, as a last resort and through a European mechanism. Now we need to strengthen the governance of the Schengen area. The aim of this initiative is precisely to enable us to provide responses to the crisis that the Schengen area is going through at the moment. This crisis is particularly associated with the fact that certain Member States are no longer able to ensure that they respect their obligations under the Schengen acquis when it comes to effectively controlling their sections of the external borders.</p>

      <p sl="en">SIS II claims to help ensure a high level of security within the area of freedom, security and justice of the EU, including maintaining public security and public policy. Parliament states that the VIS enables consulates to exchange visa information in order to facilitate the application procedure, helping to prevent ‘visa shopping’ and fraud, and facilitating checks at external borders to identify third-country nationals. However these controls should be strictly sovereign. I do not believe in the efficacy of the project, it is both expensive and will encompass IS II, VIS and Eurodac, meaning eventually all IT systems in the area of security and justice will merge, raising questions about increased vulnerability to computer hacking and the acquisition and storage of data. I believe this vote represents a step in that direction and thus should be blocked.</p>

      <p sl="en">In June 2009, the Commission presented two legislative initiatives on the establishment of an agency for the management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. The first initiative comprised a draft regulation on first pillar issues relating to the Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System and Eurodac, while the second initiative comprised a draft decision on third pillar issues relating to these systems. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, however, these initiatives lost their justification. This is because, although the distinction between the three pillars was removed, the proposal in question possesses a variable geometry relating to various aspects of the area of freedom, security and justice in general, and specifically to aspects of the Schengen area. The legal framework of the systems to be administered by the agency applies to a diverse group of Member States with varying levels of participation, in the case of the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland, and associated third countries such as Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and, in future, Liechtenstein. The Commission has drawn up an impact assessment in order to determine what would be the best solution from a financial, operational and institutional perspective. The most appropriate solution appears to be to establish a European agency, although it should be emphasised that the aims and tasks of the agency relate exclusively to the technical level of operational management. The agency should not have the power to take political decisions, for example it should not be allowed to set up new systems or take decisions relating to the interaction of systems.</p>

This legislative package will allow us to accommodate these three data systems within a single platform in order to enable better continuity in data management, improved exchanges of data and an increased number of synergies.

My Estonian colleagues and I are very glad that Estonia and France were today able to reach the agreement that was also confirmed today, namely that the new agency will be located in Tallinn, Estonia. Since the technical development of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the Visa Information System (VIS), as well as the preparation for their operational management, had already been carried out in Strasbourg, and a backup site for these IT systems had already been established in Sankt Johann im Pongau in Austria, Estonia, France and Austria came to an agreement that they would remain there. I think that the creation of this agency will increase the reliability of the European Union’s IT systems and will lead to the speedier and more effective creation of new systems. There are now several examples of how the development of trans-European systems has been delayed and their quality has not been ideal, and therefore the creation of the new agency is altogether justified. I welcome today’s decision, and I am delighted at the creation of the new agency. Thank you.</p>

Eventually, this agency will be responsible for the operational management of data collected by the three large-scale IT systems within the European Union: the Visa Information System (VIS), the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the European Dactylology (Eurodac) system. It will, moreover, have to respect the conditions and procedures of data exchange among the countries of the European Union and to play the role of ‘facilitator’.

Dock dues are crucial for supporting outermost regions economically and socially disadvantaged by certain permanent factors, such as their small area and insularity, remoteness from major markets, inadequate topography and climate or dependence on a small number of products available on the market. Dock dues are intended to bring stability to the economies of outermost regions, helping them to maintain jobs in areas where the unemployment rate is close to 30% and, by extension, support local production. Furthermore, the revenue obtained from levying these dock dues, which makes up between 37% and 48% of local authority budgets in the overseas departments, is intended and must continue to underpin the policies promoting investment in local development. Consequently, the European Parliament supports the necessary step of making permanent, as of 2014, the exemptions from or reductions in dock dues granted in the case of the French ODs.</p>

I voted in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I supported this own-initiative report, which aims to assess recent changes in relation to the concept of basic universal services enshrined in the Universal Services and Users’ Rights Directive. It examines the possibility of extending universal access to broadband and stresses the need for coordinated approaches and adequate financing, taking account of the specific needs of vulnerable people and disabled consumers. This report also focuses on the single European emergency number 112, particularly on the visibility of this number and on citizens’ awareness of it. It lays the emphasis on improving the efficiency of emergency lines in order to protect public health and ensure civil protection, to promote improvement in how calls are dealt with and to assess the quality of the assistance provided, from the time when the call is made to the time when action is taken.</p>

      <p sl="ga">It is a fundamental right of everyone in the EU to have basic access to telecommunications infrastructure. Everyone in the Union must be able to enjoy the advantages of the digital era. Where there is no financial incentive for the private sector to implement the appropriate infrastructure, the Universal Services Directive ensures that the state will assume responsibility for making a basic service available to everyone. I fully support the ‘Broadband for all’ aim of the Digital Agenda and agree with the report’s contents in relation to providing sufficient funds in order to achieve this. The 112 number is a service with significant rescue potential, but it is manifestly not familiar enough in the EU. If the people of the EU are not well aware of, and used to, this number, it is of little use. Everyone in the EU must have access to this number. A comprehensive review must be set up to improve the service and ensure that the European people have the information and the ability to use the 112 number in case of emergency.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this report. The introduction of the European 112 emergency number was aimed at increasing the protection of EU citizens and providing them with urgent assistance, using the same number in all EU Member States and ensuring the smooth functioning of the 112 emergency number throughout the European Union. However, the European 112 emergency number has not yet reached its full potential. A Eurobarometer survey published in 2011 reveals that barely 26% of EU citizens know that the 112 number can be used to call for emergency services, while 58% of citizens believe there is a lack of information about the existence of the emergency number. I welcome the call for the Commission and the Member States to further step up their information work so that the emergency number 112 reaches all EU citizens and travellers through the media, particularly the print and audiovisual media. During information campaigns, special attention should be paid to practical information, such as stressing that 112 is the European emergency number, reachable from fixed and mobile phones free of charge everywhere in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report, because the 112 emergency number must receive the support it needs to become the best means of protecting citizens’ lives. The European Parliament has repeatedly stressed the need to raise awareness of the 112 emergency number and the fact that hitherto a poor quality of service has been provided to citizens through the 112 number. The latest edition of the Consumer Markets Scoreboard shows that, at EU level, the telecommunications market is one of the sectors with the lowest scores. Above all, the telecommunications market is one of the markets in which consumers found it most difficult to compare offers and experienced most problems. It also received the highest number of complaints. Internet access services also show a much greater price divergence across the EU. Internet service provision is actually the third worst ranking market in general and the market where the highest percentage of consumers have experienced problems, and where prices diverge widely across the EU. I therefore welcome the European Parliament’s proposal for the Commission to carry out an in-depth study on internet service provision following the publication of the 4th Consumer Markets Scoreboard.</p>

Although it has proved to be useful, the 112 number still has some further progress to make to be really effective. No matter how good an idea is, it must be adapted to the social context it is developing in and be revamped according to the real needs of the citizens it is serving. At the same time, an idea needs to receive the support it deserves for it to work. Both statements are valid in the case of the single 112 emergency number. I know countless people who have called this number when they have been in trouble. Fortunately, in the majority of situations that they can recall, they received the assistance they were expecting. The European Parliament, just like other stakeholders, has repeatedly stressed the need to raise the public’s awareness of the 112 number and the poor quality of the services which have been provided so far to citizens via this number. I also share the sentiments of those stating that, like any good idea, this service needs to receive support so that it can deliver the maximum benefits to those pinning their hopes on it.</p>

Furthermore, I am pleased that this report urges Member States to improve the caller location facility as soon as possible to a few seconds after the call has been made. This aspect is of paramount importance as the speed of location determines the effectiveness of the intervention made by the emergency services. This aspect is technically feasible. Therefore, Member States and telecom operators must be willing to do it.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that investments need to be made in future-generation technologies to improve the 112 number by creating new applications which will enable data to be transferred by the emergency service so that it has as much information as possible available in real time prior to intervention.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The creation of the European emergency number 112, in 1991, was of the utmost importance, as it enables citizens to access emergency services using a single number, regardless of the Member State that they are in. Unfortunately, the vast majority of Europeans are still unaware of it, on top of the poor quality of the service that has thus far been provided to citizens through the 112 number, with no significant progress observed since 2000. In view of the fact that several recent disasters have shown that giving the public early warning in the event of emergencies or imminent or developing major disasters is necessary if suffering and the loss of life are to be reduced, it is vital that the quality of implementing this support service in cases of emergency be improved, especially in terms of information, accessibility, interoperability and intervention times.</p>

The establishment of European targets for network coverage, especially broadband, requires coordination between the Union and the Member States, and between the latter and the operators, so as to achieve the desired universal coverage.

      <p sl="pt">The European emergency number, 112, was created in 1991 to complement national emergency numbers and make emergency services more accessible for all the EU Member States. However, according to a Eurobarometer survey, currently only 26% of EU citizens can spontaneously identify 112 as the number to call for the police, the fire brigade or the ambulance service in any part of the EU. I understand that this percentage should be at 80% by 2020. This service can save lives, and its universal reach is of the utmost importance for protecting the public, particularly in the context of free movement within the EU. In order to ensure the greatest possible efficiency and a better service for those in need, and to combat fake calls for help, I support the georeferencing of calls, forcing both mobile and fixed telecoms operators to automatically ensure the identification and exact location of the people making the calls.

The report also focuses on the emergency number 112, which was introduced to allow citizens to contact the emergency services by using a single number. The EU rules place an obligation on the state to ensure that citizens are able to connect to a public telephone landline network, and to have access to public telephone services with functioning Internet access. All States must ensure that consumers have access to information services, registers and public telephones, as well as specific measures for the disabled. The single European emergency number 112 was introduced in 1991 in connection with a directive of the EU Council of Ministers, and attention is also given to it in the Universal Service Directive. The need to raise awareness of the 112 number has been emphasised repeatedly, and the poor quality of the services provided to citizens so far through the 112 number has been pointed out.

Henceforth, Member States should focus on ameliorating this system by increasing the number of dedicated lines at call centres, develop a new software system aimed at monitoring the call handling system and step up efforts in improving and doubling the availability of human resources. On the side of the Commission, there needs to be development of a more targeted and far-reaching communication strategy which addresses the preoccupations and queries that citizens face with regards to the mechanics of the system; any action plan must necessarily take into account persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups.</p>

The report also focuses on the single European emergency number 112, introduced to enable citizens to call the emergency services by using one and the same number from anywhere in the EU. There is a need to raise awareness of the 112 emergency number and the fact that hitherto a poor quality of service has been provided to citizens through the 112 number. The 112 emergency number must receive the support it needs to become the best means of protecting citizens’ lives, otherwise the results may outweigh all its benefits. However, I believe that internet access services also show a much greater price divergence across the EU, and this must be reduced. I believe that the Member States must take the necessary steps to reduce the number of unsuccessful emergency-call attempts, shorten call set-up and response times and reduce the number of hoax calls.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Access to telecommunications services is essential for the development of modern societies in the EU Member States. The introduction of universal broadband coverage provides us with opportunities to compensate for imbalances between the various regions of Europe. However, I agree with the rapporteur that it cannot be consumers themselves who bear the burden of the measures we take. The report raises the key issue of improvements to the emergency number 112. A uniform system makes the emergency services more effective and has helped to save lives on more than one occasion, and hence it is highly recommended that the EU institutions should support it.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report generally gives an objective description of the current situation regarding universal services in telecommunications. I particularly applaud the fact that Parliament is aware of the importance of retaining a market environment in the area of telecommunications. The report itself demonstrates this in emphasising the need to avoid market disruption when enforcing the revised directive. Despite the fact that the report is on the whole balanced, I am slightly concerned about the call it makes to the Commission and the Member States to strengthen measures in support of demand and the introduction of new services, rather than just providing connectivity. In my opinion, this shows a failure to understand the role of the state in the area of telecommunications and in broadband connectivity policy. If the state is to function transparently and to avoid disrupting competition and market mechanisms, it can only support the natural development of broadband connectivity by providing high-quality e-government, e-health or e-learning services, in other words a high-quality offering. Any other measures to increase demand for broadband connectivity are almost always at the expense of the proper functioning of the market, and they disrupt competition to a lesser or greater extent.</p>

Issues relating to technology and coordination need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. The number of unsuccessful emergency-call attempts must be reduced to a minimum, while call set-up and response times need to be lightning fast, because sometimes even a few seconds can mean the difference between life and death. Every European must know this number. Every Member State must increase public awareness, by using the media and other awareness-raising measures.

The task is immense, given that only 26% of Europeans can identify 112 as the emergency number in the Union, with enormous differences depending on the Member State in question.

Its aim was to propose a review of the sector by analysing its economic, social and environmental performance, so that an assessment could then be made of the improvements that needed to be made. Our colleague Mrs Corazza Bildt has prepared a report on behalf of Parliament. It calls, in particular, for an integrated European action plan for the sector in order to encourage retailers and suppliers to engage in an active dialogue that can lead to innovative solutions with the support of the European Union. As I support the general orientation of the report, I voted in favour of it.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report. EU citizens are as yet unable to exploit all the advantages offered by the single market, such as choosing goods and services at competitive prices. This is particularly true in less economically developed Member States, where people have to pay similar prices for goods and services as those living in countries that have made greater economic progress. This largely happens because the market is focused on wholesale trade, which is able to offer more favourable prices thanks to its large market share. Today we have the problem that divergent interpretations of EU single market legislation are being applied in the Member States, which fundamentally impedes free movement of goods and services in the EU and creates additional costs for consumers and retailers, in particular SMEs, thus limiting the potential usefulness of the single market to European citizens and the business world. I agree that the Commission needs to further analyse price differences in the EU, using adequate statistical tools, in order to ensure greater price transparency and comparability for consumers, without prejudice to national fiscal and labour market rules, thereby promoting more enlightened choices and greater confidence in cross-border trade.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The retail sector represents 20% of Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), generates 4.2% of EU Gross Domestic Product and employs almost 20 million people. This is a key sector for the revival of the single market and for achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy. Despite the progress that has been made in this area, this report, which I voted for, calls for the adoption of measures to strengthen the retail market, namely: opening up markets to businesses and removing the obstacles and difficulties that many businesses face, especially SMEs; exploring the full potential of e-commerce, while strengthening the trust of businesses and consumers, and improving the Single European Payment Area in order to develop a payment service available for all types of cards, thereby increasing transparency in transaction costs and removing unjustified interchange fees; and ensuring faster bank transfers within the EU. Finally, I would like to highlight the idea of the Commission tabling a European Plan of Action for Retail, to define a strategy to address outstanding issues, with recommendations at a sectoral level.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report, because it is about creating jobs by removing borders, barriers and burdens to trade in Europe. The retail sector is a pillar of the European economy, because this market employs almost 20 million people and represents 20% of Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Too often, new national barriers are raised to protect jobs and SMEs. Instead, trade barriers in Europe should be removed to promote jobs and SMEs. Nonetheless, the legitimate concerns of people losing jobs and SMEs losing business have to be taken seriously during the financial and economic crisis. Dialogue must be intensified at all levels to improve understanding, restore confidence and address difficulties. I agree that the time has come to recognise the retail sector’s achievements, specific problems and challenges. I therefore agree with the call made by the European Parliament to develop an integrated European action plan for retail, to establish policy guidelines and provide concrete proposals on the best way of addressing outstanding issues.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this document, which also has the merit of seeking to streamline current legislation and to take action against restrictive national measures, which are often damaging and costly for small and medium-sized enterprises. The European Union must take decisive action to remove the protectionist obstacles that restrict enterprises’ access to the single market. At the same time, it must encourage any initiative that can reduce market dominance by a small number of actors, thus ensuring contractual freedom and protecting consumers.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree with the approach suggested by the rapporteur of setting up a system of self-regulation involving retailers and the supply chain, while the EU should focus on public-private partnership measures.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, we need to increase the penetration of e-commerce, which can reduce the distance between consumers and products, and to introduce policies designed to restore confidence in the economic system by harmonising intra-EU payments and providing businesses with a system that is no longer fragmented and costly.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that this is an excellent report because of its conciseness and the quality of the solutions proposed in it. The retail market is particularly important not only in consumers’ everyday lives, but also for jobs in the EU. This is why I believe that making this market more efficient is a priority. I feel that the form of dialogue between all the actors in the distribution chain, suggested by the rapporteur for resolving the current problems affecting the market’s operation, is actually the most suitable and constructive. I support the notion of creating a European payment area in the true sense of the term by harmonising payments within the EU, thereby reducing the commission on these payments. Furthermore, I too think that efforts to offer consumers’ freedom of choice must be stepped up. We need to encourage not only e-commerce but also small local stores which can meet the demands of certain consumers. Last but not least, this report tackles in a logical manner the issue of unfair commercial practices and competition on the retail market. It is very true that sometimes large operators can abuse their market power. However, I believe that we need to look at the bigger picture and not ignore that large operators too are possibly victims of unfair practices.</p>

      <p sl="it">I particularly welcome the non-regulatory line proposed by the rapporteur, which places the emphasis on exploring other means before resorting to new regulation. The report shows, in fact, that appropriate rules exist but inadequate enforcement hinders free movement. At the same time, the interests of European traders and entrepreneurs need to be protected by means of a fully operational single market in which the barriers that prevent it from operating smoothly are removed.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this respect it is essential to mention two important pieces of legislation that help to stimulate the growth of operators in the sector: the Single Market Act and the Small Business Act. Their aim is to ‘simplify life for small and medium-sized enterprises’ by reducing the administrative burdens they bear. All this must be governed by the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, a section that deserves special attention is the one on improving efficiency and sustainability by encouraging the retail sector to invest in innovative solutions for logistics and transport, energy efficiency, packaging and waste disposal.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We have to tackle the remaining obstacles to the free movement of goods and services in the EU, especially the existence of more restrictive national rules, divergent interpretations and inadequate enforcement of these rules, which end up limiting the potential of the single market at the service of European citizens and businesses. At the same time, competition rules must be applied properly to prevent abuse of a dominant position or unfair trade practices, and if necessary provide the opportunity for access to simpler, less time-consuming and more transparent infringement procedures.

      <p sl="pt">This report concerns a sector where the problems are all too obvious. Particularly in countries where the fabric of business is made up of a large number of family-like micro and small enterprises, the retail trade is facing the effects of decreased purchasing power among the general public, adding to the overwhelming weight and unfair competition exerted by large distributors.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These are problems and difficulties that threaten the viability and future of a sector which, it is worth remembering, plays an important social role, particularly, but not exclusively, outside the main urban areas. However, the report does not address the root causes of this situation, despite this being necessary in order to remedy it. It ignores the effects of deregulation and the liberalisation of trade that the EU has been actively promoting, the associated impact on the proliferation of supermarkets and the unbridled increase of their power and influence, and it does not address the consequences of liberalisation and privatisation, the reduction in purchasing power among the public, the increase in interest rates and the difficulty of accessing credit. Its route is precisely the opposite: it insists on deepening the single market, which exacerbates the difficulties of small enterprises and the retail trade, as reality shows us only too well.</p>

It is true that retail is suffering severe attacks, particularly in countries where this trade is made up of a large number of family-run micro and small enterprises, and where, in certain cases, the purchasing power of the public is decreasing. It is suffering most of all in less urban areas, where these businesses play an important social role, and where they are experiencing a time of turmoil.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the report forgets the fundamental cause of this situation and is not sufficiently critical of the liberalisation of trade, the proliferation of supermarkets, the consequences of liberalisation and privatisation, the reduction in purchasing power among the public, the increase in interest rates and the difficulty of accessing credit.

It is a dynamic market, employing almost 20 million people, generating 4.2% of the EU’s GDP, and accounting for 20% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe. Retailers are also service providers, active at the forefront of new sales methods and offering easy access to the labour market. Although the retail sector has fared relatively well in the crisis, trade is becoming more difficult in the EU due to mounting economic nationalism. It is necessary to put the real economy at the centre of political programmes once more, and to work towards opening up the freedom to travel and to take up residence throughout Europe. These freedoms are based on transparent trade relations and sustainable consumption. Too often, new international obstacles are erected in the interests of protecting jobs and SMEs. Instead of this, trade barriers in Europe should be removed in the interests of supporting jobs and SMEs. Despite this, we must take seriously people’s justified concerns about job losses and the concerns of SMEs over the loss of business opportunities seriously during the current public debt crisis. It is right to acknowledge the results achieved to date, as well as the specific problems and challenges of the retail sector. At the same time, I believe it is appropriate to apply a targeted European action plan for the retail sector, creating a political framework with concrete proposals providing pragmatic solutions to outstanding issues.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The rapporteur recognises in principle that it is up to the Member States to define their shop location policy. It is a pity, however, that the rest of the report goes exactly in the opposite direction, and in favour of the recommendations made to France by Brussels in the context of the European semester: namely, there would not be enough competition in the sector, and all regulation on locating retail outlets would be a hindrance to this competition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Strangely, the oligopolistic way in which purchasing groups are organised, and the abuse of their dominant position, as well as certain commercial practices which can be criticised, do not seem to bring about a reaction. Furthermore, when it comes to putting right the asymmetric and unfair relationships between the different stakeholders in the distribution chain, from production to retail, we are content with having dialogue between the stakeholders, which shows that some people are living on a different planet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, priority is given to competition, Brussels-style. This will have the kinds of consequences that we are all suffering at the moment: farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) strangled by excessively low prices, consumers hit by excessively high prices and, in the middle, a large number of intermediaries who are doing a lot better because of their often unjustified margins, which are enormous.

      <p sl="en">I am in agreement with this report because it highlights the importance of taking a more holistic long-term approach to the EU retail sector, one which is consistent and better coordinated to address the market exigencies which existed prior to and following the financial crisis. The aftermath of the crisis has shown us that the European retail market still holds areas of growth and untapped potential and can serve as an important catalyst to harness growth, competitiveness and job creation within a renewed Single Market. Therefore, the Commission should map out its action plan carefully and base any strategy to improve the Single Market for retail on the basis of ‘ex ante’ and ‘ex post’ consultations with SMEs in order to be able to draw out the effects which measures at EU and national level can have on competitiveness and employment levels of businesses, in particular of micro and small businesses within the EU. In the case of consumer protection, I call on the Commission to consolidate an easily accessible user-friendly mechanism containing data on the economic, social, ethical and environmental performance of retailers operating within the Single Market, so as to enable consumers to enjoy a more integrated retail market within which they are able to make better choices.</p>

Retailers are also service providers, at the cutting edge of new and diverse ways of shopping, such as direct selling, and offer easy access to labour markets. Member States must fully and correctly implement the internal market rules and legislation, notably the Goods Package, the Services Directive, the Late Payments Directive, the E-Commerce Directive, the Small Business Act and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. They must also remove overlaps and reduce administrative burdens and regulatory barriers that may limit growth and job creation. Attention must be drawn to the concern expressed by parts of civil society and SMEs about the increase in shopping centres and the decline in local shops and markets in remote areas and town centres. I believe that we must offer incentives to renovate urban building stock, using the Structural Funds, and that this could allow utility rates to be reduced (public-private partnership) and could facilitate the return of businesses, particularly local ones, which are instrumental to economic and social development.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I should like to emphasise once more that the most important task of today’s European politicians is to encourage economic growth and Member States’ recovery from the recession. We must realise that protectionism is not the way to achieve economic growth, because it inhibits the creation of jobs and the free flow of goods between Member States. Protectionism is a short-term measure that can create short-term improvement and have public support, but in the long term it will create new, more serious, economic problems. The report focuses on the retail sector, which has a very important place in Europe’s economy, employing about 20 million people, and accounting for about 4.2% of the European economy. Unfortunately, with the economic crisis this sector in particular has been badly hit, and this has adversely affected people’s living standards and income. For precisely this reason I support the suggestions made in the report, which are aimed at improving the work of the retail sector, which will in turn encourage economic growth and the creation of new jobs. The report focuses on five themes, the most important of which for me is the encouragement of competition and the opening-up of Member States’ markets to cross-border trade.

It particularly focuses on a whole series of administrative obstacles that actually prevent the free movement of goods throughout the Union.

The report also acknowledges that Member States are responsible for their own policies on business location, and the Union should not intervene in the arrangements which Member States themselves conclude in this area. The main message of the report is, in my opinion, the emphasis on competition law as an instrument for protection against abuse of dominant position or significant market power.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report is thus free of the modish tendency to favour the creation of new laws for this area, preferring instead to make use of existing legal instruments.

It is important to coordinate the different policies that have an impact on this sector, which is a genuine motor of growth within the Union, in order to derive its full potential.

However, there are still several problem areas, starting with the difficulty for the smallest retailers to remain in the market, because of the ever-present trend towards encouraging major outlets.

The Member States in turn must fully and correctly implement the internal market rules and legislation. It should be noted that small and medium-sized enterprises play a major role in the areas of employment and value creation. They are particularly important for life in rural areas and city centres. Consequently, we must make every effort to ensure that large shopping centres do not drive local shops and markets out of city centres and remote areas. Conditions must be created for small retailers to take better advantage of the freedoms of the single market. We must encourage them to develop their services. In order to achieve this, the funding allocated from the Structural Funds must be used more efficiently. Furthermore, we must reduce the administrative burden and remove market access restrictions. We cannot allow large shopping centres to use their powers and influence to ruin small entrepreneurs.</p>

Indeed, the retail sector, as stated in the report, is a pillar of the European economy, a market that represents 4.2 % of EU Gross Domestic Product and 20% of European small and medium-sized enterprises, and which employs almost 20 million people. A sector of this size deserves attention from all of us and the creation of the necessary measures to support and develop it. The growing economic nationalism that we have seen is hindering trade in the EU. While old barriers are still in place, new ones are being created, affecting the business climate as well as investment and job creation by foreign retailers. At a time of crisis and in the face of these difficulties, I believe that it is essential to step up dialogue at all levels in order to improve understanding, restore confidence and respond to the difficulties of small and medium-sized enterprises. The specific problems and challenges that the retail sector is facing need to be addressed. I voted in favour, as I also agree with the call to draft an integrated European Action Plan for Retail.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The retail sector is perhaps the most visible part of the programme for Community action, not only for its emphasis on the economy, but because it is hinged on the moment when trade brings together professionals and consumers and makes the reality of the common area tangible. However, this is an area which features delicate problems that need to be given careful attention. Among these problems is the fact that some national states have put up obstacles – indirectly, such as through the laying down of rules that make specific requirements for packaging – to the marketing of foreign products; private labels have been causing concern among the right holders of reference marks; and on another level, some retailers, often part of distribution networks, have used their strong bargaining power to crush the margins of producers. These are cases that may jeopardise the single, free and competitive market, and endanger one of the fundamental purposes of the Community project. This is one point that should not be left off the agenda, as the rapporteur says.</p>

Furthermore, the report insists that the consumer’s freedom of choice should be preserved, which is why particular attention must be paid to local retailers, who play a role in the accessibility of goods and services to all and in the preservation of jobs, particularly in the most backward regions. This report also reminds us, quite rightly, of the need to expand online trade and to increase consumer confidence in this area, for example by improving access to the Internet in those regions of the Union which need it, as well as improving the security of online payments. Finally, the report proposes developing a global European action plan for retail trade developed by the Commission in cooperation with the retail sector, and I would like to see this European action plan come about.

It is worth noting that of the aforementioned surplus, EUR 1.8 billion corresponds to penalties and interest gathered during the delay in implementing projects. This annual surplus is deducted proportionally from the contributions made by each Member State to the Union budget. Although the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets understand that the surplus resulting from interest accumulated due to delays in implementing projects and the fines charged to the Member States should not revert to the Member States, this is revenue from the implementation of EU law.

In this particular case, this proposal, for which I voted and which Parliament is determined to promote and advocate in the upcoming negotiations on annual and multiannual budgets, results in a reduction of EUR 59 million in Portugal’s contribution to the Community budget.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Effective consumer protection laws are critically important in regard to the single market. There must be a strong, clear legal framework to ensure that consumers are fully confident when paying for goods or services anywhere in the EU. There are problems with the regulations as they are at present. Differences between national laws add to the delays and high costs which are often involved. In addition, the Consumer Protection Network is not operating at full capacity because of lack of cooperation from the Member States. It is consumers who are adversely affected by this, with rogue traders exploiting the weaknesses within the system to make a profit. A progressive approach is the one recommended in the report in order to amend the directive, allowing the CPC to function correctly and to provide proper protection for European consumers. A comprehensive assessment from the Commission, as recommended in the report, would greatly help to identify the weaknesses in consumer protection laws and to frame responses to those weaknesses. Consumer rights must be at the heart of any legislation proposed in future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">There is a great deal of talk about cross-border cooperation and about its benefits. However, we have seen in practice that, when it comes to trade, we also need to factor the protection of European consumers into the equation. This is especially true where there are sellers or suppliers who illegally evade enforcement of the legislation to the detriment of law-abiding traders. At the moment, there is insufficient information on the operation of Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws. However, until we receive new information about how the system operates, I would like to make a few remarks supporting the inclusion on the political agenda of the subject of cross-border enforcement of consumers’ interests. At the moment, each country sets its own priorities, especially as we do not have a common set of priorities which we can refer to. I believe that, in order to win and retain the confidence of European consumers, the Commission needs to create these reference points. It is vital for us to have laws that protect consumers, which they are familiar with and can refer to in the event of deviations. Consumer confidence is a valuable asset which is both difficult to win and easy to lose during times of crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">I agree with the need to review the regulation creating an EU-wide network of competent public bodies for the enforcement of consumer protection law in the Member States (the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) network), which came into operation in December 2006. The review takes the form of an update of the annex in order to reflect the latest legislative developments in the area of consumer protection. The last Commission report from 2009 on the application of the CPC Regulation revealed a series of doubts relating to the system for cross-border promotion of the consumer acquis, consisting, for example, in the fact that a considerable number of registered authorities are not connected to the system, or do not make active use of it. The increasing length of time taken to handle requests is another problem. Apart from this, it is necessary to resolve the continuing fragmentation of procedural rules for enforcing the legislation. The different systems of national legislation and systems for enforcing legislation make it difficult to combat infringements of legislation in the EU effectively. Some public bodies have effective resources to hand for ending infringements of the legislation, while others must turn to the courts and face lengthy procedures. The costs of court proceedings can also cause problems, particularly if the requesting body is not able to cover the possible costs of court proceedings. The fact that requests always take longer than agreed (more than 150 days at present) can partly be explained by the greater complexity of cross-border cases, but it is often a matter of failing to stick to deadlines.</p>

I support the rapporteur’s view that the volume of all transactions has to be transparent in order to ensure maximum financial market stability and enable supervisory authorities to do their work properly. It is important to stress that national supervisory authorities and the European Securities and Markets Agency (ESMA) will be in charge of supervision.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This draft regulation concerns over-the-counter derivatives, financial products whose value is derived from another asset, and which are traded directly between two parties without passing through an intermediary. In September 2009, there was agreement among the leaders of the G20 that exchanges of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives should be better regulated. The Commission accordingly brought forward this proposal for a regulation in order to act quickly. The report drafted by my colleague Mr Langen and the amendments adopted in the Commission on Economic and Monetary Affairs give us a good basis for negotiation with the Council.

However, non-financial counterparties below a certain threshold, if they are not systemically relevant, do not need to be subject to the regulation, given their non-speculative nature. I know that this exception triggered a sharp response from the US Treasury secretary.

I believe that pension funds with a risk-averse profile should be obliged to provide reports and implement risk mitigation techniques for over-the-counter derivative contracts not cleared by a CCP. The clearing obligation should subsist as long as the non-financial counterparty’s net positions and exposures in OTC derivative contracts exceed the clearing threshold.

Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 (the Financial Conglomerates Directive) introduced supplementary and consolidated supervision of financial groups.

Whilst the EU directives relating to banking activities and insurance activities aim to constitute sufficient capital buffers to protect customers and policyholders, the Financial Conglomerates Directive (FCD) regulates the supplementary supervision of group risks.

      <p sl="pt">No sector, individual or product can avoid effective regulation and smart supervision. This directive aims to strengthen financial stability. Directive2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 December 2002 on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate provides the authorities responsible in the financial sector with supplementary powers and tools for the supervision of groups made up of many regulated bodies, which are active in different sectors of the financial markets. Such groups, that is, financial conglomerates, are therefore exposed to risks relating to controlling a group (group risks), which include the risks of contagion, where risks are spread from one end of the group to another; risk concentration, where the same type of risk materialises in various parts of the group at the same time; the complexity of managing many different legal entities; potential conflicts of interest; and the challenge of allocating regulatory capital to all their regulated entities, thereby avoiding the multiple use of capital. I agree that conglomerates should therefore be subject to supplementary supervision as well as supervision on an individual basis.</p>

If participation is the only element that distinguishes a financial conglomerate, I agree that supervisors should be allowed to assess whether the group is exposed to group risks and waive the group from supplementary supervision, if appropriate. Financial conglomerates need to be identified throughout the European Union according to the extent to which they are exposed to group risks.

      <p sl="en">The issue of short selling and credit default swaps is particularly important from the perspective of maintaining financial stability. It is essential that these provisions take the form of a regulation. They impose a direct obligation on private parties to publish information. They also delegate powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). This regulation respects fundamental rights and complies with the principles recognised, in particular, in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Transparency is necessary above all for reasons of financial market stability and investor protection. Another item is the proposed ban on so-called naked short selling. The current debt crisis shows how speculators who do not even hold bonds from a Member State of the eurozone, but only speculate on them, can cause entire states to go bankrupt. It is therefore important that only bond holders can engage in covering securities through credit default swaps. Last but not least, we also need to strengthen ESMA’s powers.

I believe that we must increase supervision in areas of short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps, in order to avoid economic crises in the future. The measures adopted by Member States were divergent as the European Union lacks a specific legislative framework for dealing with short selling issues. To ensure and improve the functioning of the internal market, in particular the financial markets, and to ensure a high level of consumer and investor protection, it is therefore appropriate to lay down a common framework with regard to the requirements and powers relating to short selling and credit default swaps and to ensure greater coordination and consistency between Member States where measures have to be taken in an exceptional situation. It is necessary to harmonise the framework for short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps, to prevent the creation of obstacles to the internal market, as it is likely that Member States will continue to take divergent measures.</p>

While CDS can have a useful insurance role, there is no benefit to society in allowing people to insure something they do not own, while there are risks to such practices. That is why it is illegal to take out an insurance policy on your neighbour’s life. These practices are part of the culture in the financial system which led to the financial crisis and this legislation will help address this.</p>

It is very important for the European Securities and Markets Authority to properly manage short selling and credit default swaps. In order to achieve this, the authority must be given more powers. It should be noted that credit default swaps in relation to sovereign debt are a particularly effective and efficient means of mitigating risk in a variety of instruments. Consequently, we must define objective market instability criteria. There must be strict control and monitoring of naked short selling and settlement discipline, while market makers should also be exempt from any restrictions or requirements imposed in exceptional situations. All of these measures must be implemented, so that financial markets function smoothly and results are optimised.</p>

      <p sl="it">On reading the newspapers in recent months, I have noticed that terms like ‘short selling’ and ‘credit default swaps’ have unfortunately become part of everyday language, and not for the right reasons. These are the instruments through which the harmful speculation that does nothing but damage to our countries and people has been and is still being carried on. That is why it is important to introduce regulation, but it must be thorough and not just a by-product of the crisis. I therefore agree that it is a case of continuing with the trialogue to try to obtain a balanced text on which people can agree but which does not demonise these practices. The original text of the proposal was rather restrictive and would actually have stopped this kind of activity. Thanks to a series of amendments, the text that was adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is much more balanced. At the moment the only point arousing concern is Article 12, which provides for restrictions on naked or uncovered short sales (sales not covered by shares borrowed or taken as collateral), as well as credit debt swaps. I truly hope that a balanced mutual agreement can be reached during the trialogue.</p>

I agree that the requirements to be imposed should address the identified risks, taking into account differences in the Member States and the potential economic impact of the requirements. They should do so without unduly detracting from the benefits that short selling provides to the quality and efficiency of markets by increasing market liquidity, as the short seller sells securities and then later repurchases those securities to cover the short sale, and by allowing investors to act when they believe a security is overvalued, leading therefore to the more efficient pricing of securities.

Financial speculation has caused untold damage to the exchequers of those very states which scrambled to save the financial sector from the brink of destruction, at the expense of essential public services and social provision on which our citizens’ well-being depends. Parliament is sending a very clear message to the Council ahead of the negotiations to come on this piece of legislation: if investors do not own sovereign bonds, or assets whose value is tied to them, they should not be able to seek profit from defaults on debt they do not own by trading in sovereign credit default swaps. Such speculative practices have no real economic utility, and they encourage betting on the failure of states to fulfil their obligations. I also welcome the proposed requirement that naked shorting be allowed only when, at the end of the trading day, the securities meant to be sold have at least been located and reserved.</p>

As such, a regulation seems to be the most appropriate solution, in that it offers the regulation with the most guarantees of certainty and security, whilst also enabling more concerted action by the Member States.

Europe can no longer allow speculators to enrich themselves on the back of their fellow citizens who are called on to bail out the coffers of Member States that are forced into bankruptcy. With the report voted on today in plenary, it would no longer be possible for a hedge fund to buy Greek CDSs without holding bonds from Greece and thus to speculate on the bankruptcy of the country.

      <p sl="nl">The European Parliament today drew clear conclusions on lessons to learn from the global credit crisis and the European debt crisis. The House voted in favour of banning naked credit default swaps (CDSs) on government bonds and of keeping naked short selling in check.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Credit default swaps act as insurance for bondholders against payment problems on the part of governments and businesses. These derivatives are, however, also sold by speculators who do not hold any bonds themselves. Anyone who holds credit default swaps without an underlying interest is positioned to gain in the event of panic on the financial markets. This is because, whenever doubt arises about the ability of a country to pay off its debts, these CDSs increase in value. The speculation on CDSs did not cause the crisis relating to the debts of Greece and other countries in the euro area, but it did greatly aggravate it. Speculators should only be permitted to buy Greek CDSs if they really do hold Greek government bonds. That would make it more difficult to gamble on Greece going bankrupt.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Speculators on the financial markets find it too easy to profit from this kind of perverse trading, while European taxpayers pay the price.

Directive 97/9/EC on Investor Compensation Schemes (ICSD) was adopted in 1997 to complement the Investment Services Directive, which was later replaced by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). Ten years since the ICSD entered into force, and against the backdrop of the financial crisis, there is a need to review the functioning of the ICSD, because the Commission has received numerous complaints from investors about the application of this directive, which has sometimes led to investors experiencing very significant losses. Furthermore, this review must consider the objective set at G20 level of addressing any loopholes in the regulatory and supervisory system and the objective of restoring investor confidence in the financial system. The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently fulfilled by the Member States, because the current EU framework only provides for some minimum harmonisation principles, leaving it up to Member States to develop it further. However, problems encountered in some Member States demonstrate that additional and notably more extensive harmonisation at EU level is necessary in order to ensure that the objectives of the directive are fulfilled within the EU. This directive’s amendments will improve the proper functioning of a single market for investment services, will increase investor protection and investor confidence in the European Union and will establish common rules to ensure a degree of harmonisation in the funding of the schemes and daily practice.</p>

      <p sl="en">The main achievement of the vote in the Committee on Economic Affairs is to ensure that private investors will be better protected against fraudulent and defaulting investment firms, and be eligible for at least EUR 100 000 in compensation – double the sum initially proposed by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The directive does not compensate investors for ‘investment risk’ and operates only as a last-resort safety net for investment firms’ clients should other important safeguards fail. Claims under the directive typically arise if there has been fraud or other administrative malpractice within a firm, or as the result of a firm’s inability – through error, negligence or problems in its systems and controls – to meet obligations towards clients’ assets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, the text would enhance transparency in three ways. Firstly, it imposes new reporting requirements on Member States, so as to provide the Commission and ESMA with more information on their national schemes and the nature of the risks being covered. Secondly, it requires investment firms to inform investors through their websites about compensation coverage and how to apply for compensation. And thirdly, it requires investment firms to state clearly the cost to each investor of the firm’s participation in a compensation scheme. I am in favour.</p>

      <p sl="de">The financial crisis has destabilised a whole series of high-risk financial products, which in some cases were sold to investors as being safe places to put their money. A number of court cases have been going on in this area for some time. For example, despite being aware that this was inadvisable, JPMorgan is alleged to have recommended that investors buy retail mortgage-backed securities when the prices on the property market had long since stopped rising. In addition, JPMorgan is said to have failed to tell investors that a hedge fund was involved, which was betting on the collapse of the securities. The investors, including the pension fund of the carmaker General Motors, lost almost all their investments. The losses made by pension funds as a result of speculation represent a major problem in this respect. Some examples from an Austrian perspective include the millions of euros lost by the Vienna Chamber of Commerce and the joint pension fund of the Austrian Chambers of Commerce, together with cases where legally acquired occupational pension rights were transferred to pension funds by means of highly risky contracts without the knowledge or consent of those affected. Against better judgment, these funds promised tax assessment earnings at unrealistically high levels. This report has many positive features, but it pays no attention at all to this problem, which is equivalent to the failure of the second pillar of the pension system. For this reason, I have abstained from voting.</p>

Furthermore, in cases where an investment firm or a third party is in a state of insolvency, it is very important to facilitate the return of investors’ financial instruments. In order to strengthen investor protection, ensuring a level playing field for investors, we must above all improve the single European market for financial services and harmonise EU legislation.

Any minor improvements made by the report to the European Commission’s initial proposal do not get to the heart of the problem, namely the fact that the Member States cannot ban the trade in modified organisms in their territory. Thus, it is impossible to afford any protection to workers, even in states which have banned GMO crops in their territory. It is no coincidence that, for the last 10 years, despite the provisions in this particular directive, the European Commission has not carried out a study into the impact of GMOs on health and the environment, even though a series of studies illustrating their disastrous consequences has been published.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) regularly arouses passions, unfortunately sometimes without sufficient appeal to reason. I used my vote to call for decisions on the authorisation or prohibition of GMO cultivation to continue, as far as possible, to be taken at European level, so that the single market does not fall apart and so that we do not create distortions of competition among European farmers. If the growing of a particular GMO is bad for Sweden, it is also bad for France. I therefore think it is essential to strengthen the role of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in order to ensure optimal food safety and environmental safety throughout the continent. I recognise, however, that certain criteria, such as public policy, which is recognised within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and is thus legally applicable, must be able to be used by the Member States to restrict or prohibit, on a case-by-case basis, the cultivation of certain GMOs which pose particular difficulties in certain Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It is euphemistic to say that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are controversial in Europe. While several Member States, including France, are using their escape clause to refuse to cultivate certain GMOs, at the moment the Member States have very little room for manoeuvre, and, because of unanimity, or even majority, decisions are regularly blocked in the Council. The idea of this directive is therefore to reintroduce a degree of freedom for Member States: they will be able to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs within their territory. We have adopted Mrs Le Page’s report by a very large majority, a report which was the result of long negotiations, and which I think represents a balanced compromise. This is a difficult exercise, because we are in a single market, supposedly without barriers. The report therefore strives to find a balance between the EU’s system of authorisation and the freedom of the Member States to respond to their specific national or local problems. It must be emphasised, however, that the Member States will no longer be able to act as they see fit: a list of grounds has been drawn up which will serve as a basis for justifying the restriction or prohibition of the cultivation of GMOs. Among the possible grounds given are environmental and socio-economic impacts, as well as land use and town and country planning.</p>

Each Member State will be able to introduce specific bans going beyond considerations relating to human health protection and the environment or the effective functioning of the internal market, which are already guaranteed to the highest level on a European basis.</p>

This report reaffirms Parliament’s ability to compromise, which has enabled us to secure a resolution that has significantly improved the initial proposal tabled by the Commission. This report stresses the need for a more preventative and cautious attitude as regards cultivating genetically modified organisms (GMOs), whilst also emphasising the importance of protecting the environment, as well as of defending traditional farming, and small and medium-sized farmers. It also takes into account the diversity of the European Union, and the need to make the Member States fully able to intervene in the particular characteristics of their territories and agricultural activities.</p>

      <p sl="en">The European Parliament and Council Directive of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), together with the European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of 22 March 2003 on genetically modified food and feed, establish a very strict framework which should, if applied correctly, ensure a high level of protection for human life and health, the health and decent living conditions of animals, environmental protection and the interests of consumers, while also securing the proper functioning of the internal market. The directive does not permit GMOs to be marketed unless a special environmental risk assessment is carried out. The requirements of the directive in the area of risk assessment are not complied with, however, and these shortcomings in its implementation explain the opposition in many Member States to the cultivation of GMOs on their territory. It should be noted that the issue of cultivating and releasing transgenic plants on a territory has to be distinguished from permits for marketing and consumption, as well as the free movement of goods and products, to which this text does not apply. In addition to from this, GMO cultivation should not result in additional costs for conventional or organic agriculture. We must therefore stipulate that Member States are obliged to adopt measures to prevent GMOs being present in other products.</p>

Fourteen million farmers have been growing GMOs for years without any negative impact on human or animal health or on the environment. In Europe, on the other hand, we cultivate fears, while importing massive amounts of genetically modified soya and corn to feed our livestock. That has, quite clearly, had no consequences for animals and humans, except that we are preventing our agriculture from adopting techniques that would allow us to reduce the usage of pesticides, fertilisers and other added chemicals.</p>

The report represents a success for those Member States whose citizens are very health-conscious and opposed to genetic engineering. Around 20% of the seed sold on the global market is genetically modified. It is not yet clear whether farmers who plant genetically modified seeds really use less pesticides, which is the argument always put forward by the supporters of genetic engineering. The fact that the seed can only be used for one year and, therefore, that artificial dependencies are being created also gives cause for concern. Genetic engineering remains an area where the short- and long-term consequences have not yet been made clear. Critics of genetic engineering, for example, suspect that there is a connection between the rapid increase in allergic reactions over recent years and genetically modified foods. In addition to allergies, opponents fear a range of other side effects may be caused, including kidney and liver damage.

In each instance, all factors should be duly justified and measures must be backed up scientifically or supported by arguments relating to risk management or other legitimate factors which might arise from the release of GMOs. For the ban to function effectively, Member States must establish a general mandatory system of financial liability and financial guarantees. I believe that research urgently needs to be carried out to determine the long-term impact of GM crops on the environment, as well as their potential effects on non-target organisms.

      <p sl="en">This vote would clearly strengthen the hand of Member States that want to prohibit GMO cultivation under the proposed new rules, ensuring they have a stronger legal basis for banning cultivation. Clearly an EU-wide moratorium would give the greatest certainty to the Member States and the clear majority of citizens that are opposed to GMO cultivation. However, this vote would give greater legal certainty to countries or regions wishing to introduce bans and, as such, is a step forward. Importantly, GMO cultivation could be banned on environmental grounds – such as to protect biodiversity – or if there is a lack of adequate data on the impact of cultivating a GM crop. In favour. Given the very real concerns of cross-contamination of conventional crops by GM crops, including cross-border contamination, we welcome the broad consensus to make anti-contamination measures mandatory. Member States that still do not have such measures in place have to adopt them. MEPs also supported a Green proposal calling on Member States to establish a strict liability system to ensure the polluter pays for damages that might occur due to the cultivation or placing on the market of GMOs.</p>

      <p sl="et">I welcome the fact that today’s report gives the Member States the competence to use their own territory for the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or to restrict or prohibit them. According to the latest Eurobarometer survey on this issue, published in October 2010, 61% of Europeans say that GM food makes them feel uneasy, and the same proportion (61%) disagree with the idea that the development of GM food should be encouraged. Less than a quarter (23%) agree with the idea that ‘GM food does no harm to the environment’, whilst over 53% disagree with this statement. Overall, there is not a single country in which the majority of respondents agree that the cultivation of GMOs is good for the country’s economy. On the issue of the contamination of conventional or organic farming by GMOs, the Commission has always justified its refusal to legislate at Community level by the diversity of agricultural practices, climates and geography among and even within Member States. This same diversity exists for ecosystems and receiving environments, and justifies the application of subsidiarity to the cultivation of GMOs, following the same logic. At the same time, the possible cultivation of a GMO should also not result in additional costs for farmers working in conventional or organic farming. It should thus be compulsory for Member States to take measures to avoid the presence of GMOs in other products, and particular attention should be paid to any possible cross-border contamination. In addition to the above, it is certainly also worth noting the question of what need there is in Europe to encourage the cultivation of GMOs when at the same time we have restrictions on several other forms of agricultural production. I supported the adoption of this report.</p>

The question of authorising or prohibiting GMO crops on national territory is extremely important for both French and European agriculture. It requires in-depth scientific and environmental discussion rather than inflammatory and unworkable rhetoric.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In my view, the decision to authorise or prohibit GMO crops should only be taken once an independent expert assessment has been completed, based solely on objective health and environmental criteria and in accordance with the precautionary principle. What is more, the decision should be taken at Community level, under the auspices of the European Food Safety Agency. The same criteria must be applied to all Member States so as to guarantee fair and healthy competition.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The use and spread of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has sparked enormous opposition from the European public. Nevertheless, I should like to mention that this lack of confidence is due, in particular, to the improper application of Directive 2001/18/EC by the Member States. The aforementioned directive and Regulation 1829/2003 have already set out a fairly rigorous European framework which, when correctly applied, provides a high level of protection of human life and health, of animals, of the environment, and, finally, of consumer interests, so ensuring that the Internal Market will operate properly. This amendment, which respects the principle of subsidiarity, gives the Member States the final say as regards the limitation or prohibition of GMOs, and is not applicable to their freedom of circulation and importation. Once they have informed the Commission and the Member States, EU countries can now apply these measures on a case-by-case basis, in line with environmental, socio-economic and scientific criteria. These reasons must be backed up, thus preventing market distortions and legal uncertainty. In order for this directive to be properly applied, there is a need to strengthen environmental assessment and arrangements for monitoring by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), so that there can be a systematic study, in line with advances in research into the area of biotechnology.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Like my group, I voted against the amended Lepage report. The debate on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is always an emotionally charged one in this House. The debate that we are holding today will have to be a debate not for or against GMOs but concerning the issue of whether we want to grant the Member States greater flexibility where they wish to restrict or prohibit the use of GMOs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The package that was approved today is a step backwards, as it splinters the internal market. The environment and health are, by definition, problems that we can best tackle together. The environment and health do not stop at the border of a Member State. I am therefore arguing for a bolstered European approach with a more involved role for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). We need to be careful that we do not introduce a de facto ban on GMOs by unnecessarily firming up the criteria under which GMOs can be prohibited or restricted.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I argue for a case-by-case approach, in other words for GMOs to be approved where it is scientifically proven that the genetically modified organism is just as safe as the non-genetically modified organism. The study of GMOs, too, must be continued, but it must take place in a scientifically responsible manner, rather than on the basis of political dogma.</p>

Given the risks to biodiversity, different cultivation methods, the economic impact on conventional and organic farming, and the limited number of studies on the environmental and health impact of GMOs, Member States need to have a legal framework for banning these crops.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This vote sends a clear signal to the Council and Commission: that ultimately they need to improve the guidelines on assessing GMOs in accordance with the Council Conclusions produced under the French Presidency in December 2008. The Commission and Council now need to take up their responsibilities with regard to GMOs and to ensure that the Member States, such as France, will actually back this much-needed change to Community legislation.

The changes to the Hungarian Constitution are a move in precisely that direction, in order to consolidate the power of the local bourgeoisie. What the EU is seeking is an even more decisive role in political developments, including in the internal affairs of its Member States, so that it and the local bourgeoisie can join forces in imposing the iron will of the monopolies, profit for capital and a reduction in the cost of labour and crush the grassroots movement.</p>

It is the sovereign right of Member States to draw up a constitution or to guarantee the rule of law by means of other legal instruments. Nobody expects states founded on a common law system to draft and adopt a constitution, nor is the institution of ombudsman known in every Member State. Why should the European Commission make an exception in the very case of Hungary and scrutinise – even before its entry into force – the law which is to replace the 1949 Constitution drafted and adopted in the communist era and patched up with several amendments since then? The new Hungarian Constitution is based on common European values and guarantees the principles of democracy and the rule of law. The preamble of the new constitution recalls the national anthem and pays tribute to ethnic Hungarians living abroad and other nationalities living in Hungary. In addition to the contribution to European unity, it is appropriate that an article includes a provision on responsibility for Hungarian minorities abroad. It is a precondition for a peaceful European coexistence to ensure minority rights which are essential for survival. Supporting this is a natural responsibility of the motherland.

As a democratic country, Hungary must respect the territorial integrity of other countries while supporting Hungarians living abroad. Attention should be drawn to the fact that the new Hungarian Constitution must be consistent with the European Union’s values, human rights and the principle of the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In this extraordinary explanation of votes I wish to explain why I voted against the motion for resolution on the ‘revised Hungarian Constitution’, tabled by left-wing and liberal political groups at today’s voting session. I have many reasons, but this time I would like to highlight only two of them: (1) The resolution argues that the Hungarian Constitution ‘may create a legal basis for actions that neighbouring countries would consider as meddling into their internal affairs’ (Paragraph H). (2) The resolution calls on the Hungarian authorities ‘to amend the Constitution, including its preamble, so that it explicitly guarantees that Hungary respects the territorial integrity of other countries..’. (Paragraph R(5)). I firmly reject this tendentious and insinuating wording that reminds us of the past political discourses of the national-communist regimes of history, namely the ‘non-intervention’ doctrine of the Ceauşescu dictatorship in Romania, and I find the wording derogatory for both Hungary and ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring countries. The Basic Law of Hungary is fully entitled to express the responsibility of Hungary for Hungarian communities living abroad and still suffering from severe discrimination, and does not pose any harm to the territorial integrity of the countries concerned. Furthermore, I denounce the initiative role Socialist MEPs Mrs Kinga Göncz and Mr Csaba Tabajdi played in the adoption of the resolution of the European Parliament, which is little short of betraying Hungarian national interests.</p>

It was a laudable and necessary undertaking. Mr Eickhout’s report required the Commission to make proposals on increasing the target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 30% by 2020. However, some other Members thought otherwise: they refused to agree to the 30% reduction and persuaded the majority of Members to reject the report in the final vote. I feel this was unfortunate, particularly as we have already cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17% compared with 1990, which means we are close to achieving the 20% target. We should be more ambitious.

Progress on a global scale is the only way to solve the problem of climate change, and the EU must therefore continue to encourage its partners to meet their commitments. In turn the European Commission should work towards a structural overhaul of EU climate diplomacy which, through the involvement of the new European External Action Service and the High Representative, should seek to present a clearer EU profile on climate policy, bringing a new dynamic to the international climate negotiations and encouraging partners throughout the world to also introduce binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

It is essential to find solutions that maintain the competitiveness of European industry. In that respect, I welcome the fact that for the first time there is a broad consensus between the political groups on the inclusion of a sectoral approach.

Even though extreme weather events cannot be clearly ascribed to global warming, it is highly likely that climate change is increasing the occurrence and intensity of these events. The fact that the international community failed in Copenhagen to reach a comprehensive binding international climate agreement, however, does not mean that countries are not adopting any measures, because European countries are facing key decisions aimed at preserving their future prosperity and security. The transition to the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, which is in line with EU climate objectives, can be combined with a healthier economy, growth in green jobs and innovation. In the absence of efforts to significantly reduce maximum emission values, the stimulation of investment into environmental technologies and innovation would threaten to make the EU emissions trading scheme unnecessary.

Why exactly have I done this? The EU climate and energy package defines the conditions for increasing our commitment to reducing emissions. We should keep to the terms of the package, including in our efforts to guarantee the security of investments. This increase in our goals will have hardly any impact on the UN climate negotiations. No studies have been carried out into how we intend to achieve the goal of 30%, in particular following Germany’s exit from nuclear power. I very much value the opportunities which energy efficiency offers and have already called for a mandatory energy efficiency target in the 2009 climate report. However, I am opposed to efforts to reopen the debate about the EU commitment to emissions reductions by the back door and by means of energy efficiency measures, and to attempts to change the key features of the emissions trading system, which have already been decided on, while failing to call for any binding energy efficiency targets. Before we take any further measures, we must achieve the goals that we have set ourselves and, in particular, demonstrate that the emissions trading system is functioning correctly. We must ensure that by making calls of this kind we do not damage our credibility with our partners and, particularly, with those partners who are hesitating about joining us.

It was the Member States which agreed on the binding targets of 3x20, and they should have the opportunity to meet these obligations in the same way that they have the opportunity to shape their own energy mix, although it is evident that this opportunity exists only in theory. Secondly, I would like to remind everyone that there is no evidence that anthropomorphic CO2 has any impact on the climate. This hypothesis, which lacks scientific credibility, was put forward by a group of individuals subject to political lobbying, or in other words the IPCC, whose mistaken conclusions and scientific misconduct, for example as regards the Himalayan glaciers and Climategate respectively, are widely known.</p>

      <p sl="hu">European countries are facing critical decisions if they intend to maintain their prosperity and security in the future. There is a need for a shift towards national greenhouse gas emission reduction targets which are also in line with EU climate change objectives. A healthier economy, an increase in the number of green jobs and the development of innovation must take the lead in this respect. In 2009, the European Union already reached 17.3% of the 20% carbon-dioxide emission reduction commitment undertaken in the Europe 2020 strategy. There are many who now believe that we could modify this commitment by 2020, and could perhaps raise it to 25%. I, however, do not share this view, especially not in the light of the changes that took place in EU nuclear energy policy in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. We must consider that our original commitments were already based on an energy mix where nuclear power constituted an integral part of the programmes of several countries. Were this to change, a 25% target would be difficult to achieve, all things considered. In the light of the above I therefore consider it important that Member States do not reject entirely the possibilities offered by nuclear power and its 0% carbon emissions. Based on the above, even though I supported the report as a whole, I voted against the amendments aimed at a commitment of 25%.</p>

Increasing the percentage of greenhouse gas reduction from 20% to 30% alters the forecasts of the EU 2020 strategy. It is undoubtedly important in the fight against pollution and in the protection of citizens’ health, but reducing emission levels in such a short timescale also means putting European enterprises at risk on the international market.

It is with great regret that my colleague and rapporteur Bas Eickhout was forced to recommend that MEPs reject my own report after it was hijacked by amendments from conservative and centre-right MEPs. The amendments, which passed by the tightest of majorities, would have meant the final report was a step back from previous positions adopted by Parliament and, as a result, the least-worst outcome was to prevent the report from being adopted. It is extremely frustrating that conservative and centre-right MEPs continue to keep their heads in the sand with regard to climate policy. It is clear that the EU’s current 20 % emissions target for 2020 is completely obsolete and that the EU needs to deliver on its pledges and step up to a 30 % reduction target.

The reason for this is that it is not definite that other industrial and developing countries will follow Europe’s example and adopt the same ambitious commitments. Another reason for this is that the new targets mean significant changes to EU legislation, although the old legislation has not even come into force yet in the EU. This has disastrous repercussions for European business’s planning as a global player. The last reason is that it would entail higher prices for emission quotas, bigger green investments from business and, in the long run, dipping again into the already dwindled post-crisis financial resources of the general public who ultimately have to foot the bill.

This is precisely why the focus of the cohesion policy in the European Union – which is a unique project in the world, as is clearly highlighted in the report – must be on narrowing the disparities and taking special measures in the disadvantaged regions in Member States. The reason for this is that it is only if we are united and equal that we can be strong in the same European project. The centrifugal forces of globalisation do not offer any Member State opportunities on an individual basis. This is exactly why I too believe that the expertise from the richer regions must be used to benefit more disadvantaged regions so that, ultimately, the European cohesion policy will mean primarily a Europe which is united and strong in its diversity.

Whereas at present the EU-27 are still home to some 8% of the global population, by 2050 this figure will have fallen to 5%. Particularly because of growth in China and in important emerging countries, the EU’s share in the global economy will decline from 20% to around 12%. If the European Community wishes to compete economically and politically, and if this relative decline in significance is not to be accompanied by a loss of prosperity, the Community must act in a more concerted manner with regard to vital issues about securing its future. Cohesion policy and structural policy therefore have a key role to play in ensuring future competitiveness. Future policy must be oriented towards growth and innovation, but it can only be sustained by combining regional policy objectives with pan-European objectives concerning innovation, research and environmental challenges, and by exploiting the know-how of the more affluent regions. It is also necessary to reduce regional and social disparities, which prevent the EU’s potential from being fully exploited, because despite the trend towards a narrowing of interregional disparities, major imbalances still exist and are actually growing among/in some Member States.

I therefore voted for greater convergence and greater solidarity between the European regions and a return to economic growth.</p>

      <p sl="en">On the Pieper, Sanchez-Schmid, Stavrakakis, Vlasak and Mikolasik reports: The Conservative MEPs have elected to reject these reports on the future direction of ohesion policy, with the exception of the Vlasak report where we have abstained. This is due to a number of fundamental reasons: it is our contention that at a time of ongoing fiscal consolidation across Member States, it is totally unacceptable that the EU's large Cohesion budget should remain untouched by these efforts. Generally, these reports fail to meet Conservative concerns regarding the EU's management of Cohesion policy in any meaningful way. They reject any moves to allow richer Member States to fund their own regional development and prevent the emergence of a smaller, more efficient and more targeted Cohesion policy towards Europe's poorest regions. Instead, new vehicles of bureaucracy such as the macro-regional entities are proposed, and the nation-state is once again undermined by a determined shift towards regionalism. This age of austerity offers an opportunity for the EU to spend less on old and wasteful priorities. These reports go in entirely the wrong direction.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Cohesion Funds play a key role in the EU’s balance. The projects supported by these funds at regional level contribute to pan-European objectives in areas like economic growth, research, environmental protection, renewable energy supply, social cohesion, and even overseas development. This report is therefore very important, in the light of the prospective analysis it proposes for the post-2013 period. Cohesion policy encourages the principle of good governance at micro, macro and intergovernmental levels, and I entirely agree with this. I believe these instruments are crucial for reducing interregional disparities, and that these disparities can have no place in an increasingly interlinked and interdependent Europe. With a view to this sort of post-2013 improvement, I would stress the need to rigorously identify Europe’s investment priorities, as well as to thoroughly analyse the macro-regional strategies. I consider it imperative for funds to be managed following a rigorous evaluation and constant financial controls throughout the life of each project. A more balanced and developed EU requires Europe’s leaders to approach investment priorities and cohesion policy itself in a dynamic way.</p>

      <p sl="it">Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars of an EU that is in favour of bridging gaps in the development of geographical areas and sectors of society and the economy. If correctly focused on people and bottom-up subsidiarity, it allows the promotion of integrated, systemic growth, stimulating initiative and civic sense and fostering the development of responsibility and the common good. The experience of the current 2007-2013 programming period has taught that in the next programming period we need above all to give greater responsibility to the actors, beneficiaries and targets of strategic and operational programming, as well as to its implementation, monitoring and the assessment of whether objectives have been met, through programmes providing incentives and disincentives to encourage the meeting of targets and allowing greater transparency in the processes and work involved in active participation in them. It is also important to make the entire structure of governance and management simpler and more flexible, and to foster the capacity for integration of the different territories in a cross-border, inter- and intra-regional sense. Finally, it is necessary for the resources and objectives of cohesion policy in the next programming period to be in line with the challenges the EU will be undertaking, including the EU 2020 strategy. I think that the report I helped to approve shows the right way to do this.</p>

I do not share this pessimism and I believe that, if it is not separated from its core values, Europe will be able to emerge from this crisis strengthened. However, this is an extremely difficult task and threatens one of the principles that contributed to its initial success: cohesion. Without promoting cohesion, each part of the Union will tend to get caught up in its own interests, and to lose the notions of solidarity and helping each other that are so necessary in a political and economic area that wants to be increasingly integrated.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Cohesion policy has reduced many of the asymmetries between Europe’s various regions, but it is only fair to recognise that the disparities still remain very significant.

Given the challenges currently posed by the economic, financial and social crisis, cohesion policy should be reinforced in order to ensure better conditions for supporting development in disadvantaged regions. This will be crucial to guaranteeing that the Europe 2020 is actually put into practice and better ensuring that the established objectives are achieved, in particular in terms of reducing numbers of people who leave school early, of increasing higher-level qualifications, of increasing the active population and employability indices, of reducing poverty, and of increasing investment in environmental projects.

This report, however, does not understand coherence, and thus cohesion, altogether correctly. The report draws attention to the threat of the EU losing its demographic and economic importance by 2050. On the basis of this ‘threat’ it states that ‘If the European community of States wishes to compete economically and politically, and if this relative decline in significance is not to be accompanied by a loss of prosperity, the community must act in a more concerted manner with regard to vital issues on which it needs to secure its future’. In my opinion, it is not for these reasons that the community should act in a concerted manner – the purpose of cohesion policy should not be to maintain the global economic positions of the EU or to compete with the rest of the world. The purpose should be the cohesion of nations and the development of a sense of identity among EU citizens, so that Europeans have the feeling that they are in their own country and that they are equal within the EU. EU cohesion policy represents a political approach which is unique in the global context, and which, in my opinion, must be promoted.</p>

Fifty or so regions would be affected, 11 of them French, including Lorraine. Another key point is strengthening the territorial cooperation objective. Areas of territorial cooperation are privileged areas of European cooperation and have a crucial role to play in the strengthening of links at local level, between partners of different Member States, or between citizens preoccupied by common problems.

Ex-post evaluations have shown a significant reduction in economic, social and regional disparities. These developments are having a positive impact on social security and investment in environmental protection. Cohesion policy was intended to be a counterpart to the single market and to foster the development of an innovative and protective Europe based on solidarity in the face of the challenges associated with globalisation, demographic change and resource conservation, and the intrinsic potential of all regions should be exploited to boost growth and regional and social cohesion. Cohesion policy is relevant to citizens, because it brings Europe into people’s daily lives. The cohesion and structural policies have proved flexible in crisis situations and have made a crucial contribution to various national economic stimulus and training programmes. European structural policy is making a major contribution towards overcoming the economic and financial crisis, as it tends to be oriented towards innovation and removing disparities, strongly encouraging European regions to upgrade infrastructure, increase regional innovation potential and boost environmentally sustainable development. A comprehensive and well-funded EU cohesion policy in all European regions continues to be essential, given the economic and social imbalances in the regions, the geographical disadvantages of certain regions (particularly the outermost regions), as well as specific structural problems and the need to adapt to new challenges.</p>

At present, the population of the European Union accounts for around 8% of the world’s population, but by 2050 that figure will have dropped to only 5%. The EU will also become less significant in economic terms, mainly due to economic growth in China, from the current 20% to around 12%.

There must be agreement between Europe’s objectives and objectives relating to regional development if we want to achieve the European added value that we want. This added value can be created, of course, by competitive and strong regions, which is why we need to use cohesion policy to reduce the large differences in development among regions. I supported the European Commission’s proposal to establish a clear-cut, transparent objective for the transitional regions – between 75% and 90% – in order that the different European regions receive equal treatment when it comes to providing them with support. I therefore did not support Amendment 5, paragraphs 33 and 99, by the rapporteur, Mr Pieper, and I supported the principles set out in paragraph 34, which state that regions should be treated equally and not through an opaque system</p>

Slow progress in development, including a lack of research and development capacity in the private sector, too little involvement in international business cycles, companies with an inadequate capital base and serious demographic disadvantages, cannot be overcome by 2013. Of course, it is a good thing when a region no longer belongs to the poorest group, but we do not want to be lumped together in future with regions which have not made the same level of effort as we have or have not had to cope with the same conditions.

Given the nature of these policies as a key instrument supporting poverty eradication, the large-scale involvement of civil society and national parliaments is absolutely necessary. The political dialogue obtained should be on these issues, but also on the annual budgetary review. As we can see in the report, the 2006 evaluation by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) demonstrated that the impact of these policies in countries like Malawi, Mozambique, Nicaragua and Uganda, inter alia, had a positive effect as regards improving governance, implementing national poverty reduction plans, and improving accountability.</p>

It concerns the transfer of financial resources from an external funding agency to the coffers of the partner country, provided the latter meets the agreed payment conditions. At first sight, budget support may appear to be a risky undertaking. However, that is not the case, if the necessary precautions are taken to ensure that the funds are used efficiently. The fact that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must give its consent to each and every disbursement further limits the scope for abuse. All disbursements presuppose appropriate capacity in the field of public finance management of the recipient country, which must also have a strategy in place for combating poverty. The countries concerned are called upon to promote their capacity for dialogue with civil society and parliaments.

It is therefore important to involve parliaments and civil society to a greater extent in the dialogue on anti-poverty policies and in annual reviews of budget support. Finally, I took the opportunity to highlight once again the clear need for policy coherence for development and to reiterate my wish that the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) focus on promoting democracy and human rights, which are key conditions for sustainable development.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Union has vast experience in conducting development aid processes. Despite the added value that European support constitutes for the most deprived countries, these countries cannot simply be receivers of aid, but partners and must, as such, be accountable. However much funding or aid of other sorts is provided for them, for their part they will have to commit to transparency and good management. In order for this transparency to be in place and verifiable, it is essential to involve national parliaments and civil society in the debate on managing aid received, and to make this debate a central element of annual political life in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The awareness that something that should be for everyone is only for the few undermines social ties and degrades the already fragile social capital of the weakest societies. The Union must not let up in its development aid efforts, but must introduce mechanisms, like budgetary support, that enable European taxpayers and potential recipients in developing countries to know how it has been used, to what end and with what result.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Regardless of the time in question, each and every budgetary programme for investment or financial support should prioritise rigour, transparency and a proper evaluation of its sustainability, as well as guarantees that the funds will be properly and efficiently used and spent in the interests of the beneficiaries. That is the orientation that policy regarding support for developing countries should have. Independent assessments have shown that the majority of programmes have benefitted the beneficiary countries and their populations, so their continuation would be advisable. However, concerns remain about the effect of support in reducing poverty and consolidating democracy in beneficiary countries. On the other hand, these countries have great independence regarding this support. I therefore support the clear definition of criteria, a strong commitment to regional integration and the development of beneficiary countries from within, as well as clarification of compensation for contributor countries and institutions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Budgetary support means the transfer of financial resources from an external financial agency to the domestic budget of a partner country, if that country meets the conditions for implementing the payment. The funds obtained form part of the overall resources of the partner country, and are therefore used in accordance with the system used by the partner country for managing public resources. Although budgetary assistance has been in operation for some time, it expanded in the 1980s and 1990s, when the World Bank and various bilateral cooperation groups began to provide budgetary support in the form of assistance with the balance of payments. Within the framework of the second wave of budgetary support in 2000 – 2005, a new coordinated approach to budgetary support in general was introduced. The aim of this form of budgetary support was to introduce support for the policies and strategies of partner countries, in order to develop the concepts of accountability and strong partnership, and to provide a better harmonisation of procedures, methods and payment of support between aid donors. In order for countries to be entitled, however, they must achieve a sufficient level of accountability in the fight against poverty, macroeconomic governance, the handling of public finances and management.</p>

Budget support is currently regarded as the most effective way of achieving the objectives of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda. Between 2003 and 2009, the European Commission provided over EUR 13 billion in budget support. Around 56% of support went to African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, 24% to countries involved in the European neighbourhood policy, 8% to Asian countries, 6% to Latin American countries and 5% to South African countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The 2006 evaluation of budget support provided to Malawi, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Uganda, Rwanda and Vietnam, which was commissioned by the OECD Development Assistance Committee, states that budget support had a beneficial impact in terms of the efficient use of public funds and the increased potential of governments, particularly in the field of public finance management.</p>

However, in order to achieve this objective we must above all specify the criteria applied to budget support, in order to avoid possible deviations or poor absorption of support. Attention should be drawn to the fact that budget support must become the Commission’s principal form of aid and therefore a collective EU target for budget support must be set. In providing support we must ensure democratic accountability and stop depoliticisation, and development policy measures must comply with the principles of the rule of law and democracy.

The nature of this aid mechanism obliges the involved entities to seek ways of monitoring how these funds are actually spent.

However, simple financial aid is not enough to improve local institutions on its own. Indeed, according to the data we have seen, it is difficult to even evaluate the impact of these measures on budget support, since, for example, it creates a certain sense of third countries’ dependency on the awarded aid, which suggests that there is no structural progress. For example, it is feared that the result of the cut in aid will involve a drop in provision of basic services. However, Parliament is not contesting the benefit of this type of measure: instead, whilst committing to it working properly, Parliament is demanding that the criteria laid down for making it available be followed, according to objective analyses, so as to contribute to consolidating local structures geared towards respect for the inviolability of the person.

Budget support reinforces concepts of ownership and partnership, as it imposes more responsibility on third countries for the commitments they have made and for increasing mutual cooperation on achieving the objectives of the policies and strategies they have set out. On the one hand, this method also enables greater coordination between donor countries and increased harmonisation of procedures. It is clear from a number of reports and Commission assessments that budget support has an effect on the development of the countries in question. However, there is a need to clarify eligibility criteria, which differ between beneficiary countries, to promote the participatory development of civil society in monitoring expenditure and the impact of this method, and to reinforce coordination between Member States’ bilateral aid and between the EU and international organisations.

      <p sl="fr">The European Union has a crucial role to play in the field of energy, which is an area for which a European approach is fully justified. The stakes are high: security of energy supply; diversification of means of production; projects of European interest. However, all this can only be achieved at European level. This own-initiative report deserves credit for making this point and is thus a step in the right direction. What we lack above all in the field of energy and in the fight against climate change is political will. I voted in favour of this report, and I will pay close attention to the proposals to be made by the European Commission on energy infrastructure in October. We will also need to monitor closely the drafting of the next multiannual financial framework to ensure that a sufficient budget is allocated to enable the development of a true common energy policy at EU level. EU energy infrastructure projects should be funded through Eurobonds in particular, which would increase investment and ensure complementarity of public and private partners.</p>

Furthermore, we need to develop smart and super grids, build interconnections and extend gas grids, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance security of supply. An EU approach to improving Europe’s energy infrastructure is necessary as individual Member States cannot achieve this on their own. It should be noted that environmental benefits do not necessarily occur in those countries that make the required investments, and therefore we need to think about long term objectives, so that energy infrastructure planned today would serve us well for several decades. I agree with the European Parliament’s position that it is essential to draw all the necessary conclusions from the existing directives and the provisions of the so-called third internal energy market package and then to establish the basis for planning and investment in the European network. We also need to establish improved EU financial instruments to back regional and local authorities as they seek to invest in sustainable energy production.</p>

Only through determination and by having an energy policy can all of the obstacles be overcome. Both of these elements form part of the ‘Energy 2020’ communication, which calls for a radical change in the current approach to highly important issues such as energy infrastructure and networks, which should be mobilised and supported under the banner of ‘Europe making effective use of its resources’. In my opinion, we need to focus on energy structures that are highly important from the perspective of fulfilling objectives the EU has been pursuing for decades: in other words, reducing carbon levels, ensuring security of supply and price stability for consumers and creating a single market in energy which will ensure access to energy resources for businesses and individuals at affordable prices. Solidarity between Member States is also important from this perspective, and we cannot talk about security without also mentioning solidarity within a European framework.

In order to address major challenges in the development and security of energy infrastructure in Europe, the European Parliament wished to adopt an own-initiative report in anticipation of the legislative proposal concerning a new European instrument in this field. Interconnection capacity or its availability between Member States still remains insufficient in one-third of the Union.

Although this does not specifically apply to Malta, and is a statement made in reference to other Member States, any distortion of this term can potentially lead to the isolation of Malta in these matters. Due to its geographical positioning and a general lack of resources, the country has no gas connections to the continent and is, therefore, completely dependant on foreign fossil fuel imports.

It is impossible to tackle all of these unless we envisage new networks and new interconnections both within the EU and with third countries. I believe that we need to: determine the necessary infrastructure; lay down the criteria for deciding which projects should be classed as being of European interest, taking account of balanced development in the various regions; ensure that these projects are implemented within a reasonable timeframe, working out formulae with which to resolve the controversial matter of authorisation procedures and the awarding of licences in the Member States, guaranteeing debate, information and public participation; improve cost allocation; secure financing that will attract and boost private investment.</p>

However, it would be futile to build energy projects if the networks that they will connect to are too old to cope with the new energy. Europe needs more internal and international interconnectors. We must ensure that supply routes serve the general European interest and not that of individual Member States. At the same time as it builds new routes, the Union must also focus on the modernisation of national grids, and support the Member States in this task.

The recent disruptions to the gas supply reminded us of this, being an example of how there is no option for reverse flows. In the longer term too, the target for cutting the EU’s carbon dioxide emissions will create a need for development, because there will be a dramatic increase in the use of electricity and growing pressures on large-scale energy storage and transmission.

Deregulation in particular has not brought the promised financial improvements for customers. In addition, the bills are still in some cases difficult to understand. Of course, it is important for us to guarantee Europe’s security of supply. However, the EU continues to focus too heavily on nuclear power in this respect and not enough of its funding programmes are targeted at developing alternative forms of energy. Many concepts are also still incomplete. For example, the problem with wind energy has so far been storage. It is currently only possible to store electricity on a large scale without drastic reductions in efficiency by using pumped storage plants. In order to accommodate the predicted doubling in the amount of electricity generated, this means that a corresponding increase in the number of storage plants is needed.

Only through joint efforts can we implement cross-border projects and achieve efficient and intelligent interconnections between local and regional energy sources and large energy grids. When implementing priority energy infrastructure projects we must maximise the efficiency of the EU funds. Furthermore, subsidies for energy infrastructure, research and development must be allocated on a geographical basis. In order to achieve EU energy and climate goals, we must set the priorities for the selection of projects of European interest. We must involve as broad a section of society as possible in the implementation of an energy infrastructure project from the first stage of its development, in order to spread information as widely as possible and exchange best practice.

      <p sl="el">I voted in favour of the own initiative report on energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond. The way in which we plan, develop, fund and operate our energy infrastructures and systems in Europe will determine our ability to reduce our energy dependency and thus to improve our energy security. The energy resources that the EU has at its disposal can be used as a driving force for growth in the European economy as a whole. The funding and implementation of energy infrastructures is of particular interest to the countries in Southern Europe, such as Greece, which have renewable energy sources, such as the sun, wind and sea. These sources can be used for the benefit of national growth. Furthermore, these countries can help to reduce Europe’s energy dependency.</p>

      <p sl="pt">On the 60th anniversary of the foundation of the European Coal and Steel Community, this report on energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond approves a series of measures aimed at creating an integrated European energy network. Europe is far from having reached the goal of a genuine internal energy market, but it is time for it to speak with one voice in setting joint short-, medium- and long-term energy policy objectives. This voice should be clearly audible and should make itself heard throughout the structure of the Union, for the benefit of the European public and EU businesses. I voted in favour of this report, which introduces very ambitious projects. However, I would warn that these projects are inconceivable without the determination and diligence of energy sector businesses, which must make every effort to implement them. Nothing can be achieved without the resolute involvement of the European institutions. Up to now, despite its laudable initiatives and sustained efforts, the EU’s common energy policy has lacked a resolutely ‘European’ impulse.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Since its inception, European energy policy has been a bulwark of the European project. Then as now, the Member States’ sustainability and energy interdependence make an essential contribution to the success of the Union. The intention is currently to find a guiding policy, which should involve strengthening, in general terms, the connections between the energy networks of the various Member States. It is important, for example, not just to support energy production, but also to encourage energy being shared and full use being made of it. In organisational terms, it is important to move towards the harmonisation of permits and authorisations for production, transportation and sale, which are different in each Member State. Finally, it is important to find substantial sources of funding that will enable the success of the project. That is the purpose of this report.</p>

      <p sl="es">We know that only through a network without internal bottlenecks that leaves behind the current situation of isolation of certain European regions will we be able to ensure the three pillars of our energy policy: competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply. However, a third of Member States have still not reached the 10% interconnection capacity objective we set in 1992. For that reason, we wish to reiterate the European Union's commitment in regard to this objective and, more importantly, to insist that it be monitored in the same way as the 20-20-20 targets: a reduction in greenhouse gases, increasing the use of renewables and improving energy efficiency. Also, therefore, the development of infrastructure considered to be of European interest cannot be solely dependent on the will of Member States nor must it solely be based on commercial criteria. The ten-year network development plan (TYNDP) is a small advance but after the first financial year last June we have observed that, in general, the European vision is missing. We ask that this bottom-up approach be complemented by a structured top-down approach that incorporates a European perspective.</p>

I voted for the report because it reiterates that, while responsibility for the planning and development of infrastructure projects lies mainly within the market, the EU has a role in promoting certain projects by awarding them the status of ‘project of European interest’ and in providing public financing to some of them, but it calls for a clear and transparent methodology leading to the selection of priority projects that meet pressing European needs. The report shows that, to justify projects being accorded priority, the following criteria should be taken into account: the project must have a European dimension, in other words clear EU public interest; its necessity must be demonstrated on the basis of the infrastructure hierarchy; it must be in line with climate energy efficiency and environmental objectives; it must be consistent with long-term EU energy policy (allowing flexible and multifunctional application and avoiding lock-in effects); it must offer a good cost-benefit ratio and cost efficiency; and finally, it must be technically sound.</p>

I am voting for this report because I understand that there is a need to set out an integrated European approach to new energy infrastructure that enables the development of common European systems, the reduction of disparities between energy supply and demand, the promotion of increased cooperation between Russia, Belarus and the Baltic States, and contribution to energy consumption that is more rational and sustainable. I should like to stress the importance attached to the ‘Intelligent Cities’ partnership for innovation, to the Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas (Jessica) and European Local Energy Assistance (ELENA) programmes, and to the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which will contribute to an 80-95% cut in EU greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In the regional context, the report contributes to eliminating socio-economic and environmental disparities between the various Member States, and enables the regions to launch projects for investing in a number of areas. I would also stress that the EU needs to pay particular attention to the outermost regions, whose integration with the European energy network will be difficult: the specific situation of the outermost regions’ energy systems should be included in the energy infrastructure priorities for 2020.</p>

We need to prevent the current financial and economic crisis from putting the development of social services of general interest at risk.

      <p sl="lt">The crisis has resulted in enormous economic and social costs, including economic stagnation, large increases in unemployment and poverty. Current Council and Commission policy is to emphasise fiscal consolidation - the restoration of the debt and budget deficit criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact. The debate about how to address these problems is also about how we save the European social model from fatal damage. The Treaty on European Union acknowledges that services of general economic interest (SGEI) are an intrinsic part of Europe’s social model and states clearly the responsibilities of Member States in the delivery of such services, while the European Charter of Fundamental Rights recognises the right of citizens to access SGEI. High quality universal services such as health, education and childcare, and essential network services such as transport, energy and telecommunications, ensure a healthy, active, and harmonious society. They are also essential for higher levels of labour market participation and for the development of a competitive social market economy. I agree with the report’s call for the Member States and the Commission to better coordinate their actions in this area and exchange good practice, promoting the further modernisation of social services of general interest (SSGI) in different Member States.

Creators of social cohesion, these services play a vital role as a shock absorber to cushion the effect of the crisis. While they remain mainly within the competence of the Member States, they often come up against the rules of the internal market, especially state aid rules. Because these rules appear inadequate and do not give enough recognition to the specific characteristics of these public services, we need to work pragmatically on revising them and on strengthening legal certainty. The challenge is to enable public service providers to fully carry out their mission of general interest. Yet the legal vacuum is filled by the Court of Justice, which is neither democratic nor creates legal certainty for the service providers.

This change of approach makes it even more important to encourage the creation of an economic and social context in which the need to develop one’s own identity and the response to the fundamental needs of daily life and future prospects are what drive public actions. In this context social services of general interest take on a bigger, different role in which the financial aspect, in terms of budget compatibility and medium- and long-term sustainability, play a important part, but only in the context of the primary objective of developing human beings and quality of life in a family, social, working and institutional sense.

High-quality universal services, such as health, education and childcare services, and basic network services, such as transport, energy supply and telecommunications, ensure a healthy, active, integrated and inclusive society, as well as being important for higher levels of participation in the labour market and for the development of a competitive social market economy. The public bodies involved in the provision of SSGIs, or granting the right to use them, need a clear legal basis for this area. Voluntary organisations and social economy enterprises that provide SSGIs and have few resources and limited management structures may get into financial difficulties again due to bureaucratic requirements. In my opinion, it would therefore be appropriate to propose and draw up a secure and flexible framework for SSGIs, using the instruments we have available, with the aim of ensuring that rules intended for the regulation of commercial enterprises support rather than hold back the social objectives of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The problem with the European Union is that the notion of public service is totally alien to it. For the European Union, services, the provision of which is commercial and can generate profit, should be subject to competition, preferably global competition. All sectors are potential candidates, even though some unprofitable segments can, and even must, be left in the care of the Member States and taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What the hell, companies exist to make a profit, not to promote solidarity. That is the general philosophy behind this text. Some exceptions, which are highly sensitive when it comes to preserving the good reputation of Brussels bureaucracy, have been made: financing some forms of transport, but solely to make up for their public service obligations; social security, even though people are convinced that private insurance companies would do better for their greatest benefit, and some others.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, although well intentioned the report by Mr De Rossa resembles a desperate attempt to salvage something from this situation. It is above all for the Member States to define public services, which are not subject to competition law, in line with the needs and traditions of each nation, and to decide how to organise and fund them. The Commission must take note of this.</p>

It is therefore imperative that a strong SSGI framework is provided on a European level. This would serve to support efforts to retain high standards, accessibility and affordability of such services for European citizens. In doing so however, it is important to keep in mind that SSGIs are constantly evolving and must therefore respond to new social, economic, political and technological developments. It is important that any changes in this field respect the competencies and responsibilities of Member States, as these services must be tailored to the needs of individual nations and their citizens. The relationship between Community law and its operation within the internal market, state aid, public procurement and services of general interest should be viewed against the social aims of the European Union and must therefore be properly analysed. The Commission should also provide a clear legal framework, especially in the current economic environment, and any information on the application of EU rules must ensure that services of general interest continue to be capable of fulfilling their purpose of guaranteeing a better quality of life for European citizens.</p>

I believe that it is necessary to examine how the Member States, when defining social services of general interest, can take account of gender-specific services, especially advisory and social services particularly designed for women and important services that contribute to women’s quality of life and equality, such as health services, particularly sexual and reproductive health services, education and the care of dependents. There is a need to promote innovations such as a Member State register of SSGI, a pilot scheme on care for the elderly, and action programmes based on the voluntary European Quality Framework. The working group should also consider how Member States can develop forms of home help including support for elderly and vulnerable persons, provided by both men and women, and reduce the negative impact on employment and pensions for those who take care of dependent family members.</p>

      <p sl="pt">One of the EU’s main objectives is to continuously improve its peoples’ living and working conditions, and their well-being. This objective can only be achieved through the sustainable development of a Europe based on balanced economic growth; on a highly competitive social market economy geared towards supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and aiming at full employment and social progress; on the protection and improvement of the environment; on combating social exclusion, discrimination and inequalities in access to health care; on promoting social justice and protection; on equality between women and men; on solidarity between generations; and on the protection of the rights of the child. Social services of general interest (SSGIs) are essential to realising these ambitious objectives. As a result, only the provision of universally available, high-quality, accessible and affordable SSGI, within the meaning of the 2007 Commission communication on SSGIs, can therefore be regarded as an essential pillar of the European social model, and as the basis for a good quality of life and for the achievement of EU employment, social and economic objectives.</p>

Social services of general interest, such as health services, care services for children, the elderly or other dependents, and other universally available services, are an essential part of the European social model. They play a key role in social cohesion and inclusion and in the realisation of the social rights recognised by the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, they are faced with a number of constraints and with legal uncertainty, as the application of EU rules on the functioning of the single market, on public procurement and on state aids impinges upon their normal operation. The European Court of Justice has been called upon to adjudicate on this tension. There is an overwhelming stakeholder consensus on the need for Commission action to address these problems. The weakening of SSGIs through austerity measures is a false economy, as demonstrated by their role as automatic stabilisers which cushioned the impact of the crisis for the most vulnerable members of European societies.

Therefore, things that were not long ago considered secure are now under threat, making it necessary to find new solutions in order to continue offering a development model supported by respect for human dignity. Irrespective of the solution found, there are some things that should be viewed as certain: SSGIs are of great economic significance; it should not just be national governments responsible for their provision, but also associations, companies with a social focus and even private enterprise; and it should be ensured that the process of setting out priorities in this area will involve the participation of various non-state entities, in order that the most suitable solutions can be found for the proposed goals to be achieved.</p>

Assistance for less affluent regions embodies the spirit of solidarity and is in the interest of the EU as a whole. Subsidising poorer areas makes it possible for them to develop more rapidly, for many new jobs to be created and for us to exit the crisis we are currently experiencing much more rapidly. Support for poor people will allow them to feel that they have not been rejected. This programme makes a significant contribution to the fight against poverty, and extending its budget would represent major progress in the fight against the crisis. Financial assistance for the most deprived allows them to gain more qualifications and helps them to find a way out of the unfortunate situation in which they currently find themselves. It motivates them to take further action and improve themselves. The universal services we are discussing here, such as education, health care, transport, energy and telecommunications, guarantee that EU society will be cohesive, healthy, well-educated and thus politically and professionally active, and they translate into a higher percentage of well-educated workers on the market, which in turn results in the growth of a competitive social market economy, making it possible to fight the crisis and subsequently to achieve economic growth.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report, because given the recent increase in poverty and social exclusion throughout the world, this is a good time to examine the EU’s development policy. Indeed, the EU’s development policy should aim at eliminating obstacles to development, such as the dumping of agricultural products, illegitimate debt burdens, capital flight and unfair trade, and at creating an international environment conducive to fighting poverty, guaranteeing decent incomes and livelihoods and to the fulfilment of basic human rights, including social and economic rights. There is also a need to tackle inequality, including gender inequality, because gender equality, women’s political and economic empowerment and women’s enjoyment of human rights are essential for poverty reduction and sustainable development. At the same time, it is important to raise public awareness of this and efforts must be made to improve the transparency of aid spending, enhance the dissemination of independent evaluation studies and impose stricter sanctions on those actors who have been found to be misappropriating development aid. Furthermore, it should be stressed that economic growth policies cannot succeed without the promotion of social and environmental standards and the implementation of social protection mechanisms.</p>

      <p sl="it">The confirmation of a modernised EU development policy must be supported, particularly at a time of crisis, as investments in poverty reduction and eradication could create significant advantages for the EU in terms of investments and new jobs. Therefore it is necessary to implement and increase the impact of development policies that aim to achieve the ambitious objective of poverty reduction, a key objective for EU external action.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this regard, efforts need to be concentrated on the concept of ‘democratic ownership’, a key approach that involves investments promoting good governance, greater democracy and human rights, and the fight against corruption. The development assistance process should see more active involvement on the part of the private sector, in particular of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are widespread and vital for sustainable development and for achieving the objectives that have been set.</p>

The report proposes making development cooperation policy more effective by analysing seven areas of activity: seven fundamental directions that I believe cover the areas key to the success of these policies. By way of example, I would stress the crucial importance given to human development by increasing support for basic social services like education and health. That is the only way they will earn Official Development Assistance (ODA), thus promoting real and sustained development. I would also stress the importance of private sector involvement as a means of creating new jobs and promoting the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

      <p sl="en">In order to boost the impact of EU development policy, the Commission has proposed three criteria for the selection of activities: (1) added value, (2) EU prior coordination, and (3) potential of leverage on reforms and/or other funding sources. Parliament has always called for better coordination, and therefore we can only support efforts to draw up strategic documents for individual EU countries. We should, however, support the Commission in all the efforts it makes to implement in full its coordinating role set out in the Treaty of Lisbon. Coordination and harmonisation should be improved from the perspective of accountability. The incorporation of the European Development Fund (EDF) into the EU budget would be a significant step towards achieving better coordination between EU development aid instruments. The focus on achieving a major impact must not lead to a cautious development policy concentrating only on the ‘easy countries’. Need must remain the key criterion. EU development aid should continue to be focused on the poorest countries and the poorest levels of society. In my opinion, a well-developed administration is essential for the positive impact of development, and the EU has considerable experience in supporting political reforms while implementing its aid programmes. Also important for this policy is an approach to administration which emphasises human rights, democracy and the rule of law, the fight against corruption and the role of parliaments and civil society in ensuring the accountability of governments and assessing the results of development.</p>

Faced with a financial crisis in Europe, it is all too tempting to decrease or even abandon our commitments. However, if we followed that path, we would only make the crisis worse. Today, we see ever increasing waves of economic migrants coming to Europe. They come because they cannot build a quality life for themselves in their countries of origin. Without development aid, this would only increase further. It is fully in our interest to help these nations to develop, as it means more trade with Europe, more sharing of information and greater mutual understanding.

Poverty affects people in many ways, and is closely linked to the problem of social exclusion, inter alia in terms of gender equality.

Almost one in four women in the EU live in poverty, most of whom are older women, single mothers, disabled women and women belonging to ethnic minorities. Another huge problem is violence against women, which is undoubtedly a factor that causes poverty due to its negative impact on health.

      <p sl="it">In order to enhance the impact of EU development policy, there needs to be improvement of coordination and harmonisation based on the principle of ownership, and an approach to governance based on the key concept of ‘democratic ownership’.

      <p sl="sv">Today, the European Parliament voted on the report on increasing the impact of EU development policy (2011/2047(INI)). The report is, to a large extent, a very good one and it puts forward a number of important principles with regard to the responsible utilisation of the Union’s aid funding. As a member of the Committee on Development and also a member of the same group as the author of the report, it would in fact have been natural for me to support the report and vote in favour of it in plenary. However, in my opinion an unfortunate compromise was made between the political groups in the vote in the Committee on Development and a reference to the introduction of a tax on financial transactions was inserted in paragraph 22. Since I am convinced that such a tax will harm development in the world rather than benefit it, I was unable to vote in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union says that ‘Union development cooperation policy shall have as its primary objective the reduction and, in the long term, the eradication of poverty’. I am voting for this report because I believe it is essential for the Union, in partnership with various local and regional actors, to identify the public’s problems, to set out development strategies and policies, to build social support networks, to promote economic growth that closely follows social and environmental standards, and to boost industrial development.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe it is important to set out a cooperation strategy that contributes to increasing the impact of aid, and to obtaining better results from sums invested. As such, I advocate incorporating the European Development Fund (EDF) into the EU budget, thus making it possible to improve coordination between the EU’s various financial instruments, as well as to make available EU technical support that will enable the Member States to implement the established projects quickly and efficiently. Finally, I should like to stress the importance of removing obstacles to development, and of encouraging public and private investment in any goods, infrastructure and services that enable inclusive growth and reduced social inequality.</p>

      <p sl="lt">It is important for the EU to review its vision, ambitions and appropriate instruments before deciding on the place that should be reserved for development aid in the upcoming multiannual financial framework (MFF). While helping others, we must not forget ourselves. The majority of the areas mentioned in the report – corruption, poverty, lack of good governance – equally need to be improved in Lithuania. In its latest annual report, Transparency International gave Lithuania five points out of ten for its efforts to combat corruption, ranking Lithuania 46th in the world, after Costa Rica, Puerto Rico and Botswana. Both in Lithuania and the developing world we must increase our efforts to reduce differences in income. Achieving this objective would strengthen the impact of EU aid and poverty would be addressed more efficiently. I agree with the rapporteur that the European Commission’s Green Paper on EU development policy devotes too little attention to poverty. Poverty is not simply an economic phenomenon, but also encompasses social, political and cultural deprivation. EU development aid must include this. Most importantly, EU development aid must be based on the values of human rights and democracy. It must also be transparent – a modern European development policy needs the understanding and involvement of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament has adopted a report on the impact of EU development policies by very narrow majorities (by just a few votes at times).</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are a number of positive points: the use of a financial transaction tax to achieve the target of 0.7% of gross national income (GNI), especially for development aid; the need to eliminate obstacles to development, such as dumping of agricultural products, illegitimate debt burden, capital flight and unfair trade; the need to address the root causes of food insecurity, including food-price speculation and ‘land grabbing’; the call to end seed monopolies; the need, in the fight against climate change, to start by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Europe by increasing targets in Member States rather than in developing countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">The objective of EU development aid is to reduce and, in the long term, eradicate poverty. In this context, values such as human rights, democracy, autonomy and partnership are important. EU development aid aims to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth and to provide basic social services and education. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), at least 20% must be earmarked for basic social services. The proposed growth strategy involves strengthening the private sector and small and medium-sized businesses. They will be supported using micro-finance which must be aimed in particular at disadvantaged groups, such as minorities, small farmers and women. The report calls for the poor to participate in economic growth rather than just being recipients of it. Other measures include promoting sustainable agriculture and investing in renewable energies, which have the potential to create new jobs and ensure sustainable development.</p>

      <p sl="en">The main aim of development aid should be to help people in underdeveloped regions to help themselves. The submitted report by Mr Kaczmarek analyses various aspects of European development policy very thoroughly and proposes solutions that will boost the effectiveness of the aid provided. Solidarity between people does not mean giving blindly. Those who give take on a great responsibility. On the one hand, there is the responsibility towards those who need the aid – development aid has a substantial impact on market relations, the rise of elites, the environment and culture in the recipient country. On the other hand, though, there is the responsibility of the EU towards its citizens for the resources provided. Governments do not give their own money, and neither does the Commission. This money comes from the public purse, and it is wealth generated by the people through their work. It is money they have entrusted to the state, and they expect it to be used carefully and sensibly. Mr Kaczmarek’s report is based precisely on this responsibility, and I also expect the same responsibility from those who implement the Union’s development policy.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the statement by the President of the Commission on the multiannual financial framework (2011/2751(RSP)).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This is one of the most important subjects we will deal with over the next few years, and it is an important subject for the future of the European Union. This is why we attach so much importance to this debate, and we are also grateful to the European Commission, and to the outgoing Hungarian Presidency, for including the European Parliament in the debate. We would like to thank President Barroso and the Commissioner for presenting proposals to us before they were presented to the press and the media, which they did on Wednesday evening, as we will all remember.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-568-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last Wednesday, the Commission adopted its proposals for the next multiannual financial framework, and I have the honour to present it, together with Mr Lewandowski, immediately at the Conference of Presidents.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While drafting these proposals, we benefited greatly from the high quality of your contributions, especially the excellent SURE report, for which I would like to thank you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European budget we are proposing for the 2014-2020 period is both ambitious and innovative, responsible and rigorous.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a budget which, in the current economic context, provides reasonable funding for our European policies, with increased funding for sectors of the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a budget which will cost the taxpayer no more than the current budget but which may make a huge difference for 500 million Europeans. How can we achieve this?</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all by focusing our spending on funding priorities that will enable us to work together to achieve our shared objectives, those of the Europe 2020 strategy. That is why the budget we are proposing is largely devoted to growth and employment. While it is true that, even today, in some of our countries there are quite demanding programmes, notably budget consolidation programmes, it is also true that we need to promote growth. Without growth, we will not be able to return to the path of prosperity. Let us not forget, therefore, that this budget, which is for 2014, is a budget that needs to increase growth and employment in Europe; it is a budget that must be a tool dedicated to the idea of growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We propose to increase the research and innovation budget allocation significantly – by 46% – and to strengthen programmes to promote education, training and European youth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to stimulate sustainable economic growth, we propose to link cohesion policy, which has a budget allocation of EUR 376 billion, more closely to the Europe 2020 strategy. It is necessary both to avoid dispersion and to develop a strong culture of European responsibility. All requests for European funds must be clearly linked to the attainment of our shared priority objectives. This is what I call ‘positive conditionality’. It will enable us to obtain the best possible value for money for every euro spent, since one and the same euro can and does have multiple impacts. Well invested, one and the same euro can strengthen economic and territorial cohesion, increase energy efficiency, contribute to combating climate change, and promote social objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, from the outset, I invited analysts not to look at the budget from the traditional perspective of examining budget allocations sector by sector, at times adopting an approach I would tend to describe as bureaucratic, but to see what can be done through interlinking the different policies, the reason being that, I repeat, a single euro can help us achieve several European objectives at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For this reason, the common agricultural policy (CAP), for example, whilst remaining the most important EU policy – and, I repeat, the CAP, which has been under so much attack, is still, in our proposal, the premier European policy – must also be able to contribute fully to other common priority objectives. We therefore propose that farmers also contribute to improving the ecological character of their farms. This is useful, of course, for attaining agricultural objectives, but it is also useful for attaining our environmental and climate policy objectives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is essential for the future of our children and grandchildren that we be more environmental-friendly and firmly committed to combating climate change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore propose to refocus policies in this area, and we want to increase the budget allocation devoted to it to at least 20% of total overall expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can also dramatically change the everyday life of our citizens by adapting our spending more effectively to needs, as and when they arise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am thinking in particular of countries both in the euro area and outside it benefiting from macroeconomic support programmes, which we can support in their budget consolidation efforts through a temporary increase in EU cofinancing, while the budget remains constant. I would emphasise that this aspect is very important. At times, analysts focus on the overall value, on what is entered in the budget. When all is said and done, what is important is investment that truly affects people, investment that truly benefits the poorest regions of Europe, and what can be improved by enhancing absorptive capacity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also thinking in particular of the poorest Europeans, of those who literally need our help to survive. To meet the needs in all circumstances of those who, without food aid, would go hungry, we propose, for the 2014-2020 period, to renew the programme for providing food to the poorest people, and we hope that the Council will finally approve the draft regulation, which has been on the table since 2008, so that this programme can be resumed as early as 2012.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, an effective EU budget, which is at the service of all Europeans, is a budget that provides real European added value, that is to say, a truly pan-European budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A pan-European approach means, in particular, funding at EU level what the Member States are unable to fund by themselves, and not only benefiting from all the synergy effects and scale effects but also avoiding unnecessary duplication. In some cases, savings can be made through spending at EU level. Therefore, all those who say, in a simplistic way, that spending more money on Europe violates the principle of economy, are simply wrong. Quite often, a euro spent at European level saves money at national level. As you know, one of our main proposals is the creation of a Connecting Europe Facility to fund integration projects in the transport, energy and information technology sectors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This will both improve access to the internal market and put an end to the isolation of certain economic enclaves. The proposed target amount for the new fund is EUR 40 billion, plus EUR 10 billion from the Cohesion Fund. We also provide for recourse to EU project bonds. As I promised you here, at a part-session, we think high leverage can be obtained through mobilising a certain amount of the EU budget linked to loans from the European Investment Bank, and even private funds, for certain medium and long-term projects, most of which will be profitable. This is one of the important innovations contained in our proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The budget we propose is also quite clearly a solidarity budget: solidarity with the Member States and the poorest regions and also solidarity in our efforts to tackle the challenges facing us, ranging from energy security to migration, as well as solidarity with third countries, particularly the poorest countries. It is important for Europe to make its voice heard in the world not only to defend its interests but also to promote its values, primarily respect for human dignity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we propose to increase the budget allocation devoted to external relations by EUR 70.2 billion, including EUR 20.6 billion for the financing instrument for development cooperation, so that we can deliver on our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals, particularly the eradication of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Solidarity also means solidarity of European institutions, which must contribute to the general European effort. We therefore propose not to increase administrative expenditure, which currently represents just 5.7% of the total EU budget. At the same time, we propose to make further changes to the staff regulations for the European Civil Service, which could generate savings of more than EUR 1 billion by 2020, while also ensuring its independence, competence and permanence. I want to emphasise this. We are making these proposals because we think that we, too, need to show solidarity with those who face greater challenges. However, we are not making these proposals because we think badly of the European Civil Service. On the contrary, I believe that the EU Administration is one of the best administrations in the world, and I believe that it is in our interest to maintain the level of prestige and independence of the European Civil Service.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This ambitious, innovative and unifying budget is also a responsible and realistic budget based on a rigorous approach. As you know, it is 1.11% of GDP in commitment appropriations. This includes both the part traditionally referred to as ‘financial perspectives’, amounting to 1.05% of EU GDP in commitments – with an expected 1% in payment appropriations – and 0.06% in appropriations devoted to reserves not only for unexpected expenditure for which the Union must, if need be, be prepared to intervene, but also to major projects that have seen major budgetary slippages, such as International Experimental Fusion Reactor (ITER) and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), and to integrating the European Development Fund already financed from direct contributions of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We propose to make savings in certain areas so that we can spend more on present and future priorities. As a result, while preserving the priority to be given to economic, social and territorial cohesion – because, as I often say, without cohesion there is no solidarity, and without solidarity there is no Union – and also while maintaining the role of the common agricultural policy (CAP), we will free up resources to fund new priorities, such as research and innovation, education and training, pan-European infrastructure, energy, migration and the neighbourhood policy. If Europe does not invest more in these sectors, we will not be up to the task of meeting our challenges. I believe that these sectors are essential, especially to ensure competitiveness in Europe in an increasingly demanding world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also want, in the spirit of the Treaty, a more autonomous, more transparent and more equitable budget. While the Member States want to pay less – a lot of Member States would prefer to pay less – what we want specifically is to reduce their contribution by increasing own resources, while keeping the budget constant. I promised you I would return with proposals for own resources, and that is what the Commission has done. It is this determination that is at the heart both of our proposals for new own resources – with a financial transactions tax and modernisation of the VAT resource – and of our proposals to reform the system of rebates and correction mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that the forthcoming debates will be very difficult. More than ever, it is essential that these debates be conducted in a truly European spirit so that, together, we can transform these proposals into an ambitious and realistic budget that is equal to the hopes of our citizens. I know that, in this endeavour, the Commission will be able to count on this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, President Barroso, it is very appropriate that a debate should take place on the multiannual financial framework during the first part-session of the European Parliament under the Polish Presidency, since this will be one of the most important, and maybe most challenging tasks facing the Polish Presidency and our trio, or in other words our colleagues from Denmark and Cyprus as well. I would like to note that the European Parliament will be a key partner during work on the multiannual financial framework. Parliament has stated its opinion. The Garriga Polledo report was adopted by a large majority of votes at the June part-session. At present, we are waiting for the Council to adopt a position.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Polish Presidency will devote the next six months to undertaking a very detailed analysis of the European Commission’s proposal. As we sometimes say, perhaps a little frivolously, it will be a ‘period of enlightenment’ in the debate on the multiannual financial framework, in terms of enlightening the various aspects of the European Commission’s proposal. The General Affairs Council will coordinate this work, and also the debate on own resources. The General Affairs Council will hold political and horizontal debates on the multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It goes without saying that the Treaty provides for the Council and Parliament to make every effort to reach an agreement on the shape of the multiannual financial framework, and the Polish Presidency, together with the European Commission, will endeavour to steer the process with this in mind. I would also like to say how happy I am that the Hungarian Presidency and our trio have agreed a way for the Council to collaborate with Parliament as regards cooperation on the MFF. Regular cooperation will take place under the General Affairs Council, and Parliament will be kept up-to-date on every debate that takes place within the latter.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to note that as a gesture of good will, and as a gesture of our openness to cooperation with Parliament, the Polish Presidency has invited representatives of the European Parliament to an informal meeting of the ministers of European affairs, which will take place in Poland towards the end of July. Finally, I would like to say that in addition to the political and technical procedure within the Council, in the autumn we will have the opportunity, together with the European Commission and the European Parliament, to organise a political conference dedicated to all aspects of the multiannual financial framework and an analysis of the Commission’s proposal, with the participation of the national parliaments and other stakeholders. We hope that this initiative by the Polish Presidency will help to increase the transparency and democratic visibility of the process of negotiations on the multiannual financial framework.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of Europe are asking for institutional unity and clarity in the European project. In a time of crisis the European Union must be the reference point of the future not a scapegoat for national guilt.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union’s fifth multiannual financial framework was born under the star sign of cooperation. Under the political impetus of the European Parliament, 14 of the 27 Commissioners have appeared before this House and the proposal is as a result of that broad collaboration. It incorporates most of Parliament’s objectives, policies and budgets.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, we regret that the 5% increase in the total resources requested by the honourable Members has not been taken up by the Commission. This practice of freezing financial resources is going to leave us a slim possibility of negotiating with the Council if it ultimately rejects the Commission’s proposal and reduces resources.</p>
      <p sl="es">At that stage the distance between Parliament’s and Council’s positions will become too great to reach an agreement. For this reason, we defended that 5% margin.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission has made an enormous effort to cover very ambitious expenditure targets with scant resources. We welcome the effort in cohesion, the new trans-European networks (T-ENTs), energy efficiency, immigration, own resources and research.</p>
      <p sl="es">We regret that the common agricultural policy is the only policy that loses in net terms in order that the rest of the Community policies gain. You must assuage the legitimate concerns of the honourable Members committed to agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="es">In general, however, the Barroso proposal is a commitment for a modern and innovative budget open to the involvement of the new financial instruments.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the debate which we are holding today is the start of a decisive argument about the future of the EU. Budgets reflect what politicians expect from a country or a confederation of countries or what they will allow a confederation like the EU to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission says that our approach is ambitious and bold. I want to emphasise this, even though, Mr Barroso, you naturally present the figures in a more favourable light than we see them in, and we will forgive you for this. Our positions are not far apart, but it is important to be clear about the figures. On average 1.12% of the gross domestic product of the Member States is currently available. According to your draft, the figure in future will be 1.05%. This does not sound like much. The fact is that our initial analyses show that you are freezing the budget on the basis of the current figure. We will have to come back to this, because the Member States that are on the other side from the Commission are expecting a significant increase in spending.</p>
      <p sl="de">You have mentioned several examples. There is not just the ITER nuclear fusion reactor, which I think is superfluous, GALILEO, the External Action Service and the development of democracies in North Africa that will be our partners in future. There are also many other tasks which have to be financed and with less money. The Commission proposal seems bold when we look at the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The attitude of the Member States and, in particular, the large net contributors is easy to describe: more European tasks with less money. That simply will not work. Therefore, the decisive issue will be whether we, the European institutions, can stand together, whether the Commission and Parliament, the two community institutions, can achieve solidarity in order to push through an ambitious, bold budget in the face of opposition from part of the European Council of Heads of State or Government.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, a call to Parliament itself: in this House we have many experienced and self-confident budget experts. So much became clear as we listened to Mr Garriga. They are all members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and, behind me, of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. We have just seen the little PPE group conference around the table. They are all highly qualified Members, but the situation is rather like a football game. A group of star players does not necessarily make up an effective winning team.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we need to do in Parliament is to come together and develop a common line which has a broad majority in this House. If our line is close to the Commission proposal, we will have achieved a high level of complementarity between our strategy and theirs. This high level of complementarity is necessary because there are governments like the Polish Government on the European Council. This is a bold, pro-European government which supports the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make one thing quite clear to you, Mr Dowgielewicz. Your speech here, despite being brief, has already shown that the Polish Presidency wants the European Union to be successful. We had a debate this morning in which the outgoing presidency gave a different impression. It is encouraging that you want to join us on this path.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are also governments like that of Mr Cameron who wants a different Europe with 0.8% of gross domestic product, while, of course, keeping the British rebate. He wants a large free-trade area with as few rules as possible, but no political union. This is not the sort of Europe that I want and I believe that the overwhelming majority of this House does not want it either. The question of whether or not this is what we will get depends on whether or not we can push through this ambitious, medium-term EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the Commission takes a bold approach and Parliament fulfils its role effectively, we can defend Europe on this issue and we will be the winners when it comes to the medium-term financial plan.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, at the beginning of his mandate Mr Barroso promised to put on the table a bold multiannual financial framework based on a system of own resources. That is also the reason, if you remember, that in 2009 that we supported his appointment, and he kept his word.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is very important that, for the first time in the last two decades, we have a consistent radical change in the budget, in which we are going back to the initial idea in the Treaty of Rome, which is to base the budget of the European Union on own resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second positive thing is that you also backed, as did the Polish Presidency, the idea of a European conference on the financing of the Union. That is an old idea of Mr Lamassoure’s. One year ago in 2010 – you remember, Mr Lamassoure – the idea was impossible. Today, if I heard the Polish Presidency correctly, it is becoming reality. It is also a very good thing that the European Parliament and the national parliaments will be involved.</p>
      <p sl="de">The most important thing is to do it. The main task is before us. We have a good proposal from the Commission. We have a Presidency that is willing to start a real debate on this, also involving the national parliaments. Now we have to face the biggest challenge, namely to convince public opinion that some of the arguments that are used against this proposal are completely wrong.</p>
      <p sl="de">Own resources do not mean more taxation for the citizens, on the contrary. Citizens will pay exactly the same. The only thing that is changing is that there will be a direct link between the citizen and the European Union so that the citizen can directly control the European Union. That is, in fact, a democratic advantage that we create with a system of own resources. It is not one penny or one pound more than they are paying but they have direct control over European expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second thing we have to explain is that, by making cuts to the European budget, you do not solve the problem of fiscal consolidation of the Member States because the total deficit of all Member States in the European Union today is EUR 800 billion. For example, if you cut the budget of the European Union by EUR 4 billion, because you say that you are blocking the increase in nominal terms, there is no increase in the Union’s financial resources. What you do is gain EUR 4 billion. So you are lowering the EUR 800 billion fiscal deficit to EUR 796 billion. But what the governments that are defending this do not say is that they will increase their expenditure on a number of issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is European cooperation that can gain money for the national Member States. Take the diplomatic service, for example: we have 93 000 diplomats in Europe and in the US there are 25 000. Take defence, for example: we have two million soldiers in Europe and there are 1.4 million soldiers in the US. Take monetary policy: there are 25 000 staff in Europe and 11 000 in the Federal Reserve Board in the US. This is, in fact, what is to be gained from a bold European budget. It can gain and it can cut money in the different Member States of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have an enormous amount of work to do to convince public opinion because some nation states have used wrong arguments against this proposal. I think we have to fully back the Commission proposal.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President of the Commission, I would like to endorse, in some way, but also correct, what Mr Verhofstadt said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First, as regards own resources, the point must be made that it is others who pay. If you introduce a tax on financial transactions, it is the large financial institutions that pay, and that also completely changes the situation for the citizens. I would like to give you an example that the former Director General of the Energy and Transport Directorate General of the European Commission, Mr Lamoureux, gave me a long time ago: to create own resources, 1% could be levied on all telephone and Internet transactions carried out in the European area, because the European area has enabled large telephone and Internet companies to make profits. If you take 1% of that, you get EUR 20, 30 or 40 billion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You can calculate what that gives in own resources. It is not just the citizens who are affected, therefore; resources are taken from the profits of large companies or banks and so on, because they benefit from the European Union. It is therefore only natural that they pay some sort of tax to the European Union. Here then is a new tax, which does not affect the average citizen but those who make a lot of profit, as we are now seeing. This is the truth of the matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, concerning your budget, Mr Barroso, I think it is a mistake to say that the EU budget should not be increased. It has to be increased. Baroness Ashton was right when she spoke of a major plan for Egypt and Tunisia and, when we see how things develop, I hope it will include Algeria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Syria. Therefore, if we aspire to a more democratic world, a more democratic planet, Europe will have to invest. It is not the Member States that will invest; it will be Europe. Whenever something good happens, the Member States will come to see Mr Barroso. Mr Barroso, you will have a successor one day, you will not always be here, but your successor will be here. As far as I am concerned, I will retire before you, and you will also have to act. I therefore think it is a mistake, today, to want to reduce the budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I would like to say that, between own resources and the budget, Mr Barroso, it is clear that own resources must make it possible to reduce national contributions, but not entirely: by a third, yes, but the other two-thirds must be used to increase the budget. I do not agree with own resources being used to reduce national contributions by 100%. Therefore, if you arrive at 60% of own resources, 20 % – a third – should go to the Member States, and the other two-thirds to the budget, which will automatically increase the budget of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that, with all the things we have to do for ecological transformation, for democratic transformation, and for the actions of the European Parliament, we need a budget in excess of the 1.05% you propose.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first of all say a word to Mr Verhofstadt. He talks about a PR campaign to convince people of the necessity of a rise in the budget. I think he wants to start on his own political family. The two largest components of his Group, the German Liberals and the British Liberal Democrats, are both part of governments – the last time I looked – that were calling for a freeze in the European budget. So perhaps he wants to talk to his own Group before he tries to convince the rest of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Listening to Mr Schulz, Mr Verhofstadt and others, it is sometimes hard to imagine that the supporters of the so-called European project actually want it to succeed because they seem to me, by their proposals, to be doing their very best to discredit the whole idea of the EU in public opinion. Because how can the EU justify a substantial, real increase in its budget of something like 5% to 7% at a time when every national exchequer across the whole of the EU is cutting back on their budgets?</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Verhofstadt, more Europe is not the answer to every one of our problems. The public have long since stopped believing that more Europe is the answer to all of our problems. In no country in Europe that I am aware of, do they want more Europe, Perhaps they want a better Europe, perhaps they want a more efficient Europe, but nowhere – not even in Belgium – are people calling for more Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">In none of our Member States are the public calling for more European taxes and, frankly, nobody believes you when you say that more European taxes will result in fewer contributions from Member States. People believe that they will be paying more money towards Europe and, frankly, with some of the speeches that you make, it comes as no surprise to any of us that that is what they believe.</p>
      <p sl="en">This MMF proposal is yet another wish list by a European elite that everyday becomes more and more distant from the concerns of ordinary people. And it is not just David Cameron calling for a budget freeze; the leader of the Netherlands, the leader of France and the leader of Germany are also calling for a budget freeze, Mr Verhofstadt. We believe that a freeze is the right way to go; it should have been proposed in the first place. That is the proper response of the European Union looking at times of austerity across the whole of Europe: to say to people that we share your pain, we realise that times are hard in public expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso, you should be looking for cuts, for reductions in the European budget and this should not be too hard to find. Your own Court of Auditors has refused to approve the EU’s accounts for the last 16 years in a row. A thousand of your civil servants earn more than the British Prime Minister.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso, there are plenty of opportunities for savings in the European budget. That is where you should be looking for cuts, rather than coming back to Member States and asking for more austerity to pay for higher public spending.</p>

Contrary to what you are saying here, the French Government has reacted positively to this completely radical change to the budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the time is right for you to tell the truth to your own people. You do not want to give power to your citizens.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Dr Barroso, we are discussing the multiannual financial framework for the period 2014-2020 in the very week when the rating agencies have called into question the second financial bailout plan for Greece, following the resounding failure of the first.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is something odd about this. I have my doubts as to whether we are really learning the lessons we should be from the situation in which Europe finds itself; the situation through which we are struggling. Just as there is no chance of any bailout succeeding without mentioning European public debt, without Eurobonds, I also cannot see how it might be possible for the euro to exist without a robust budget; a demanding budget.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is the lesson that I do not think anyone is learning. Therefore, Mr Callanan, my first observation is that the Commission proposal does not go far enough: it is a proposal to freeze the European budget in real terms. That is what we are talking about, in fact: 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) to the European budget, the freezing of the European budget in the medium and long term. This, then, raises a fundamental problem: either we do not do what needs to be done with the European budget, or we will multiply the financial mechanisms and instruments outside the budget to do what is necessary. However, we will then have a real problem of democratic control, of democracy, in this Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My second observation relates to financial transactions. I welcome the fact that the Commission has changed its position. For years, social movements and the political left have been arguing that there was a need for a European financial transactions tax, in the face of silence and even cynicism. The European Union, and Dr Barroso in particular, has always said either no or, later, that it needed to be at global level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I clearly welcome the change of opinion, but we need to understand each other. I should really like to know why he has changed his mind, because this question is important for one simple reason: I need to know if it is a new conviction, if it is strong and if it will convince the governments that do not want it, because there is a need for unanimity on fiscal matters in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My third observation relates to spending. There is an important proposal to increase spending on scientific research and innovation. However, the volume of funding is less important than where it goes. I shall give an example that also says something about the social issue in Europe: one in four Europeans has or will have cancer. At the moment, 90% of people who die of cancer in Europe die of metastasis, but the bulk of funding for cancer research does not go on metastasis, it goes on primary cancers. More than 90%! It is, therefore, a problem of quality – I am concluding, Mr President – it is problem of quality that is before us and it is a problem of social commitment, and that is the main limitation of the proposal you have presented to us, in my opinion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, to the amazement of Europe’s citizens, suffering austerity at home, the Commission has come up with an effective increase of 11% in the long-term budget. Moreover, the proposal has been presented in a misleading manner, in which at least half of the increase is disguised by keeping it out of the budget lines, as is the case with ITER or the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, for example.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 5% average under-spend from the EU budget year after year is reason enough to doubt that the Commission is asking taxpayers to fund real needs. This time, in addition, the Commission’s proposal lacks transparency and definitely cannot be relied upon. The present multiannual financial framework was supposed to support the Lisbon strategy, which would make Europe the most competitive economy in the world, and look where we are. The one being proposed for the 2014-2020 period is based on the 2020 strategy that will supposedly take us out of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is anybody seriously able to believe this? Ah, but this time the EU is proposing to tax us out of the crisis. Indeed, they will burden Europeans with yet more taxes, even if they try to convince the public that they are only making the naughty banks pay. Far from allowing citizens tight control over the EU budget, as Mr Verhofstadt recently said, this tax will reduce control over, and room for negotiation on, how EU funds are being spent. Member State governments must not allow this to happen.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it seems to me that one of the basic requirements for a European Commissioner responsible for the budget should be that he can count. Mr Lewandowski claims that the multiannual budget will increase by 5%, but that is not the case. It is much more if we include all the items that he is keeping out of the budget thanks to accounting trickery. The sum in question is many millions of euros.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Dutch government, together with a number of other sensible and prudent Member States, has thus sought to have the multiannual budget frozen. We have not yet reached agreement about real savings, but simply about freezing a budget that, after all, is all too large already. Even that, however, is too much to ask. Mr Lewandowski labels the democratically elected Members of this House from the Danish People’s Party, the thrifty Britons, the True Finns and the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) arrogant. That is another new term to go alongside the label of ‘populist’ that Mr Barroso uses.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Lewandowski is seeking money in the budget to counteract the destruction of important EU achievements. Well, those achievements are simply not out there. What there is, is a single hotchpotch of failed, overpriced, crazy projects that exhibit no added value whatsoever and only serve to satisfy a European elite surrounding it. Fortunately, the citizens are seeing through this more and more, as they do not allow themselves to be brushed aside as ‘populist’ or ‘arrogant’, Mr Lewandowski. You see, a true democrat knows where his or her vote is in good hands and who is really arrogant and who is not.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current Commission proposal lies somewhere between the letter from the five Heads of State or Government and the very moderate, responsible proposals in the report by Mr Garriga which we adopted here in Parliament four weeks ago with a large majority. In this respect, the Commission proposal with all its different facets is quite clever, even if it does not entirely reflect Parliament’s priorities. We will have to do a lot of calculating and comparing.</p>
      <p sl="de">I must also say that the figures presented by the Commission, which involve doubling the outsourcing of funds and special projects, are extremely questionable. We have to ask where the payments are actually coming from. Are these unused payments from within the financial framework or are we applying the intergovernmental method, which is definitely inadvisable? At the same time, the proposal holds up a mirror to the Member States, because they want to refuse certain funding and, therefore, they are automatically putting at risk specific projects which bring European added value.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order to highlight the synergy effects between the national budgets and the European budget, it is, of course, important to say that there is a margin in the administration costs. External, security, neighbourhood and development policy are all underfunded in the proposal, but nevertheless the Heads of State or Government said at the last summit: we stand by our commitments to the Millennium Development Goals, although we know that you do not want or intend to keep to them. This does not add up.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that refusing to hold an open, unprejudiced debate on own resources goes against the spirit and the wording of the Treaty. That is how simple it is, ladies and gentlemen. The Commission is taking a very sensible approach to the commitments in the Treaty to show European solidarity and to the flagship projects of the Europe 2020 strategy, with the aim of generating more growth. Now it is a question of turning what you, and by this I mean the Polish Presidency, have promised us into reality. It is clear that we must work together on the assent procedure for the multiannual financial framework, so that we can say yes at the end of the procedure and so that we do not present the European public with a negative response. It is up to the Council and the Commission whether they take seriously the opportunity to work more sensibly and more effectively together with Parliament than they have done in the past.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Dowgielewicz, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is now receiving a great deal of criticism from a number of Member States, and of course from a lot of media and certain political forces for having tabled a far too ambitious, far too expensive and far too extensive proposal for a financial framework. However, we cannot lay down a framework that is to apply right up until 2020 based on the extreme austerity hysteria that is prevalent in Europe today. That would be totally unreasonable. I therefore do not agree with the criticism.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Allow me to be cautiously optimistic on a number of points. I think it is good that the Commission is proposing that we spend more on research and development and strengthen innovation and training and that there are proposals for more money for infrastructure. These are precisely the investments that we have called for. We can discuss the scope of agricultural policy, but the approach taken has now become greener and fairer. This is also a step in the right direction. With regard to our own resources, this proposal is of course fairer, more direct and a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am also cautiously optimistic with regard to the regulations. They bring greater flexibility, at least an attempt at simplification, more conditionality and strategic guidelines that provide better guidance. That is therefore rather good.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am nevertheless very concerned for the future, because we risk ending up in a kind of worst case scenario, with certain Member States demanding cuts to, or freezing of, the budget. Other Member States will fight to preserve agricultural policy and the structural funds, and then there will be no money left for research and development and investment in infrastructure. This is a worst case scenario that we must all help to prevent. I therefore welcome the constructive attitude of the Polish Presidency. I hope that we will be able to convince the future presidencies and the majority of the Council not to tear up this proposal, which would result in an agreement that would indeed be a worst case scenario. Let us – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – now help to build on the positive elements of the proposal so that we can look to the future up to 2020 with a certain amount of optimism.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would, firstly, like to thank the Commission. I think that the proposal demonstrates a new way of thinking and brings a great many of the kinds of changes that we really do need. The positive aspects are, first and foremost, our own resources, which our group leader has already spoken about, and then there are the benefits that Mr Färm just mentioned: research and development, infrastructure, and so on. These are extremely good. At the same time, I believe that it is important to also be able to give an explanation for the items for which we are actually trying to reprioritise European resources, in other words it must be a question of quality when it comes to spending money. Here, we are nevertheless asking for more money, so it is important to be able to explain that we are also reprioritising. In this case, some communication would be a good idea. It may be the case that we in Parliament, together with the Council, could also have reason to review some of our items of expenditure. We must remember that every year we pay back quite a lot of money to the Member States, which we could perhaps avoid and instead reprioritise funds for the future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would also like to say that the practice of removing certain items from the budget is not necessarily a good one. One fellow Member said that the draft budget is increasing by 11%. It is not, of course, but in various sections of the media in different countries, various different ideas of how large an increase the Commission is actually proposing have emerged. Here the Commission can look at itself in the mirror, because the proposal is undeniably very complicated. If we take items out of the budget in this way, we should consider how we should communicate this in future. Overall, however, the proposal represents a good start. My thanks to the Commission.</p>

The fact that there will be zero growth in the administration and in staffing levels shows that the Commission has understood what difficult times we are in. However, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are critical of the fact that many of the planned areas of spending are still not sustainable or environmentally friendly enough. We also need a much more decisive approach to the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to emphasise once again that the question of own resources means that we are returning to the basic principles of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. We will not only be receiving a percentage of the Member States’ gross domestic product, but we will also have our own resources. This gives us a decisive advantage. The financial transaction tax is more democratic and more transparent and it does not involve additional taxes for European citizens. However, it guarantees something that the majority of European citizens definitely want, which is the appropriate involvement of the financial markets. The tax will also help to regulate the financial markets. Proposing to siphon off this money is a very clever move.</p>

The overall budget should be pinned down at 1% of EU GDI. That is fair, reasonable and realistic.</p>

They are all in the governments that are against this. And they are still in the governments, Mr Schulz. Mr Verhofstadt, although he ran away and is now absent, talked about democratic rights originating from taxation. Well Belgium has the highest taxation level in the European Union and I do not have the impression that citizens in Belgium feel democratically empowered by this.

      <p sl="sk">The introduction of European taxes appears to me a more problematic proposal. The European Union was created by the Member States as an institution to which the associated states entrusted the exercise of some of their own powers, in the belief that these powers would be exercised more effectively and in a more coordinated manner by these institutions. The Member States therefore give the European Union the necessary financial resources from their budgets for the exercise of these powers. By monitoring the allocated funds, the Member States also regulate the activities of the European Union, and I therefore understand those Member State governments that want to retain this mechanism for supervising the activities of EU institutions. I therefore think, Mr Barroso, that it is necessary to consider whether we will further irritate the founders of the EU with such proposals.</p>

A large majority of this House will support the proposals on own resources.</p>

      <p sl="de">In the draft, the Commission constantly refers to several possible sources for EU own resources. The question is what other types are being considered in addition to a financial transaction tax. These should ideally be resources which, alongside their original purpose, also support other objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy. In this context, I am calling on the Commission to follow up the idea of a carbon tax, even if this is a difficult subject for everyone in political terms.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the positions of the Commission and Parliament are not the same. However, I believe that they are sufficiently close to provide a solid basis for negotiations with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The best aspects must be taken from both proposals, with budget growth being taken primarily from Parliament’s proposal.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Commission’s proposal confirms how important Europe’s agricultural and cohesion policies are. Abandoning historical criteria and introducing a convergence mechanism for direct payments is a fair proposal. However, I think that a quicker pace should be adopted so that Member States reclaim two thirds at the end of the period, and not a third of the difference between 90% of the European average and the situation at the reference point.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The contract notion within the cohesion policy should also be implemented in other European policies to bring about sustained efforts from Member States in spending the allocated funds. The proposal to increase the cofinancing rate for Member States receiving financial assistance may help achieve financial stability. The current TEN policy has proved its European added value and I believe that we must find how to increase the allocated funds.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Support must be given to the introduction of the own resources system. Likewise, Parliament’s proposal to carry over unused amounts to the following year must also be supported. At the moment, we have approved the return of EUR 4.5 billion to Member States. I think that it was much more efficient for us to keep these funds in the Union budget and use them as part of the 2011 budget.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Creating extra-budgetary lines is excellent. I believe that Parliament’s proposal for greater flexibility within and between budgetary chapters is also an equally good idea.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Dowgielewicz, the Commission’s legislative proposal has been described by Mr Barroso as ambitious, but realistic and sensible. Having listened to the dismissive and highly critical reactions from various capital cities in our wonderful European Union, it would be easy to believe this. However, if you read the proposal, which is what Parliament does, unlike many areas of government and the large majority of journalists, you get the very clear impression that the time when the Commission was regarded as the engine of European integration and development is finally over. The Commission has failed to meet Parliament’s expectations with regard to the structure of the budget, levels of spending and the extent of the reform of the own resources system.</p>
      <p sl="de">To give one example of revenues, Parliament has said that we want our budget to be based entirely on own resources as laid down in the Treaty. Therefore, we aim to replace the transfers from the Member States completely. At the same time, we want to bring an end to all rebates. What does the Commission do? It proposes replacing less than half of the Member States’ contributions with real own resources and no longer calculating the rebates, but simply applying a flat rate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Well, my goodness! It would have been better if we had at least reached this point only as the result of long negotiations between Parliament and the Council, as a compromise achieved, as far as I am concerned, with the help of the Commission. We in Parliament had hoped that the Commission, as the champion of a Europe-centric policymaking approach, would be on our side during the negotiations with the Council, but now we are anticipating the inevitable discussions with very mixed feelings.</p>

It meets the challenge of the next few years by ensuring economic growth, while at the same time making a definite shift away from our dependency on fossil fuels.</p>
      <p sl="da">Without changing the budgetary framework, the Commission has found the resources for a significant investment in research and education and in energy and transport networks, and that should arouse enthusiasm, also in my country, Denmark, where a linking up of electricity networks across borders will make wind power more profitable, and where we would like to see a large EU subsidy for the Femern Belt connection that is to be built precisely during this forthcoming period 2014-2020.</p>
      <p sl="da">The money has been found by cutting direct agricultural aid – modest cuts that nevertheless mean that the new Member States can receive more, and the historically determined aid for the old Member States is reduced slightly. I am pleased that the Commission is also opening up the debate on new own resources and is proposing that we stop the rebates. I come from a country that pays dearly for other countries’ rebates – so dearly that we are now coming and asking for a rebate ourselves – and therefore I think it is high time that we were given new own resources. We need a fairer, simpler and more transparent system for our own resources, so I would like to say thank you for the proposal and I hope that this is what we end up with.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, as soon as we consider the multiannual financial framework, it seems that everyone holds a discussion about the level of the budget. It is a kind of national hobby that all we do is look at ‘how much’ it costs. What kind of small-minded mentality is that? The mentality seems to be spreading from the Netherlands throughout Europe, and I find that completely incomprehensible. We must now discuss the content of the budget. If we are to be discussing the level of the budget, though, I have one simple figure to add: the Dutch government is going to increase its national budget by 10% over the next four years. If we are going to discuss money, then, we should discuss this, too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">No, we must now discuss the content of the budget. What do we want to achieve with this budget? The Commission then comes out and says that 30% greening is to take place. What exactly does that mean, however? The first pillar of agriculture has to be ‘greened’. What exactly do we mean by that? When it comes to the energy infrastructure, again we come up against the issue of greening. 30% is not greening, however. If you really want to make energy infrastructure more sustainable, you have to invest much more money in order to ensure that the priorities are energy saving and sustainable energy. Will the Commission do that?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I turn to the issue of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), which you are now leaving out of the budget. Does that mean, however, that no more extra EU money will go to this project? I would like Mr Barroso to answer that question for me.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso, you chose to ignore the advice of five Heads of Government to freeze the budget, and you have declined to take those tough spending choices. You could have started by looking to impose the kind of austerity that every other national government is having to introduce at this time. You could have looked to cut waste. You could have been prepared to reassess and reform traditional priorities such as the common agricultural policy, and you might even have shown a willingness to tackle the issues raised by the Court of Auditors. You could have, but you did not. Instead, you are asking for a bigger budget and more tax-raising powers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso, your instincts are right, but your actions are wrong.

My country, the United Kingdom, is a large net contributor and in my view should withdraw from the EU altogether.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, in the meanwhile we are being told that we must relinquish what remains of our rebate and make an even larger net contribution. This will be to finance regional policy that should be carried out by Member States which know best how to spend their own money; to carry out unnecessary social engineering with their absurd politically correct social targets; to put sticking plasters over the fragmentation of our national societies caused by third world immigration experiments; to pay for propaganda in Member States and candidate states to carry out the impossible task of making the EU even less repellent; to provide bribes to so-called neighbourhood countries to seduce them into the web of EU membership; and lastly the ludicrous claim that the new budget will strengthen the management of our borders and tackle serious crime and terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would do so only if the EU had the will to stop what Mr Berlusconi has called the human tsunami into Europe.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let the first word be that of praise. The Commission, between the devil and the deep blue sea, tried to harmonise and managed to harmonise with success the financing requirements of the common European goals supported by the European Parliament and the fiscal consolidation objectives of Member States. Please allow me to highlight a few elements that already sound good at first hearing. As opposed to some fellow Members, I am glad that agricultural aid and cohesion will remain the two most important items of the EU budget. I am glad that more assistance will be provided for small size enterprises, research, and cross-border cooperation. I am glad that reimbursement systems will be simplified and will be partly withdrawn. I consider it a step in the right direction that the Commission was brave enough to start reforms on the income side of the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, I am not glad to see that internal proportions shifted in the wrong direction within the cohesion policy. The proportion of assistance given to convergence regions will decrease significantly in favour of the more developed regions. Lowering the upper limit of cohesion funds will create a serious problem for many Member States. As the more developed states are not affected, this change is made at the expense of the less developed states. The Commission’s proposal does not deal in sufficient depth with cities and the problems of capital cities. The amount of agricultural aid will decrease substantially, although the details have not been revealed yet. There is a danger here: in the case of acquis where Parliament has the right of agreement in the course of the adoption process, there cannot be any items requiring a codecision procedure. Finally, ladies and gentlement, everyone is talking about the crisis. Please look at the next seven years. Are we going to suffer from the crisis for seven years? We will come out of the crisis. Do not assess the opportunities of the next period based on today’s or last year’s problems.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commission President, Commissioner, I believe that you have lost a magnificent opportunity to make a good financial perspective proposal. I do not think that it is an ambitious proposal. The Commission has the right and the duty of initiative and I sincerely believe that you have not taken the opportunity to propose what the European Union really needs. You have not done your duty. This proposal gives me the impression that it is more the result of negotiation than principle and the will of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the level of funding, the truth is that I cannot see these 9% and 11% increases. I do not know how you are making these calculations. You have simply taken some of the money from the common agricultural policy or the cohesion fund and distributed it to other programmes. However, there is no increase in funding whatsoever. We are faced with a financial framework freeze. Therefore, it saddens me that in your speech, in which I largely share the idea of the European Union and of where we have to put the emphasis, when we get to the data and figures the words do not match the numbers.</p>
      <p sl="es">I can give you some examples. It gives the impression that the allocation for the Eighth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is going up by 30%. One could say that it is a very big increase but, of course, if we take into account the level we are coming from and if we compared it, for example, with the proposal that you made for the previous financial perspectives then that 30% has vanished.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, if there is one positive part in this entire proposal it is the part to do with own resources. At last we have an own resources proposal that includes the initiatives of this Parliament. It is good that you want to amend Value Added Tax (VAT) and it is very good that, at last, you are proposing a financial transaction tax. Although the proposal is missing the details, which we will firm up in autumn, it is a good step forward.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, once more, it is a job half done as this is going to be a very long-term debate and, with the proposal put to us, we only managed to reduce the contribution of Member States from 75% to 40%, thus we did not achieve the objectives we had set ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="fr">On the expenditure side, the proposed increase is more or less what Parliament recommended; I will not go back over what our rapporteurs said. On the revenue side, a historic milestone has been passed. Parliament has been calling for this for four years. It has now been done. Proposals for new own resources are now on the table. The infernal logic of a fair return is finally being challenged and no government can brush aside the practical proposals being put forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All national contributions will be reduced; the allocation of one percentage point of VAT had been accepted, even by Mrs Thatcher in the 1980s, and, quite recently, the study of a financial transactions tax was unanimously requested by the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the first time, therefore, a debate will open both on budget expenditure and on budget revenue. It is essential that this debate should be as wide-ranging, open and democratic as possible.

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, first and foremost, I want to congratulate the Commission for the proposal it has tabled, especially for its efforts in seeking further efficiency and more European added value for the European budget. At the same time, I would like to say how deeply disappointed I am that the Commission is suggesting that all these ambitious targets will be achieved with the smallest ever European Union budget in relation to Member States’ economies.</p>
      <p sl="bg">What is very important is for us to seek a solution in the negotiations starting later on between Parliament and the Council to several important issues which are presented in the Commission’s proposal and which will determine how far what President Barroso also mentioned a short time ago will happen. This is providing support to the regions which need to catch up so as to create a more homogeneous and heterogeneous European economy.</p>
      <p sl="bg">What are just some of these issues which we still do not see any solutions to in the Commission’s proposal? You are introducing the conditionality principle for EU expenditure. However, it is not made clear how it will come about that this conditionality will not be a mechanical process, but will be relevant to the specific resources offered by national economies when agreements are concluded between Member States and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Secondly, you suggest a connection between cohesion expenditure and economic governance. We must say right now that this approach may create some risks likely to make the problems worse, especially for countries experiencing problems with macro-economic management and which will be punished further by having EU funds taken away.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Thirdly, there is the issue of allocating 30% of expenditure to agricultural policy for environmental purposes. One target and one percentage, which I fully support. However, how will these funds actually be linked to Member States’ resources? How flexible are you envisaging that the budget will be? How will the review be conducted in the middle of the mandate? How will the resources be found for all the items which fall outside the European Union budget, as well as for the European Stability Mechanism, which significantly adds extra-budgetary costs?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Mr Barroso, Commissioner, the Commission has indeed kept its word and, as this House’s rapporteur for own resources, I am absolutely delighted that that is the case in respect of the promise to review the system of own resources. It has proposed a new basic act for own resources that returns to what always was the basis in the Treaty, namely that the budget must be fully funded by own resources. This path was moved away from, with the effect that the European dimension of the budget was actually completely lost, replaced by a discussion based on the concept of everyone wanting ‘their money back’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Commission proposal reverts to own resources making up a 60% proportion. At the same time, a drastic simplification and greater transparency of the funding system are to be adopted. The proposed own resources – and this is very important – strengthen European policy and, more specifically, the functioning of the internal market. It is, however, important to reiterate, as the Commission and Parliament have relentlessly stated, that the own resources are not there to inflate the budget. The purpose is to ensure proper funding that emphasises the European dimension of the budget, including in the way in which the funds are collected. Given that such own resources also make it possible to reduce the contributions from the Member States, it is also a way to contribute to their budgets.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The fact that the Commission has cast its proposals into a draft decision and demand means that the Council cannot ignore it. We are counting on the fact that – as the Presidency has promised – this will be discussed thoroughly with Parliament and that the idea of doing this together with the national parliaments will be adhered to. It must also remain an indivisible proposal, tied to a multiannual financial framework, and we must avoid the situation whereby bits of it are singled out. It is a single whole – the Commission has called it ‘three proposals, one act’, and that is how it must remain.</p>

      <p sl="en">For the 2014-20 multiannual financial framework, this means a focus on investment. Looking at the Commission’s proposal from this perspective, I see that it generates new space for future-oriented policies investing in growth based on advances in knowledge, innovation, resource efficiency and skills. At the same time it proposes to modernise existing policy instruments and harness them more effectively to achieve the EU 2020 objectives. It offers tools and ways to achieve growth, jobs and competitiveness, while striking a politically sensitive balance between new policy tools and the modernisation of existing tried and tested instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a second reason why I consider this proposal a good basis for our negotiations. While being forward-looking, it is built on objective rules and principles and offers transparency, equity and efficiency as well as public visibility of joint European action.

The document allows us to meet the requests advanced by the European Parliament in the report by Mr Garriga Polledo on a series of important issues, such as innovation, development, small and medium-sized enterprises, renewable energies and own resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, in my view, there remains much to be done with regard to certain equally important issues, such as the amount allocated to funding the common agricultural policy (CAP). I would argue that the Commission’s proposal in this regard should be improved, as it is not fully in line with what is being requested by a large majority of this Parliament. A general increase in resources is necessary if only to retain current levels of funding of the common policy par excellence, agricultural policy. It is precisely with reference to the CAP that, at 2011 prices, the Commission’s proposal represents a cut that is difficult to quantify, but is still a cut.</p>
      <p sl="it">I do not believe that this fact can be acceptable to Parliament, and therefore I believe that in the next round of negotiation it will be necessary to work on reaching an acceptable agreement with the other institutions that will allow Europe to emerge from the crisis and achieve its objective of intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth, as required under the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="el">The Union budget is the main mechanism for activating solidarity between the Member States. Thus, this multiannual financial framework, as proposed by the European Parliament, with objectives endorsed by the European Commission, cannot but be the real European added value that will make Europe efficient.</p>

It is an excellent starting point to which Parliament has already contributed. I hope that the Community method will become the method of governance once and for all. Therefore, all policies, all European projects, should be included in the Union budget. Projects like ITER or Galileo, for example, or funds like the European Development Fund (EDF) should be included in this budget. In order for the next multiannual financial framework (MFF) to be effective and resilient, it is important that transparency, simplicity and flexibility be the watchwords.</p>

That is not what we should do, however: we now need to have courage. Now we need more Europe, and now we need added value for the euro. The best way for that to happen is for us to invest in research and innovation, and, above all, in new forms of energy. In this way we will achieve growth and employment, which we obviously need most.</p>

Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has, at long last, submitted a proposal for own resources on a large scale and for a financial transaction tax which I supported, when I was a member of the Austrian National Assembly, along with many other people. Finally, we have this proposal. I hope that you will succeed in getting this approved by the Council so that this haggling over every cent with the Member States can at last come to an end, so that the European Union will actually have more own resources to make the necessary investments and so that we will not always have to wait to see whether the Member States say yes.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, this debate on the future has started badly. The proposal tabled is for continuity. It does not take into account the profound social inequalities or the increasing divergence between the various Member States. It is a proposal that reflects a financial framework for a Union that is increasingly operating on the basis of the ‘every man for himself’ principle that the more powerful and developed countries are imposing on the Member States whose economies are more fragile, which have very serious economic and social problems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, as well as ignoring the crisis being experienced in the euro area and its consequences for unemployment and poverty, as failing to make clear proposals for a genuine cohesion policy, and as not putting forward essential ways and funding to support production and jobs with rights, it forgets the need to significantly increase support for development and cooperation. We therefore call for another general budget that guarantees minimum incomes, quality public services and the eradication of poverty, that respects and supports those who work, and that promotes genuinely equal rights and opportunities, and social progress.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it was the Greek philosopher Democritus who said, ‘it is greed to do all the talking but not to want to listen at all’. These words came to mind when I heard President Barroso state, in relation to the EU budget, that ‘it would be the greatest surprise of my life if Member States starting supporting me. If they did, I would be worried I was doing something wrong’. Surely in these words Mr Barroso sums up what is wrong with the Commission. Undemocratic, unaccountable, out-of-touch and, most worryingly of all, it does not care. It is consumed by greed not just for money but for talking.</p>
      <p sl="en">The MFF has many flaws. It is unjustifiable that any increases be proposed at this time of austerity across Member States. UK contributions to the EU are to rise by EUR 1.5 billion a year at a time when our hospitals are understaffed, our schools are closing and pensions are being sacrificed. The City of London, our financial capital, is being attacked and undermined through financial taxes. Mr Cameron, it is important that you continue to veto such a proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to thank the honourable Members for their comments. Today’s debate has once more demonstrated that the European Parliament is a good place to discuss serious European matters from the European perspective – a truly European perspective – and this is a fundamental debate because the budget is a vision in figures. Without figures it could just be about empty declarations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given the context of today’s Europe, the strategic choice of the Commission and the puzzle to be solved was how to respond to more Europe – the Treaty of Lisbon is about more Europe – with more or less the same amount of money to defend a real constant volume, to be taken seriously, and to put on the table a proposal which is taken as a solid basis for negotiations with both the Council and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say to Mr Callanan, Ms Andreasen, Mr Hartong, Mr Brons, Mr Ashworth – already missing – and also Ms Dodds, all of them from countries whose national budgets are growing this year, and where projects for the next year are also growing – that the multiannual financial perspective is about the ceilings, limits on expenditure. This is the essence of a multiannual perspective. We are of course placing some reserves, some potential expenditure, outside because this is about reserves and flexibility. It is wise to be ready in case, and this is that section of the budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">It should be acknowledged that apart from the positive priorities in this budget – positives are increasing research to EUR 80 billion, external relations increasing to EUR 70 billion – this time we had an exercise in negative priorities, including major efforts to restrain administrative costs. It should also be acknowledged that so-called traditional policies are being modernised, as seen in the greening of direct payments, conditionality in cohesion, the shift towards the poor in cohesion, but also a convergence, a delicate convergence of direct payments done in such a way that we could afford increases of more than 50% for those with the lowest direct payments, but the most extreme cost for those who are financing this increase is only 7%.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now turning to Lásló Surján: with our proposal the four poorest countries in Europe should have transfers from the European budget of up to 4 % of GDP. This is quite a lot. I would say that this is the limit of what we can afford.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to Mr La Via and Ms Manner, who are worried about Greek agriculture: yes, this is communal policy, therefore we have more communal responsibility for the farmers, but you could also detect in this proposal that we now have now proposed to cover, via the Globalisation Fund, the risk for the farmers. There is a special crisis reserve, various positions on deprived persons, so there are some safeguards indicating that we are conscious of a communal, federal responsibility for farming in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">On own resources, Mr Eppink warned us that this is a non-starter but this is already flying. This is the conclusion of the European Council. This is in the Parliament resolution. This is supported by more than 60 % of the European population and versions of this sort of tax are imposed in Great Britain. And I believe there are still some financial services in the City despite that sort of stamp tax and taxation on derivatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Salvador Garriga Polledo said that the proposal was born in a climate of cooperation. Let us preserve the climate of cooperation, aiming at an agreement that could be equal to financial peace for Europe for seven years. This is a gift. This is a value in itself in our turbulent times.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The proposal for the multiannual financial framework for 2014 to 2020 is not modest, as the Commission suggests it is. Compared with the framework for 2007 to 2013, the proposal for 2014 to 2020 shows an increase of 11.0% in its appropriations. Mr Barroso’s statement that the budget will not cost the citizens more is thus questionable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, the European Commission wants a financial transactions tax and a tax based on VAT as new sources of income. This could appear attractive to the governments, as these levies would replace a part of the national contributions. I call on the Member States not to fall for this. In practice, these new levies would mean higher taxes for businesses and citizens. Those who advocate taxes of this kind must not find themselves thinking that they are representing the citizens. The revenues from any tax on financial transactions should in any case flow to the national exchequers. It is the governments, after all, that had to rescue the banks and those Member States that so required.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Why does the EU want these new taxes, anyway? The reason is that the Union wants to spend more on things like its Europe 2020 strategy. That strategy relates to the labour market, which is a competence of the Member States. The European Union’s budget could thus be greatly slimmed down.</p>

I should therefore like to extend my warm congratulations to Commissioner Lewandowski and his team.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe it is particularly important to ensure that there is no reduction in funding for cohesion policy, which has been proven to promote development and have a beneficial impact on the economies of all European regions. I am glad that negotiations on the new multiannual financial framework, a document which will be a significant factor in determining Europe’s development between now and the end of this decade, will start during the Polish Presidency.

      <p sl="pl">How can it be possible to fund expenditure on the implementation of so many CAP objectives in the 2014-2020 period, if it is assumed that CAP resources will be kept at the same level as in the 2007-2013 period? The income of farmers in the EU as a whole is around 55% of the income of other professional groups. During WTO negotiations, the EU’s agricultural market has been opened up too much to goods from third countries where production takes place without any respect for the standards which are in force in the EU, as a result of which imported goods are more competitive. European farmers suffer losses as a result of WTO negotiations. Who is to compensate them? The EU budget should take care of it, since it is the EU which is conducting negotiations which are so disadvantageous to farmers. Why do we not pay farmers for the public goods they produce, from which the whole of society benefits? The conditions for the enlargement of the EU to include 12 new Member States were based on the assumption that the level of support and the level of payments would be equalised. When will we do this, and where will we find the money to do it? Who freed us from the necessity to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Rome on agriculture and food, which were intended to ensure the universal availability of food at appropriate prices and satisfactory incomes for farmers? The two first objectives have been achieved, but the third has not. What is needed is funding for rural development, which means that the second pillar is most useful in implementing the Europe 2020 strategy. Small farms and farms in disadvantaged areas require special support. We must ensure that the programme for the free distribution of food to the most deprived continues to operate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, after almost three years of very hard work, far more than 3 000 amendments, countless conversations, discussions and debates, highly complex technical negotiations and political trialogues, we have reached the stage of voting on the political package, the major compromise between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers on the future labelling of food.</p>
      <p sl="de">This regulation is intended to give consumers more and better information about food, in order to allow them to make informed purchasing decisions. That is not all, however. It should also benefit the European food industry by providing more legal certainty, less red tape and better lawmaking. This is particularly important for the small and medium-sized businesses which make up more than 80% of the food industry in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, this labelling must be appropriate for every type of food and non-alcoholic drink, from basic foods to highly processed ready meals. This is why mandatory labelling using the traffic light system is not possible, because it is not suitable for basic foods.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite all the difficulties, despite all the political and ideological differences in Parliament and despite all the self-interested nationalism in the Member States, we have managed to reach a respectable compromise. Information about allergenic substances will be immediately obvious. The plants used to produce vegetable oils will be specified. There will be country of origin labelling for pork, poultry, lamb and goat meat. An impact assessment will be carried out for other products to show whether and how the origin can be specified, for example, for milk and dairy products, single ingredients, in other words, products made from one main ingredient, meat in processed foods and so on.</p>
      <p sl="de">Imitation foods must be clearly labelled as such on the front of the packaging. The same applies to reconstituted meat and fish which is formed from small pieces. In addition, packaging must not give the impression that it contains something which is not there. If there is a picture of fruit on a yoghurt pot, the yoghurt must contain fruit, not just colouring and aromas.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, the most important nutrients must be stated, but always per 100 grams or 100 millilitres in order to allow comparisons to be made. The label must also state whether water has been added to meat, the date on which meat and fish was first frozen and many other important details.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the most important point is that all the information must be legible. We have defined legibility and we have specified a minimum font size and called on the Commission to introduce binding regulations for other factors, such as the contrast between the text and the background.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, we have protected the handcrafted food production sector from excessive costs and red tape. Information about allergenic substances must be provided for fresh, non-prepacked foods, but not the nutrient information which can only be obtained by means of costly analyses. The Commission originally wanted this nutrient information to appear, but this would have led to the disappearance of national and regional specialities and would have resulted in standardised European pap, which is why we have ensured that it does not happen.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now we have all come to an agreement and the reputable consumer protection organisations are very satisfied with what has been achieved. I would like to thank everyone involved, the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and, in particular, Mr Dalli for his explanations, which I hope he will soon pass on to us and with which he succeeded in cutting the Gordian knot in our political debates. I would especially like to thank the Hungarian Presidency which has achieved something that we had almost given up on, the equivalent of squaring the circle, and that is an agreement on this regulation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it is a great pleasure for me to take part in today’s debate. It concludes four years of debates on a regulation on the provision of food information to consumers. This is really a debate on the inalienable rights of consumers to information. These debates have not been easy, but their outcome is worth the work put into them. The regulation will provide clear benefits for EU consumers, and is an important step towards ensuring that food products purchased in the European Union contain clear, legible and useful information.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Your constructive attitude in Parliament was a significant factor in achieving a favourable outcome for our negotiations. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, the shadow rapporteurs and all those who worked on the report we are debating. Of course, I would also like to thank all of the six preceding presidencies whose work paved the way for the compromise package that I hope will be put to the vote tomorrow. I have no doubt that the provisions of this legislation will make it possible for consumers to make more balanced and healthier dietary choices, at the same time avoiding an extra burden on entities operating in the market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">All three institutions were able to achieve a very important compromise on many issues: labels will be more legible, since a minimum font size will be laid down, packaged food will from now on have to contain information on nutritional values, mandatory information on allergens will also need to be included, and non-packaged food, usually sold via personal contacts between the seller and the consumer, will be subject to more flexible rules laid down by the Member States. In order to avoid imposing excessive burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises, non-packaged food will be exempt from the labelling obligations, and hand-made products or products manufactured in small enterprises will also be exempt. As far as distance selling is concerned, almost all information will need to be provided before the purchase is completed. We have also succeeded in achieving indirect compromises on three issues relating to labelling, upon which the Commission is still working. These issues relate to alcoholic drinks, country-of-origin labelling for additional types of food and the provision of information on whether the food product in question contains trans fatty acids. The Commission will submit a report on these issues within three years of the entry into force of the regulation, and may also put forward its own legislative proposals where appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, honourable Members, this regulation provides consumers with a number of benefits: it increases transparency and helps to improve enforcement of EU legislation by simplifying the labelling requirements in force. The Polish Presidency is keen for this legislative act to enter into force as soon as possible. We hope that after the text has been verified by lawyers and linguists as usual, the Council will be able to adopt it in early October. This would mean that it would be possible to publish the act in the Official Journal of the European Union before the end of October this year.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, more than three years ago, on 30 January 2008, the Commission adopted its proposal for a regulation on food information to consumers. Now we are reaching a conclusion on this important regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am grateful, in particular, to the rapporteur, Dr Sommer, for her hard work and commitment towards finding a compromise with the Council. Let me also thank all shadow rapporteurs for their active and fruitful involvement. Last but not least, let me thank the Hungarian Presidency, and the other presidencies which preceded it, which were very active and did an excellent job in finding compromises that are acceptable for the Council as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to see that Parliament shares the Commission’s vision to establish a general framework for the provision of food information which puts consumers first. With this text, we ensure that our approach to food information is both forward-looking and sufficiently flexible to respond to future developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our common work during the past months has been rewarded in several areas. Let me highlight some of them: firstly, the introduction of a minimum font size for mandatory information will improve the legibility of food labels – one of the main complaints in this area. Secondly, mandatory nutrition information will help consumers identify the foods that meet their personal preferences or dietary requirements. Third, mandatory information on all food on substances causing food allergies or intolerances – not only pre-packed foods but also non-pre-packed foods and foods sold in restaurants – will ensure better protection of consumer health. Highlighting allergens in the list of ingredients will also help consumers to identify them more easily. Fourthly, the move to mandatory origin labelling will provide consumers with more transparency with regard to the food they buy.</p>
      <p sl="en">To ensure that consumers are given meaningful information and that the new rules are enforceable, Commissioner Cioloş – my colleague responsible for Agriculture – and I will pay particular attention to the implementing rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although the new legislation improves matters for consumers and food business operators alike, I regret to see that the ‘front of pack’ nutrition declaration – an important part of the initial Commission proposal – has been deleted. This reduces the benefits of including nutrition information for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The framework for the voluntary inclusion of nutrition information on the front of packs, including other forms of expression, is, however, a step in the right direction. This provides the basis for further consideration of this issue in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also regret to see that alcoholic beverages have been totally exempted from the ingredient and nutrition labelling requirements. I believe that consumers are entitled to receive appropriate information when they consume alcoholic beverages. I will seek to ensure that we strike the right balance in this area in the context of the future report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, there are four statements that have been requested by either Parliament or the Council: firstly, a declaration by the Commission on information on the method of slaughter of animals. Parliament and the Council have noted that European consumers show an interest in the implementation of the EU animal welfare rules at the time of slaughter, including whether the animal was stunned before slaughter. We are also aware of the sensitivity that this has with certain sectors of our society. A study on whether to provide consumers with relevant information on stunning animals before slaughter will be considered in the context of the future EU strategy for protection and welfare of animals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, a declaration by the Commission on aspartame. On 4 May 2011 the Commission asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to perform a full re-evaluation of the safety of aspartame. EFSA accepted this request and the scientific assessment is expected to be completed by September 2012. The Commission will ensure that EFSA will also consider the effect of aspartame on pregnant women.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the light of EFSA’s opinion, the Commission will consider whether there is a need to review existing legislation on aspartame and, if necessary, will undertake appropriate legal measures, such as revising maximum permitted levels and/or requiring the provision of relevant information to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, a declaration by the Commission on food colouring. The Commission is working with the Member States on developing guidelines on the classification of food extracts with colouring properties. The guidelines are expected to be finalised in the second half of 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">The outcome of this technical work will provide the basis for refining the definition of food colouring and for enabling the provision of accurate information to consumers in relation to the use of food ingredients with colouring properties.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, a statement by the Commission on food pre-packed for direct sale. The status of food pre-packed for direct sale in terms of hygiene requirements and the provision of food information in this respect will be considered in the context of the future revision of the food hygiene package.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would also like to make the following statement on the institutional aspect of the text: the Commission underlines that it is contrary to the letter and to the spirit of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 (laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers) to invoke Article 5(4), subparagraph 2, point (b) in a systematic manner. Recourse to this provision must respond to a specific need to depart from the rule of principle, which is that the Commission may adopt a draft implementing act when no opinion is delivered. Given that it is an exception to the general rule established by Article 5 paragraph 4, recourse to subparagraph 2, point (b) cannot be simply seen as a ‘discretionary power’ of the legislator, but must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and thus must be justified.</p>
      <p sl="en">This being said, the compromise package on which you will vote tomorrow is a significant step forward in the area of food information.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, and to thank everyone who helped us to reach an agreement, in particular Mr Dalli and the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have been following the legislative process right from the beginning and it is true that it was very difficult and involved very diverse positions and interests. However, I believe that we have achieved a good result. We will be providing consumers with better and clearer information, but we will not be patronising them or telling them what they can and cannot eat.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to highlight the agreement on imitation foods in particular. It was always very important to us in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) that food should not give the impression that it consisted of a certain basic ingredient when in fact it did not. In other words, cheese must be made of milk. If it contains other vegetable fats, for example, this must be clearly stated on the label in future. It was not easy to find the right solution in this area. The Council argued that the prescribed term ‘food imitation’ would result in the relevant companies claiming that their food was not an imitation, but an innovative product. However, if an ingredient is specified which the food normally does not contain, this represents a significant improvement, in my opinion. Consumers will no longer be deceived by food imitations and this could also help dairy farmers, for example, to get better prices for their products.</p>
      <p sl="de">Other very important points are that in future we will no longer need a magnifying glass to identify the ingredients, that legibility is a mandatory requirement and that we have kept our sense of proportion with regard to small and medium-sized businesses. We have always borne in mind Nestlé, Ferrero and other large organisations, but small bakers, local restaurants and farm shops must also be able to cope with the regulation and we have also found a good solution for them. My sincere congratulations and thanks go to everyone involved.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am delighted that, after years of work, we are taking a big step in the right direction in informing consumers about what is in the food that they eat.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, it seemed at times as though we forgot that this regulation is about food information to consumers. The amount of lobbying from the food and drink industry has been unprecedented, and clearly a lot of money has been spent trying to stop transparent labelling. Nevertheless, we have gained many positive things in this compromise. I fought hard for country-of-origin labelling and am pleased that the Council has agreed to origin labelling for fresh lamb, pork, goat and poultry, just as we have already for beef, fish, fruit and vegetables.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also convinced the Council that the Commission should produce a report, and possible legislation, on the origin of meat in processed food within two years. Why is this important? At present I can buy a chicken sandwich which says ‘produced in the UK’ when in fact the chicken has come from Thailand. We really do need more transparency about where our food comes from.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issue of trans fats was also of great concern to the Socialist Group. Trans fats are often added unnecessarily to processed foods, when we know that they can increase risks of a whole range of problems, including heart disease, infertility and Alzheimer’s disease. This agreement ensures that the Commission will investigate the problem and report back within three years. This group will be pushing for an EU-wide ban on added trans fats similar to that currently applied in Denmark and Austria.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also proud that we persuaded Member States to agree to label all types of vegetable oil. Consumers will now be able to see when unsustainable palm oil is used in foods at the expense of precious rainforests and to put pressure on manufacturers to use oil from a sustainable source.</p>
      <p sl="en">The huge disappointment for me is that mandatory front-of-pack labelling has not been adopted. It seems to me that, if we are serious about tackling some of our major health issues, such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes, then we really should have given consumers the information they need to quickly identify healthier options.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I am glad that existing systems can continue to be used on a voluntary basis, including consumer-friendly schemes such as the traffic-light system. I hope that more and more retailers and manufacturers will start to use them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us not forget that this is the first time that back-of-pack nutritional labelling will be mandatory under European law, which means that now consumers will always have the opportunity to see how much salt, sugar and fat and other key nutrients are in their food.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Sommer, the other shadow rapporteurs, the Hungarian Presidency and the Commission for their readiness to reach this compromise at second reading. We have made enormous strides for the 500 million consumers of Europe towards greater clarity and transparency about what their foods contain. I am also pleased that the liberal line has been maintained so that consumers are not told from on high what they may and may not eat but are instead given the information, on the basis of which they can decide for themselves what they eat. That alone will not be enough, so sufficient consideration must also be given in school to the importance of healthy eating.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Allow me to just emphasise a couple of aspects. The first of these is the obligation – finally – to declare vegetable oils on the label. At long last, consumers will be able to see which oils that vague label ‘vegetable oils’ really conceals, with the result that manufacturers will no longer be able to fill their foods with certain non-sustainable oils. The second aspect concerns the trans fats. I have the utmost confidence in the fact that, with this compromise, we will at last even be able to obtain a ban on the presence of artificial trans fats in foods, which would be a major step forwards.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I noticed that the Commissioner was reading his speech from his iPad. In future, let us look into whether we, too, can use new technologies in order to inform consumers about what is in their food so that we are not solely dependent on the paper-based labels.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, we have had long and difficult negotiations, but now they are over and we have something that is considerably better than the current state of affairs, even though I think that we missed an opportunity to have a quick, instantly recognisable labelling system that we could have used to inform consumers of high levels of salt and sugar, for example. It is also regrettable that the alcohol lobby has succeeded in removing alcohol from this proposal instead of providing information for consumers. How many people here are aware of the intoxicating effects of alcohol? I expect everyone is, but how many people here in the gallery are aware of the fact that the calorie content of alcohol is 1.5 times that of sugar? People have a right to know that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, I am very pleased that we have put an end to fraudulent foods. Now, if blueberries are stated on the packaging, the food will have to contain blueberries. You will now discover that the ham on your sandwiches consists of several pieces stuck together and that the marzipan you buy contains apricot kernels instead of almonds. You will also be able to find out whether there is a lot of water in your chicken thigh instead of meat.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Vegetable oil will be labelled with its country of origin, and that is excellent. We will start with the origin-labelling of meat, and I hope that the study will quickly show that we can extend this to include meat contained in products. Many consumers would like to avoid animals being transported long distances and to encourage producers that produce good meat under good conditions. It is important that this is included after the evaluation report, but we will in any case begin with the meat pieces.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am also pleased that nanotechnology, when used, will be labelled for those who want to know about that. As far as trans fats are concerned, we did not achieve the decision that Parliament wanted, but we did nevertheless reach a decision on labelling. However, we will now have a study carried out and that will perhaps result in a ban. I believe that to be the simplest and quickest way to eradicate cardiovascular disease, and it is cheap and effective. The technology that generates trans fats is old. We can abolish it. I hope that that is what the study will show. I am pleased that we have clearer allergen labelling, and also that consumers will quickly be able to identify vegetarian food throughout Europe. Finally, I am also pleased about the derogations for micro-enterprises where the owners are able to provide information to consumers themselves. That is good, as there will be no unnecessary bureaucracy for them and it is to be regulated at local level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am glad that the Council, the Commission and Parliament reached a consensus on this. We had widely divergent positions but it would have been a shame to see these three years of work, for which we have to congratulate Renate Sommer, going down the drain the same way as the novel foods bill went down the drain.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me pick up on the point that Commissioner Dalli raised in his opening remarks about the animals that are slaughtered without pre-stunning, under the derogation on religious grounds for the Schechitah Jewish method of slaughter and Halal. This, as we all know, has been widely abused. The derogation has been abused, so that many millions of animals are being slaughtered in this way now and the meat products from those animals are finding their way into the general food chain. We felt very strongly that the consumers in Europe have a right to know when they are buying those products. I am glad to hear Mr Dalli say that he will now produce a strong animal welfare draft regulation that covers this issue. This House expects nothing less.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Mr Dalli, I have brought you some cake. Why so, you may ask. It is because today is Dolly the sheep’s birthday. The world’s first cloned mammal is celebrating her 15th birthday – well, posthumously, anyway, as the cloned sheep died in 2003. Dolly deserves congratulations nonetheless. 93% of all cloned animals are not born alive, or are born critically ill. The fact that Dolly lived until the age of 6 is thus worthy of congratulations.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is a failure on the part of the Commission that it has not brought forward any regulation of cloning technology in 15 years. 15 years after Dolly’s birth, food deriving from cloned animals is still being placed on the market, and unlabelled cloned food is reaching the market. In other words, consumers are receiving no information. What actually is on the label, then? Provisionally, trans fats will not be there, and these are harmful to health. The 100-gram-based nutrition declaration also threatens to disappear, as manufacturers are to be permitted to label on a per-portion basis, which is misleading for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Then we come to the labelling of provenance – this is to apply only to fresh meat, not to prepacked meat, milk and dairy products. These animals can thus just continue to be hauled around Europe, then. Consumers will obtain no clearly visible information about energy, fats, sugars and salt. It will be on the back somewhere.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, Europe is choosing not to make identifiable to consumers meat from ritual slaughter with no anaesthetic. This will make the Dutch legislation on this a farce. The interests of consumers are absolutely not being put first. It is my view that, on this, Dolly’s birthday, the new food labelling rules certainly do not merit any congratulations.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we were in favour of the text in its form at first reading. Despite the efforts of the rapporteur, the Council rejected the measure, which is now at second reading, with the request to remove the obligation to indicate the country of origin or the place of origin of a food.</p>
      <p sl="it">We believe that this decision goes against the interest of our enterprises, which want to continue working, producing and creating jobs in Europe. There has been some progress in the negotiations between the Commission and the Council, but it is still not enough to meet the expectations of European citizens. Even more serious is that the possibility of adopting national provisions on indication of origin is in practical terms a purely theoretical standard. It would be very difficult for a stricter national standard to find a qualified majority in the permanent committee.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur. Consumers have the right to expect information given on food labels to be correct and not misleading. Nutritional information is important to the consumer and the quality standard with which the food complies is important for consumer choice and for consumer safety. All of these are good things to have emerged from the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I want to highlight one particular area where I have concerns. That is any potential change in country-of-origin labelling. While having sympathy with the concept, I have reservations as to the potential impact on trade. In Northern Ireland, local business has already seen how something like country-of-origin labelling could and can be used as a protectionist measure. This has had a negative impact on trade in Northern Ireland, and producers and processors have suffered as a result. I know that this is a matter of concern for the Member States which have voiced that concern at Council level.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would urge the Commission to carry out an impact assessment to investigate any proposed labelling legislation, particularly in relation to country-of-origin labelling.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner. Mrs Sommer, the shadow rapporteurs, the Hungarian Presidency and the Commission have come to a good agreement with regard to this Regulation which is so important for consumers and the food industry. Many congratulations to all of them.</p>
      <p sl="es">As consumers, of course, we want comprehensive information about everything we eat. However, to put this information on the packaging is no mean feat and we must find a balance in everything. We must also find a cost-benefit balance as we cannot overlook the fact that the information on the labelling, depending on the nature of that information, makes the product more expensive. Someone has to pay that cost.</p>
      <p sl="es">If the consumer does not pay it then many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will have to quit the market as they cannot compete with large companies that can pay this additional cost.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that this balance has been achieved and we have to be satisfied. We have to be satisfied with regard to country of origin labelling, for example. It was already foreseen that, where confusion may arise, the origin of products should be labelled. Furthermore, it is permitted that this labelling may be done voluntarily.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to processed products containing several ingredients, it is not easy to determine what the main ingredient is. Therefore, another solution other than that adopted would raise implementation problems because of the economic cost and administrative complexity for the companies, without bringing the consumer any clear additional benefit.</p>
      <p sl="es">Also in this context, I agree that this legislation should not be applied to alcohol products as all these products already have comprehensive legislation concerning labelling, and everyone knows that when you drink an alcohol product you are consuming alcohol and that it has calories.</p>
      <p sl="es">In short, all of this is important but, above all, it is very important to educate consumers so that they are able to absorb all this information.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on information to consumers allows Europe to take a new and important step towards achieving its specific objective of protecting consumer rights. I would like to thank Mrs Sommer for this, and all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular the shadow rapporteur from my group, Glenis Willmott.</p>
      <p sl="it">While it may be true that Europe can look to the future with more confidence now that the instruments for food protection and transparency have been made more effective, it is also true that the agreement in second reading redefines, albeit in part, what this House approved at first reading. For example, we would have expected more, Madam President, on origin labelling for foodstuffs. The obligation to indicate the origin of all meat, given to us in the new paragraph 25, is a significant change that meets the expectations of large numbers of European consumers. At the same time, we have to underline its less ambitious approach with regard to the introduction of mandatory labelling for all fresh agricultural products and single-ingredient processed foods, which this House had approved.</p>
      <p sl="it">Meat labelling in Annex XI excludes some important products that require an equal level of protection, such as rabbit meat, which for some reason has been excluded. However, the way forward in food transparency has been shown, and we now need to pursue it with the same commitment and responsibility that have brought us this far.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, after three years of controversial, at times even stormy, debates, this food labelling regulation has been packed and is ready for use. Certainly, this is a compromise, but one I would describe as balanced. I would underline the extended country-of-origin labelling, which is a response to a strong demand from the citizen: to know where a particular product comes from and to be able, if need be, to favour local products. Clearly highlighting allergens and the study on the harmfulness of aspartame, which the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been asked to carry out and has been announced by the Commissioner, are also worth emphasising.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, trans fats, including industrial hydrogenated fats in pizzas, pastries and other fried foods, have been given a reprieve, which I find incomprehensible given the damage they cause.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission would therefore be well advised to reduce the currently planned three-year period and to go further than simply labelling food. This is the price the Commission must pay for its ambition, if it wishes to give a new, stronger dimension to this fight against obesity, this scourge from which 400 000 additional people suffer each year in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am delighted to be able to support this package and take the opportunity to welcome greater honesty and transparency on food labels. This dossier has really ignited consumer interest. We have all had hundreds and thousands of communications from our constituents and I would like to pay my tribute to organisations such as the Women’s Institute in the UK, who have also done their bit on the campaigning side. Of course nobody is ever 100% satisfied but we have a significant way forward in a number of areas. We have a clear forward on country-of-origin labelling. A lot of us argued for this and I think we have a good compromise here.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nutritional data on pack is understandable, more useable, plus Member States are able to continue with their own discretional schemes, and all of this legible too. So I think this regulation will make a significant contribution to healthy eating in Europe and, as such, it is very welcome.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the key word in this report is ‘consumer’. We often forget who we are addressing when we take decisions. Important decisions have been taken in the report we are discussing, such as the indication of specific nutritional value or the indication of origin, in order to give consumers more correct information. It is a step forward, not the ultimate goal.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indication of origin for agricultural food products – the provenance of the main foodstuffs that make up a product – should be the first information available to the consumer. There are various cases in which traceability is vital, the latest being the bacteria which unfortunately killed several people. By identifying the provenance of a product it is possible to take swift action or to safeguard the product from incorrect information. The issue of competitiveness is no less important. Often an indication of origin can be a guarantee and a promise of quality. The various quality products of each country have won the trust of consumers. We support the indication of origin because consumers have the right to know what they are eating.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I too, of course, would like to offer my sincerest thanks to the rapporteur – this legislation will definitely lead to European consumers being better informed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, there is still something that bothers me when it comes to sham products. Take this cheese pizza, for example. At first glance it looks very tasty, but as soon as you study the ingredients, you discover that the Edam cheese used is in fact not a cheese at all but a mix of cheese, water, cream and vegetable fats. Bon appétit!</p>
      <p sl="nl">The compromise that has now been reached with the Council ensures that every producer must specify what substitute products are made use of. I can see you nodding, Commissioner, but how will that work out in practice? I fear that all this will mean in practice is that vegetable oil will be added in the case of this pizza. That gets consumers absolutely nowhere, as they will be thinking of olive oil rather than fake cheese. I would prefer to see a stricter approach taken to vegetable-based cheese substitutes, for example. To me, that would seem to be clearer and better.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To sum up, I will wait and see whether this compromise delivers any practical result. That will also depend on strict enforcement and strict checks in the Member States. Therefore, Commissioner, my plan – so you know this in advance, and you have been warned – is to ask the Commission over the coming years how this legislation is being enforced in the Member States. When a product purports to contain cheese, it should actually contain cheese. If that is not the case, consumers should be informed of this. I hope that this legislation succeeds in bringing that situation about, but if it does not we will certainly be asking you for a stricter approach.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I am one of those who are very pleased that we have now succeeded in getting our requirement accepted for the mandatory origin labelling of all meat. This has been repeatedly called for by consumers and also by many producers, particularly Swedish pig and poultry breeders, who maintain higher animal welfare standards than many of their fellow breeders in Europe and the rest of the world and who are currently forced to compete on unfair terms. They really welcome this as a way to give consumers the opportunity to make a choice that is better for the animals and better for the environment.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We would have preferred to have extended the mandatory requirements for origin labelling to also include combined products, because, precisely as Mrs Willmott just said, it is unfortunately the case at present that many consumers are often misled. In order to be able to make a fully informed choice, they would need the information to be easily accessible on the packaging. We hope that we will make further progress on this matter very soon.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Other disappointments include trans fats. We would have liked to have seen some form of labelling, although we would have preferred a ban of course, but until then some form of labelling. It would be a cheap way to avoid this type of product or eradicate it from the market. I, too, am pleased that we will have a mandatory requirement for the labelling of nanomaterials. That was important as far as I was concerned. I am also pleased that we are making it a requirement to state the content per 100 grams or 100 ml. That will really make it easier for consumers to make true comparisons.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the aim of Amendment 137, which I tabled with 40 other colleagues, regarding languages on food labelling is respect for language diversity in the European Union. Every citizen has the right to information in his own language, even if this language is not yet an official language of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Diversity in the EU means that millions of European citizens have a language as their mother tongue which is not officially recognised in this Parliament. In the case of Catalonia, it is a reality that thousands of enterprises use Catalan alone on the labels of their products.

It will clearly have to be sufficient in relation to the possibilities offered by the size of the packaging and what is possible for our consumers. I also believe that some of the drastic changes will ultimately be a burden to consumers, but that was to be expected. I consider the result to be reasonably successful, and I will vote in favour of it.</p>

But the truth is that it is the consumer who is paying and not the EU and the consumer will choose what he or she wants to eat. Of course, some kind of labelling is just common sense, whether it is nutritional information or allergies but I would suggest that much of this report is nannying in the excess. I also fear that it will come at a cost and that that cost will then be pushed onto the consumer, which seems to me to be particularly dangerous at a time of an economic downturn.</p>
      <p sl="en">But here is the crux and I repeat it in almost every speech I give. We all know that the UK can pass laws itself, indeed our parliament was known as the mother of parliaments for many years. This is a decision that should be taken at nation state level.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this regulation will finally provide consumers with the nutritional info that they need in order to live a healthy lifestyle. It is a major step forwards that the obligation to provide nutritional information will henceforth apply to all foods, rather than merely to those that make a health claim. The fact that this information must be stated in numbers and letters and in relation to standard quantities is the right choice. The traffic light system was attractive, but it was far from effective. Fortunately, the handcrafted products sector is to be given an exception from these requirements. Otherwise, it would be like signing a death warrant for these high-quality products in many cases.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am grateful to all those Members who have supported my bid to retain the existing language arrangements. This is essential, as what use is a right to information for consumers if they do not get that information in a language they can understand?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would like to emphasise once again the difference in purpose of the designation of provenance marking and the traceability requirement. With that difference at the back of my mind, I have no problem at all with a mandatory marking of the designation of provenance of the ingredients of composite products being provisionally on the legislative table and for the benefit of this to be first thoroughly investigated in all its aspects.</p>

      <p sl="es">It is true that we have moved forward, especially with regard to food labelling and with regard to safety in terms of the clarity of the message. However, we have come up short on trans fats, for example, in terms of the obligation to label them.</p>

In a well-supplied continent such as this, with problems of over-eating, cardiac issues and obesity, we must speed up and consider as soon as possible a prohibition on trans fats being added to food, as Denmark and Australia have done and as Spain is doing. This must be done without delay and without waiting any longer.</p>
      <p sl="es">The compromises are going to depend on the urgency with which we apply ourselves, the clarity with which we conduct ourselves and how ambitious we are.

      <p sl="fr">It is essential that European consumers should have the necessary information on the packaging of the products they consume to enable them to make an informed choice – all the information they want and not just any old information. I am therefore pleased that a compromise has been struck. Mr Nuttall has left; I do not agree at all with his analysis. I think we should welcome the compromise reached. Labels will be more legible and information on allergens will be accessible to the public affected by these allergies. Imitations will be identified as such, because it is, for example, unacceptable to mislead consumers by selling them cheese made from vegetable fat instead of milk.</p>

I regret to see that the proposal on mandatory traffic-light labelling and recommended daily amounts labelling was deleted. According to consumer and health care organisations, this labelling would have provided more help to consumers in following a healthier diet. The front-of-packaging nutrition declaration proposed by Mrs Glenis Willmott and the S&amp;D Group would have served to provide better information to consumers.

      <p sl="fr">We can be pleased with origin labelling, especially for a large number of additional types of meat. I want to thank Mrs Willmott for having fought so hard for this, and I thank Mrs Sommer for having included this element.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The agreement we are going to endorse tomorrow is certainly a step forward, since mandatory country-of-origin labelling, hitherto reserved for beef, honey, olive oil, fresh fruit and vegetables, has been extended to fresh pork, lamb, goat and poultry. It should perhaps be further extended to other foodstuffs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The compromise is clearly not going to fully satisfy all consumers, but I realise just how difficult it has been getting to this point. I call on the Commission to propose additional legislation on this matter as quickly as possible, without necessarily conducting the onerous studies you are recommended to conduct.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will finish by giving an example. There is no point in defining the portion; we are no longer asked to do this anyway. It is either 100 grams, or 100 millilitres, or else the unit, in the case of packaging by equal units. As for the notion of portion, it is completely theoretical and must remain so.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, the majority of Members welcome these proposals. That is not surprising, because it helps citizens with regard to the food they eat.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Just a few points on these proposals. Firstly, I think we have to be careful that SMEs in particular are not driven out of business in complying with regulations, to the benefit of multinationals. Secondly, it was my pleasure to attend a National Federation of Women’s Institutes breakfast meeting this morning, where they revealed some the results of a survey that they carried out. It was significant that 98% of respondents felt that country-of-origin labelling was necessary, but also over 50% of the respondents were not aware that country-of-origin labelling meant the country in which the product underwent the last significant change.</p>
      <p sl="ga">There is a huge difference between something being reared in a country and being processed in a country. That certainly needs to be clarified, and a distinction made and the current practice ended.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, thank you very much. I am glad that Mr Sawicki, the Polish foreign minister, is taking part in our debate in this Chamber for the first time, and I should like to extend a warm welcome to him. I would like to highlight one issue which I regard as very important. This House very frequently and willingly talks about the duties incumbent upon manufacturers. However, I would like to highlight the fact that these recommendations are very important for consumers. They mean that consumers should be significantly more aware of their rights. I use the word ‘should’ on purpose, because there is nothing to say that this will definitely happen.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would therefore like to stress most emphatically the need to educate consumers. It is not enough for there to be significantly more data and information on the label. What matters is that not only specialists, but also consumers and purchasers should be able to interpret correctly the information they are given.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it has taken three years and several food scandals before we could finally reach a compromise. One positive step is the mandatory labelling of imitation cheese and reconstituted meat. We should not expect consumers to eat cheese which is not made from milk or ham that consists of little offcuts of meat stuck together and we certainly should not allow them to be presented with these things without warning them about the contents.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the requirements for country of origin labelling of meat do not go far enough. They only cover fresh meat and not processed products. For example, the meat used in chicken nuggets often comes from Brazil or Thailand and the pork used to make bacon and prosciutto seldom comes from the region in question, but from somewhat further north and is sometimes transported over distances of 900 kilometres right across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report is a step in the right direction which is long overdue. However, we must not sit and wait for the next scandal before we take further action.</p>

No front-of-pack labelling, no calorie information on the front, no indication at least of the calories in alcohol, never mind any other ingredients, no portion sizes at all, not a spoonful or a cup or anything else. The compromise includes none of these things. The country of origin information, which is something that consumers urgently need to know, is totally inadequate. The content of Article 25, like everything else, is linked to reports from the Commission on the status of the implementation of provisions: reports on trans fats, reports on products with one ingredient, reports on a whole range of other subjects. This really is a resounding failure. It is not a good result and it is very disheartening. I would have liked to have seen a proper second reading and then, if necessary, the conciliation procedure. That would have been a respectable result. Now European consumers will simply be disappointed.</p>

      <p sl="de">I would have liked to have seen a bolder approach in the case of alcoholic drinks. It is entirely possible to provide labelling for alcopops for example. In the case of wine, a long-term exception could have been made, given that for decades wine has been subject to much more stringent conditions than other products, including exact details of the alcohol content, country of origin, specifications relating to the font sizes and so on.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I want to thank everyone for this excellent compromise; in any case, it is a step forward as far as origin labelling is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When we speak about the labelling of food, the central concerns must be the consumer and consumer protection law. All consumers must know where the food they buy originates and what it contains. The consumer must, in this way, have the opportunity to support local produce.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This compromise is a step in the right direction, especially as far as origin labelling is concerned. As has often been said here, it will extend the obligation to provide information on these labels to meat products, for example, and that is very important.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There is, however, very much still to do. It is important that, in the future, labelling showing the country of origin will also extend to milk products and even to processed products, so that the consumer cannot be misled here either.

I am delighted that we have agreed on the size of the lettering and on nutrition information. As a doctor, I support and very much welcome the fact that it will include allergens, as well as substances causing various intolerances and, naturally, it is a very good thing that nobody will be able to put an image of strawberries on packaging where the product contains only a kind of essence or aroma, which is no substitute at all for the original food.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is crucial to show that the European Union is willing and able to produce legislation that really empowers citizens in their daily life. Information is the lifeblood of empowerment, and I predict, in agreement with Mr Gerbrandy, that improved technology will in the future – in the very near future, I hope – enable us to give more timely information to consumers on what is being offered for their consumption.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have noted the insistence by some Members on the issue of enforcement. In connection with both the issue of animal slaughter without stunning and the issue of imitation products, the question of enforcement was emphasised. This, I believe, is the key. I am a firm believer that, even before coming up with new rules, new legislation and new regulation, we have to really ensure that what we have today is being properly enforced. I believe that our efforts and our resources should be more and more applied to ensuring enforcement.</p>
      <p sl="en">On imitation we also have to be very creative, and I agree here with Ms de Lange. We have to be careful that, while giving the correct information to consumers about the presence or absence of certain substances in a product, we are not giving the opportunity for creative marketeers to use our own regulation to defeat our own purposes, for example by emphasising the substances they then say – maybe in smaller print – the product does not contain. Therefore we have to be very creative when we make our regulation in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Like Ms Liotard, I am also very disappointed that we have no regulation on cloning and no information on the cloning of animals. I believe that we lost an opportunity of starting on the right path to get this information in the near future. I believe that the proposals that we had on the table some weeks ago – although not they did not represent the final objective for most of us – were indicating to us the direction we should move in so as to finally come to a position where consumers would have this information telling them what they are consuming. Again this is the key. I remember during my hearing before you in Parliament that I made this statement in a very affirmative way. It is not a question of telling people what to eat. It is a question of telling people what they are eating and then letting them decide what they really want to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the language question, here we also have to be very careful. We have not changed the present regulation on language. We have to be careful because, if I understand correctly, the amendment that is being proposed would enable any country or district or region to impose one exclusive language on the packaging. Here again, I believe this would defeat the purpose of information rather than improve the information flow to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new legislation represents a milestone in the European consumer’s right to information. With the conclusion of the legislative procedure we can now move to the next step, the implementation phase. A lot of work still remains to be done to ensure the full application of certain rules. I count on fruitful interinstitutional cooperation to ensure the pragmatic implementation of this regulation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, we have had over three years of debates, but a multitude of doubts still remain, and there are still very diverse opinions on the matter, ranging from full support, through major doubts, to the outright disappointment expressed by Mr Tabajdi.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Honourable Members, what we eat to a large extent determines how we live. Of course, as consumers we are fully entitled to information about the products we consume, for example in order to avoid Mr Mikolášik’s colleagues having to correct our dietary mistakes. I would also like to agree in full with the opinion expressed by Commisisoner Dalli in this Chamber a short while ago, that consumers do not need to be told by us what they should eat, but that they have the right to know what they are eating. However the problem is that labelling alone will not really help us to shape good nutritional habits. I agree with Mr Zemke that a huge amount of work is needed, including in terms of consumer education, since it is unfortunately not enough just to describe products.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to agree with the Commissioner that what we have today in the form of a compromise is a balance between consumers’ expectations and interests and the possibilities open to farmer-producers and processors. I would also like to stress very emphatically that the issues raised by the Commissioner, including the matter of slaughter and animal welfare, and the issues relating to cloned animals raised by Mrs Liotard, will need to be clarified in future in separate legislative acts.</p>
      <p sl="pl">You were very emphatic on the issue of country-of-origin labelling. I remember the debate from before the last enlargement in 2004, when the new Member States were told quite clearly that country-of-origin labelling was nothing other than trade protectionism. I am very glad that today, as part of a larger European Union, we have become mature enough to provide consumers with the right to know where products come from. In the first instance, it is certainly worth labelling products originating from outside the European Union, since within the EU products are manufactured to the same standards and norms. The matter of national labelling is of course still open in my opinion, and still needs to be debated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The issue of counterfeit products is also important. This practice is too widespread for us to turn a blind eye to it. It is thus also worth ensuring that anything that is not animal fat is clearly named, and that anything that is not a food product, but instead an additive or improver, is clearly named and labelled so that consumers are fully aware of what they are eating.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Honourable Members, I would like to conclude by thanking you for this debate. I would like to assure you that I will, of course, raise all your concerns and opinions at the Council meeting.</p>

I would have preferred mandatory information about the number of calories per 100 grams or per 100 millilitres to have appeared on the front of the pack. Other Members had more far-reaching requirements. However, it is in the very nature of a compromise that everyone has to give way a little at some point and that one item is played off against another. You may or may not find the details satisfactory, but this is the only way of reaching a solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not think that it is right to work towards conciliation with such a difficult dossier. Anyone who is heading for conciliation, for example by means of the amendment on the language issue which will be tabled tomorrow in plenary, is aiming to destroy this draft regulation, this compromise, as it currently stands. It is absolutely clear that this dossier would fail in the conciliation procedure in just the same way as the novel foods regulation recently failed. This is why the rapporteurs from all the groups helped to ensure that an agreement was reached.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Liotard, you have also helped on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, as did Mr Rossi for his group. Therefore, I completely fail to understand why you want to withdraw from this compromise and why you are saying: ‘Oh, this is a dreadful result that has been produced. I cannot support it and I cannot even congratulate the people who worked on it. It simply does not go far enough.’ Why did you agree to it then? You helped to bring about this compromise and I am grateful to you for doing so. To me this sounds a little like trying to have your cake and eat it. Your group aims for a populist approach and this is not right. We want to do something for consumers and this is an important issue for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is true that the result is not perfect. It is true that we could have achieved more. There are a lot of problems to be solved in the transitional period before the regulation can finally be implemented. However, I am confident that the Commission will find the necessary solutions and will carry out investigations into alcohol and ultimately come up with a definition of alcopops. We will produce a very good solution and I would ask you please to support this dossier, this political compromise, tomorrow.</p>

I would also stress the mandatory country of origin marking for a significant range of products, such as vegetables, fish, beef, honey, fruit and oil.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nonetheless, there is also a need for this marking to become mandatory immediately in the case of milk and dairy products. This is a piece of information that should be clearly provided for consumers. The big distributors, with their own brands, frequently change the origin of the milk inside their packaging, for example UHT milk, without consumers having the faintest idea about it, using this lack of transparency to covertly bring millions of litres with other origins into consumption.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore call for everyone to vote for country of origin marking for dairy products to become mandatory immediately.

      <p sl="en">The discussion of the draft regulation on the provision of food information at second reading is a good illustration of the irreplaceable role of Parliament as the body closest to EU citizens. We cannot allow economic interests to be the sole victor. It is logical that the industry should lobby governments in order to make the obligation to provide information as limited as possible, as that will reduce their costs. The most important thing, in my personal opinion, is not only for the widest possible range of information to be provided, but for food manufacturers to comply strictly, for example, with the obligation to label products containing substances that are risky for allergy sufferers or people who are otherwise in ill health. I consider it crucial for product packaging to include this information. It is similarly totally unacceptable to provide information on the composition and use of foods on packaging in extremely small fonts. This practice represents a wholly unacceptable risk for elderly people, whose rights are curtailed by this approach. Most elderly people have a problem reading this kind of font. I therefore welcome the more detailed definition of the obligations incumbent upon producers and distributors regarding labelling and the provision of food information to consumers.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The agreement which has been reached can be improved. However, I think that it does mark important progress towards giving consumers better food information. The report contains a large number of positive points. One of them which I would like to mention is the mandatory nutrition declaration, which contains information about the nutritional value, quantity of fats, saturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, proteins and salt. Another example is highlighting allergenic substances on the product label, thereby making these substances more visible on the label, which is a real help to consumers. I think that the introduction of stricter and more substantial product labelling regulations will offer consumers the opportunity to purchase food products in full knowledge of the facts. As food is involved, it can affect people’s health, thereby making labelling all the more important. I believe that a ‘traffic light’ type system could have been rather more useful for consumers as it would have been clearer, given that labels already contain a fairly large amount of information. However, I regret that such a solution was not possible. Last but not least, I think that the new regulation will introduce greater legal certainty, which will help the food industry, especially SMEs.</p>

In this context, it is crucial that the EU should take measures to address this problem, both small and large, direct and indirect, both in hospitals – through thorough preparation for relevant health problems – and at the source through food information to consumers. While this report does not contain all the measures which I would like to see implemented – such as information on alcoholic drinks and traffic-light labelling –, it is an important start and will cause European consumers to think twice in future about what they eat on a daily basis and what it means for their health.</p>

Legible labelling has always been my priority. Consumers should not have to be agricultural engineers to be able to decipher labels. Let us not forget, however, that responsibility for a healthy and balanced diet does not rest solely with consumers and the information given to them.</p>

I therefore await the impact assessments promised by the Commission on trans fats, allergens and extending country-of-origin labelling to all meat, because there are still many unfulfilled expectations.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, food labels do not serve the purpose of ‘educating’ the consumer, or of creating a good diet. They simply serve the purpose of providing information to citizens, to allow them to make more informed choices. This is the approach that won over in the end, after nearly three years of hard work. We will now have labels that are clearer and easier to read, showing allergens more clearly, for example. We will have strict rules on misleading information. It will no longer be possible to show pictures of strawberries on the packaging if the yoghurt only contains aromas and colours, for example. All in all, we will have many good things for consumers. The regulation will also benefit our businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, because it will reduce distortions in trade and cut down on bureaucracy. Of course, like many compromise agreements, the agreement reached is not completely satisfactory. With regard to the indication of origin, for example, labelling should be mandatory also for rabbit meat. The rabbit-breeding industry has recently been hit by a serious crisis, and needs urgent measures to promote the image of rabbit meat also through far-sighted labelling and traceability policies. I hope the Commission will be able to remedy what appears to be an oversight rather than a choice.</p>

      <p sl="en">The main principle that this amendment to the procedures on the provision of food information to consumers hitherto in force aims to achieve is the consumer’s right to obtain information about a food product, and to be able to make a decision on whether or not to purchase or consume that food product. Adopting a decision on food information should also reduce consumer complaints that food labels are misleading. Indeed, by providing the consumer with information, we run the risk of going to the other extreme – too much information. Too much information would, on the one hand, be a burden on consumers, forcing them to become nutrition specialists. Then in order to provide more information (in a script that is still legible), more space is required, and this means making packaging and containers bigger (often consumers complain that they have to buy a product in large packaging that is unnecessary), which in turn leads to an increase in waste packaging. Meanwhile the cost of the extra packaging would inevitably be passed on to consumers. The product’s nutritional value will be marked along with the quantities of ingredients (carbohydrates, fat, protein, salt and sugar) that might cause an allergic reaction when consuming a chosen product. Stringent requirements regarding the provision of information would be a significant burden for small traders, selling products they have baked or produced themselves without packaging. It is good that an exception has been made for such traders and that food sold in bulk will not be subject to compulsory labelling.</p>

The specification of a minimum font size is a benefit not only for people with impaired vision, but also for people with normal vision, who often cannot read the tiny lettering on packaging. The mandatory labelling of allergens may even save lives. The proposal for mandatory labelling of the date of first freezing of fish and meat is very important, as is the labelling of their country of origin. This can help consumers understand the risks of purchasing a given product, especially after the recent epidemics and diseases in the EU. Despite the lack of support for the proposal by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left for so-called traffic-light labelling of nutrient content, I am pleased that this proposal survives as an option for those who want to make use of it.

The resulting standardised system of food labelling will provide better protection for consumers. The intention is for consumers to be able to find out quickly what products contain and where they come from, along with other important information. Our highest priority is the health of consumers, which is why known allergenic substances will be highlighted in the list of ingredients. In order to prevent consumers from being deceived, misleading information relating to the appearance, description or pictorial representation of products has been banned. We need legal certainty and clear regulations in this area in particular. The country of origin of fresh meat must be specified. In addition, the Commission will investigate the possibility and the potential costs of stating the place of birth, rearing and slaughter.

There is certainly still a great deal to be done in this area, especially in terms of simplifying the red tape and facilitating a quick assessment of the relevant information for consumers.

Steps in the right direction have been taken, but there were also missed opportunities here.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Good points include the clear declaration of allergens, the reporting of palm oil and an expansion of labelling of origin, although this does not go far enough. What is lacking, above all, is the mandatory declaration of the five most important ingredients (salt, sugar, fat, saturated fat and energy content) per 100 grams or 100 millilitres on the front of the packaging, as well as the prohibition of, or at least the mandatory declaration of, saturated fats.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore hope that the Commission study delivers the results that consumers need within three years.

      <p sl="nl">Finally, the industry should strictly apply this regulation and must be supervised in that regard with appropriate checks and sanctions.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0195/2011) by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on EU legislation on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) and on related feed and food controls (2010/2249(INI)).</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can no longer count the number of times over the past 14 or 15 years that I have spoken here in Parliament on subjects relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), animal health and, most importantly, consumer protection and human health. In 1997 I was the chair of the BSE committee and since then I have had the opportunity to speak perhaps 20, 30 or 40 times on the subject.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have a report here to discuss today and to vote on tomorrow, which concerns another Commission road map. At this point, I would like to thank the Commission, Mr Dalli and his colleagues once again for their cooperation. Over all the years that we have been dealing with BSE, this cooperation has been of a consistently high quality and I am grateful for this. However, this has not always been the case. If the situation in the 1980s and 1990s had been similar, we would have perhaps had fewer problems, but, thank goodness, things have changed over recent years.</p>
      <p sl="de">The road map contains essential technical sections, but it also has sections relating to the content which are important in political terms. I would like to refer to some of them, but I will not be able to cover all of them because of a lack of time. In all of the proposals which I am asking you to accept tomorrow, safeguarding the health of consumers is, of course, the highest priority.</p>
      <p sl="de">In recent years, we have introduced several amendments to the legislation on BSE and TSEs and, rightly so, when you consider that in 2001 we had 2 167 cases of animals with BSE in the European Union, while in 2009 the figure was only 67. This alone shows what a quantum leap forward has been taken in animal health and also in consumer protection.</p>
      <p sl="de">Tomorrow we will have to look at the question of whether we want to continue on this path. I have made a few proposals relating to the content which will also help us to continue reducing the risk of BSE and TSEs. However, I would like to focus here on one proposal and that is the question of the ban on feeding meat and bone meal to omnivores which are not ruminants, in other words, not sheep, goats and cattle.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 2001, in the light of the BSE crisis and the BSE scandal, a ban on feeding meat and bone meal to pigs and poultry in particular was introduced. At no point did this have any scientific basis; it was purely a political decision. At that time we had to admit that contaminated meat and bone meal had been fed to cattle. This was highly unethical because cattle are ruminants and herbivores and should not eat meat and bone meal. This contributed to the BSE crisis and, therefore, there was a complete ban on feeding meat and bone meal which also covered omnivores, in other words, animals which eat animal protein and, in particular, pigs and poultry.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to propose to you now, just as the Commission is doing, that we go back and say that if we can produce these products safely, then we must also be able to feed them. There is no point in us eating only about one third of an animal and not eating the rest of the animal which is fit for human consumption, but also not being allowed to reuse it to feed other animals.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, we must amend this regulation. We are importing large quantities of protein crops, soya in particular, from the USA and Brazil, all of which have been genetically modified. That is not an acceptable alternative. We need our own high-quality, safe supply from within the European Union. The manufacturing method used must meet the relevant standards and we must also ensure that no cannibalism occurs. In other words, pigs must only eat meat and bone meal made from poultry and vice versa. The Commission can make sure that this is what happens.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that tomorrow, following the very positive cooperation, a large majority will be in favour of taking this next step towards returning the situation to normal.</p>

    <intervention id="2-671-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="John Dalli" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss this important report on EU legislation on TSE and related feed and food controls. I would like to begin by congratulating Ms Roth-Behrendt on her excellent work. As a result of the enormous efforts made over recent years, the European Union has made impressive progress in its battle against BSE. We are – at last – about to eradicate the disease thanks to the strong and comprehensive EU measures to prevent and control it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The results of our intensive monitoring programme continue to show a significant overall decrease in the number of cases of the disease across the EU. Furthermore, the mean age of positive BSE cases in healthy slaughtered animals in the EU has increased. This supports the belief that BSE contamination occurred during a well-defined period in the past, before the stringent measures came into force at Community level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given this positive trend and new scientific knowledge, we are now at the stage where further amendments of certain measures could be envisaged without endangering consumer health or changing our BSE eradication policy. It was on this basis that the Commission took the initiative to prepare its communication, ‘The TSE Road Map 2’ which was adopted and presented to you last July.</p>
      <p sl="en">‘The TSE Road Map 2’ is a reflection paper on future amendments over the short, medium and long term. I should be clear, however, that it will not change our overall policy to protect all consumers at all times.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me touch briefly on the main topics of this communication. One of the key issues is the review of the total feed ban provisions, which have now been in place for over 10 years. I am fully aware of the expected impact that a future revision of the total feed ban would have, and that is why I have decided to launch discussions with various stakeholders. I must, however, make absolutely clear that all conditions, including scientific support and appropriate control tools, must be in place before any amendments can be adopted. In this respect, I am pleased that Parliament’s position is in line with that of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another issue is the revision of BSE surveillance. Some progress has already been made in this respect insofar as 25 Member States are authorised – as from 1 July 2011 – to revise their annual BSE monitoring programmes based on a scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.</p>
      <p sl="en">I take careful note of the fact that Parliament is concerned about a further rise in the age limits for testing cattle and I assure you I will keep this House informed of any future initiative in this domain.</p>
      <p sl="en">Rules for the removal of Specified Risk Materials, SRMs, the most important measure in terms of protection of public health against BSE, would also be amended in future to align them with international standards. However, this would only be possible if supported by robust scientific facts.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will firmly defend a step-by-step and science-based approach for any future revision of TSE measures: the scientific advice provided by EFSA will continue to play a crucial role in the consideration of future policy options.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me now to tackle two specific issues touched upon in your report. The first is the use of mechanically separated meat, MSMs. Again, I am pleased that Parliament’s position on this is in line with ours.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should add that the Commission services have already started to discuss with Member States how to harmonise the interpretation of ‘MSM’ to ensure a more informed approach across the European Union. This will be addressed in a guidance document or, if appropriate, by legislative amendments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second concerns food and feed controls and the shortcomings identified in the collection and presentation of data on official controls in Member States. On this point, the Commission, in close cooperation with Member States, will soon propose a number of actions to ensure that the way in which information on controls is collected, analysed and presented at EU level, is more efficient and comprehensive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I want to underline that our future strategy will not lose sight of other threats to animal and public health which have emerged in recent years, such as antimicrobial resistance. The balance of evidence points towards a need to better prioritise actions towards diseases that may have a bigger impact than TSEs in terms of public health, economy and society.</p>
      <p sl="en">The encouraging trends in relation to BSE merit a considered review of the opportunities to focus on, and secure, financial support to assess and manage these new threats.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, let me once again thank Ms Roth-Behrendt, and all the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety members for their work in preparing this valuable report. It will contribute positively to the debate on future measures for TSE, and other related food and food aspects. I look forward to hearing your views.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for including the shadow rapporteurs in the discussion at a very early stage. The result was a very good report. I would like to thank her once again for her constructive cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The way that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) have developed has already been described and the older Members of the House, by which I mean the ones who have been here a long time, will remember what we discussed in 1990 and how we acted at that time. If I am honest, I did not believe at the time that the legislation which we adopted then would be so successful. However, it has been a success and we have produced a very good result. The rapporteur has explained how the number of cases has fallen. For this reason, it is logical for the Commission to submit a new report based on this change in circumstances. It is also right for us to make changes in particular with regard to the very costly procedure which we have put in place.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can only agree with the rapporteur. The feed ban was purely a political decision. At the time, we should have restricted the ban on feeding animal protein so that it only covered ruminants. Then we would have achieved what we needed to. This is why I believe it is right for us to create an opening here, naturally on the basis of the criteria specified in the report.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to go a little further than the rapporteur when it comes to the change in the age of the animals. We should follow the Commission proposal of 72 months, which is something that we can support. I have tabled an amendment concerning the feeding of animals which may cause some irritation. Tomorrow I would like to delete the words ‘fit for human consumption’ in paragraph 7 part 3 of the split vote. This may sound a little mad, but in the hygiene legislation there is a passage which describes how certain parts of an animal are automatically unfit for human consumption, but are suitable for feeding to animals in the form of dry feed. We should take this into account and not call for a change here. We must continue to fund research in this area. We need to develop the post mortem process so that we can identify the disease more effectively.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Dalli, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, I would also like to thank you very much. I believe this is something that we urgently need. I would like to focus my remarks on one part of the report which concerns food and feed safety and, in particular, on paragraph 22 and paragraph 23.</p>
      <p sl="de">These paragraphs are about dioxin and about the contamination of feed and foodstuffs with dioxin, a subject that has caused us genuine concern over recent months and years. The best legislation is useless if it is not properly implemented in the Member States. I am calling on the Member States and, most importantly, on the Commission to pay special attention to dioxin contamination and to evaluate the thresholds for fish meal. Dioxin is not produced intentionally. It is one of a group of chemicals which occur naturally, but which are not biodegradable. They are also not water soluble and they collect and accumulate in fatty tissue. It is now possible to prove this, despite the fact that the methods used for doing so are rather complex and time-consuming. We are making an urgent call for the thresholds to be evaluated. We need to determine whether contamination on the scale currently caused by animal feeds can be prevented.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Dalli, I would like to urge you to intervene in the Member States immediately, in the context of our future agricultural policy, to ensure that the agricultural industry takes measures to prevent our soil from becoming further contaminated with dioxin.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Roth-Behrendt and the Commissioner. Twelve to 15 years ago, we experienced a nightmare. The images on the television were indeed reminiscent of hell, and the fear that spread across Europe was the stuff of nightmares. This situation cannot be described as anything other than an anxiety-laden nightmare. The situation has passed now, but at that time it was clear that a total ban on meat and bone meal was necessary. We did not know where the disease had come from, nor did we know where it would end. Now, 10 to 15 years later, we know a little more, but I would ask you to remember that we still do not know everything.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am very pleased that Commissioner Dalli mentioned the issue of antibiotics resistance, because that will be at least as bad, and significantly worse for public health, but it does not provide us with any dramatic, hell-like images, and it will therefore be more difficult to tackle.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, I think that it is time to review the total ban on meat and bone meal. We have a manifestly acute protein and feed shortage in Europe. It is somewhat immoral to throw food away when we could use it for a good purpose once again.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Now I would like to turn to the Commissioner. When it comes to this issue, to animal welfare, to antibiotics resistance or to the transport of animals, the key elements again and again are implementation, control and compliance. Without these we can completely forget about drafting any new laws.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, with what is happening with e.coli at the moment in Germany, France and other countries, I am a little surprised to note that it could be agued that, now we have solved the problem of animal-based meal, we should be able to give it to non-ruminants, including pigs, poultry and fish.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To start with, I used to think that we do in fact have a lot of animal-based meal and that we could give it to all non-ruminants and herbivores, eliminate everything to give it to omnivores or carnivores. In fact, however, I see that, even if there were a whole set of constraints in place, we would not succeed. How are we going to monitor the existence of differentiated sectors? Let us take the example of a farm on which poultry and cattle co-exist. There will be animal-based meal for the poultry and other food for the cattle. The operator can easily make a mistake and give to the cattle what he gave to the poultry; there will be no guarantee, even if monitoring is carried out. I therefore asked a number of scientists, who told me that, as regards the problem of prion, which caused Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans, there were still a huge number of scientific uncertainties.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as consumers are concerned therefore – I know, Mr Dalli, that you are highly sensitive to the health of consumers – we must regain their confidence. You saw what happened with e.coli and you know the story about the cucumber. We learned that the cucumber was not to blame. I cannot see how, at the present time, farmers can be authorised to give animal-based meal to pigs and poultry. I believe that the solution is to say that our scientific knowledge is incomplete, draconian control and monitoring cannot be carried out, even if it is written into the texts, and that, as a precaution, it is better to place a ban on the feeding of animal-based meal to all animals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all can I warmly congratulate the rapporteur. I think there is no better person in this House to bring forward this report. Her experience, going back to the last parliament and things that have been outlined, is well known. I know she has certain views, but she has got to understand that those of us who come from the UK react maybe in a different way when we talk about bringing this back, because of the experiences which Mrs Paulsen referred to earlier on.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can support the rapporteur in a lot of what she says in her report and very much the compromise on the issue of tolerance, because we have got to understand that those who actually produce the feedstuff produce it in very difficult circumstances. Mills producing feedstuff are dusty, so let us be very realistic about that.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, Commissioner, if you are going to move forward – and I personally have no objections to you moving forward – I ask you to move slowly and make sure that you take the people with you and explain every detail. I think that is going to be very important but I think above all else we must inform the people where we are going.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I should like to start by saying that it has been mentioned here several times that in recent years we have witnessed a huge decline in the number of cases and that, if we have witnessed this, it is because there were controls, because there was monitoring, and because there were measures dominated, not by laxity, but by rigorous control of consumer safety and food security.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that is the idea behind the report presented to us by my colleague Mrs Roth-Behrendt. The idea is to maintain this control and rigour: we do not want to call into question issues as fundamental as consumer safety and food security.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is also why I would congratulate the rapporteur, and I wish to say so publically, on the solutions she has managed to find on issues as difficult as those of animal feed or of the age for testing cattle. These are difficult issues. They are issues bound up in the continuous controversy and tension between business, on the one hand, and the protection of consumers and public health, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My preference would be to do away once and for all with this form of cannibalism that is feeding animals with feed and remains processed from other animals of their own species, cattle or otherwise. That would be my preference, and for zero tolerance because it has to be zero tolerance for the sake of consumers; for the sake of public health.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, I shall conclude by saying that, given the pressures, the solutions found by the rapporteur are solutions that serve all of our interests, public and common.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, we seem to lurch from one health crisis to the next. Unfortunately, we had another epidemic recently, involving e.coli bacteria.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this alarming situation, although I acknowledge the excellent work done by the rapporteur, Mr Roth-Behrendt, I would like to express my concerns about the report’s proposal to review the ban on animal meal under certain conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As has been explained, this would affect non-ruminants, mainly poultry, pork and fish. The report also notes – and I share this opinion – that the significant drop in the number of cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the European Union should not result in less stringent measures or a reduction of the strict surveillance and control mechanisms in place in the EU. Why, then, should we not stick to our guns on animal meal and the potential health repercussions? Our citizens have genuine concerns. In my opinion, there is no justification for lifting the ban on feeding processed animal proteins to non-ruminants, albeit subject to certain conditions. There would still be health risks, not least the risk of cross-contamination on mixed livestock farms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is all very well putting controls in place, and it is all very well for this report to express immeasurable good faith, but I am afraid that in reality cross-contamination is inevitable. Any repercussions from these measures would undoubtedly hit meat consumption, because consumers would lose confidence. So let us take a longer-term view and promote a proper policy on developing vegetable proteins. It is certainly true that there is a protein deficit, but lifting the ban on animal meal, albeit only under certain conditions, cannot and must not be the solution at the current time.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fifteen years after the emergence of BSE, we should take stock of the implementation and prospects of the European legislative framework and the relative checks carried out on feed and food. As the rapporteur has said, figures show that the number of cases testing positive in the European Union has fallen from over 2 100 cases in 2001 to just over 65 cases in 2009, and in the light of this declining epidemiological trend we can conclude that the legislation implemented helped to eradicate BSE.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is why the report we are about to vote on is an important opportunity to show commitment and responsibility in moving towards aligning legal provisions with the actual situation in terms of risk. One good signal in this regard is the review of the ban on using animal meal in feed. The period of panic having passed, scientific progress shows that the time is now ripe for reviewing the ban on feeding non-ruminants with processed animal protein. This is an important new factor, and one which, in full compliance with food safety rules, is of strategic importance, particularly in light of the EU’s current protein deficit.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, it is naturally important not to lower our guard in terms of checks and monitoring. We need to make sure we do not threaten the extraordinary progress Europe has made in consumer and animal health protection.</p>

I concur with the view that new solutions must be put in place, given that we have a deficit on the feed market, or in other words a protein deficit. However, I am in full support of preventing the possibility of animal cannibalism, which means the use of feed obtained from the same species. In general, I support the solutions proposed by the rapporteur, and I will vote in favour of adopting the report she has drafted.</p>

    <intervention id="2-682-000" speaker_id="38398" name="Esther de Lange" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, you have already pointed out that we are debating a sensitive topic here that gave rise to the necessary discussion even within the political groups, namely the possibility that the use of animal meal may be permitted once again. It is sensitive because past abuses of the use of animal meal gave rise to BSE, resulting in many animals having to be culled and also human deaths. Clearly, if the use of this kind of animal meal is to be permitted once again, this must not be allowed to give rise to that kind of abuses.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is why we are only discussing feeds for non-ruminants – obviously with no animal meal to be fed to animals of that species – and controls, as tests have now been developed, and this is the major difference from the debate of a few years ago, that can differentiate what kinds of animal feed are actually being dealt with. Under these conditions, the partial lifting of the ban on animal feed is justified. Not only is it justified, in fact, but also desirable. It is desirable from an animal welfare point of view as chickens and pigs are, of course, omnivores and a solely plant-based diet is actually sub-optimal for them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Good animal proteins would be used in such cases, instead of them being thrown away or fermented as at present. The EU is only 30% self-sufficient when it comes to plant proteins for animal feeds: we have to import 42 million tonnes of them every year. I hope that putting animal meal back into use can also make some contribution to reducing that dependence.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To sum up, I support the Commission’s approach, but only with the right conditions and subject to strict controls.</p>

Therefore, it will be important for us to set up projects relating to the area of feeds in the Eighth Framework Programme for Research and Technical Development, in order to safeguard the production of healthy feedstuffs and foods. This represents a major opportunity for Europe to be seen as a healthy continent on international markets and I believe that we should make the most of it.</p>

The European Parliament admitted the need to revise the ban on the use of animal protein sources for non-ruminants two months ago, based on the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. I completely agree that the current health regulations do not contain anything to justify a ban on animal proteins in the feed of non-ruminants. This ban has to be lifted as soon as possible. Today’s debate only reinforced what several fellow Members have said before, and I share their opinion, that there is such a great shortage of feed and such a vulnerability in Europe that we need to import genetically modified feedstuffs from outside the EU, from America, which is an overwhelming reason to adopt the proposal of Mrs Roth-Berendt.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is caused by prions, an abnormal form of protein, which turn brain tissue into a sponge-like substance. I would like to remind everyone of the cases of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) in people, of BSE in cattle and of scrapie in sheep and goats. BSE spread rapidly during 1997 and 1998 because processed animal proteins contaminated with BSE were fed to cattle. The strict measures taken resulted in a dramatic fall in the number of cases. This is all about the health and safety of people and animals. For this reason, our actions must be based on the precautionary principle, in order to guarantee the maximum protection for consumers and the highest possible levels of food safety.</p>

We should not forget the consequences of being over-hasty. All our actions should be guided by common sense and comply with the appropriate safety measures. It is important to carry out further research, since there can be no question of us having achieved a complete success. It is therefore vital to remain vigilant and to monitor closely the development of TSEs, in order to prevent a further crisis of this type. The actions we take must be aimed at implementing detailed checks on feed, with a view to ensuring that hazardous substances which increase the risk of an epidemic are not found in circulation. All of these measures will make it possible to conclude at an earlier date our efforts to overcome the threat, which is still real and to which we should pay attention, and they will also make it possible to limit the protein deficit.</p>

We need clear provisions which will be unanimously accepted and applied so as to be able to reduce the incidence of TSE across Europe, with the hope that this scourge will be eradicated one day. Animal health and consumer safety are obviously the number one priority. These are principles that we cannot deviate from and are supported by this report, which provides a suitable framework beforehand for devising future measures.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I agree with the rapporteur in relation to the key goals of this piece of work, of providing consumer confidence and protection. Improving animal health and the eradication of TSEs are, of course, most important. I am concerned that the Commission has suggested reducing EU funding for research. The number of cases has reduced significantly from 2001 as a result of the steps taken, but we cannot afford to let down our guard on this issue. Any changes in the regulation should be as a result of clear scientific evidence, ensuring surveillance is not reduced and that the sample size for testing is adequate to detect BSC.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any lifting of the feed ban must be thoroughly investigated and the issue of cross contamination fully addressed. I am concerned by colleagues in this Chamber who indicate that, because of a protein deficit in Europe, we should therefore simply move on. I feel very strongly that this would be disturbing for consumers, for farmers, for processors and for new markets that exporting countries like Northern Ireland would want to get into.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, mad cow disease and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD) are linked to each other. If you have not seen someone die of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, I can tell you as a doctor that it is terrible. We state that there are fewer cases and that the incidence in Europe is falling thanks to our measures. That is excellent, but I would like to point out to everyone here who is aware of this fact, including the Commissioner and certainly the Council and the Polish Presidency, that we also thought that tuberculosis had been eradicated in Europe, but now we see the exact opposite.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is now a serious social and health risk. I would also like to add to what Mrs Grossetête said, and point out that ease of access to meat and bone meal for use in animal feed may cause the slow viruses and diseases we are debating here today to appear in our countries again. I would also finally like to mention the issue of dioxins. As has been said here, we must devote a lot more attention to this health problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me once again thank Parliament for this valuable report. When considering matters relating to BSE, the protection of consumers is my main goal. It is of overriding importance when considering any changes to the current rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I do not agree with a ‘do nothing and keep the status quo’ attitude. We cannot live in the past. It is our duty to revise any regulation or measure that we have adopted in the past for precautionary reasons and see whether it is still applicable in the current situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Scientific advice from EFSA and other national institutions has told us that we can move on. We are not moving on simply because of protein deficits. We are moving on because it is our belief that it is safe to move on, and the advice we have received has been unequivocal in this regard. I appreciate Mr Nicholson’s advice to move judiciously on these matters and this is what we will be doing.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason, the Commission will remain alert and continue to monitor the BSE situation very closely. A re-emergence of the disease cannot be ruled out if we fail to remain vigilant. Member States also have their share of responsibility in this domain and should not be complacent. We must not forget the past – even if we are heading firmly in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, in conclusion I would like to look at one point and that is the question of the feed ban which was introduced in 2001. I understand the fact that not all of you have been as closely involved with this subject over the last 15 years as I have. However, it is important for you to know that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) came about because illegal, undeclared feed containing processed ruminant protein was wrongly fed to cattle. In other words, sheep suffering from scrapie made their way into the meat and bone meal and this infected a similar species, namely another ruminant.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report, which I am sure you have all read, and this is directed at Mrs Grossetête, Mrs Rivasi and also Mrs Werthmann, specifically does not state that it will be possible to process ruminants to produce meat and bone meal. Ruminants are specifically excluded. Only pigs and poultry will be processed to make meat and bone meal. Even if the wicked farmers whom Mrs Rivasi mentioned actually exist and even if these nasty farmers do something illegal, in other words, feeding pig meat and bone meal to cattle, nothing would happen to the cattle. Therefore, and you can really believe me, because I will not do anything in relation to BSE and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) without thinking about it in great detail, I am calling on you once again to consider this carefully.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Häusling, Mrs Rivasi’s fellow Member, drafted an excellent report on the protein deficit in the European Union. We must not throw away other parts of animals that we eat because we cannot or do not want to process these parts which are fit for human consumption. This is what we did until 2001. The correct reaction at that time would have been to continue using meat and bone meal, but not to process cattle and sheep to produce it. That would have been the sensible solution. However, we rather overshot the mark and took our populist approach a little too far.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now it is time to correct this mistake. In the meantime, 10 years have passed and it is clear that meat and bone meal is a valuable source of protein, just as valuable as soya from Brazil and the USA and perhaps a better solution than creating monocultures in those countries and importing genetically modified plants into the European Union. I am calling on Parliament to take a unified stand tomorrow. I would ask you all to support my proposal.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I am certain that many of you remember the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy epidemic at the end of the 1990s, caused by cattle being given feed containing BSE-infected animal proteins. As a response to the fatal epidemic the EU adopted the so-called TSE Regulation in 2001, banning the use of animal proteins in the feed of livestock bred for food production. Thanks to the stringent measures and regular monitoring programmes, the occurrence of the infectious Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy decreased significantly from 2167 positive cases in 2001 to only 67 in 2009. In view of the favourable epidemic situation, we should consider lifting the feed ban on animal proteins. We also need to consider the significant protein deficit in the EU, as a result of which Europe has to cover two-thirds of its protein feed demand from imports. The demand for mainly South-American soy imports could be decreased by using certain animal proteins produced from non-ruminants, which would have the added benefit of making European animal breeding more profitable. However, in spite of these arguments, I consider it important to emphasise that the ban can only be lifted if other measures provide sufficient guarantees that a situation similar to the one in the 1990s will not occur again in Europe. Although technological advances allow certain changes, the current ban can only be lifted if strict safety regulations – such as the exclusion of cannibalism, the use of reliable analytical procedures and strict separation of production lines – are complied with.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I welcome the proposal of the European Commission on allowing the use of certain animal proteins as feedstuff while meeting the strict food safety requirements.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Europe can only produce less than one-third of its protein feed demand, and covers the rest from soy imports mainly from South-America. This not only increases the vulnerability of European animal breeding farmers, but raises serious environmental and climate protection concerns. The increasing demand for soy prompts South-American producers to grow it on ever-expanding areas. However, they can only increase agricultural land by destroying rain forests.</p>
      <p sl="hu">More than 10% of the cultivated land in the EU would be needed to replace protein imports completely. Thus, in the light of present circumstances, it is obvious that our dependency cannot be eliminated by increasing the production of European protein plants alone. Moreover, climate conditions in most parts of the continent do not allow the production of soy, the most competitive protein crop.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, the use of animal proteins could ease the demand for soy import, and thus make European animal breeding more sustainable and profitable.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome the opportunity to discuss human rights and our trade agreement with Colombia and Peru in line with the fundamental values the EU holds dear. Let me start by saying very clearly that there is no leniency in the Commission in any form whatsoever on such grave matters. We are fully aware that threats and attacks against human rights activists in Colombia continue and I deplore them. In the specific and tragic case of Mrs Córdoba the Colombian Government has not only unequivocally condemned her killing but has also offered a reward for any information leading to the identification of her killer.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also taking measures to strengthen the safety of victims as well as activists and their leaders. On every possible occasion the EU is actively raising the issue of human rights and in particular the need to guarantee the personal safety of human rights defenders in Colombia. Only last week the EU held a human rights dialogue with the Colombian authorities in Bogotá and raised individual cases in this context. The parties also discussed the land restitution law and ways to combat impunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two weeks ago I personally raised the human rights issued with President Santos to tell him how close this is to the heart of the people in the EU and their elected representatives. He gave me an unequivocal response that the course that he has set for his country towards the full restoration of law, in the practice of respect for human democracy and the rule of law, is definite and resolute. I assure you the Colombians know that the Commission means business when it comes to approving their human rights record.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now as regards the agreement with Colombia, it is the view of the Commission that the EU would be overlooking its responsibilities if it were to walk away from an enhanced economic partnership with Colombia. If we were to do so we would fail to support the transition of this country from a culture of conflict and violence to a society of freedom and opportunity. There is indeed not a single doubt in my mind that the trade agreement, through the incentives it creates, will have a positive effect on Colombia’s civil society, its governance structures and the human rights situation in general.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sustainable improvement of the human rights situation in Colombia requires us to address the root causes of the violence in the country. These include poverty, social exclusion and a lack of economic opportunity in some parts of the territory. The EU trade agreement coupled with our efforts in the development cooperation field will further this economic development, create jobs and reduce poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular our contribution will be significant in creating the means of income generation that provide viable alternatives to drug cultivation whose stranglehold has been a main driver for Colombia’s internal conflict and for the human rights violations that it entails. If this overall approach were to fail, the human rights provisions that we negotiated in the trade agreement fully address the human rights challenges that Colombia is facing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Article 1 of the agreement states that respect for fundamental human rights as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights constitutes an essential element of the trade agreement. In the event of violation of this essential element, the EU will be in a position to immediately, unilaterally and without prior consultation suspend the agreements. It is clear to me that our fundamental objective to consolidate and support democracy, the rule of law and human rights will be fully safeguarded thanks to these strong provisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition our agreement includes a number of binding commitments to effectively implement core labour and environmental conventions and makes provision for a mechanism for monitoring the implementation of labour standards which allows for the participation of civil society organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement with Colombia and Peru is a trade pact for development which requires, unlike our GSP autonomous preferences scheme, full reciprocity of commitments and contains solid human rights guarantees. In the coming months you will soon have the opportunity to give your consent to this agreement. I urge you to take this overall balance into consideration and approve the conclusion of this agreement when the time comes.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank you very much, Commissioner, for your answer which sounds very positive. However, I would like to emphasise once again that the problem lies in the fact that there was already a human rights clause in the old preferences scheme and it did not help to prevent the violations of human rights which took place under the Uribe government and before that. Therefore, my question was specifically: What exactly will be different? How do the EU and the Commission intend to guarantee in future that these violations of human rights will not be repeated?</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, I have figures which show that under the new government in the last 300 days there have been more than 200 attacks on human rights activists. Also 15 leaders who supported human rights and the fair distribution of land in the agricultural sector have been murdered. When I look at what is happening, I have to ask once again: How exactly are you going to ensure that you can prevent this? I still do not know what the answer to this question is.</p>

      <p sl="en">First of all, the word ‘ensure’ which you are using is a somewhat difficult word. We are not an insurance company: we are a political body that has been negotiating a free trade agreement with Colombia in good faith and with very clear provisions with regard to fundamental rights. These provisions are an essential part of the agreement and enable us to suspend it without prior consultation in the event of gross infringements.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is different from the existing GSP arrangements because, under the GSP scheme, agreements cannot be suspended without first holding an inquiry. This agreement goes further since it can even be suspended without prior consultation. But it is not only about this: it is also about creating new opportunities through the trade agreement. And it is by eradicating poverty, by giving new opportunities to people, that we will be able to do this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, I will say that I am convinced that the authorities are doing everything possible to stop this, that they are very honest with respect to this. But you should not forget that we are speaking about a country that two decades ago was – and has been in the decades since – at war.</p>
      <p sl="en">I remember the first time I went to Colombia at the beginning of the 1980s: just walking a couple of hundred metres in the main street of Bogotá in daytime was dangerous. So the situation is much better than it was then, far better. The governments, be it that of Uribe, or now that of Santos, are really serious in trying to combat this danger.</p>

And if, because of the privatisation, there should be a merger that has an EU dimension, then it would be the direct responsibility of my services, as I am Commissioner for Competition, to analyse whether this merger complies with EU rules. This is not, of course, a legal answer, it is a political one. In any case, I think we could provide a much more precise answer about the EU laws, regulations and directives that would apply.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 14 by Gay Mitchell (H-000234/11)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: National Asset Management Agency</p>
      <p sl="unknown">It is now over a year since the Commission approved the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) in Ireland under State aid rules. In light of the potential effects of the NAMA scheme on European competition law, the Commission requested, and obtained, a commitment from the Irish authorities that yearly reports would be submitted to both the Commission and the Irish national competition authorities on the use of NAMA’s post-acquisition powers.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">A year on, is the Commission still satisfied with the NAMA scheme?</p>

      <p sl="en">As the Member correctly says, paragraph 74 of the Commission decision on the NAMA case in 2009 includes a commitment from the Irish authorities to report yearly on the use of some of the post-acquisition powers conferred on NAMA by the legislator. On 16 February this year, the Commission received the first yearly report on the use of post-acquisition powers.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have not raised any concerns on the use of the aforementioned powers mentioned by NAMA for the period covered by this report. In addition to assessing the report on the use of post-acquisition powers, the Commission follows NAMA’s operations closely, both directly and indirectly. As for direct monitoring, we have adopted two decisions in the period up to June 2011, one for each of the two first tranches of assets that have been transferred to NAMA and notified to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">These decisions stem from the commitment to notify each individual tranche of transfer assets set out in the aforementioned paragraph 74 of the decision and indirect monitoring is carried out through the assessment of the impact on the financial institutions participating in the NAMA scheme.</p>

Can I say that I am very pleased with the reply that I have received from the Commissioner?</p>
      <p sl="en">But what is crucially important is that the Commission keeps its eye on the situation, because we are in the early stages of an experiment that we have never had before, in which stressed assets are being taken over by NAMA. What is crucially important is that the hospitality sector, with its multi-million euro hotels, which cost the Irish taxpayer and the banks a lot of money, is kept under review and does not contravene the competition laws.</p>

We know how important it is and the huge volume of assets and resources that they have to manage, and that there is a lot at risk for Irish taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time we are looking very closely at the individual cases of restructuring of the banks that benefited from this outsourcing of the bad assets towards NAMA. We decided last week on the liquidation of Anglo Irish and INBS; we are waiting until the end of this month of July for the reception of the restructuring plans both of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, according to the programme that Ireland subscribed to with the EU, the IMF and the ECB, and we will look very closely at those restructuring plans.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Can the Commission outline the advantages and disadvantages of plans by the Irish Government to create two-pillar institutions in the Irish banking sector? On a recent visit to Ireland, the Commissioner for Competition noted concerns in relation to this strategy.</p>

      <p sl="en">As Mr Gallagher has pointed out, the Commission has recently expressed some concerns about the situation regarding competition in the banking sector in Ireland. I myself expressed these concerns over the medium term.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, on 31 March the Irish Minister of Finance announced the government’s plans regarding the future of the Irish banking sector. In particular the Minister announced the merger of Allied Irish Banks with EBS. The Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland are now the two pillar banks in Ireland. This decision by the present Irish Minister of Finance, Mr Noonan, has been endorsed by the IMF, the ECB and the Commission. The Commission also sees the rationale for the merger of Allied and EBS, as it clearly serves a financial stability purpose in the short term, which in the current climate is an advantage.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is a matter of concern – and I personally express this concern – is the situation of the Irish retail banking market in the medium to long term. For financial and stability reasons and because of what has happened with other financial institutions in Ireland – I have just mentioned that Allied Irish Banks is in liquidation and we decided on this liquidation process last week – in the short term there is no alternative other than to base the functioning of the banking sector in Ireland on these two pillars – Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">But this situation should not mean that over the medium term the barriers to entering into the banking sector in Ireland will increase because of the short-term situation of a de facto duopoly. We will be monitoring very closely to ensure these barriers to entry will not be increased and we will carefully encourage other players to enter into the Irish banking system gradually. In the short term there is probably no alternative to the present situation but in a few years – hopefully – the situation will improve and will be completely different from the present one. In that case, maintaining a duopoly would present a serious risk for competition and in real terms for the citizens of Ireland, who will require a competitive, dynamic and efficient banking sector.</p>

He referred to our Finance Minister, Mr Noonan, and his announcement in March. You will be aware that in the United States, in Washington, he announced his intention to impose losses on EUR 3.2 billion of senior unsecured guaranteed bonds.</p>

      <p sl="en">We clearly support the liability management that is taking place with subordinated bondholders.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question of the senior bondholders is a different one given that, because of the way the decisions were taken in the recent past at the beginning of the crisis, these senior bondholders have a strong state guarantee. So, one way or another, the taxpayers are supporting their interests. In this case I can share the concerns that have been expressed, among others, by the President of the ECB about the negative consequences that the imposition of this kind of haircut on the senior bondholders can have.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I praise the exercise of the liability management with subordinated debt bondholders. In such cases – with Anglo Irish or in other cases – as in all the other financial institutions which are under restructuring because of the consequences of the financial crisis and the intervention of the state giving public resources for the rescue and restructuring of those banks, we are always taking decisions that will try to distribute the burden of the operation in a fair way. This is one of the three elements that we always take into account when analysing the restructuring plans that are submitted to the Commission and when adopting our own decisions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Thank you, Commissioner, for your very comprehensive reply and your understanding of the banking situation in Ireland. In particular I welcome your comments that you are encouraging other players to enter the Irish market.</p>
      <p sl="en">At present we have a number of banks in the Irish market, for example KBC, who are doing very well indeed. Can I ask the Commission if it would have any objection to the establishment of a further Irish domestic bank? This is because, like in Greece, there is a lot of private money in Ireland. It is a case of setting down new terms, new standards, new protocols and new conditions. So would the Commission have any objection if a whole new Irish bank – or several Irish banks – were to emerge in the market to avail of the capital that is there?</p>

Your argument here is the existence of earlier guarantees, yet, at the same time, we have Angela Merkel saying that post-2013 there will be burden-sharing.

      <p sl="en">What kind of measures will encourage market players or potential new entrants? First of all, there is the question of solving the present problems. I have my doubts that, even under the best possible conditions, a lot of new entrants will be knocking at the door of the Irish banking system under the present circumstances. Hopefully in one or two or three years the situation will have improved and will be much better than today.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we were discussing the previous restructuring plans, we suggested to the banks in Ireland, for instance in the case of Bank of Ireland, that we should adopt the decision in relation to the first and previous restructuring plan that, if new entrants were to knock at the door, they should help their future competitors to enter the market.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that these kinds of measures are possible and will be necessary, but I stress in the short term that financial instability concerns prevail. Now we need to seriously restructure these banks and put them on a sound footing with a viable business model able to finance the activity in Ireland, both households and companies. But in the future, and I hope in the foreseeable future, we can tell these banks that have been restructured with public money that they should provide some help to new entrants to enter the market in a successful way. This is what I can say today.</p>
      <p sl="en">You mentioned a known institution that is present in Ireland, but this institution is also under a restructuring plan. So we need to call for new entrants, but first of all the new entrants should also be in a sound position.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning 2013 and the Angela Merkel comments: that is in the new mechanism and the revision of the Treaty. One thing to anticipate is that you can be subject to a contribution for restructuring a debt or a kind of haircut under certain circumstances that the issuers announce and the subscribers are aware of at the beginning. It is a completely different matter to change the rules of the game in the middle of the match.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 16 by Mairead McGuinness (H-000247/11)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Proper functioning of the food supply chain</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The share of agriculture in the food supply chain fell from 29% in 2000 to 24% in 2005, while over the same period the share of the food industry, wholesale and distribution sector all increased (Commission CAP Communication November 2010).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does the Commission believe that competition policy has a role to play in addressing concerns regarding the proper functioning of the food supply chain and to ensure that producers are paid a fair price, given that these figures demonstrate that a growing share of revenue is being taken by others in the supply chain who have market power over primary producers?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What existing competition law provisions could be used to address this issue and where could the application of these provisions be broadened?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does the Commission intend to tackle the lack of transparent pricing in the food supply chain?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Would the Commission consider it beneficial to initiate a sector inquiry to examine the behaviour of dominant actors in the supply chain and to determine how to address the unfair commercial practices that undoubtedly exist?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-720-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, lack of competition in any sector stifles modernisation of production, leads to higher prices for consumers, worse products and, ultimately, to a less competitive sector. It is important that the food supply chain remains competitive, with efficiencies passed on to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">For that purpose, the competition rules – Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty – ensure that cartels and abuses of dominant position are sanctioned and that companies have access to the market and supplies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Farmers should also increase efficiency to improve their position in the food supply chain. The EU agricultural sector needs consolidation and rationalisation to achieve this. EU competition policy can contribute to this goal, to the extent that Article 101 of the Treaty allows farmers to develop sustainable and pro-competitive forms of cooperation to become more efficient, innovative, and better equipped to face competition both within and outside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">You will be aware of the work undertaken within the high-level forum for a better functioning food supply chain, which includes a wide range of initiatives including the European price monitoring tool. You will also be aware that the Director-General for Competition is working in close cooperation with the national competition authorities within the European competition network. Over recent years a number of national competition authorities have actively undertaken sector inquiries to identify potential malfunctions in the food markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will submit a detailed report of the most significant actions taken in recent years by the national competition authorities in the food sector to the high-level forum by autumn of this year. The Commission will inform Parliament of this report at the time of its submission.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the sector inquiries, decisions to launch this kind of study are carefully considered, in line with the strategic priorities set by the Commission. To ensure the effectiveness of its actions, the Commission cannot announce in advance which sector might possibly be investigated.</p>

Would the Commission not agree that the victims in all of this are the small farmers who have limited cash flow and the small retail outlets that are increasingly being squeezed out of business by the multinationals and the big retail chains? What does the Commission propose to do to get a proper balance between the two?</p>
      <p sl="en">Would the Commissioner, who has been very forthcoming, not agree that, once the huge supermarket chains achieve total dominance and get a stranglehold on the retail market, the two groups that are really squeezed are the producers, particularly small producers, on the one hand, and the consumers on the other hand?</p>

      <p sl="en">As you know, we have been analysing these issues in recent years in a kind of task force, involving a lot of Commissioners, our respective services, and the stakeholders in the sector, so I think we now have a sound knowledge of where the problems lie along these value chains. Certain problems lie in my direct area of responsibility – competition policy. Others are being dealt with by my colleague, Dacian Cioloş, the Agriculture Commissioner, or by the Commissioners for trade, consumer protection or health, for example.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my view, as Competition Commissioner, the solution for the farmers will not be to organise cartels; it will be to become more efficient, and farmers have lots of possibilities open to them, in compliance with the competition rules under Article 101 of the Treaty, to increase their bargaining power, to improve the vertical integration of their activities and to be able to negotiate on a sound footing with the distribution chains or their intermediaries. We have excellent examples within the EU of these kinds of strategy for improving dynamism, efficiency and quality and improving bargaining power against other parts of the value chain.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that, on some occasions, farmers say they are not used to organising themselves into cooperatives or integrating themselves into a vertical chain. Nonetheless, I think this is the right way to go. There are also problems elsewhere along the chain but, according to our knowledge – which has improved over recent years with this analysis – these problems are better dealt with at national level by the national competition authorities. In fact, during the last few years, several national competition authorities have carried out sectoral studies and are adopting a lot of decisions to improve competition and improve the functioning of the value chain. All this is taking place from a competition point of view: there are also other structural policies that should help the whole sector to function better.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the end of the day, we need to protect farmers and we need to consider consumers. These are the two ends of the value chain, and both extremes of the value chain should put pressure on all the authorities concerned, so that we can deal with the problems we are finding at intermediate stages along the chain. So far, from the competition point of view, our work in this sector in recent years has not had an EU dimension. However, many of the competition authorities at national level are doing a very good job, and in our report next autumn I hope to show you how the European competition network, through the national competition authorities, is contributing to the solutions you are seeking with your question.</p>

One of those is ‘hello money’, and that is being dealt with in the programme for government.

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Financing of Belene nuclear power plant with state aid</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Under the EU’s Nuclear Illustrative Programme, projects to build nuclear power plants in the Union may not be funded via state aid, and other solutions need to be identified, such as financing by private operators or from the capital markets. The planned Bulgarian state guarantees for the Belene project fall under the heading of ‘state aid’.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In this connection, would the Commission approve financing for the Belene project which was contingent in one way or another on state guarantees?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Has the Commission’s Competition DG been consulted by the Bulgarian Government, under the urgent procedure, as to whether this type of financing could be approved and, if so, what stage have the consultations reached?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does the BGN 300 million already allocated to the construction of the Belene plant in 2008 constitute state aid? Have proceedings been opened in that regard and, if so, when will the relevant decision be announced?</p>

      <p sl="en">The Commission has not been approached either formally or informally by the Bulgarian authorities concerning possible notification of a potential state aid issue regarding the future financing of the Belene project. The Commission has recently requested clarification from the Bulgarian authorities on the subject, but no information has been received so far. It is thus premature to draw conclusions as to whether possible state guarantees or other ways of financing the project in the future may or may not be in line with EU state aid rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards past financing, the Commission has investigated the matter following a complaint. Based on the Council of Ministers decree of 27 October 2008, BGN 300 million were allocated from the state budget with a view to increasing the capital of NEK-EAD, the Bulgarian national electricity distributing company, in order to implement the project of building this nuclear power plant, the Belene nuclear power plant.</p>
      <p sl="en">The information showed that the capital injection was performed in the light of considerations and prospects, and under conditions, that would have prompted a private investor to carry it out. Furthermore, the project was subject to an invitation for expressions of interest from strategic investors addressed to prospective private co-investors in May 2007. Several of them replied positively, showing interest in the project based on the available prospects at the time.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is additional evidence that private investors also consider investment in the project at market terms to be justified. On that basis and pending the further information requested from Bulgaria as to future plans for the financing of the project, it would be premature to conclude that state aid financing is planned for the future and, if so, when the Commission could take a decision on the matter.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Can the Commission comment on the situation where Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 would prevent drivers from working more than 30 hours per week? What remedies would the Commission propose?</p>

He has the opportunity on a Saturday to drive another run for between six and nine hours, finishing on Saturday at 20.00 (including an uninterrupted break of 45 minutes), but the required weekly rest period of 45 hours means that he cannot start his school bus run at 08:00 on Monday.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How does the Commission propose to deal with situations like this where the application of the directive means that drivers – as in this example – are restricted to driving 30 hours per week and unable to earn a living?</p>

      <p sl="en">Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 does not prevent drivers from working longer than 30 hours per week. Normal weekly driving time is 45 hours averaged over two consecutive weeks and 56 hours as a maximum.</p>
      <p sl="en">Similarly Working Time Directive 2002/15/EC allows for a maximum of 60 hours of weekly working time, provided that the average of 48 hours per week is respected. In fact driving a bus on regular routes shorter than 50 kilometres is a transport operation which does not fall within the scope of the regulation.

The driver in such a case does five to six hours per day, five days a week but, because he may drive eight to nine hours on a Saturday, according to the Road Safety Authority in Ireland he cannot start work at 8 a.m. the following Monday morning.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 21 by Ismail Ertug (H-000226/11)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Commission's position on mega-trucks</p>
      <p sl="unknown">So-called mega-trucks are to be brought into operation for trial purposes in freight transport in some German Länder. Given that these trucks weigh up to 60 tonnes and are more than 25 metres long, there is no doubt that they will cause more wear and tear on infrastructure than conventional lorries. There is also a risk that using these vehicles will cause lasting damage to the goal of bringing about a modal shift to rail transport.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the Transport White Paper the Commission referred to independent studies on the possible use of longer and heavier trucks. Have these studies already produced results? Does the Commission have a clear position for or against the use of mega-trucks?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-734-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mega-trucks is a hot topic and will remain so for a while. The maximum authorised weight and dimensions of vehicles for national and international road traffic are governed by EU legislation, namely Directive 96/53/EC, which does not currently authorise the longer and heavier trucks referred to by the honourable Member for international road transport.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some stakeholders in the road industry argue that significantly heavier and longer trucks would bring efficiency gains. The Commission needs to take into account all critical factors, including future traffic generation, facilitation of intermodal transport infrastructure capacity and upgrading and maintenance costs in its policy-making on the dimensions and weight of trucks.</p>
      <p sl="en">At present there is no uncontested evidence that the introduction of larger and heavier vehicles, through general acceptance of the European modular systems, would result in an overall reduction of energy consumption and emissions from the transport system as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will subject any proposal to amend current regulations to a thorough impact assessment, taking into account economic, social and environmental aspects. It nevertheless appears to the Commission that there may be a good case for limited change to current dimensions in order to improve the aerodynamics, and thereby the fuel efficiency, of vehicles.</p>
      <p sl="en">Limited changes may also be necessary to accommodate new standards of intermodal vehicles and to deal with electric vehicles and, perhaps, also journeys between adjoining countries which allow the use of longer trucks internally.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as you said, Mr Kallas, the gigaliners or monster trucks or whatever you want to call them are a controversial subject. You mentioned efficiency gains in terms of fuel consumption. I would like to know what exactly these efficiency gains are. I know that those in favour of these trucks say that you can make one truck out of two. This would ultimately result in warehousing as we know it today becoming less expensive and it would be cheaper to drive goods around on the streets than to store them in warehouses, with the result that making one truck out of two would actually have exactly the opposite effect. I would like to ask you to consider this, because it would mean that we would have more trucks on the roads than we did before.</p>
      <p sl="de">You have announced various studies on the subject of the monster trucks. What is happening with them? What results have you so far received? What are the next steps to be taken?

      <p sl="en">Germany is a country where bigger trucks are allowed, so the position here is not so black and white. Actually, you raised several issues on which I simply do not know the answer. These matters are much debated in technical circles too. Construction is a key factor: if a truck is heavier but the burden for the axis is spread differently then the actual burden on the road can be less. So all the aspects of how a given model is constructed in terms of manoeuvring, etc. need to be examined carefully. I have seen contradictory reports and arguments from both sides. Currently the Commission has no final or fixed position. We are looking carefully at all aspects.</p>
      <p sl="en">These bigger trucks are used in Nordic countries, where they are allowed and are not seen as a problem. At the same time in countries like Austria people are extremely opposed to them. They are concerned that this will be a big problem in terms of road structure in complex areas such as the Alps. We will not push for a radical decision that would provoke major opposition in society. We will listen to all arguments and then we will come up with a proposal. I cannot say what the efficiency gain will be because that depends very much on the various analyses and the construction of possible models.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Airlines' non-compliance with Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 with regard to protection and information for passengers</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 came into force in 2005, with the key aim of ensuring that airline passengers were protected and properly informed. The Commission has run its own awareness-raising campaigns on the subject, yet airlines repeatedly violate the regulation, leaving passengers without swift and effective remedies. Meanwhile, online booking has turned into a racket: a ticket from Brussels to Strasbourg with an ordinary carrier, advertised and heavily promoted at the price of EUR 98, ends up costing a total of EUR 219.60, including am additional ‘fuel fee’.</p>

      <p sl="en">This is very high on our agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">The correct application of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 on air passenger rights must be ensured by the designated national enforcement bodies in the Member States. They have to take all reasonable measures to ensure that the rights of passengers are fully respected. The Commission’s task is to ensure that EU law is correctly implemented and enforced by the Member States by constantly monitoring their activity.</p>
      <p sl="en">During the recent air traffic disruptions due to the Grimsvoetn volcano, right from the start of the disruptions the national enforcement bodies and the Commission services took a proactive approach, verifying with air carriers that they planned to put measures and procedures in place to help passengers in the event of disruption to flights, whenever this was necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore last April the Commission adopted a communication on the application of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 which identifies possible shortcomings of the regulation and proposes action to clarify and strengthen the enforcement of passenger rights. The Commission also announced an impact assessment in view of a possible revision of the regulation, which would also cover enforcement issues.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I hear what you are saying. Nonetheless, we have to recognise that for every incident which causes a flight to be delayed or cancelled, including those caused by what are deemed exceptional circumstances, air carriers do all they can to avoid taking responsibility for travellers and to avoid paying the compensation set out in the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A recent ruling by the European Court of Justice had to state, once again, that the concept of ‘exceptional circumstances’ is actually very limited and that in most cases, air carriers have an obligation to compensate travellers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You mentioned an impact assessment. Let me say again that I disapprove of this approach, which involves extremely costly assessments that do not always produce results.</p>

      <p sl="en">During my time as Transport Commissioner I have had three big disruptions in air traffic, and a fourth for cargo security as well, and we have definitely obtained a lot of experience during this time. The situation is not so bad. It was, of course, an extraordinary situation when the volcano erupted, and most airlines operated very responsibly. Yes, there were airlines which tried to avoid and to evade their responsibility, but most airlines operated quite reasonably. Most national enforcement bodies take this issue seriously – though yes, not all of them – and we monitor and try to enforce it, but this is in the hands of the national enforcement bodies. In the new regulations we will be more precise concerning extraordinary circumstances which can be a reason not to compensate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that overall the regulation works very well; there must certainly be some adjustment time for its correctives. Air traffic is of course a huge issue. This summer we warned all Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that there will be no big delays in traffic, because we foresee very many places where the traffic will increase delays. This machinery tries to do its best and of course we try also from our side to facilitate this functioning. The legislation is quite advanced and there will be some accommodation. Now we are opening the process of consultation, so it is for everybody to express their comments.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to suggest dividing my time into two parts: the first four minutes to make my speech, and the last two to answer questions from my fellow Members, if that is all right with you.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Vice-President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this first evening debate on the subject of transport. I would like to mention that between 2000 and 2010 we achieved the target we set ourselves to reduce the number of road fatalities, which stood at 50 000 in the year 2000. We did not succeed in reducing it by half, to 25 000, as planned. Instead, the figure now stands at 31 000, and therefore the new target that we have just set ourselves for the 2010-2020 period, to reduce these 31 000 road fatalities by half, requires new and important measures.</p>
      <p sl="es">The measure that I am proposing today is the result of an agreement that has a long history, which began in 2008, based on a proposal from the Commission that Parliament warmly welcomed, because it provided us with another instrument; indeed, it provides us with an instrument to continue and improve on that goal to reduce the number of road fatalities. It was calculated that we could prevent at least a further 400 road fatalities each year, not counting injuries. However, in 2008, after our first reading, the report stalled. I therefore invite you to calculate the number of lives we have failed to save in those three years during which the report and the implementation of this instrument were delayed. The truth is that I have criticised myself for that every day, specifically for not having been more diligent. It was not Parliament’s responsibility. It was the responsibility of the Council, which, with a blocking minority, did not accept the joint proposal from Parliament and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">Precisely with the aim of putting an end to this continuous flow of blood from the victims of road safety, we tried – with the Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies, whom I have to thank for having done everything possible and impossible to break the deadlock on this issue – and managed to unblock the issue, although the legal basis was changed. It required unanimous cooperation from the police, and there was the opt-out problem, since three Member States – the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark – had the option of remaining outside this new system definitively.</p>
      <p sl="es">There was also a series of problems concerning limitations or conditions for a procedure which, at first reading and in the Commission’s proposal, created a comprehensive system from the moment the offence is committed right up to the moment when the necessary sanction is enforced; all of this was done for the four offences which, at the time, were causing 75% of road fatalities: jumping a red light, breaking the speed limit, driving with a blood alcohol level higher than the legal limit, and not wearing a seat belt.</p>
      <p sl="es">In any case, with this new proposal and its new legal basis, we managed to enter a new, important climate of negotiation where we succeeded in breaking the deadlock on the issue. It is a first step, a vital step towards achieving this, as has been confirmed by associations of victims and the families of road victims, as well as expert groups. Right now we are waiting to find out if a procedural matter, such as correlation tables, which came up at the last minute, could bring us to a standstill once again.</p>
      <p sl="es">I only want to draw everyone’s attention to the importance of not blocking this directive.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to take part in the debate concluding the long process of negotiations on the cross-border exchange of information on road safety violations. This is an important directive. It will make it easier for the Member States to exchange information on individuals who have committed road traffic offences in a Member State other than the Member State where the vehicle is registered. It will make it possible to identify the owner of the vehicle’s logbook, and will make it possible for the authorities of the Member States to prosecute individuals who have violated road traffic regulations, regardless of their nationality.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that adopting the directive will help to make the European Union’s roads safer. Ensuring that drivers no longer go unpunished will have a preventive effect. It will deter ‘road pirates’, who too frequently and too willingly disregard the rules. The aim of this directive is essentially to save lives on Europe’s roads. In spite of the obvious benefits arising from the proposed directive, it has been the subject of negotiations for a long time.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A proposal for a directive was first presented by the European Commission in March 2008. The debate on the proposal was held during the French Presidency in the second half of 2008. In spite of the Member States’ support for the proposal and its main objectives, doubts emerged as to the choice of legal basis. As a result, the Council was not able to reach an agreement at this stage. It was agreed, however, that work should be continued in order to find a solution.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Council reviewed the dossier in July 2010, on the basis of a new proposal put forward by the Belgian Presidency. This proposal contained a new legal basis, in the shape of Article 87 of the Treaty, which relates to police cooperation. On 2 December 2010, the Council unanimously adopted an agreement on this proposal. The Council position was submitted to the European Parliament for first reading on 24 March 2011. At this point, I should like to thank Mrs Sender and the Hungarian Presidency for their efforts aimed at overcoming the various obstacles that have stood in the way of this difficult compromise.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The final point of contention as regards this dossier was the correlation tables. An agreement was finally achieved thanks to the joint statement by the European Parliament and the Council and the separate statement by the European Commission. I greatly regret that certain Members of Parliament are disputing this part of our agreement. It took us a great deal of time to reach this agreement, and it would be inordinately difficult to explain to EU citizens why a legislative act of such great importance has been blocked in its final stages because of a difference of opinion on a purely technical matter.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Correlation tables are one of the points of contention between the Council and the European Parliament. The Polish Presidency will endeavour to reach an agreement on such a politically sensitive issue. However, this will be significantly more difficult if individual legislative acts, such as the one the European Parliament is debating today, are blocked even though an agreement has been reached on their substance. I would therefore ask the honourable Members of this House to respect the outcome of the negotiations between the Council and Parliament and to vote in favour of adopting a directive which will help us improve safety on Europe’s roads.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission welcomes the efforts and commitment by all parties on this important issue, EU road safety policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against this background, I would like to thank all actors for their spirit of compromise and I would like to thank Inés Ayala Sender for her contribution, which has enabled us to try to achieve a second reading agreement on this long-awaited piece of road safety legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to single out the following key points on which the text has been significantly improved as a result of intensive negotiations between the Council and Parliament: the data protection regime, information letters to offenders, the revision of this directive – with a clear perspective on future initiatives concerning the road safety guidelines – and reinforced enforcement mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to reiterate that the Commission still considers that the legal basis for transport was more appropriate for this directive, but we can accept the substance of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, as an honest broker, supported both the Council and Parliament in order to find a balanced and satisfactory agreement. The text of the directive, as it stands now, offers a good mix of flexibility and ambition, as requested by Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission regrets the absence of correlation tables in this text but, in a spirit of compromise and in order to ensure the immediate adoption of the proposal, can accept the substitution of the obligatory provision on correlation tables, including in the text with the relevant recital encouraging Member States to follow this practice. I would urge you to accept the text in a second reading agreement and not risk reopening all points in conciliation for the sake of a horizontal issue such as a correlation table.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to make a few remarks concerning the history of this document, or this decision. When we started to push this decision it was considered to be heresy. It was considered by the Member States as an insult and an attack on the sacred principles of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Member States finally reached a compromise and made a decision. It was very close to failing to do so, but now the Council has reached a compromise. I have to ask you to wait: we have not yet reached an agreement on two issues – correlation tables on one hand and 250 million vehicles on the other – in this long-awaited decision to deal, finally, with cross-border traffic violations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Numbers show, for instance, that a foreign driver is three times more likely to commit an offence than a resident driver. EU figures suggest that foreign drivers account for 5% of traffic, but around 50% of speeding offences.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we must wait for a solution on these two things. It is a long-awaited piece of legislation. It was not easy to reach a compromise in the Council. If you think that the Council is a homogenous body which now opposes Parliament on the sole issue of correlation tables, this is not the case.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Grabarczyk, I would like to join with previous speakers in thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Ayala Sender. As has already been mentioned, the Council has been blocking progress on this dossier since 2008 and we only succeeded in reaching a compromise under the Belgian Presidency. The improved sharing of data between the Member States should, as has been said, make it possible in future to prosecute various traffic offences across national borders.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our main priority must be to improve road safety and to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the roads. Together with the own-initiative report by Mr Koch on road safety, which contains a series of very specific proposals, the repressive nature of this directive will help to ensure that the rules are followed. I do not need to go into these rules in detail because they have already been described here in positive terms.</p>
      <p sl="de">Changing the legal basis of European traffic policy to ensure police cooperation has finally enabled the Council to adopt a common position. However, the result of this has been that some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, have been excluded. This means that once again we do not have equality for all European citizens. Citizens must understand what rights they have with regard to data protection. We have attempted to make the rules in this area more stringent, so that access to the data that is collected and transmission and storage of the data are all regulated as strictly as possible. We were also very concerned about the information.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although the current text does not fully live up to Parliament’s expectations, I am still optimistic, because I believe that this is the first step in the right direction. I hope that we will be able to continue building on this foundation over the next few years in order to move towards further harmonisation of European traffic regulations. The revision clause inserted by Parliament should make this possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">I very much regret the fact that this report has ended up in the midst of the institutional conflict between the Council and Parliament about the correlation tables. During the trialogues we agreed that the joint statement on this subject would help us to find an overall compromise. I would very briefly like to remind everyone that tomorrow the European Association …</p>

      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, I read your twitter update today, and the news it contained was good. It revealed, specifically, that in 2010 deaths on our roads fell by 11% and that we are well on the way to halving the numbers of deaths by 2020. The directive that is currently on the table can play its small part in contributing to this and we must thus give it our emphatic backing. For a long time the Council disputed the legal basis for this directive. We lost a lot of time as a result. I want to avoid us now losing a lot more time in Parliament discussing the correlation tables. That is an important debate in itself, but I do not think that we should link it in to this dossier. As a result, my group will be supporting the compromise package without reservation and rejecting the amendment relating to the tables, as we must deal with what is really important, and that is reducing the number of road deaths, removing the sense of impunity that some drivers have when they drive in other countries …</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I was just saying that the feeling of impunity must be done away with and that with this directive we will help to bring that about. Is the result perfect? No, of course it is not. It is a first step, namely organising the exchange between Member States of data concerning the identity of drivers who violate a law in another country. In future, offenders will have their fines sent to their homes, along with any reminders, and in that way they will be encouraged to follow the rules.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Of course, we would have liked to have seen the Member States commit to also chase up their citizens who commit offences elsewhere, but we will perhaps be putting new measures in place in that regard in just a few years. That, sure enough, is the revision clause.</p>

      <p sl="et">I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Sender, and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation. This directive is above all necessary to increase protection for our citizens on the roads and to reduce fatalities due to traffic offences. This is a first important step in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="et">Having myself participated in numerous trialogues and negotiations, I am pleased that we have now reached a principled agreement. Speaking of agreements, I must unfortunately say that, compared with the report at Parliament’s first reading, this draft directive has lost a considerable amount both in terms of content and in terms of impact. The part on enacting penalties has been deleted, under pressure from the Council. We must, however, give the Council recognition for the fact that the increase in the number of offences from four to eight came just after the Council’s first reading. This left the impression that the Council had a sincere wish and desire to deal seriously with this issue. Unfortunately, at the Council’s request, the legal basis was also changed, which left out the aforementioned part on enacting penalties and changed the Directive such that it merely contained cross-border exchange of information. Because the directive focuses exclusively on exchange of information, I made several proposals in this area, most of which found support, and thanks to these, data protection and privacy were treated more clearly and strictly.</p>
      <p sl="et">I would now like to say more on the proposals that I submitted to this House regarding correlation tables. At Parliament’s first reading and in the Committee on Transport and Tourism’s in May this year, the idea of adding correlation tables to this directive was supported. Unfortunately, despite the opposition of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the last trialogue, this was removed. Today, the Conference of Presidents has unanimously supported correlation tables, which were the result of two decisions at last year’s Conference of Presidents and also the recent decision at the session of 30 June.</p>
      <p sl="et">On behalf of the ALDE Group, I can clearly state that we support the adoption of this directive. Of course, I am also striving to get the amendments I tabled adopted, but in any case the most important thing is the progress made on the compromise that has been achieved, and the adoption of that compromise.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur who has made a serious effort to bring about a compromise in this area. If we look at the various traffic figures, it becomes clear that in particular in areas where there is a lot of traffic from other countries, there are major differences in the frequency of accidents involving citizens of the country or the region in question and people travelling to this country for the first time. Why is this? It is certainly in part because they are driving in an area which is unfamiliar to them, but also because there is unfortunately no common sense on the roads and people ultimately only follow the rules if they know that they are likely to be punished for transgressing. That is a very sad fact.</p>
      <p sl="de">The result is this regulation because we need to take action if we really want to bring the accident figures down. However, the Council has very rapidly put a stop to the plans made by Parliament and the Commission. All that now remains is an improvement in the sharing of data in the case of serious offences, no more and no less. The previous speakers have referred to this in very restrained and refined terms. I would like to be more outspoken and make it clear that the Council is responsible for putting the brakes on. Braking on the roads is a relatively sensible manoeuvre, but in the case of legal regulations it presents a problem. I would like to congratulate the new presidency on its ambitious approach and I hope that it will be able to carry it through.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless it was very difficult to ensure that the data was protected, because the Member States want the data, but they do not want to provide genuine official assistance when it comes to prosecuting offenders. Unfortunately, this is a very poor regulation. It is a first step, but nothing more.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to mention the drama over the correlation tables. I believe it is essential for us to have them, because ultimately I am also the rapporteur for the report on the implementation of EU law and the Commission needs these tables urgently for this report.</p>

That would be a happy achievement after such long and difficult negotiations, as this legislation really will improve European road safety. I therefore hope that there will not be anyone in the House in the morning applying the brakes, like those in the Council to whom Mrs Lichtenberger referred.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This agreement has our backing, as the Commission has produced a written statement that recognises that the Member States may themselves choose to apply a system of licence plate or driver liability when carrying out enforcement. That was something that I personally found very important. German attempts to prevent licence plate liability were unacceptable After all, that would have meant that the Germans, for example, would have been able to race from the Dutch border to the sea along our motorways, and that is certainly not the idea.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This new piece of legislation ensures that speed demons abroad can no longer go on their merry way undisturbed and unpunished.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am utterly underwhelmed. If we really want our citizens to be safe, then when it comes to road safety, all citizens and all businesses in every Member State must be equal before the law. Otherwise, instead of speaking of European unity, we should refer to European disunity and the principle of every man for himself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The basic idea is wholly legitimate: more safety for our citizens, working to reduce the number of deaths on European roads by penalising anyone who drink-drives, and anyone who speeds, no matter where they are in Europe, particularly when abroad, and those who think that the law will not notice them smoking a joint, and so on. However, essentially we have come up with a system whereby Member States – although not all of them – will exchange information data that will not be much use, since the penalties themselves are optional.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You call this progress. You will have to explain to drivers in the French Nord-Pas-de-Calais region that when they are caught on a static speed camera they will have to pay a fine, as is only right, but that British and other foreign drivers will be left free to continue using our motorways as race tracks. The UK, Irish and Danish opt-outs are unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Scandalously, the country of origin principle, which is so dear to the ultra-liberals who are unfortunately governing the Union, will allow offenders to escape scot-free.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Looking ahead, we may find that low-cost road transport companies choose to register their vehicle in these countries where they will be at liberty to impose worse working conditions on their staff. They might require their employees to take risks, which could prove fatal both for them and for other road users. We will invite the Commission and the Council to explain this approach in person to the victims and their families: let them explain why they are in no way responsible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In view of what I have said, you will understand that the information to be exchanged and used will be purely anecdotal. If we are to save lives, we need to get back on track as soon as possible. We can rely on the support of the new Polish Presidency. It is laudable to want our citizens to be safe, but it would be much better if we were to make it a reality.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the establishment of an area of free movement throughout the whole of the European Union brings with it the need for an adequate mechanism to supervise compliance with traffic regulations by drivers who, as a result of unresolved issues over the correct handling of the necessary information, have escaped the consequences of an infringement of traffic regulations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Efforts towards the necessary legislation have long been frustrated by the divergent views of Member States on how to solve the problem, but I believe we will be able to make substantial progress towards solving this issue. It is a pity that an agreement will come first between the States in the area of unified regulations on prosecuting and penalising drivers, while the coordination and unification of traffic regulations on EU roads, making it easier for drivers to comply with universal European road traffic regulations, remains a distant prospect.</p>
      <p sl="sk">A driver can travel at an unrestricted speed on the motorway in one country with no penalty, but will have to stick to a much lower speed limit on the same kind of motorway in another country.

      <p sl="fr">I am afraid that, at heart, nothing has really changed. Of course, in a country like mine, where persecuting motorists has become a presidential pastime, finally calling drivers of foreign vehicles to account might appear to bring greater justice and fairness. It is true that the penalty for torching someone else’s car is less than the potential fines when driving one’s own car.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also significant that the information will be exchanged using EUCARIS, a system designed for combating organised crime and terrorism under the Prüm Convention, which is itself symbolic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In my country, 25% of offences registered by static speed cameras are committed by foreign vehicles. That figure rises to 50% in the summer. The number of offences has rocketed since 2003, although no one has allowed for the direct correlation between this explosion and the increase in the number of fixed speed cameras. Are foreign drivers less aware of the warning signs and of capricious changes to the speed limit, often for no real reason? They probably get flashed more often. Does that make them more dangerous? Are they more prone to accidents? That is a different question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This directive is being presented as a way of providing equal treatment for European motorists, but the United Kingdom, for example, which accounted for 90 000 motoring offences recorded last year in France, will be opting out. As will two other Member States. French motorists are required to deposit the total fine in order to appeal. This illegal measure is quite rightly being contested in the European Court of Human Rights. Will it be applied to foreign drivers? What is fair about that?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I am sorry to see that the compromise negotiated with the Council no longer contains many of the guarantees suggested by Mrs Ayala Sender to protect privacy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Mr Gollnisch mentioned that collecting speeding fines in his country had become a kind of presidential hobby. He mentions the number of British drivers who are caught and fined for speeding: would he accept that the system that is run in France of on-the-spot fines, with the number of speed cameras that there are on the motorways as you enter France, is wide open to corruption, and that levying on-the-spot fines without any real receipt is another form of corruption in France?</p>

I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Council, the Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies and the current presidency, despite the fact that overall the Council did not play the most glorious role in the case of this dossier and that the result does not meet our expectations.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a very sensitive subject. More than 30 000 people die and more than 340 000 are seriously injured every year and by means of cross-border prosecutions we want to make it clear to the citizens of Europe that this is not just about being prosecuted in your own country for serious offences, but that Europe is also a single transport area. We took it for granted that the existing technical obstacles would be removed. For example, as we have seen recently, radar devices used in one country are not recognised in another. However, we need to remove the obstacles to prosecution in particular, because we want to see improvements across national borders.</p>
      <p sl="de">We were mistaken about this. It is true that we have taken a step forward, a small step, and we will support this move, but we had hoped that we would be able to remove the larger obstacles. We were wrong, because at the moment the only thing we have achieved is sharing information. I think that the subject that has just been mentioned would be better discussed in committee than here in plenary.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say one more thing on this subject. I hope that there will be a majority tomorrow and that we will send the Council a clear signal about correlation tables. If we do not have a majority tomorrow in favour of correlation tables in this area, this does not mean that the subject is closed for Parliament. The Council must take these subjects more seriously. If there is no correlation table, we will have grounds for assuming that the Council does not take the subject seriously.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to ask the members of the Council to tell their colleagues that the methods they have used for blocking a good dossier by means of correlation tables will not be acceptable in future. I hope that we will have a majority tomorrow. I will continue to appeal to the Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) not to support the amendment tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, but I hope that this will not send the wrong signal to the Council and will not be misunderstood.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, over 31 000 people a year are still dying on European roads. That being so, I find it negligent, to say the least, that the Member States’ transport ministers have blocked such an important instrument in the Council for over two years. As representatives of the people, you should be keen, for the safety of your citizens, to ensure that drivers from non-Member States cannot disregard traffic rules with impunity.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact that we shall be voting on this proposal tomorrow is due, above all, to our rapporteur’s persistence. Like her, I too am disappointed that the Council has changed the legal basis for this directive, thereby provoking an opt-out by three Member States. This will create a law for EU-wide prosecution of traffic offences that will not be applied throughout the EU and I consider this less than perfect, to put it mildly.</p>
      <p sl="de">This disappointment notwithstanding, it is another important step towards closer cooperation in the road traffic sector and I should like to ask you all to vote in favour of this compromise tomorrow. I should like to point out once again that the rapporteur campaigned extremely hard for a strong review clause and to thank her for that; I hope that, when the review comes around within the next five years, the transport ministers will be not only older, but also wiser.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, I should also like to begin by thanking Mrs Sender and also the various presidencies for coming to this compromise. Negotiations, of course, were difficult due to the change in legal basis, which called for a unanimous vote by the Council, and on the other hand, resulted in the fact that three states are not participating in this legislation. It is positive to note that the new directive will finally end the anti-social practice that drivers who commit serious traffic offences in other European Union states are actually not penalised, or are penalised in very rare cases. I should also, perhaps, point out two important issues for the future. First of all, it is now in the hands of the Member States to ensure that this directive has meaning and produces results, and we expect that Member States’ competent authorities will take action, utilising data-exchange systems not only to identify and locate offenders, but also actually to enforce penalties to which they are subject. Regarding the issue of personal data privacy, Parliament had serious concerns whether this data exchange would be confidential and used only for the purpose of locating and penalising the offenders, and not used for other purposes. I should like to express my hope that Member States’ competent authorities will not do so. Finally, as the Commissioner has already stated, I should be very disappointed if for some reason, now we are at this final stage, there should not be enough votes for this resolution tomorrow. I hope that will not happen. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Grabarczyk, in the European Parliament we agree that it is necessary to promote road safety in Europe. The directive on cross-border enforcement represents significant progress in terms of improving this latter.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that the directive should impose greater obligations on the Member States to provide information, and include a reference to the need for appropriate and correct information for drivers on the regulations which are in force. We should at long last carry out a review of enforcement procedures and harmonise road traffic regulations and the procedures for checks. To this end, cross-border enforcement should be guaranteed on the basis of an efficient exchange of information between Member States. One of the ways to achieve this is by creating an electronic network for the exchange of data, by means of which it will be possible to establish the identity of vehicle owners, and thus of those guilty of road traffic offences.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to note that, in my opinion, the legal instruments outlined in the report relating to the security of data which has been obtained are sufficient. The directive is extremely important as it covers very serious road traffic offences, such as those which have already been mentioned several times today. Tomorrow’s vote may open the way to an agreement at second reading, on the basis of which amendments to the legal basis for the directive will be agreed. The provisions of the directive may thus be in force in the Member States 24 months after its publication.</p>

      <p sl="fr">At present, in my country, which is located in the centre of Europe at the intersection of roads to and from Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, a large number of non-residents are involved in road accidents, many of them linked to speeding or drink-driving. This is a daily reality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By way of conclusion, let me point out two things. Firstly, we need to do our utmost to standardise penalties throughout Europe so as to prevent the perception of impunity and unfairness from growing. It is incredible that a citizen who drink-drives or runs a red light can avoid punishment purely because he was driving outside his country of residence. Secondly, we must do all we can to harmonise blood alcohol limits and speed limits within the Union, together with measures to tackle those who drive under the influence of drugs. Essentially, we do not need liberalism, ultra-liberalism, neo-liberalism or any other ideology: rather we need more Europe, not less.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, we have no time for further delays in adopting this report. Every day costs the lives of at least several people using Europe’s roads. I am opposed to prioritising procedural issues over matters of substance, and in this instance we are dealing with an attempt to prove the superiority of one position over another at all costs. I only have a few seconds left, and so I shall be brief.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I would like, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur for her truly tenacious work on this report. The compromise that has been reached should be seen as a first step, which should be followed up as quickly as possible. In the current situation, European drivers abroad appear to be immune, and they usually are. According to Eurobarometer research from June last year, the cross-border enforcement of laws is the third highest priority for European citizens as far as road safety is concerned, coming after improvements to transport infrastructure and the enforcement of traffic laws at national level.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I therefore very much support the rapporteur’s view that the Commission should propose harmonising the enforcement of road traffic rules as soon as possible. Only by establishing penalties at European level will we achieve the application of road traffic rules to all drivers without exception. The compromise we have now reached must be welcomed. The sharing of information between Member States can significantly help to reduce the number of serious traffic accidents. The estimate of 5 000 victims spared says it all, and I am therefore calling for us to support this compromise tomorrow.</p>

How can you have a consistent policy here? I am glad the UK will be opting out, because one of the things we have, which some EU states do not have, is the right to appeal to a court: the right to appearance in court for all traffic offences. The position on this is inconsistent across the EU. Is the aim, in fact, to have a single complete legal system?</p>

      <p sl="de">Without doubt, the opt-out facility permitted by the new legal basis remains a fly in the ointment and I hope that, if possible, no Member State will in fact make use of this opt-out for any extended period of time. I also hope that there will be a large majority in the vote tomorrow, so that safety and justice on the roads prevail and that, under the new presidency, the Council will ultimately be able to push ahead and ensure that the correlation tables are introduced, so that we can verify if what is decided jointly in the European Parliament and the Council is in fact implemented.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the main task of every state is to protect the lives of its citizens. I therefore consider it extremely important for us to be able to punish, effectively and rapidly, those who threaten the lives of others through their actions. It can be seen from the statistics that the number of non-resident drivers exceeding the permitted speed limit in a given Member State is relatively higher than the number of resident drivers. For this reason, cross-border cooperation in this area is very important.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Poor coordination in imposing penalties for traffic offences between countries helps drivers who come from a Member State other than the one in which the offence is committed. At the same time, it discriminates against drivers who commit an offence in their home country and who cannot avoid the punishment.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The possibility of cross-border enforcement of penalties in relation to serious crimes such as murder or robbery has not run into the same sort of complications as in the case of traffic offences. These offences also threaten people’s lives, and therefore there should be no exemption.</p>

      <p sl="en">On conciliation: if people think that conciliation will be a solution and offer a better compromise than we achieved today, I am not so sure. As I said at the beginning, this is why I consider this compromise decision so important. Yes, of course, there are a lot of details which can be improved and will be improved, but this is one of the first types of legislation involving cross-border law enforcement and this is a matter of sovereignty, sensitivity, or intelligence, whatever. It is a subsidiarity issue. This is why this was blocked but now we have a compromise and we have a clear understanding that we have at least some tools to enforce the rules and to fight traffic violations. This is why this is so important.</p>
      <p sl="en">One factual remark about the penalties. There is already a Council framework decision on the mutual recognition of financial penalties, which also covers road traffic offences. So if you receive a penalty, especially after this new law, you will pay.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, this debate was exceptionally interesting, and it confirmed that there is a difference in positions, but a concern about the safety of road traffic was common to all speakers. This is the most important goal we are setting ourselves by taking up work on the directive, which reflects our concern for the safety of our citizens and the safety of road users. It is very important for there to be a happy ending to the compromise which was so difficult to achieve in the trialogue. I would like to stress once more that correlation tables are one of the points of contention between the Council and the European Parliament, but the Polish Presidency will strive to reach an agreement on this politically important issue. I would like to assure you that we will endeavour to resolve this issue horizontally.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Turning to the doubts expressed by several speakers, for example with regard to personal data protection, I do not wish to go into technical details, but I would like to stress that this very issue is covered by Article 7 of the cross-border enforcement directive. This directive provides for the best possible data protection system with reference to the Prüm Decision and the Council framework decision 2008/977/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to express my belief that the three Member States which in principle will not be taking part in the implementation of this directive, as Commission Kallas has already mentioned – Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom – will be able to decide to participate at a later date, by means of an opt-in for Ireland and the United Kingdom, in accordance with Article 4 of Protocol No 21 to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and by means of the international agreement provided for in paragraph 13 of the directive for Denmark.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to say that the issue of equality, which was mentioned during today’s plenary debate, is an important one, and it merits a vote in favour of maintaining the compromise tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If the President will allow me, I have one more thing to say: Poland took over the presidency of the European Union on 1 July, and is now working for the good of all the Member States, but something else that happened in Poland on 1 July was the entry into force of an act which makes road traffic safer by means of automatic speed detectors. This too is progress towards safety.</p>

I should also like to thank the Council for its cooperation, since it has provided a great deal of support to the Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies.</p>
      <p sl="es">I agree that we were most ambitious at first reading, in other words, Parliament and the Commission were moving forward together. However, we were stopped in our tracks by a blocking minority in Council, with which Parliament and the Committee on Transport and Tourism are already familiar, because the Council has been blocking some important measures for years now, in some cases permanently. In this case, we made an effort. We broke the deadlock. To that end – for practical reasons, and because of the optimism that motivates us to make use of every available opportunity in the area of road safety – we accepted the Belgian Presidency’s proposal to try to find a different way forward, for which I was grateful. We tried to move past the Council’s block, and we succeeded. The Belgian Presidency worked very well with us, as did the Hungarian Presidency, and we were successful.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is true that this is only the first step, but we were in complete deadlock. It is the first step. We managed to improve data protection, to require the Member State of registration to provide the necessary information, to introduce consultation with victims’ associations and experts, and to include a strong revision clause that the Commission accepted, for which I am particularly grateful to the Vice-President.</p>
      <p sl="es">Now, with utmost respect, I would just remind Mrs Savisaar-Toomast, who, I am sorry to see, has not stayed, even after expressing her reservations to us, that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe was able to adopt another transport report without the correlation tables and that, in this case, I believe that they could make an effort, and I appeal to them to do so, to give this report a chance, otherwise they are not going to help the disagreement with the Council, since the Council will still be able to use its blocking minority in the future. Things are not going to get any better in the conciliation procedure. I think this is a fantasy, and perhaps Mrs Savisaar-Toomast’s youth makes her think that we can manage it, but I do not believe that is going to be the case this time.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, I would ask Mrs Savisaar-Toomast and the ALDE Group that tomorrow they do not force us into voting against the amendment regarding the correlation tables. That will not improve anything, and the victims, the victims’ families and our citizens out there are not going to understand why, because of an interinstitutional quarrel, we are blocking such an important instrument, which is a first but vital step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="en">This important report aims at improving road safety and abolishing the impunity of non-resident drivers in the EU. Incredibly, some 100 people a day die on Europe's roads. We simply must act decisively to improve road safety. EU studies show that respecting the rules of the road would result in 33% fewer road deaths. At present, 75% of road deaths are caused by four offences: speeding, breaking red lights, failure to use seatbelts and drink-driving. Indeed, EU statistics suggest that non-resident drivers account for 5% of traffic but for some 15% of speeding offences. However, most go unpunished because Member State authorities are unable to pursue drivers once they return home. This report approves a system for exchanging information between Member States to enable follow-up on road-safety-related traffic offences committed by non-resident drivers. Unfortunately, the previous Fianna Fáil Government chose not to participate in the drafting of this directive. However, I'm pleased to say that the new government is now carefully considering opting in to the new system.</p>

      <p sl="cs">There are three aspects to road traffic safety. The first aspect is safe infrastructure, which involves road construction, road visibility, installation of signs and so on. The second aspect is the safety and safety features of vehicles, and the third is the driver. Since the target of drastically reducing the number of fatalities in road traffic accidents was included in a White Paper some years ago (the target was a 50% reduction), various studies have shown that the weakest link in the three aspects affecting the accident rate is the driver. It is therefore important gradually to adopt all possible measures to ‘improve’ this weakest link in the three aspects of road traffic. One of these measures is to improve the enforceability of traffic regulations. According to various studies, improving the enforceability of road traffic law, that is, tackling the non-enforceability of fines for offences committed in another State, is an important aspect for improving the current situation. In some States the enforcement bodies easily cope, particularly in the case of parking offences. In other cases the matter is more complex, and enforceability between States is negligible, particularly where automatic equipment is used and the information is not transferred. The theme of the report is therefore very topical, and it concerns me personally that the amendments by the European Commission and the Council remove many parts of the original text. Nevertheless, I believe that we can adopt a usable document, once the rapporteur’s proposal has been approved.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The high death rate on Europe’s roads is a problem which affects all EU residents. One of the White Paper’s ambitious goals to be achieved by 2010 was a 50% reduction in the number of fatal accidents. According to the EU database on road accidents (CARE), there has been a 36% reduction, which is undoubtedly a significant step forward. Research into the frequency of offences committed in the country of residence or in other countries shows a clear increase in hazardous behaviour such as speeding, driving without a seatbelt and drink driving outside the country of permanent residence. We should therefore make every effort to minimise such practices, by introducing harsher penalties and by ensuring that there is less chance of non-residents going unpunished, which can be achieved by introducing standardised regulations for all European citizens, regardless of their country of residence and the country in which they committed the offence. I believe that the same rules should apply to all countries, and I am therefore deeply concerned by the separate treatment given to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark. Communication between citizens and decision-making bodies is a key aspect in this regard. We should make EU citizens more aware of the road safety regulations which are in force in the different Member States and of the implementation of new directives, in particular using appropriate methods which ensure that sufficient information is provided regarding the consequences of non-compliance with road safety regulations when driving in other Member States.</p>

    <intervention id="2-781-000" speaker_id="28393" name="Luis de Grandes Pascual" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, it is an honour to defend this own-initiative report. While it was initially intended that it would be limited to security scanners, the recent increase in terrorist activity demanded that the report go further.</p>
      <p sl="es">As a result, the Committee on Transport and Tourism unanimously agreed to make me the rapporteur so as to ensure that the report would take an integral view of civil aviation security. In keeping with that mandate, the report assesses security scanners, the decisions adopted regarding liquids, aerosols and gels, and security measures on cargo and mail. Transport security, ladies and gentlemen, is one of the main concerns in the fight against terrorism. Currently, Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 describes the different aspects which are included in the points of this report.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the area of security scanners: as is set out in the explanatory statement, this report derives from the Commission’s 2008 draft regulation. This proposal, if you recall, was rejected by Parliament for not demonstrating that it fulfilled a series of requirements such as respect for fundamental rights, safeguarding health and protecting passenger data. Therefore, the Commission has resolved, and I hope it will continue to do so, all the doubts that Parliament raised and which I have identified and dealt with in this report.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the protection of fundamental rights, the new-generation security scanners comply with all the necessary requirements: human dignity, respect for privacy, non-discrimination and the guarantee of a high level of protection of human health in the definition and exercise of all European Union policies and actions, all of which are included in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">The systems in place are not usually those presented in the news or newspapers by critics of security scanners. The proposed systems do not show the human body, but rather a stick figure, a mannequin, a photograph of the fully-clothed passenger or simply an ‘OK’ in green when the passenger passes through without activating the alarm.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the area of data protection: data protection is an issue that is also under constant review, and is guaranteed by new scanner technology. This makes it possible for data to be automatically destroyed once the purpose for which it is collected has been achieved.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to body images, ladies and gentlemen: no body images will be produced. This is one of the basic points on which the vast majority agreed, without doubt because it affects privacy as a fundamental right that cannot be eroded.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the area of public health protection: the maximum guarantee has been given by Parliament. Ionising radiation, because of its harmful effects, whether through cumulative or long-term effects, has been made obsolete by another type of technology that does not affect passenger health. Therefore, Parliament is sending a clear message and saying ‘no’ to the use of X-rays.</p>
      <p sl="es">To summarise, ladies and gentlemen, security scanners are not perfect but they are, without doubt, more effective than simple metal detectors. They bring added value and can detect dangerous objects and items that conventional scanners cannot detect. They are a tool providing measures that are proportional to the risk they are trying to prevent. They will be optional and not compulsory for Member States, but those States that do introduce them should implement harmonised, minimum standards for everyone. They will not be compulsory for travellers, but those who refuse to use them will be obliged to submit to alternative procedures which are at least as effective as the security scanners.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to liquids: I am not going to refer to them as there will be a debate with the Commissioner, and two objectives have already been set: there is the unfulfilled objective of 29 April 2011, on which we are awaiting reports, and the guarantee that this will be met in 2013. The European Civil Aviation Conference guarantees that technology exists which is capable of detecting liquid explosives. Therefore, this report reaffirms that Parliament’s mandate must be implemented if everything is ready. It is clear that the first objective has not been met and, therefore, as I have already said and I repeat, we are awaiting the Commissioner’s comments.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the area of cargo and mail: the recent attacks carried out on passenger planes have led the European Union to develop a more ambitious plan and to act quickly to identify additional necessary measures. I support the idea that security and screening systems have to be proportional and equivalent. Goods transported on planes must be screened, particularly if 70% of cargo is transported on passenger planes. In this regard, I welcome the support of all the groups for raising the level of cargo security, as I proposed.</p>
      <p sl="es">To conclude, Mr President, all of the issues which are included in this report on aviation security are a response to previous terrorist acts, which is why, over the coming years, the European Union will endeavour to establish a security system that prevents and avoids future attacks.</p>
      <p sl="es">I particularly wish to thank all those who worked together to enable a very difficult and complex issue, which was initially rejected by Parliament, to reach this plenary session today – thanks to the Commission’s new attitude and the flexibility shown by the political groups – with widespread support and broad consensus.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his cooperation and dialogue. The Commission called on Parliament, and the Commission will take up the relay. The next steps are the Commission’s responsibility. We await the Commissioner’s comments.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, unusually I have plenty of time today, but I shall try to be as short as possible. First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr de Grandes Pascual, for this exhaustive and balanced report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The threat to civil aviation is real. We were reminded last October that some people are still seeking to target aviation and we were reminded that we are vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to security scanners, the Parliament resolution of October 2008 asked the Commission to analyse the impact of security scanners on fundamental rights and health aspects. A basis for discussion with Parliament and Council, addressing some essential issues concerning the use of security scanners at EU airports, was provided by the communication of 15 June 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has since continued to assess all aspects and is now ready to come forward with a legislative proposal on security scanners. On the basis of the de Grandes Pascual report, we can now move forward quickly: some airports are keen to start using scanners to improve our security. This will allow Member States and airports to use security scanners at EU airports. It will also lay down strict operational and detection performance criteria.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, security scanners are a valid alternative to existing screening methods, in particular at large airports with major passenger flows. What is more, current technology allows full respect of fundamental rights and health concerns. Further, scanners have good detection performance, as both metallic and non-metallic items can be detected. Moreover, experience shows that they are increasingly accepted by passengers and staff as a convenient method of screening.</p>
      <p sl="en">At this stage, however, to safeguard the health and safety of passengers and staff, only security scanners that do not use ionising radiation should be allowed. The Commission has therefore asked its Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks to assess the effects of security scanners that use ionising radiation on human health.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has also proposed for passengers to be given the possibility of opting out from a security scan and of undergoing alternative screening methods. We are convinced that a common EU approach addresses the current fragmented situation while ensuring both the highest level of security and the best possible protection for fundamental rights and health.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to liquids, the deadline of 29 April 2011 was intended to be set for the first step towards abolishing the restrictions on liquids on board aircraft. However, this step proved impossible to implement for several reasons. The Commission therefore decided to remove this obligation and to instead focus on 29 April 2013. This is the legal deadline on which all restrictions on liquids must be lifted. However, airports can start the screening of liquids before that date, and are encouraged to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context you also wanted the Commission to make a statement on liquids. Let me assure you that the Commission is fully committed to ensuring that the 2013 deadline is met. Therefore, a working group consisting of Member States, the aviation industry and international partners will be set up and will start work right after the summer. This group will agree on concrete steps to be taken in the coming year and will coordinate implementation, including operational trials at airports.</p>
      <p sl="en">International cooperation, in particular with the United States, is essential to prevent a similar situation in 2013. The 2013 deadline has also been endorsed by most of the 60 ICAO states applying liquid restrictions. On 22 June 2011, the EU and the US signed a joint statement, agreeing to closely work together towards the 2013 deadline. The joint statement demonstrates our common acknowledgement and acceptance of the 2013 deadline, and includes an agreement to exchange information on operational trials and on planned regulatory requirements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now go back to the de Grandes Pascual report and turn to cargo. Last December, the Council endorsed the High-Level Working Group report and action plan on strengthening air cargo security. This was a direct response to the October incident involving explosive devices concealed in air cargo consignments from Yemen. I welcome Parliament’s support to this work, as expressed in the de Grandes Pascual report.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards progress on implementing the action plan, the Commission is developing a common EU risk assessment for cargo security, with input from interior ministries and the intelligence services. And we are working within ICAO to set global standards and coordinate capacity-building activities in third countries. This is on-going work and we should continue to give it the necessary priority.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, I am as yet unable to report on a successful conclusion to the new rule-making for cargo. At the meeting of experts in the Regulatory Committee on 8 June 2011, Member State delegates failed to give sufficient support to the Commission proposal, due to a large number of abstentions, which came as a big surprise. At the Transport Council in June, I asked ministers to ensure that improved rules on cargo can be adopted as soon as possible. I am hopeful that this will be possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is therefore resubmitting the proposals to the Regulatory Committee this week. It is important that the EU takes action to close a clear security gap for air cargo arriving from third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Parliament for its attention to the various components of this file. Your careful scrutiny has led to better legislation and therefore better protection of citizens.</p>

    <intervention id="2-783-000" speaker_id="96815" name="Judith Sargentini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justic and Home Affairs">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, as rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I have a clear message to put across here. There are three criteria to which body scanners must conform.</p>
      <p sl="nl">These are free choice (people must not be forced to pass through this machine), data storage (data must not be stored and there is no need for pictures to be taken of people which security staff sit in rooms further along watching) and no X-ray radiation. This last point is crucial for the health of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This kind of equipment is not only to be found at airports. It can also be found, for example, at the court in Paris and I am convinced that they will be appearing at many more locations in future. That is why the European Parliament and the European Commission need to lay down clear rights for European citizens along with clear criteria to which these scanners must conform.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We must not listen to industry, which says, ‘now we will make scanners that work using X-rays’. No, that is why we have rules. I am pleased to see that the Commission is now bringing forward legislation prohibiting X-ray radiation and guaranteeing free choice. I would still like to see clarity on the issues of data storage and photography.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What badly disappoints me is that you continue to choose to implement this decision as a kind of technical decision through comitology and that you are bringing forward proposals before we have been able to vote here about the involvement of this House. I actually expect you to give us full right of approval, as this is not simply a technical decision. It concerns security, but it surely also relates to the privacy of European citizens. The debate about whether this is equipment that we really need, and about whether this will provide security at airports is one that I would like to have with you. What I am now ensuring is that, if people think that it is necessary, that it also duly happens, but I personally still have doubts about that necessity.</p>

    <intervention id="2-784-000" speaker_id="28251" name="Jörg Leichtfried" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I absolutely share the view taken by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that it should not be compulsory to go through a scanner if someone really does not want to. However, it is also important that, if a person refuses to go through a scanner, they should not be subjected to any degrading treatment, with a full-body frisk and even more degrading treatment than they would have experienced by going through the scanner.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wanted to ask my fellow member if that is what she meant and if, as rapporteur for of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, she is taking care to ensure that this sort of thing does not happen in the future.</p>

    <intervention id="2-785-000" speaker_id="96815" name="Judith Sargentini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Leichtfried for his question. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs put in its report that when you decide not to go through a body scanner, for whatever reason, it should not be a reason to think there is something is wrong with you, and that you should then undergo a security check on a similar level of effectiveness to the machine. In no way should this be an indication that there is something wrong with you. To make another point, we also have been very clear on not going for profiling. I sympathise with your fears, Mr Leichtfried, but in our report that is clearly taken care of.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, aviation security has long been a subject of debate in Parliament. Strangely, the discussion in the Council foundered recently on the question of who is to pay for this security. Everyone is in favour of it, but no one actually wants to pay for it, as we have seen to some extent over recent weeks and months.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards the rules on liquids: we all knew what they were. We also knew what the deadline was and, thirdly, we were also clear as to what was and what was not technically feasible. Nonetheless, it was decided at the last moment that this scanning would not be introduced, due to so-called security aspects, even though we are and remain convinced that the arguments were purely financial. That is why I should like to repeat, on behalf of our group: how the Commission resolved this at the last minute should be and should remain an exception. It cannot provide a precedent for unilateral resolutions in the future. Secondly, we must also address issues correctly, when we address them in the run-up. That is why three principles are important to me for the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first is: there should be no more last-minute decisions. The second is: a review should take place as early as 2012, because we want to know what is possible. The third is: what will happen with this opt-out clause on security grounds, after all, this clause will give every country the facility to opt out if security is the issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as body scanning is concerned, I would say to Mr Leichtfried that we must not overcomplicate the issue. With this excellent report by Mr de Grandes Pascual, Parliament has sent the Commission a clear message. We want to protect health and respect privacy. We do not want to make it binding. If a person does not want to use it, they should not have to use it. However, if something goes wrong tomorrow, then the House will again say, why did we not have better controls? We therefore need to strike a balance between good technologies and better controls. That applies to the future and not just at European level; it applies internationally as well. What is the point of introducing good control technology if it is not accepted on other continents?</p>

    <intervention id="2-787-000" speaker_id="28251" name="Jörg Leichtfried" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, one thing needs to be clarified with regard to this report: what is it about? It is not about the European Union suddenly introducing security scanners. It is not about the European Union suddenly having no interest in safeguarding the privacy of European citizens. It is not about the European Union suddenly discovering its love of manufacturing such equipment. It is about the fact that individual Member States have begun to introduce security scanners in European airports. It was the European Union, it was our rapporteurs, it was the European Parliament that said: if this happens, then we need uniform rules throughout Europe, throughout the European Union. We have addressed this together with the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">There will be no health risks anywhere in Europe. There will be no X-ray equipment. We are in favour of absolute safeguards for privacy and personal data. There will be no link between images and data. The images will be deleted immediately. No third party will be able to view these images. It will also be possible, as we have discussed, to refuse controls using this equipment without any adverse repercussions. We are heading in the right direction here. Body scanners are not the ultimate solution against terrorism, but they may help somewhat in stemming the problem, if they are introduced and used under reasonable conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I have something else to say: it has been said that the Commission considers that these stick figures may not suffice in certain circumstances and that true images should be available. I should therefore like to state quite clearly that, for our group, this is the bottom line: we shall not accept the use of photographic images, we shall not agree to that.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was a pleasure to work on this issue with the House and the rapporteur. We did a good job and achieved a good result. Many thanks.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to begin by wishing my colleague, Mrs Meissner, a speedy recovery; she has been the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on this report. An illness has prevented her from continuing the great work she has done over these past months. On her behalf, I am going to highlight six aspects of this legal report that are important for the ALDE Group.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, this issue is about security measures and, as always, these are at odds with people’s fundamental rights. Therefore, we want Parliament to codecide with the Commission and the Council to regulate these areas. There should be no more comitology to legislate on these issues.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, I would like to reiterate that security and fundamental rights are, furthermore, basic elements of the Europe we want to build. Only an EU-wide approach can ensure the harmonised implementation of security standards at all European airports.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, I would like to say that body scanners used alongside current equipment can improve screening security, as long as they have shared characteristics. Security must not jeopardise the civil liberties or health of users and personnel. That is why, during the screening process, the use of X-rays has been rejected and the storage of the images obtained has been banned. Furthermore, it is requested that stick figures be used, and that no personal details of passengers be revealed other than those required for flight security.</p>
      <p sl="es">Fourthly, I would say that Member States and passengers must be given a choice when it comes to security scanners, but that if the latter decide not to use them they must accept an alternative screening procedure. Moreover, airport screening must have better trained staff and a uniform code of conduct. The restriction on carrying liquids on board planes must be lifted by April 2013 at the latest, and I was pleased to hear the statement made by Mr Kallas.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I should like to say that the efforts made by personnel must also apply in the area of cargo screening. We must define risk priorities and ensure the screening of goods and baggage that arrive in our airports from third countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on body scanners – which I shall continue to refer to as such, in order to distinguish these systems from baggage scanners – has only been this intensive, because it has attracted a great deal of public attention and because a number of Member States have pressed ahead and introduced equipment that many people simply see as an invasion of their privacy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament has reacted correctly here and I thank the rapporteur for his open cooperation. Together we have done a good job and created a European regulation that also allows the Member States to opt out of using body scanners. We have managed to ensure that equipment that poses a particular health risk cannot be used, which means no X-ray scanners for any passengers. At the moment, we have a version which ensures that there are no body images that might crop up in public or be passed around among staff. There is no obligation to introduce these systems and data can be deleted quickly. I also set great store by well-trained airport staff, which is why I tabled an amendment on this subject. I believe that this is the very best security measure.</p>
      <p sl="de">As ever, the question of costs remains. We are still waiting for the Commission to find an appropriate solution. I must, of course, comment briefly on the question of liquids. We need prudent handling of the cost issue here, especially as the equipment does not identify what it is supposed to identify and costs a lot of money. The rule for freight scanners has finally been improved and included. That is only fair and it strikes a balance between the various sectors within the aviation industry.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr de Grandes Pascual for all his hard work – and likewise his staff – as well as his contribution to this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the original rapporteur for the regulation on common rules for aviation security post-9/11, I fully appreciate the need for a common approach. It is essential that we find a more sophisticated way forward in the fight against terrorism, and to achieve one-stop security we must have uniform rules. Additional measures need to be applied in a harmonised and coherent manner. In my view, body scanners could be a formidable additional tool in the fight against terrorism, but their deployment is extremely controversial, and I have frequently raised issues in this regard in relation to concerns about health and privacy. We must, therefore, deploy the best technological equipment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Technology such as millimetre-wave scanning is already available to address the health, privacy and data-protection concerns of our constituents. Agreeing on the most appropriate equipment is crucial, however, because if we are in a position where we have to exempt huge swathes of people on medical or ethical grounds, then there really is no point in proceeding with this measure. I must also stress that we should not regard body scanners as a silver bullet. If correctly deployed and managed, they will prove useful as part of a more efficient security procedure across the EU. All governments must work together: better cross-border intelligence, counter-terrorism measures and the use of central reservation systems and passenger profiling to identify potential terrorists before they reach our airports are essential. The societies which we have built and the values which they embody deserve proper protection, and we must not forget that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Briefly, with regard to the liquids ban, I am not surprised that Member States were not ready in April of this year. This is a crucial decision that cannot be rushed: so 2014 certainly sounds like a more realistic date. Even then, I do not wish to see confusion and chaos and passenger disruption, because all that has been bad enough for the past 10 years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we know that the aviation sector is hugely important to the UK and other Member States in terms of manufacturing, tourism, high-skill and high-tech jobs and revenue generation. As rule-makers we must therefore ensure that we provide a clear vision on security so that the industry can plan for the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, let us be serious for a moment. Who in this House believes that security scanners, however leading edge, will reduce terrorism? Terrorism is a particularly disgusting form of war but, like any war, it is, above all, a mark of the dramatic failure of political action. This failure cannot be remedied by scanners or through a liquids ban on aircraft. Countering terrorism calls for the resolution of the underlying political causes. The negotiated settlement of conflicts that have pitted man against man for too long, while keeping thousands if not millions of human beings in living conditions that are unacceptable in the 21st century, is undeniably the best means of countering terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Terrorism will be reduced through the creation and international recognition of a Palestinian State, an end to north-south domination, an end to the wars in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan, and by helping new democracies to flourish without interventionism. However, unless there is a will to negotiate or if the parties refuse to negotiate, the best weapon against terrorism will be human intelligence and not technology, however sophisticated it may be.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This means, among other things, strengthening customs departments, not entrusting airport security to private agencies but to the police and gendarmerie services of the Member States, and integrating baggage handlers, ground staff and aircraft maintenance staff into the relevant social security system.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the constant refinement of safety measures in civil aviation is bringing better protection for passengers against the misuse of aircraft for terrorist purposes. The expansion of detection methods to include security scanners requires a change to the current regulations and the adding of the new technologies to the relevant lists.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Nothing has changed since October 2008 in terms of the actual technology of security scanners, of course, and doubts about respect for privacy, human dignity and thus also human rights in the use of security scanners are still the same problem. Even though Luis de Grandes Pascual ruled that the Commission, in its declaration of 2008, satisfactorily resolved the justified doubts of Parliament, I am not sure that we will come to terms with this assessment so easily.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Perhaps the new generation of security scanners make it possible to bypass the issue of respect for human dignity and privacy, but it will be necessary to convince not just MEPs of this, but also the wider public, who will have to undergo daily scanning in security inspections. The immediate deletion of scanning records is therefore an absolute necessity, in my opinion.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The introduction of fluid scanners, allowing passengers to bring fluids, sprays and gels after April 2013, is surely positive news for passengers. It will mean better travelling conditions, particularly for families with children. It would therefore be good if every new piece of legislation on security checks brought passengers as much comfort as possible, while retaining the necessary vigilance and security, of course.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the statistics and trends, then one thing is clear: passenger numbers will increase worldwide. I recently met with European airport operators and they forecast that passenger numbers will increase by around 50% worldwide over the next ten years.</p>
      <p sl="de">What will this mean? It will, without doubt, mean more and longer queues at checkpoints in airports. If this is to be avoided, more staff are needed. That will lead to an increase in costs and fares. The alternative is to consider what new technologies we can introduce, in order to deal with rising passenger numbers, so that we can offer a more pleasant experience and guarantee security with higher passenger numbers. If we succeed in developing and introducing security scanners that do not use any ionising radiation, that do not show real body images and that do not require any data to be stored and if passengers are also able to opt for or against scanners during security controls, that would be an instrument that really would maintain security and give passengers a more pleasant experience during controls.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I think that a debate on security scanners alone does not go far enough. We also need to discuss what we can do to improve controls on air freight in the future. Commissioner, when you next meet with the Council, you know that you can count on the European Parliament’s support.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, allow me first of all to thank Mr de Grandes Pascual for his excellent report, which is wide-ranging and very thorough. I believe the Commission has taken a positive step in including in their deliberations a great deal of Parliament’s position as contained in his report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to focus on the liquids and gel regulation. What happened in April this year was nothing short of a farce, perpetrated by some Member States who, under pressure from their biggest airports, put the Commission and this Parliament in a very difficult position. The easing of the liquids ban planned for April 2011 fell not because of security considerations but because of financial considerations. Airports were not prepared to pay for new machines and, through their European industry body, they lobbied the Member States accordingly, some of whom caved in and ratted on the agreement that they had reached with Parliament on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, what now? What guarantee can we have from Member States that when April 2013 comes around they will not do the same again? How can we trust the Member States? We need to ensure that the European Civil Aviation Conference does its work and trials machines in airports and not just in laboratories; that the Commission and the USA iron out their differences; and that this time next year we have a progress report on where we are with the liquid scanners, so that in 2013 we do not find ourselves placed in a similar position to that of 2011. We need a clear timetable leading up to 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I also ask the Commissioners: who will sit on the new stakeholders group? Surely the machine-makers should be involved, as well as the airports and airlines. What April 2011 taught us was how poor communication had been among all those involved – with each side saying something completely different at different times.</p>
      <p sl="en">Taken together with Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report and the clear statement from the Commission, the steps I have outlined should help us in taking an EU-wide approach to the whole issue of aviation security. However, I will be honest: after this April’s fiasco, I frankly do not believe that the Member States have the will to deliver. I for one do not trust them anymore.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, in the face of terrorist threats – to plagiarise the philosopher – security is for us all a ‘categorical imperative’. I think everyone would agree with that particular philosophy. For my part, I was, for quite some time, dead against the use of these scanner systems, and I have to say that I have changed my mind. To start with, I was opposed to them because of health problems associated, in particular, with exposure to X-rays, especially for children and, of course, as a Member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for reasons of dignity, respect for private life – or invasion of privacy – and integrity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, the report by Mr de Grandes provides a certain number of guarantees regarding these matters, because it opposes the practice of X-rays, because it calls for the destruction of the images immediately after the scan, because the images will be schematic and because the traveller will be able to choose not to submit to this type of check.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, Commissioner, it seems to me to be necessary that the draft regulation authorising body scanners should take into account the fact that, if one of those guarantees were to be called into question, many of us would vigorously oppose this text, and if there was a majority vote tomorrow, this should not be regarded as a carte blanche but as a framework, a red line that Parliament could accept on behalf of the citizens of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very rigorous work.</p>
      <p sl="es">The objective of this report is to maintain a high level of security in airports while safeguarding citizens’ fundamental rights. Air transport is a target for terrorist attacks, and it is therefore necessary to strengthen security in order to protect people, infrastructure, cargo and mail.</p>
      <p sl="es">In that respect, security scanners in airports are a useful tool. Their inclusion among screening methods used to detect banned or dangerous items is therefore necessary. However, it is vital for a thorough evaluation to be carried out in advance, in order to determine the least harmful technology and the level of non-cumulative emissions that is acceptable for public health. It is also important that, with this technology, the protection of personal data is guaranteed and the dignity of the individual being screened is preserved.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to point out that Member States can implement stricter security measures than those required by European legislation, thus having the capacity to introduce scanners in airports under their jurisdiction. The EU institutions therefore need to lay down common rules of procedure with regard to detection performance criteria and tools.</p>
      <p sl="es">Information relating to the screening procedure is a vital element of this tool. Airport personnel must receive proper training in order to provide passengers with adequate information on screening safety, voluntary participation, alternatives and the deletion of images.</p>
      <p sl="es">To conclude, I would like to emphasise that any passenger’s decision to refuse screening does not make them a suspect, and that the selection criteria for being scanned will be based exclusively on security reasons and not on any other grounds, such as race or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religion, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="es">Having nothing further to add, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr de Grandes Pascual, for his work, for the sound outcome and for the solid cooperation. As it happens, I can be relatively brief about his report when I say that, as a group, this report has our support. Even as we give it our backing, we are no enthusiasts for this technology, or rather we do not believe that it is the miracle cure that will ensure 100% security, but we have to accept that the body scanner does now exist.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is appropriate that we should set the ground rules and the preconditions at European level. That is also what we have done, and we have done so well. There is one thing to point out, though, and that is that it really is essential that security agents should only be able to view standard figures on their screens. This must be made very clear in the regulation that is currently being prepared.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When it comes to liquids, I would like, at this point, to join Mr Simpson and Mr Grosch in expressing my dissatisfaction about the approach taken in this dossier and the way in which the Council, specifically, has broken the agreement that we had reached together. This method of working damages the confidence in the agreements that we reach between us. This is not the first time that there have been problems between the Council and Parliament, but once a deal has been reached, it must be stuck to. We ask for a specific commitment at this stage, first and foremost from the Council, too, that the new agreements that are being prepared at the moment will be put on record and also put into practice.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am pleased to hear the Commissioner say that the talks with the United States are heading in the right direction and that they, too, are working towards the 2013 deadline. That is important. I am also pleased that the working group is being established, as that will point the way for this entire process and will enable us to achieve results in a more organised way.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr de Grandes Pascual, for this valuable report. Together with the Commission’s proposals, this will certainly pave the way for greater aviation security. We must do everything we can to guarantee passenger safety, with particular attention – as numerous Members have said – to the health and privacy of the travelling public. I think that this report contains important specifications on both these points.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, today’s decision makes it possible, but not compulsory, to introduce scanners. Each Member State will decide independently on whether or not it wants to use this technology. As a result, there is no uniform security standard in the EU, just a patchwork of countries using this technology. There is no absolute security, but the system should be as coherent and efficient as possible and the technique used is just one aspect of that. It may be as good and as progressive as you want, but we need well-trained and committed security staff operating the equipment. Airport operators often cut back in the wrong places, which is why I am in favour of high standards in working conditions, in training and further training for security staff and in health protection.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another important aspect is freight controls. Here too the report calls for greater use of scanners and specialist staff. I think that stronger controls are also needed at airports outside the Union.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the threat of terrorism is unfortunately all too real in today’s world, and security is a priority which cannot be taken lightly.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The introduction of technical measures aiming at improving security at European airports is quite understandable. The uncontrolled nature of their introduction, however, may mean both legal uncertainty for European citizens, and less effective measures. In this sensitive matter, I therefore consider it right to adopt framework rules for their eventual use at European level.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have done on the report. I am pleased that human health issues were the focus of attention. Ionising radiation and the risks of repeat and long-term exposure and the differing laws in the various Member States are just one of the many aspects to this problem. We have already talked about the others, such as personal data protection, privacy, human dignity and imaging techniques. The funding of this equipment is also a fundamental issue. Unfortunately, however, no technical measures will guarantee 100% security. That is all I would like to say in conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, as we know, some Member States have already introduced body scanners, while most are at the trial stage, but I therefore consider it very important for the EU not only to start addressing this issue, but also to adopt a unified position.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Member States are currently using security scanners to check passengers and cargo without any form of supervision or regulation by the EU. When introducing new technologies, we should remember that the new must replace the old. Since the new scanners will be capable of detecting and evaluating fluids, it will be possible to remove previous restrictions on fluids. This relatively strict prohibition raises several questions. The most fundamental question is the definition of what is a fluid, because the prohibited materials now include various creams, aerosols and lubricants, for example.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, however, the most important thing in relation to body scanners, and also in relation to lifting the ban on fluids, is to have a unified European approach in both cases.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I cannot accept any new anti-terrorism measures until the Commission has carried out a thorough review of all existing anti-terrorism legislation and investigated whether it is cost-effective and proportional and whether it protects privacy, health and the economy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Let us not deceive ourselves into believing that we can protect privacy. With this technology, an image is taken that is then processed. The image must be stored in order for it to be processed. There is therefore always a risk that the image will fall into the wrong hands. As regards effectiveness, people can hide things in their mouths, and there are numerous other ways to circumvent the technology. Only the passive system can be considered safe from the point of view of health. It is good that we are abolishing the rules for liquids, but it is ridiculous to believe that we have any security whatsoever at airports when everything that is needed to make a bomb can be taken in a medicine bag and the rest of the ingredients can be bought in the duty-free shops. It would only be secure if people collected duty-free goods when they landed instead.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The terrorists will not stop here, even if the technology were to work. The greatest effect with the least risk would mean that they would then move on to boats, trains, underground railways and shopping centres.

      <p sl="es">The fact is that we started to feel alarmed when we saw scanners appearing randomly in airports, like mushrooms; it became absolutely vital – which was Parliament’s position from the outset – to provide an EU framework that would establish conditions, but without making it in any way compulsory.</p>
      <p sl="es">Health and privacy, for both passengers and personnel, were fundamental. I believe that, in this regard, his ideas and proposals respect and guarantee Parliament’s main requests and requirements. In addition, there is one remaining aspect: efficiency.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members very much for their comments and for this exchange of views.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding liquids, I am deeply disappointed about what happened in April this year. Of course this is a lesson for us, and also one for me personally and for the Commission. What actually happened was that we had agreement more or less everywhere, despite some opposition from some airports and Member States. However, the situation then suddenly started to escalate and Member States took the opportunity to increase their security levels and actually to avoid this measure.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must consider what to do in 2013. One aspect which is a little more promising is the fact that, whereas in the past we did not have enough clear cooperation with the United States despite a great deal of contact, we have now signed a protocol with a view to cooperating. The United States has also committed itself to the 2013 deadline.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course there are many issues: money, testing of technology and so on. In relation to terrorist threats and aviation, one honourable Member mentioned the fact that there are other threats as well: there have been the London and Madrid bombings and attacks in shopping malls and elsewhere. However, according to the assessment of the competent authorities, aviation remains by far the most attractive target for terrorists. If you can create an accident with a big explosion in aviation, it is spectacular and will have major consequences.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the current situation, we have had the Detroit incident, although in fact that was not an explosion; we have had an averted cargo attack; but we have had a major explosion in Domodedovo airport in Moscow. As the Russian Minister has told me, they now intend to introduce a 100% check at all airport entrances, including checks in metro stations. So when something really happens there is an immediate reaction. Before the attack at Domodedovo, all the authorities acted in strict accordance with the rules – they did what was asked of them – but of course an explosion in a cafeteria outside was not foreseen.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no 100% security – 99.9% yes, but not 100%. We must therefore secure the front and ensure that terrorists cannot enter aeroplanes. With whatever technology we use, we must ensure that a person about whom there is some kind of suspicion, or about whom the security authorities have some doubts, cannot enter the plane. This is crystal clear. Irrespective of the technology used, no one has a right to enter a plane if they do not pass the security checks. Everybody must go through a security check.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, security scanners are in use. Some of you may have been in Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, where scanners are in use: they are very comfortable and there are no photos. I have also seen technology that involves photos or some kind of similar image. These systems are not very nice and we should definitely not accept them. This is another reason to have a harmonised approach and to avoid a situation in which airports and Member States introduce different types of scanners with different rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">On behalf of the Commission, I can assure you that we are definitely very interested in working out a harmonised approach and we greatly appreciate the report and the progress so far on finding common ground and a common understanding on this complicated issue. We will shortly put forward a legislative proposal for a harmonised approach.</p>

      <p sl="es">Commissioner, thank you very much for your attitude and for being receptive to Parliament’s report. We may presume from what you have said that you value and take on board many of our assessments. I say ‘our’ because this report is not only mine; rather it brings together a broad consensus, and that is positive. I would add that I am going to try to maintain that consensus up to the very last minute.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mrs Lichtenberger, we are going to accept your second amendment, because I believe it is beneficial to the area of training. With regard to your first amendment, I will try to ensure you do not have the same reservations over the issue of the name given to the scanners, because nobody gets them confused. I know that you mean well, but I would be grateful if you could withdraw the amendment. If not, then you are within your rights and I shall respect that, of course.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I believe it will be necessary to look at them in greater detail; I very much regret that I do not agree with the principles of your amendments. These amendments are not fundamental, and I sincerely believe that there is an underlying intention to vote against them, which I regret. In any case, I would say earnestly to Mr Hénin, and I am sorry he is not here, that in a democratic society there are no grounds that legitimise any terrorist action. No political cause nor apolitical cause: terrorism must be flatly rejected in a democratic society.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the amendments tabled by the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, and I am sorry that Mrs Foster is not here, for she is always very kind, I believe these are unnecessary because what they are seeking to achieve in the area of profiling could cause confusion. In paragraph 4, which we are also going to improve with an amendment put forward by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament so as to elaborate on the strengthening of data protection, it is not necessary to talk about profiling as that could cause confusion and give an impression of discrimination, and I am sure that no attempt will be made to do so.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are going to accept, not just accept for consideration, the S&amp;D Group’s oral amendment, because I believe it is good and, if Parliament accepts it, we will vote in favour of it. As far as the rest is concerned, I believe that we are going to truly fulfil the mandate given to us.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, I believe we have done well so far; we have passed the baton on to you and I hope you will rise to the occasion. I am sure you will, as you have shown talent and courage, and I am grateful that you are sorry about what happened on 29 April 2011. I know you are being sincere, and I hope that in 2013 we will fulfil all the objectives in the area of liquids, as we are all trying to do.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The use of body scanners must only be allowed in European Union Member States if there is conclusive evidence to prove that they pose a minimal risk to human health. Furthermore, their use must not entail any breaches of the right to privacy. There are features which prove that, in their current stage of technological development, body scanners could fail to meet all the health and safety conditions. These scanners, particularly those using ionising radiation, may have a serious impact on the human body even where a small quantity of radiation is used, as it has a cumulative effect. This situation is especially dangerous for frequent airline passengers who might need to be subjected to radiation from scanners hundreds of times each year, on top of the solar radiation they are also exposed to during their flight, whose level is several hundred times higher than that on the ground. Moreover, certain groups of people such as pregnant women, children or the elderly may be even more vulnerable to the exposure to radiation. This is why I think that the decision on using body scanners in EU Member States must be made with a great deal of caution so as to be able to protect European citizens’ fundamental rights and health.</p>

Thus, passengers with special health or communication needs, such as pregnant women, children, the elderly or persons with disabilities, persons with medical device implants, or passengers who carry medical devices and medicine in their hand luggage to maintain their health should receive special treatment during the security scans. This is why I consider it necessary to draft a European Code of Conduct on the use of security scanners, which covers not only the way passengers should be treated, but also the effects of body scanners on health, and the consideration of human rights.

      <p sl="pl">The EU regulatory framework for civilian aviation safety currently includes a list of approved methods and technologies for inspections and checks, and the Member States have the right to choose the ones they regard as most appropriate from this list. The issue of body scanners is raised extremely frequently in this Chamber, since it is the most restrictive security measure. Nevertheless, I believe that it is also extremely important to pay attention to the freight which is carried on board aeroplanes together with passengers. Apart from travellers’ luggage, the holds of aeroplanes also contain post, which represents a real threat to flight safety. The protection of flight safety currently falls under two separate pillars, but nevertheless I do not believe that a sufficient level of protection has been achieved. We must develop a joint procedure for the safety of freight and post, in order to ensure that their contents are protected against unlawful interference from the moment they pass through safety checks to the time when the plane in which they are to be carried takes off. To this end, we should in particular step up checks relating to the protection of freight and post from third countries. Ways of achieving this include improved training and checks at European and national level and increased coordination and exchange of information within the EU. It is also necessary to continue close cooperation with the International Civil Aviation Organisation, in order to ensure that parcels imported inside EU borders from third countries comply with EU legislation or standards of a similar scope.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The report which we are going to vote on marks an important step towards ensuring aviation security. The recent threat of terrorist attacks has spotlighted the need to improve aviation security standards. In 2008 Parliament rejected the use of security scanners because they failed to meet a number of requirements, such as respect for fundamental rights and protection of people’s dignity, intimacy and health. In the meantime, technology has advanced and enabled scanners to be developed which provide the necessary security without jeopardising people’s health and privacy. I felt that it was extremely important that the report mentions the need to inform passengers about the new types of scanners and the process which they will undergo during scanning to avoid any grey areas.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It has also been vital to explain that the scanners do not show a person’s body but standard images indicating only whether passengers have dangerous objects on their person or not.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I wanted to mention the need to increase the number of checkpoints and security staff to prevent as far as possible an increase in the time spent on security checks. On the issue of banning liquids, aerosols and gels, I call on the Commission to take the necessary measures to lift the restriction by 2013 and make it compulsory for these products to be scanned.</p>

      <p sl="et">Aviation security is a very important and relevant topic, and it is very much to be welcomed that we are discussing it today. According to Eurostat data, there were 751 million air passengers in the European Union in 2009, and for those and other people it is important to guarantee security on aeroplanes and in airports. I think that this report, which deals with aviation security, and above all security scanners, is necessary in order to ensure the rational and justified use of new technologies. At the same time, keeping in mind the health of passengers and employees, it is important to use those technologies that are safest for human health, and it is also important that in future contact with cumulative ionising radiation should not be permitted, and as a result they should be clearly ruled out. Many have expressed concern that the body images generated by security scanners are too revealing, but I dare say that is not the case. Having personally tested this, I know what kind of image is generated, and I find nothing revealing about it. The report states that all security scanners should use a stick figure to protect travellers’ identities and to ensure that they cannot be identified on the basis of an image of any body part. The report clearly states that data obtained from scanning must not be used for any purpose other than the identification of prohibited objects. These data may only be used during the time required for the scanning procedure. They must be destroyed as soon as the person has passed through the security inspection, and they must not be stored.

      <p sl="pl">I would like to offer my congratulations to Mr Grandes Pascual. He has drafted a balanced report which puts an end to certain illusions which are prevalent at European airports. Airport managing bodies will no longer be able to allow endless extensions to test periods for devices by making insignificant changes to their technical specifications. We are proposing clear rules for the use of scanners within the EU. The European Commission will receive an unambiguous message from us, and we are waiting for a draft regulation to be put forward on this matter without delay. I was happy to adopt a provision calling for restrictions on the carriage of liquids on board aeroplanes to be abolished. I believe that a joint effort by the Commission, the Member States and the aviation sector will result in a method being developed for checking liquids which guarantees at least the same level of safety that we have today. At the same time, I would like to remind everyone that there are still no regulations at EU level on the funding of more stringent measures regarding aviation security charges. The introduction of scanners at European airports may encounter significant difficulties without such regulations.</p>

On the other hand, our objective is to stress that women are a valuable human resource, with knowledge, ambition and skills that are not exploited by companies, as this valuable human resource is under-represented on company boards.</p>
      <p sl="el">The percentage of women on boards of directors is increasing by just one percentage point per annum. How many years will it take? How much energy will be wasted? How much talent will remain in the wings, bearing in mind that approximately 60% of graduates are women?</p>
      <p sl="el">Research has clearly shown – I shall not bore you with numbers, there is a lot of interesting information in the report – that, when women are involved in companies’ decision-making bodies, they turn in better results, perform better and are more efficient.</p>
      <p sl="el">If our economy today is to achieve the faster growth that Europe needs and if our companies are to become more competitive, they need additional characteristics and competitive advantages. These can be found in female gifts; I say ‘gifts’ because, apart from their knowledge and education, women have special skills, which are very important to companies, to administration, to understanding and to communication with the market. These female characteristics have proven valuable and companies have tried to make use of them in various ways. The actions applied by numerous companies are very widespread and well appreciated.</p>
      <p sl="el">Unfortunately, the meagre results force us to seek serious commitments from companies and effective action to give space and opportunities to women.</p>
      <p sl="el">What we need are arrangements to help balance family and work commitments, a meritocracy, transparency in the administration, in the management of human resources and in the composition of boards of directors. We are calling on companies to undertake to achieve these targets for female representation on their boards of directors and for the Member States to apply women-friendly policies which encourage women to take up demanding careers in this area.</p>
      <p sl="el">We are calling on the European Commission to map the current situation, thereby supporting the Commissioner in the binding targets already set for female representation at boardroom level. We are calling for it to promote actions to raise awareness, to support actions which companiess have implemented on their own and, if they do not bring in results, we cannot wait any longer. The Commissioner was very clear, we agree with its undertaking and, if we are to have immediate results, we need legislative proposals with targets of 30% female participation by 2015 and even more – 40% – by 2020, bearing in mind, of course, the differences underlying companies.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to add that there are initiatives in various Member States which we truly welcome, but we must work towards a single area of equality and competitiveness, which is why we are insisting on a European regulation, in order to give countries which have not taken any initiatives the chance to participate in this development and in the mobility of human resources. We also need an information campaign because, if legislation is to be applied with success, it needs as its partners society, the market and the social partners.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, gender equality is a fundamental right and it is one of the fundamental principles of the EU. Gender equality is also a condition for economic growth, social inclusion and well-being in our societies. The under-exploited pool of well educated women represents real untapped potential for the EU economy, especially at a time when human capital is a key factor in terms of our competitiveness and when, as a society, we are ageing.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU Member States might be very different, as the rapporteur has said, but they face a common challenge: the under-representation of women in high-level decision making, in particular in the corporate sector, is a reality almost everywhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that there are fierce debates about voluntary agreements versus binding quotas. I know too that there are five EU Member States which have followed the Norwegian example and have introduced binding measures to increase the number of women in business leadership. No later than last week, two Member States, Belgium and Italy, adopted legislation to impose gender quotas in business leadership. Irrespective of the solution found in individual Member States – and we know that there are other Member States that have binding quotas for state-owned companies, or general voluntary agreements – one thing that is clear is the business case for gender equality.</p>
      <p sl="en">This evening and tomorrow at voting time, Parliament will, I hope, take a strong position on this important issue. I thank Vice-President Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulo for her efforts to bring the European Parliament into this debate and for her bold report, and I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, who backed her almost unanimously.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why, in the European Union, do women constitute 60% of university graduates but only 12% on the boards of the largest publicly listed companies, and only 3% among the presidents of those boards? The question is: can Europe afford this? The answer is no, and it is not simply my answer. It is the answer from studies commissioned by businesses such as McKinsey and Deutsche Bank, indicating that there is a positive correlation between the presence of women in senior positions and company performance.</p>
      <p sl="en">So gender-diverse boards improve corporate governance and, from a micro-economic perspective, companies that have introduced gender diversity on their boards can also mirror the diversity of their employees and customers. By the way, 80% of purchasing decisions are made by women so it is an advantage to have women on the board, and there is a business case for increasing their involvement in management and corporate decision making.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is determined to advance gender equality further. You know about our strategy and you also know I have made it very clear that ‘Women on the board’ should be one of the aims we pursue. That is why, in March this year, I brought together the CEOs and board chairs of big publicly listed companies to discuss possible ways forward. I wanted to give self-regulation a last chance, and I have encouraged companies to develop credible self-regulatory initiatives to make significant progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have called on the EU’s publicly listed companies to sign the ‘Women on the board’ pledge for Europe and voluntarily to increase women’s presence on corporate boards to 30% by 2015 and 40% by 2020. After one year – i.e. in March next year – I will see which and how many companies have signed up to the pledge. I will assess the situation to see if there has been significant progress and if we have credible commitments. I hope the answer will be yes. Should it be no – should there be insufficient progress with self-regulation – then the Commission will explore policy options for targeted measures to enhance female participation in decision making.</p>
      <p sl="en">For me what counts is the end result, and the direction that Parliament takes tomorrow with this vote will undoubtedly be a very strong source of inspiration: not only for the Commission but also, I hope, for the corporate world.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the idea that economic and business leadership is the exclusive prerogative of men has long been untenable. On the other hand, those who think that anyone can be put on the board of directors or included in any other economic decision-making body – based on affirmative action or quotas – only because she is a woman, do not understand what we are talking about, or do not want to understand, or are mistaken at best. Quotas and other positive measures should help – as emphasised by Article 7 of the report – those who have the necessary abilities and are prepared, and all they have to overcome is discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Discrimination is not a disease that will go away by itself in time; it is a social problem against which we have to take positive measures. Those opposing the introduction of quotas usually argue that positive measures might become counter-productive. This is true, but remember that quotas are not eternal, they should only be used as a temporary solution, as a means of adjustment. The quantified objectives – 30% by 2015, and 40% by 2020 – place a double limitation on the life span of quotas, and we have to realise that Europe slowly but firmly turns into this direction, even if it is not accepted at the same level socially in every Member State. Positive measures, including quotas, serve and possibly are the only means to eliminate indirect discrimination. I would like to express my thanks to Commissioner Reding and Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for bringing this topic to this part-session, because we have to admit that this requires a lot of courage, even today.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows, being a woman is already an undertaking in itself, because it means having to manage and reconcile family, professional and social life, in a context that still does not adequately recognise the high level of education (as Commissioner Reding mentioned earlier), professionalism and expectations of women.</p>
      <p sl="it">I appreciate that in this report Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou has worked extremely hard to collect numerous proposals and objectives that, as a shadow rapporteur and member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I advanced together with several of my colleagues. In the European Union women are under-represented, as they are in management positions in companies, currently making up only 12% of the membership of boards of directors of listed companies.</p>
      <p sl="it">Against this background we are happy to have heard the serious commitment of Commissioner Reding, and we call on the European Commission to propose legislation including mandatory quotas by 2012, to increase percentages to 30% by 2015 and to 40% by 2020, if the steps taken by companies and the Member States are found to be inadequate. In this regard it is an encouraging sign that six countries, including Italy in the last few days, have approved legislation along these lines with a bipartisan vote.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to clarify that these quotas are not just numerical, but also aim to achieve better performance in the corporate system, by sharing the management not just of large enterprises, but also of small and medium-sized enterprises. This is why we are proposing the use of several instruments under corporate social responsibility, including family-friendly services, flexi-time working arrangements, and management training for women.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is also important to recognise the link between the presence of competences and women’s roles in corporate governance with a different approach to process management, optimal use of human resources, anti-discrimination rules and sustainable productivity which they often guarantee.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to raise another point also in response to what Mr Bauer rightly said earlier, and that is that we have not merely just included female quotas, but we have also included an important mechanism, which was our own proposal, and that is that the joint presence of men and women is linked to greater transparency in appointments, in the selection of men and women, so that this is a benefit for everyone, not just for women.</p>

      <p sl="et">Firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, for her hard work both between the groups and within her own political family. The approaches of the various groups differ, yet we are all of the opinion that the objective of equal opportunities must be enjoyed by both men and women. As well as being a prerequisite for democracy and social justice, gender equality is also a public good which brings social, political and economic benefits to both individuals and society.</p>
      <p sl="et">Research carried out in various countries has shown that women’s participation in management boards promotes performance, increases companies’ efficiency and leads to better economic results and higher profits. These research findings are based on facts. They have not been openly challenged, but implementing the proposals is an arduous task. The predominance of men in positions of leadership once again produces a perception that men are more appropriate and better leaders. Is that really the case?</p>
      <p sl="et">I would ask whether the recent financial crisis, which grew into an economic crisis, has really taught us anything. If, instead of Lehman Brothers, there had been Lehman Sisters, I would ask whether we would now be battling the consequences of a social crisis. We need a new approach. One pioneer in this area has been Norway, which began to do serious work in this area at the start of the previous decade. Of course, they too faced opposition and mistrust. A law establishing quotas for women’s participation has now been in force there for six years and has been successful. This model has also been adopted by several other countries. However, this is still not enough. There is still a lot to do in terms of this vicious circle.</p>
      <p sl="et">I would now like to turn once more to research. This has shown that experience of having female leaders is changing attitudes in favour of women being promoted to management positions. If there are few female leaders, on the other hand, then attitudes definitely will not change. Consequently, in order to change attitudes, we need to support the promotion of women to leading offices. Political will is needed here. We hold the lever for this in our hands, and I hope that tomorrow we will all support the adoption of this report.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the idea that more women are needed in top positions in business is something that unites Left and Right. For years and years now, everything has been tried to get businesses to look after this themselves, but all these efforts, sadly, have amounted to very little. At the moment, the increase is just half of one per cent per annum, at which rate it will take at least another 50 years before 40% of board seats are occupied by women. In my own home country of the Netherlands, last year the increase in the number of women heading up all the listed companies in the country together amounted to exactly one woman.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner Reding has noted this problem and resolved last March to take firmer action. If businesses do not produce credible plans to have 30% female board membership by 2015 and 40% by 2020, binding measures will follow. I have a great amount of respect for her for that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is our responsibility to give Commissioner Reding our full support in this area. We now have the opportunity to demonstrate that we mean business. I would find it a terrible pity if parts of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe were to vote against the core of this report. In that case, it might have been better for the whole report not to have been produced, as it will ruin the credibility of the Commissioner, specifically, instead of supporting it. At this point, we all need to grab this opportunity with both hands. Imagine if I give birth to a daughter in August, then I will be counting on the fact that you will all ensure, with me, that she grows up in a world where there is no glass ceiling preventing her from reaching the top in business. Of course, she may always want to become an MEP!</p>

      <p sl="cs">In relation to the topic in hand, I am generally a supporter of equal opportunities for women and men in all areas, and I therefore welcome an initiative in this area, and I firmly believe we must draw constant attention to the issue and bring it to the forefront at Member State level. The established and prevailing monocultures in leading business positions are no longer acceptable, either from an economic or from a social perspective.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I strongly supported this report from the outset, because the rapporteur originally concentrated on creating appropriate framework conditions for women in their career progress. The report has been greatly amended, however, during the legislative procedure in committee, and in its current form it calls for the introduction of specific binding measures at European level. Some Member States have already developed their own initiatives regarding the introduction of quotas, and in my opinion it should be up to the others to decide whether to follow suit.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the proportion of women in business management roles is truly low. The traditional issues affecting their professional careers are, I think, well known. Shortly after securing training, they go off on maternity leave, initially with the first child, then with subsequent ones, and natural professional development is interrupted. It is then necessary to look after sick children until they grow up. When women return to a professional career from demanding family duties, their male peers have a significant advantage.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I therefore think it is necessary to devote more attention to measures enabling women to maintain contact with professional practice even whilst they are caring for a family and young children, and to simplify their return to a full professional life once the family no longer needs as much care. Quotas for the proportion of women in managerial positions might also help women to secure socially important positions, as the submitted report suggests.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, if it is left up to the Commission and Parliament, in future a quota may possibly be put in place whereby at least 40% of corporate boardroom positions must be occupied by women. It is crazy that the European Union intends to meddle in the staffing policy of businesses with a quota of this kind. I ask myself how many women are really sitting about waiting to succeed to the top of a company as a result of this policy. I would personally decline it in advance, in any case, as I would not want there to be any possibility of doubt about the fact that I got to the top on the strength of my own qualities, and there are many women who agree with me.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Certainly, we do need to ensure that women enjoy the same opportunities as men, but a quota is a ridiculous idea. This is because there is only one relevant criterion on which to judge whether someone belongs in a job, and that is whether that person is the best candidate for the job. Man or woman, gender is not the issue.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is up to business to decide its own HR policy and this is certainly not something that the European Union should be involved in. We thus also find it unacceptable that the Netherlands is soon to have a female quota foisted on it by the EU.</p>

I would like to tell you, not a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, but a story set in Norway, where a certain Ansgar Gabrielsen, a minister in his country in 2003, decided, because the proportion of women occupying senior posts in private companies was only between 8% and 9 %, to introduce quotas. He was heavily criticised. He was also told there was no point. Well, I would like to ask you if you know the rate of women’s representation in senior posts in Norway today.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou is crucial for reducing gender disparity in corporate management bodies.</p>
      <p sl="it">National parliaments in many Member States are debating or have already introduced bills to introduce quotas for qualified women in the boards of directors of public enterprises listed on stock exchanges. As Commissioner Reding said, last week, on 28 June 2011, the Italian Chamber of Deputies passed a bill to introduce female quotas with a bipartisan vote. In Italy in listed companies and companies in which the state has a shareholding, one-fifth of the boards of directors and control bodies will have to be made up of women from 2012, and the female presence will have to rise to a third from 2015.</p>
      <p sl="it">I support the strong signal from Europe with regard to women’s integration in company management, in order to prevent a loss of talent, competence and human potential and to contribute to the performance of enterprises. It is necessary to act swiftly and with quota systems, because the information available in the European Union is worrying. On average women represent only 12% of the members of the boards of the major European listed companies and 3% of the chairmen of such boards.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this sense it is necessary to give more space to competent, qualified women, and to use the quota system to help them not to be marginalised by the corporate decision-making process. It is important to act at the root of the problem, and therefore I support actions to orient a greater number of young women towards science and technology faculties.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for this extremely important and, in particular, very courageous report. Equality between men and women is a basic element of the EU’s fundamental values, and we all have a moral obligation to ensure that men and women are treated equally. This also applies in relation to the representation of women in business, and therefore also in business leadership. However, equal representation in boardrooms is not just a question of fundamental rights. It also makes good economic sense, particularly when Europe is in the midst of a sustained economic crisis. If we are to overcome the crisis, we need to utilise all of Europe’s talents, and if women undertake the longest training and leave their educational institutions with the highest grades, it is plain old common sense that women should have the same opportunities as men to become managers. We simply cannot afford to recruit managers from only one half of the population.</p>
      <p sl="da">We can currently clear women of the responsibility for the financial crisis, because they were not on the boards of the banks where the decisions were taken. It is the case in general that there are no women on the boards of European companies, and there is no sign that this situation will change unless we actively do something about it. If businesses themselves cannot ensure that women come into the boardrooms, we politicians will have to intervene. We will have to introduce legislation that ensures that women have access to business leadership positions.</p>

Only one in ten board members in the European Union are women; 97% of board members are men. I think that we all agree that action is urgently needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to thank the Commissioner. Commissioner, it was you who took the bold step in March and called for action. You called on companies to take voluntary action. If they do not, you will table a legislative proposal, a legal basis, in March 2012. Thank you so much. The figures that we have seen in the meantime illustrate that something has already been done. If you had not been so bold, Mrs Reding, we would not have made these small steps.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should also like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, for her excellent draft. I agree with many of the statements in this draft. I shall support the draft, even though I take a different view of the quota as it now stands in the report. I take the view that, if self-regulation does nothing to help, a statutory quota is needed in order to put pressure on companies. However, I also take the view that we should start by introducing this quota for the supervisory structures of large companies, not for the operational side of businesses. I shall not therefore support the proposal in paragraph 16(b); however, I shall vote in favour of the report, because it says the right things.</p>
      <p sl="de">How women stand on the quota is a question of their own self-image. I would have no problem in using a quota to open the door. Whether or not I am good at my job is something that I still have to prove, regardless of how I get there. In that respect, a quota helps, but it is no substitute for performance. No woman has a problem with a door being held open. You have to walk through and prove yourself. Women in the European Union also need to be given an opportunity to walk through.</p>

      <p sl="fr">First of all, I can only welcome the general position of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM) on these quotas. As I have often said, it is a necessary evil, which will enable society to progress. However, more importantly than the ideological issue of quotas, the report encompasses a range of elements aimed at facilitating the presence of women at the top of companies, such as initiating a dialogue with the latter or developing training on gender equality. These quotas cannot be imposed in an authoritarian manner. We have to change attitudes to enhance the sustainability of this policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the report calls for measures to achieve a better balance between work and private life, which will benefit men as well as women. I emphasise this, because it is about changing corporate culture to bring about a better balance for all.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, workers’ professional ambitions are a very individual affair, and they depend more on personality and individual character traits than gender. This is why differences between modern women and men in this respect are disappearing. Women are making ever bolder moves towards prestigious, well-paid positions in companies, and we should therefore take note of and respond to the problems they have to face. As well as lower pay in comparison to men for the same work, they often find that they are deliberately blocked from promotions to the highest managerial positions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In line with the European Commission’s objectives, we want to change this situation by supporting various initiatives aimed at drawing the attention of companies’ management boards to the problem of the low rate of participation of women in management. The measures set out in the report adopted today, which include the promotion of social responsibility, the development of individual capabilities and training for management positions, will help women who wish to hold such positions and make full use of their skills to the benefit of the companies in which they work.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The aim of today’s report is to show that we are aware of the problem, and to show that making it harder for women to access managerial positions has a negative impact not only in terms of women’s self-esteem as workers, but also in terms of reducing companies’ revenue and putting companies in a worse economic position. In my opinion, we must above all change cultural attitudes and the traditional view of women which dominates the HR structures of large companies. If such a change takes place, women with the appropriate qualifications and individual predispositions will be employed in managerial positions as a natural consequence.</p>

When I say that quotas are a necessary evil, it is because I think that society is not moving quickly enough in the right direction, and that it may need to be forced, at a given moment, to move in a better direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Here, in the debate we are having today I am going to stop, because my time is up – I said that quotas were a necessary evil; that is what is necessary to ensure that society progresses more quickly.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for this report she has drafted, which marks a first step towards raising the profile of this issue. The outcome of these debates may offer long-term solutions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This report highlights an issue which has a significant impact on European business. Promoting women to management positions in companies is difficult and discriminatory. There is a glaring difference between the number of women who have graduated from university and the number who attain management posts in companies. Unfortunately, in spite of economic and social policies being adapted, the European Union is still faced with this problem. In theory, equality on the labour market is supported in absolutely every area. However, the figures show the opposite in practice. In this case, the work potential offered by women is untapped and undervalued. I should point out that various studies have highlighted that the actions of women managers have a positive impact on the competitiveness of companies. However, even in these circumstances, discrimination and prejudice prevent them from advancing in their career.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Another regrettable aspect is that the gender pay gap is maintained at management post level. I welcome that target percentages will be set for increasing the involvement of women in company management by 2015 and 2020. This will provide a specific method for evaluating how well these measures are implemented.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Lastly, I think that European institutions are responsible for initiating reform in this respect, with the involvement of all the decision makers. Joint action is needed at the same time from national authorities, trade unions and employers to get rid of this kind of hidden discrimination.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, it is common knowledge that there are more women than men in the world. Statistics also show that women outnumber men in terms of university education. In spite of this, their representation in senior managerial roles within medium-sized and large enterprises is desperately low. It is not just a matter of fairness and gender equality at all levels and at any price, but also of the economic growth of the European Union. Some European countries have begun to introduce legally-binding quotas, and the results, even if slow to materialise, are definitely positive. Discussions on this topic are also underway in other countries. I support this initiative at European level, and I welcome the Commission’s initiative to bring forward appropriate legislation in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also think there is a need to motivate women and to introduce appropriate legislation for them to able to harmonise their professional life with their family life more easily, for example in the area of childcare and elsewhere. Women must be motivated and constantly encouraged so that they are not afraid of having high ambitions, travelling for work or study, or developing a career.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly I would like to say that I do believe that this should stay as a Member State issue. I think it is essential for each Member State to look at its own economy. We have 27 very different economies and I think different rules work better if Member States look at their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am completely opposed to quotas. I have got where I am through my own merit, I did not need any quota on two scores, being openly gay or being a woman. I did not need quotas either way to succeed. I come from a country that had the first woman prime minister in the western world, so women can succeed on their own merit. What we need to do is look at providing advantages at a lower level. Greater child care: Member States should invest in greater child care. Greater use of technology will allow more women to stay in the workplace.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I come back to this: discrimination is discrimination. If you are a man who has worked for 20 or 30 years and you focus on a job but you do not get that job because there is a quota in place, you are a victim. You only get one life and your professional life has been taken away from you. That is wrong.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mrs Sinclaire, this is not a question, it is a, I believe, historic clarification. First of all, the first president in the world was Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, in Iceland, and the first woman prime minister was not Mrs Thatcher, but I am hesitating between Mrs Gandhi, in India, and Golda Meir, in Israel. I just wanted to clarify that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there are a great many women who have proved in politics, in business and in society that they are simply very capable. Since this very fierce debate started, there has been movement in some of our Member States: more and more women are being nominated to boards – which shows that when you look for them you can find them. They do exist.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to be a little polemic. We do not find many of the 60% of university graduates who are female on company boards. It seems that there is a male quota on company boards, an 88% male quota in the case of publicly listed companies: it certainly looks that way. We have noticed, in analysing the trend over recent years, that we are progressing without intervention at a rate of 0.5% per year. At this speed it will take 50 years to reach equality. We ought to think about that, especially at a time when we need all the talent available in order to make our economy thrive. With an ageing population, and as talent begins to be scarcer, we need women, and women mean business. Women mean life. Women mean everything positive – and we should give them a chance. It is as simple as that. The talented will go forward – as they do in this House, by the way.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that tomorrow there will be a solid vote in support of Ms Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou’s report, which is a very good one. It is a report which gives me courage and faith in this Parliament. The ideas that have been tabled here have been taken up in the commercial world by many companies. You need only look at how many women have been nominated to company boards in recent days. Things are moving, so let us help this movement to go forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">We, as politicians, can help it to go forward. Of course we need the corporate world to go with us, and we need the Member States to go with us. I see it as a very positive development that, in many Member States, relevant laws have been introduced or are in preparation. Things are moving. I thank Parliament for helping them to move even more quickly.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I shall be brief, because I have already spoken at length. Commissioner, I believe that it is clear this evening that overwhelmingly male boards of directors do not express the values of the European Union and do not benefit either companies or the economy in macroeconomic terms.</p>
      <p sl="el">We need to enrich them with women, precisely because women have talent. You may say that companies cannot engage in equality-based politics. Companies want talent and effective partners and employees. In that quest, they do not have a man or women before them; they have talent, the right person.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, life shows us and the figures quoted tonight make it clear that female talents are not in view. How can women account for 60% of graduates and post-graduates and only 3% or 8% of company boards? Therefore, certain measures are needed, certain methods that will give firms and society the chance to discover and exploit this talent. I believe that no one contests this, which is why we propose quotas, in order to provide momentum and opportunity to showcase this talent that we all believe exists.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe – and here I owe a reply to Mrs Niebler, who followed the report very attentively and made a very specific distinction for supervisory boards – that the objective of the report, the objective of our debate this evening is to give women an opportunity to play a role in which they exercise power, decisions and responsibility. Supervisory boards are not the same thing as boards of directors. I believe that we should not give women secondary rather than leading roles.</p>
      <p sl="el">Be that as it may, our report states that when – and if – the Commission makes a legislative proposal, it should take account of the specificities and, I repeat, of subsidiarity, because we know that company law is not the same in every country.</p>
      <p sl="el">Be that as it may, even with these minor distinctions, I believe that Parliament will send a strong message tomorrow both to the European Commission, regardless of whether the time is ripe, and to the Member States, as well as to companies themselves and to women themselves, that we are paving the way to help them achieve their ambitions and to offer their talents to society.</p>
