      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to make a point of order under Rule 166 of the Rules of Procedure. I refer to a letter dated 8 November 2005 – written to you by myself and by the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries and signed by the coordinators of all the political groups – concerning the blocking of a report I had written. We have had no reply from your office and I would ask you whether it is normal procedure for you, as President of Parliament, not to reply to Members of this House?</p>

      <p sl="unknown">We take due note of your comment, although it is not a point of order. The services are preparing a response with regard to a conflict of competences between the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Until that conflict is resolved, it will be difficult for me to inform you of the result.</p>

This is a question of transparency and responsibility, even though, as myself and my group believe, the outcome of the final vote is clearly dependent on the direction in which the debates have gone. I believe that it is only right that the other Members who remain hesitant should be able to consult each other so as to give an informed opinion.</p>

You will notice that there has been no signal on it whatsoever from the front bench of this group. That was what we said to the Socialists yesterday. This was a free vote on whether to include private healthcare within the scope of the directive, not healthcare overall. Many people other than members of this group clearly felt that was the case, but that does not alter in any way our commitment to the overall package that we have before us.</p>

Mrs Gebhardt is right to point out that you have the right to alter one of your own amendments, and the information supplied by the services is correct in that respect. Irrespective of your own intentions – and it is not the majority that is right but the law that is right – it is open to us to take over in our own name an amendment already submitted. That is what Rule 150(5) says. That has nothing to do with your actions.</p>

Therefore, I shall now quote your Rules – and, as you said yourself, we must be scrupulous about the Rules of this fine establishment. Rule 170(4) states: ‘Before or during a vote, a political group or at least thirty-seven Members may move that the vote be adjourned. Such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately.’ It does not matter whether you are against the EU or for the EU, surely all of you in this Chamber can see that this is now a farce!

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I should like to stress the positive character of the common position reached by Parliament, which is giving Europeans back that sign of political unity and trust that they need.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will highlight the positive impact that Article 31, in its amended version, will have on the very important area of tourist services. It is a question, in fact, of paving the way for large, balanced flows of incoming tourists, by carefully following a path that identifies the way in which to harmonise the huge numbers of tourists in the various countries. I therefore call on the Commission to thoroughly revise and relaunch a directive that many Member States have so far failed to comply with – Directive 320 of 1992 – so that the policy of high-quality services is fully realised and, with that, the objective of sustainable European tourism.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In actual fact, I have no difficulty in acknowledging the improvements made – and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt – to Mr Bolkestein’s initial proposal. Nor do I have any difficulty in admitting that I have been left unsatisfied as a result of the uncertainties linked to Article 16. Although I voted in favour of the compromise amendments on this report, I cannot endorse it and I chose in the end to reject it because it symbolises a serious historic break with the principles that have, up to now, enabled European integration to be taken forward. Solidarity and regulations are giving way to competition among the countries and the peoples of Europe. I deplore this state of affairs.</p>

Its scope has been narrowed, the country of origin principle has finally been deleted and labour law has been kept: we have transformed the spirit and the letter of the draft submitted to us, and I am pleased at this outcome.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The only European institution able to bring about this deep and inspired change is our Parliament. This is undoubtedly because we listened to our fellow citizens and to their anxieties and fears; and it is undoubtedly because we endeavour above all to champion a European model of common values and because we will always prefer upwards harmonisation to downwards dumping. We have done some good work, and the Commission and the Council will really have at last to take account of the strong political signal that we are sending today and that expresses our desire to complete the internal market, while preserving our social model. For our part, we will make sure that they do so.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is beyond doubt that the version of the services directive that we have just voted to adopt is a good deal better than the original one; as I see it, the unacceptable country-of-origin principle may not have been done away with, but it has certainly been considerably undermined.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is still, nonetheless, a great deal that is unclear in the document we have adopted today. At the moment, nobody knows precisely what the implications of much of it are.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For example, I am as yet far from convinced that this text cannot result in social dumping, and am particularly unhappy about the potential for monitoring compliance with it. The many abuses – committed not least by the institutions – in the implementation of ordinary European budgets cause us to be at least sceptical about the efficiency of monitoring at European level.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have therefore abstained from voting, for, although this may well be a step in the right direction, and even a very considerable one, there are still too many unclear points that absolutely must be removed at second reading stage. I can only hope that I will have no difficulty in voting for it then.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is of course a good thing that this House has, today, been able to amend the original text of the services directive, although it has to be said that many of the hundreds of amendments were not necessary. The original version of the directive may well have put social dumping on an institutional footing, but the present version, too, permits a form of the same thing, along with all sorts of other abuses and does not entrench the country-of-origin principle in an unambiguous form of words.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Does it not speak volumes that the request by the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group for the establishment of a monitoring centre to ensure that the directive does not open the door to social dumping, was rejected? By abstaining, we are sending a political message that my party, the Vlaams Belang, will, just as it did last month in the debate on the liberalisation of port services, resist at all costs any attempt to undermine the principle that one’s own country comes first.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The reason why I abstained during the voting on the Evelyn Gebhardt report on the Services Directive was that Amendment 250, presented by MEPs from the new Member States in the PPE-DE Group and considered to be a key point for new member countries, had not been adopted.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This amendment was to change the Directive by adding Article 35a as a replacement for Articles 24 and 25 on the posting of workers, which were removed from the Commission’s proposal during voting in the IMCO committee. The amendment would have simplified the procedures for posting workers, as the Posting of Workers Directive does not provide for any administrative cooperation between the country of origin and the country of destination.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am pleased that the Directive was approved during the first reading in the European Parliament. But on the other hand, I am saddened that MEPs from the new member countries again failed to gain enough support.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, my vote against the Gebhardt report is no reflection on the extraordinary work done by the rapporteur. I truly believe that, faced with an atrocious text, Mrs Gebhardt performed some amazing feats. Despite all her efforts, however, she was unable to contain a liberal upsurge that threatens our entire social structure. With one compromise after another, this abstruse text has become unreadable. Yet, what remains clear to anyone willing to open their eyes is the way in which the Commission has abandoned a desire for harmonisation in favour of a case-by-case regulation of what can or cannot be done on behalf of the general interest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Without a directive on services of general interest and services of general economic interest, this text leaves grey areas that will open the floodgates to countless legal appeals. Europe is becoming yet slightly further removed from the citizen.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The directive will lead to a reduction in the inexcusable red tape that exists in various Member States, and the provision of services will be subject to the rules of the country in which the service is provided.

I should like to pay tribute to the considerable work done by Mr Harbour, who - along with my friend, Mr Toubon - followed the matter on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. There was an increasingly urgent need to legislate so as not to leave it to the Court of Justice’s magistrates to ‘lay down the law’ on the fourth fundamental freedom of the Union as it relates to services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The compromise makes it possible to outline a framework supporting the competitiveness and development of service activities, which represent 70% of GDP and great potential in terms of growth and job creation, while combating the risks of social dumping. Mr Chirac, the President of the French Republic, was right to oppose the first text presented in January 2004 by the Prodi Commission, and the European Parliament did its job as co-legislator properly. This is a victory for responsible democracy and a major step towards the construction of a social market economy.</p>

This rejection was not upheld (153 to 486 votes).</p>
      <p sl="fr">The French members of the PSE had three basic requirements: that SGEIs be excluded from the scope of the directive, that the rule of the country of destination principle be explicitly referred to and that a framework directive on public services be referred to.</p>

      <p sl="nl">1) This House may well have made improvements to the Commission draft, but I do not regard them as sufficient. It is wrong that it should still apply to a number of public service sectors, to what are termed services of general economic interest. This directive really should not apply to such operations as, for example, the collection of household waste and the supply of water. Moreover, framework legislation is needed to put the right to public service provision on a secure footing.</p>
      <p sl="nl">2) Certain points in the directive can be interpreted in more than one way. The public currently take a sceptical view of Europe and so legal uncertainty in legislation is the least we need.</p>
      <p sl="nl">3) What we need is a social and trustworthy Europe with the same harmonised ground rules across the whole of internal market, and this directive is no way to create one.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am nevertheless pleased to see that such sensitive sectors as port services, employment agencies, care of the elderly, the health sector and childcare have been excluded from the directive’s scope and that, moreover, each country’s social achievements remain intact, thus making social dumping impossible.

      <p sl="sv">Today, the European Parliament is saying what it has to say about how we are to create free movement of services within the EU - one of the four freedoms on which our common European cooperation is based. In an evermore globalised world economy with constantly increased competition, the European economy needs to make the most of those areas in which we are competitive. The services sector is one such area. The compromises on which the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have agreed have unfortunately opened up new opportunities for making further protectionism legal and in such a way as will obstruct the trade in services between neighbouring countries and will deal a particularly hard blow to the newest Member States. In spite of everything, I have chosen to vote today in favour of the watered-down proposal, since it may be a first step towards what I hope will be a freedom of movement for services – which are already exposed to competition – that is worthy of our common European internal market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We are disappointed that our proposal to reject the Bolkestein Directive was not adopted. This Directive lies at the heart of the so-called Lisbon Strategy and is the linchpin of neoliberalism in the area of services. Its purpose is to serve the interests of the large economic and financial groups in the EU, as demonstrated by the stance of representative organisations of these groups, such as the employers’ association UNICE.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Whilst it is true that the struggle of the workers and the people have forced some concessions and rewordings, which we have supported when they have been positive, the appalling agreement between the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in Parliament has thwarted the expectations of those who trusted that Parliament would be able to reject a proposal as damaging to the workers and the people of the Member States as this one.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We accordingly voted against the proposal as a whole, and many of the specific points to which we are opposed, in particular in the following areas:</p>
      <p sl="pt">the liberalisation of most services, including sensitive public sectors and services, such as water, social housing, energy, postal services, research, education and training, cultural services and security services; our proposals aimed at the removal thereof from the scope of the directive were rejected;</p>
      <p sl="pt">the fact that the contractual arrangements of the workers, especially freelance workers, have become more precarious;</p>

At the same time, its aim was to rectify a draft directive, the philosophy of which, being based on competition between the social and fiscal laws of the Member States, would have tragic consequences via the levelling down of the various social models.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While the first of these objectives was fulfilled, the same cannot be said for the second. Admittedly, Parliament helped substantially to modify the line of the initial text by deleting the country of origin principle, by excluding SGIs from the scope of the directive and by protecting labour law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact remains that there are still a large number of grey areas. Social services and the economic component of public services (SGEIs) are still under the direct threat of unacceptable social dumping. The legal vacuum associated with the deletion of the COP presages, furthermore, a new situation, in which it is the judges of the European Court of Justice who will have the power to lay down social laws, with no guarantee of the outcome or democratic control.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Although I welcome the progress made on this matter, I am quite unable, for these extremely important reasons, to support the final text submitted to Parliament.</p>

Even though the overly explicit references to the country of origin principle have disappeared, there are still areas in which this scandalous principle will apply in full or in part. The uncertainties, the grey areas and the inconsistencies that remain will give the Court of Justice in Luxembourg the power to apply its own interpretation to the directive. Well, the Court has always ruled in favour of those who considered that certain standards – particularly social ones – constituted an intolerable obstacle to competition. The Commission will have an excuse for pushing harmonisation downwards in areas lying outside its powers, such as social protection and labour law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, amended or not, I reject the Bolkestein Directive. I reject the absurd principles that underpin it; I reject social and legal dumping and the free competition that is praised to the skies but responsible for unemployment; I reject the planned relocations; and I reject this Eurocracy that refuses to take into account what the nations think, so that it can continue imposing unwanted policies on them.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As a result of the resounding condemnation of the worst aspects of this proposal and the workers’ campaign to have the directive rejected, the majority in Parliament has excluded some areas from its scope, putting a decision on them back to a later date and, in a feat of legal sleight of hand, has concealed the regulation applying the law on the country of origin of the service provider.</p>

I welcome the removal of patient mobility from the directive - it should never have been included. In fact, the Commission's all-embracing proposal has been ill-considered and poorly thought through. I look forward to major amendments in their next proposal.</p>

That is what the Court of Justice confirmed by recognising a COP, a country of origin principle. For the blind among us, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, signed in Marrakech in April 1994, laid down, throughout the world, a ‘fourth mode’ of service provision, in the form of a cross-border provision of services, that is to say of a temporary switch to the social dumping conditions of the country of origin.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is this old principle that the leaders of Europe are now pretending to discover, whereas this COP has been devastating European economies for decades. Seeking to maintain the French-influenced European social model, with its pensions, its health protection, its free schools, its post offices, its trains and its hospitals, demands that we not only oppose workers being paid the lowest possible wages, as practised in the most socially backward countries, but that we also oppose the idea of a market without customs protection, which is the real cause of social dumping. The rule of the COP is only one symptom of this social dumping. The starting point – the first rogue cell – of this social cancer is the idea of the single market, without the protection of customs duties. The country of origin rule is nothing other than a secondary cancer.</p>

With more than 53 cases before the European Court of Justice, where businesses are arguing for their right under the Treaty to provide services across Europe, it is time for us to set down rules for the operation of the service market. Parliament has listened to people's concerns and fears and ensured that the freedom to provide services is not the freedom to undermine citizens' employment terms and conditions and their rights as consumers.

The social democrats had already made enough disgraceful concessions to the conservatives, but, just before the end, they made another one, the consequence of which was that the directive would continue to apply to ‘social policy’ and ‘consumer protection’, just as the freedom to provide services already did to ‘services of general economic interest’. This is quite utterly unacceptable.</p>

The Services Directive is designed to remove the obstacles to two of the freedoms that have formed part of the EC Treaty since 1958: freedom of establishment for suppliers of services, and freedom of movement for services. The potential for the trade in services is huge, and Sweden is one of those countries that has most to gain from an efficient market for services.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The debate on the Services Directive has been wide-ranging. Swedish and European trade unions point out that the directive contributes to ‘social dumping’.

      <p sl="pt">It is extremely important to set out the strategies clearly and thoroughly, with a view to boosting the development of Europe’s rural areas, improving the living conditions for people in those areas and enhancing the rural environment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I warmly welcome both the Commission’s proposal, which offers a broad range of objectives and measures, and the McGuinness report, which fine-tunes the strategic guidelines in a number of specific areas, such as the protection of rural cultural heritage and the rural landscape.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Following discussion, in accordance with the conciliation procedure, of the Strategic Guidelines for Rural Development, the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has produced many commendable proposals. The European Parliament is trying, however, continually to exercise more control over the Member States’ agricultural and regional policies. That is something towards which we are unsympathetic.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We do not believe that the Member States can be bound by extensive target-setting documents where rural development is concerned. We have great confidence that the national or regional parliaments in the Member States can cope constructively and successfully with this issue.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Strategic Community guidelines are to be adopted for the next financial period 2007-2013, within the scope of the new regulation on rural development. I wish to stress the importance of rural development, especially as rural areas make up 90% of EU territory and 50% of the EU population live in those areas.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The purpose of these strategic guidelines is to define the areas in which EU funding can create the most value added at EU level, to translate the main EU priorities into rural development, to ensure consistency in programming with other EU policies, and to support the implementation of the new CAP and the necessary restructuring in the old and new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Like the rapporteur, I support this proposal for a Council decision, as it addresses the need to provide the Member States with clearer guidance on the implementation of the regulation. Nonetheless, special priority should also be attached to modernising the farming and forestry sectors, and to encouraging young farmers and their families not to leave rural areas.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Rural development in the second pillar is just a smoke screen. It is the fancy name used to describe the disappearance of our agricultural production to the benefit of producers from Brazil, Australia or the South Pacific, with the consolation prize of modest jobs as landscape gardeners for the surviving members of France’s and Europe’s farming communities.</p>

Of course, it must be illegal to shout 'fire' in a cinema or to directly provoke racial hatred.

      <p sl="en">Yet I am not sure I see the Danish cartoons that were published falling into that category. They were certainly offensive to many, but that does not mean they meet the same test as promoting racial hatred. Certainly, when I see opposition to their publication coming from the fundamentalist Christian right in Europe, I start to worry that the laws of blasphemy are being dusted off again across Europe. The correct position would have been not to forbid publication, but to condemn the content of many of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for Mr Frattini's 'code of conduct' for journalists, it deserved the decision it received.

Similarly alarming is the fact that the major powers in the EU are moving closer to the ambitions of the USA in the region. It should not be forgotten that the initiative to block a negotiated solution under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran came from Germany, France and the United Kingdom, an objective long supported by the USA.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Unlike what some would have you believe, it is the USA and its allies, especially Israel, that have threatened peace and perpetrated war, aggression and occupation. They are the ones that occupy Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine, and have countless bases and thousands of troops stationed in the region.

I consider the edifying words in some paragraphs to be totally misplaced. The impression is once again being created that the free expression of opinion and freedom of the press are negotiable. I cannot, and indeed will not, put my name to that. To me, the free expression of opinion is an absolute right, and, in this connection, I would like to quote Voltaire, who said: ‘I may despise what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it’.</p>

Liberal democracy has proved unable to impose the rule of law on the Muslim communities in Europe or any respect for religious freedom on Muslim states. Instead, by making freedom of speech an absolute, it has managed to cause affront to the religious sensibilities of Muslims. Freedom without responsibility inevitably leads to conflict, however.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Respect for national and religious sensibilities provides the basis for respecting the people who express them, irrespective of whether we agree with these views or not.

Mr Cohn-Bendit is not right in claiming that religions become ‘de-religionised’ in the public sphere.

I wish to stress that this does not, in any way, involve relations between countries but, rather, relations between people belonging to the Muslim or Catholic faiths. The Jewish community was forced to flee the country at the start of the conflict and never became involved in it. A further peculiarity is that when the country came into being, most of the orthodox community lived in rural areas, whereas most Muslims lived in the cities.

Bosnia was disbanded as an administrative unit in the 1920s and re-established after the Second World War as a mixed area in the centre of the federal state that was intended to help integrate the different peoples within Yugoslavia, of which it was itself a miniature version. That proved a complete washout. During the 1992-1995 war, each of those groups made unilateral attempts to impose their own wishes. Dayton was a panacea intended to provide peace and reconciliation, and, whilst it is an inefficient and costly structure, it was born from the need for conciliation between widely diverse aspirations, and so, despite all its flaws, it should not simply be discarded, but should instead be used to build a federal structure in which all can live sustainably in peace with one another.

      <p sl="el">It is calling on the authorities of Belarus to safeguard 'equal conditions' for all the political powers at a time when all the political parties are free, while in the 'democratic' Baltic Member States of the ΕU communist parties are banned and 40% of the people have no nationality or civil rights. In other words, the burglar is trying to convince everyone that the householder was to blame for the robbery.</p>
      <p sl="el">We are voting against the motion for a resolution and we express our solidarity with the people of Belarus in its efforts to repel imperialist intervention and choose its own way forward.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the very interesting report, drafted by my fellow Member, Mr Kindermann, on the implementation of a European Union forestry strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Currently, the issue of how forests and wood relate to the processes of environmentally friendly wealth creation and social progress is very inadequately covered in European public policies. It is time for the European Union significantly to support the projects based on the forest-wood sector in relevant geographical areas. The link between a forestry strategy and rural development must be established and, while we are on the subject, I regret that mountain areas should not have been singled out for attention. Equally, and this in the context of the Lisbon Strategy, the Union must take a greater interest in supporting research programmes linked to the use of wood, for example in the construction and energy sectors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, a study, as a precursor to action, should be conducted on the transportation of wood, which is a heavy product, so as to provide some coherence between forests, areas of consumption and road, rail and maritime transport infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome Mr Kindermann's report on the implementation of the EU's forestry strategy because, although forestry is not actually dealt with in the Treaties, there is a need for an EU action plan for sustainable forest management that provides a coherent framework for the implementation of forest-related actions and serves to coordinate Community actions and the forestry policies of the Member States, which is drawn up in close coordination with the Member States and the various stakeholders concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">As someone who lives in one of the last important remaining oak forests in England, I am acutely aware of the need for sustainable forest management. Forests have a multi-functional role. In the Forest of Dean, the forest provides a beautiful environment and a natural habitat, opportunities for recreation and tourism, potential for work and industrial realities, as well as a home for people to live in. And yet, in the majority of cases, the multi-functional role, measured against the potential it offers, is not reflected in the economy of the areas concerned or in the income of their inhabitants. Rural development policy is the main instrument for implementing the forestry strategy at Community level and I support this.</p>

      <p sl="sv">We are of the view that the EU should not develop a common forestry policy. This policy area constitutes a very important national issue. We should have liked the European Parliament to have stated that the objective was for forestry policy to remain an area for national decision-making. We met with a certain amount of sympathy for this view in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety during the discussion of this report. Unfortunately, however, the majority of the European Parliament has, in accordance with its usual obsession with doing everything on an abnormally large scale, prepared a report which, for example, will cause the sector-specific Community policy and the Lisbon Strategy to have an impact on forestry and which recommends that an ‘objective report [be] drawn up to examine the scope for creating a separate legal basis for forests’ in the EU’s Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We decisively reject such shifts in the political statements made by the European Parliament. It should be explained once and for all that forestry policy is an area in which decisions are to be taken purely and simply on a national basis. We cannot vote in favour of a report that has a more or less hidden agenda to introduce a forestry policy at EU level that is to be conducted with appropriations from the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0332/2005) by Enrico Letta, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates (COM(2005)0088 C6-0084/2005 2005/0016(COD)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-164" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to thank the rapporteur, Mr Letta, and all of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the excellent work they have done on the proposed Regulation on this type of statistic.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like, in particular, to emphasise the fact that, in its work, Parliament has stressed the need to make the data provided for in this Regulation available as soon as possible. There is no need for me to remind you that our most direct competitors, the United States and Japan, have had detailed information about their companies’ external investments for more than twenty years, and this puts their governments and economic actors at a considerable advantage compared to Europe when it comes to drawing up their strategies and commercial policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission therefore considers it very desirable for Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement on this proposal for a Regulation at first reading, so that the collection of this type of data can begin this very year. I believe that both institutions are very close to an agreement, and we hope that it is reached as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">As I have said, the Regulation responds to a vacuum in the Community statistics that puts us at a disadvantage. At the moment, we only have the data that certain Member States collect on a voluntary basis, either within the context of structural economic statistics or the compilation of its balance of payments statistics. It is not possible to calculate aggregates for the European Union of twenty-five, however, given the diversity of the methods used and the type of information compiled.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is no need to point out the importance of completing the internal market and the importance for all of us of the Lisbon Strategy and its objectives of increasing growth and employment and of making the European Union an attractive area for investments and one that favours entrepreneurial activity. Furthermore, this is a year in which the importance of defending European interests in multilateral commercial negotiations is particularly obvious.</p>
      <p sl="es">The data that this Regulation is intended to obtain is extremely useful in all of these respects. At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about a type of statistic that is essential to increasing the dynamism, vitality and competitiveness of European companies and economic actors.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this regard, the Commission believes that the amendments that the honourable Members have presented and discussed and that are aimed at speeding up the implementation of the compilation of this data provide an excellent basis for reaching a compromise at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, for the same reason, the Commission does not agree that it is necessary to maintain the amendments relating to Parliament’s role in implementing the Regulation, since, given its very technical nature, this kind of amendment would provide relatively little added value, while almost certainly preventing an agreement with the Council at first reading; I am referring, of course, to Amendments 1, 2 and 9, which are aimed at extending the procedures of the so-called Lamfalussy process, in relation to the legislation on financial services, to the field of the compilation of statistical data.</p>
      <p sl="es">The honourable Members, and in particular the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which is also responsible for the negotiation of the directives on financial services, are in a privileged position to appreciate the differences between the two sectors. There is no need to remind you of the different levels of implementation of the legislation on financial services and the reasons, very different to those in relation to the case we are discussing today, why the Commission considered it appropriate, on some of these levels, for Parliament to have a greater capacity for scrutiny than that laid down in the current rules on comitology.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, before I finish, I would like to stress two factors to the honourable Members, in the hope that you will reconsider your position on these three amendments: 1, 2 and 9.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, account must be taken of the existing agreement amongst the institutions to set the definitive parameters for the compilation of data, once the results of the pilot studies are known, by means of the codecision procedure. In this way, Parliament will have full capacity, together with the Council, to play its role as legislator in the essential aspects of the implementation of this Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, I would like to point out that the current Austrian Presidency has expressed its political will to reach a satisfactory agreement with Parliament on the review of the rules on comitology. As you are well aware, a compromise in this field that will reflect more fairly Parliament’s legitimate aspirations to play its role as legislator fully is within sight.</p>
      <p sl="es">Under these circumstances, Mr President, while repeating, of course, that the Commission is willing to keep Parliament fully informed at all times of the work of the different committees, I hope that this Parliament’s vote will facilitate an agreement on this Regulation at first reading.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-165" speaker_id="28413" name="Enrico Letta" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Almunia for his speech and for the valuable work done by the two institutions during the preparatory phase leading up to this debate.</p>
      <p sl="it">Beyond its seemingly technical character, this directive is very important, and our aim in drafting it is to regulate two types of data on foreign affiliates, namely inward statistics, which relate to all the businesses and sectors that are under foreign control, and outward statistics, which relate to foreign enterprises that are controlled by a company located in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">As Commissioner Almunia said, the Commission proposes to establish a mandatory reference framework for the compilation of Community statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission proposal includes two different modules for collecting inward and outward data. The module for inward FATS is based on the Structural Business Statistics Regulation, while the one for outward FATS is the same as that used for foreign direct investment in the Regulation for Balance of Payments Statistics. Whereas the provisions for inward FATS would be for the most part mandatory, the provisions for outward FATS include a voluntary experimental phase based on pilot studies aimed at assessing the feasibility and costs of collecting data.</p>
      <p sl="it">The critical element for this directive is the fact that, as Commissioner Almunia just pointed out, the United States and Japan have already had this kind of information available to them for over 20 years, in even greater detail than what is provided for in the directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission proposal includes pilot studies and comitology procedures with long transition periods. That is liable to leave European political officials without adequate data for a long time yet, while their US and Japanese counterparts can now already access better information on the economic strategies and trends of their own enterprises and transnational companies, including in the area of outward FATS.</p>
      <p sl="it">For all these reasons, we believe that the Commission proposal must be supported, but with a few requirements taken into consideration. Firstly, the provisions of this regulation must not represent an excessive bureaucratic and financial burden for the companies involved. Secondly, it must not take too long to implement the regulation and therefore to make the data available, so that the policy makers in Europe can be on an equal footing with their US and Japanese counterparts as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">The comitology procedure, which has been widely debated within our committee as an alternative to the legislative procedure for the implementation of outward FATS, must be assessed very carefully and in the knowledge that every effort will be needed to fulfil the objective of making uniform data available in the short term.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, the European Central Bank and other institutions that are particularly in need of adequate statistical information should be involved in the development of common standards.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our preparatory talks before today’s debate saw a divergence open up between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. We have always tried to reach a compromise that would lead as quickly as possible to the directive being approved at first reading. However, our impression that the Council did not want this text to be approved at first reading prompts us to regard the discussions held in committee on the subject of comitology as an issue that Parliament must bear in mind, particularly when the amendments on comitology are put to the vote.</p>
      <p sl="it">For all these reasons, we believe that it is useful and important to recommend that this Chamber vote in favour of the directive. This is an important vote because it will succeed in making our European international trade system focus more carefully on data relating to competitiveness. From the start, our aim has been to have this directive approved at first reading. Beyond its seemingly technical character, this directive has a highly important content that prompts me to suggest to this Chamber that it vote in favour of it as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Letta for his cooperation in preparing our position on this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">My group is committed to two main points. Firstly, the collection of these statistics is urgent and needs to be as complete as possible, as soon as possible. It is difficult to see how one can conduct meaningful trade negotiations without them. This means that the mandatory collection of statistics on both inward and outward FATS is the best solution. It is amazing to me that apparently some Member States are just not willing to consider providing them. The Council has introduced a derogation for Member States which have not yet tested this process to deal with just those situations in Article 6, point D. Is this not enough?</p>
      <p sl="de">Both inward and outward FATS should therefore be collected on a mandatory basis and mandatory pilot studies should be set up for imports and exports. If not, just a few years on Member States that have not volunteered to do pilot studies will claim that it is still not necessary and will still refuse to collect the data.</p>
      <p sl="de">My group’s second issue is comitology, which is raising its head yet again. If Parliament’s position on this means that we will have to go to a second reading, so be it. My group will stick with its position on comitology until the Council shows itself to be serious about giving the European Parliament reasonable expectations in this area. Even now, a reassuring statement by the Council might still be enough for us to reconsider our position.</p>
      <p sl="de">My group will therefore vote in favour of the text that was adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-167" speaker_id="21918" name="Manuel António dos Santos" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="pt">I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Letta on his excellent work culminating in the report before us. I should also like to thank Mr Almunia for the very precise clarifications that he contributed to this debate, which will certainly help us to reach a solution in time for the vote taking place not in this part-session but in the next.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Much has already been said about the nature and origin of this debate. Its origins lie in the proposal for a regulation on Community statistics and the structure and activity of foreign affiliates. It has been said here – and reiterated by Mr Purvis – that these statistics provide vital help to national and Community policy-makers to formulate appropriate policy and to help businesses assess ongoing developments in a business world affected by economic globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although voluntary data collection on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates – that is, inward statistics – takes place in virtually all Member States, proving that a concerted procedure is possible, the same cannot be said of outward statistics, which only occurs in a small number of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This information is only really useful if it is available promptly and consistently and if data collection is harmonised, hence the need to establish a common framework at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I agree with Mr Almunia on the importance of reaching a solution at first reading, although I also agree with Mr Purvis that it would not be a disaster if such an agreement is not obtained at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although there is a great deal of common ground, as all speakers have said, arising from the pressing and timely nature of the directive itself, there are aspects that we would normally see as upholding the comitology principle rather than the codecision procedure, but which in practice form part of what ought to be Parliament’s role as regards all such procedures, in particular those of a financial nature.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is what must be guaranteed. I was somewhat comforted by Mr Almunia’s remarks about the changes pending to the comitology process in order to take into account the importance of Parliament’s role in decision-making and monitoring these processes. It strikes me, however, that it is not entirely guaranteed. I would therefore reiterate that if it is not necessary to reach agreement at first reading, I do not think that is particularly serious given that the most important thing is that we find a sound, properly thought through, common platform from which to implement the regulation in question effectively.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The need to introduce improvements has also been mentioned, and my group accepts this completely. In this regard, there will not be any difficulties with either the Council or the Commission, as regards the pilot studies or periods of regulation and the deadlines to be observed for obtaining this kind of information.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To my mind, anything that helps to make the pilot projects mandatory, to remove from the pilot projects mandatory conclusions and to reduce periods allowed for derogations and the deadlines for establishing definitive data is of vital importance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We accordingly endorse the rapporteur’s proposals, the significance of which lies in the fact that they specifically address those areas.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My group is amply prepared to make full use of the time remaining before the final vote for us to reach an agreement, in the context of bilateral contacts, enabling this report to be adopted at first reading. I repeat, however, that I do not believe that failure to do so will lead to insurmountable obstacles.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We also hope that the Council, which at times during this process has struck us as being too insular, will begin to show some openness, along the lines of the openness that came through from the accommodating and significant words of Mr Almunia.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should like to close by once again congratulating the rapporteur. The debate in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was most interesting. Given that the report was adopted unanimously, I feel sure that we will find an appropriate solution to the problem, in conjunction with the Council and the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="es">With regard to the comitology problems, which we have all mentioned, I would like to reiterate what I said in my first speech: we hope that the work of the Austrian Presidency will allow us, during this six month period, to find a solution which suits and satisfies all of us.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0022/2006) by Mr Hamon, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the strategic review of the International Monetary Fund (2005/2121(INI).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-175" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider the report being debated today in Parliament, drawn up by the rapporteur, Mr Hamon, and discussed by the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to be very timely, since the International Monetary Fund is in the midst of debating its strategic review on the basis of the document presented by its Executive Director.</p>
      <p sl="es">As you know, the Commission does not have any direct or formal presence in the International Monetary Fund, and nor does the European Union. It is the Member States that are represented. But we must bear in mind that the Member States represented in the European Union and this House account for more than 30% of the shareholders in the International Monetary Fund.</p>
      <p sl="es">This contribution to the debate therefore seems to me to be extremely useful, in terms of how to ensure greater economic and financial stability in the global economy, with the development of the least developed countries and the eradication of poverty included within this notion of stability.</p>
      <p sl="es">In order to achieve these objectives, there is no doubt that the assistance of the institutions with the capacity for global action, such as the International Monetary Fund, is needed.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first thing that strikes us when we analyse the role of the Monetary Fund in the world economy at the beginning of the 21st century is that the objectives set for it when it was created in 1944 are still relevant today.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, while the objectives of promoting international monetary stability — those of facilitating the expansion of international trade, promoting exchange stability and lessening the degree of disequilibrium in balances of payments — are still entirely appropriate, the economic context within which the Fund is operating today is radically different to the context of sixty years ago.</p>
      <p sl="es">This fact is recognised by the Fund in its strategic review, of course, in which it states that the challenge of globalisation is central to the work entrusted to that institution. The Fund’s new approach is therefore to look at its essential tasks of monitoring and lending within the context of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="es">To this end, the Fund takes account of both the risks and the opportunities. For example, in its strategic document, it acknowledges that the free movement of capital allows for a more efficient allocation of resources, but at the same time it also points out that it leads to greater volatility and greater risk of extreme reactions by the markets in the event of crisis. It also notes the impetus provided by the emerging economies, which are making a great contribution to the high levels of growth in the world economy, but also notes that the power of these emerging economies is making it more difficult for the poorest countries to jump on the bandwagon of world trade and world growth.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission shares the view of globalisation expressed by the Fund in its strategic document; we communicate our views to the International Monetary Fund during the fluid and frequent contacts that we hold with that institution. In particular, as you know, we cooperate with the Monetary Fund in defining our policies and adopting our decisions on the macrofinancial assistance that the European Community gives to countries of the Western Balkans or some of the States that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. Macrofinancial assistance, based on the resources of the Community budget, is always linked to a series of conditions that are complementary to the Fund’s interventions in those same countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the field of development aid and the eradication of poverty, the Monetary Fund, together with the World Bank and the European Union, are undoubtedly the main world players and, in this case, there is also close and productive cooperation between the different institutions.</p>
      <p sl="es">All of these aspects are taken up in one way or another in the report that we are debating today, and the Commission is very happy to express its agreement with the positions expressed by the rapporteur and supported by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="es">The report also stresses the need to distribute the quotas and voting rights within the Fund’s governing institutions in a manner that reflects the relative weight of the different economies of the member countries in a more balanced manner. This will give the least-developed countries and, in particular, the African countries, a greater voice, since their current quota of representation and capital in the Fund is very low.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the Monetary Fund points out in its documents, carrying out this reform of the distribution of quotas and voting rights is the responsibility of the shareholder countries and requires significant political will. It has to be appreciated that to increase some people’s quotas at the expense of others may benefit everybody in the medium and long term because it will allow the Fund to carry out its duties more effectively and fulfil the objectives set for it.</p>
      <p sl="es">My final point, Mr President, relates to the external representation of the eurozone and of the European Union in economic and monetary matters. I would like to thank the rapporteur and all of the honourable Members who have included this point in the report that we are debating today, though I would like to point out — as I believe I said in this same Chamber last year — that the Commission would prefer a clearer and more direct formulation of the objective of a more appropriate external representation of the eurozone and of the European Union as a whole, such as that proposed in Amendment 5, presented by Mr Purvis, for example.</p>
      <p sl="es">Together with the Presidency of the Eurogroup, the Commission has begun reflecting on how to move towards this more effective external representation of the eurozone and, eventually, of the European Union. Through will and realism, we are trying gradually to draw up a consistent approach that will enable us to make progress towards better coordination amongst the members of the eurozone when it comes to expressing a position in international financial institutions. In the short term, the intention is to identify items in the programmes of these institutions with regard to which the Member States can achieve a coordinated position, such as in the field of budgetary monitoring, for example. In the long term, the objective is still to achieve a single representation for the eurozone in the Fund, which will allow it to exert an influence equivalent to the economic weight of the Monetary Union. To this end, the strong political support of the Member States will undoubtedly be required.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission believes that Parliament can and must make a significant contribution to giving form to this aspiration, expressing its opinion in this regard as clearly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">I shall end, Mr President, by saying that the Commission is prepared to study how Parliament can participate in the formulation of the positions that the representatives of the eurozone and of the European Union are required to express in international financial bodies and institutions. This issue must be examined. It is not easy to find a way, but, in any event, I can assure all of the honourable Members that the Commission and myself are fully prepared to go further into this issue whenever you see fit.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I thank Commissioner Almunia for the favourable welcome he has given my report, which is also the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me to emphasise a fact that is important enough to be worth pointing out: the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted unanimously in favour of this report. I would also like to pay tribute to the work of the Committee on Development and the Committee on International Trade, and in particular that of their draftsmen, Mr Wijkman and Mr Bourlanges, who have greatly contributed to improving this report that comes at a time when the International Monetary Fund is reflecting on its strategy and on how to assess the development of its mission, the impact of its policies and the way in which it works.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to return to the spirit in which the shadow rapporteurs and the entire committee worked to ensure that our Parliament's report makes a useful contribution to the strategic revision of the International Monetary Fund whilst taking account of the major challenges facing the fund: first the issue of its governance, then the issue of its economic doctrine and of the impact of its choices on the Millennium Goals, and finally, more generally, the way in which, through its role of monitoring and crisis prevention, it now continues to guarantee global macroeconomic and financial stability.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the issue of governance, let me remind you that the Member States are currently divided into nine constituencies, which means that the European Union, if we can talk about the European Union in this context, has no unified representation. It is thus through these nine fragmented constituencies that the European Union expresses its opinion. It can also be seen - and this point is stressed in the report - that there is little or no coordination between the Member States within the International Monetary Fund. That is why this report advocates, firstly, strengthening coordination between the European seats and, secondly, step-by-step progress towards representation for the European Union as a whole within the International Monetary Fund with, of course, the prospect of a single seat, passing in the meantime via a single seat for the Eurozone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As it stands, the report does not exactly refer to the issue of the single seat, but sets the objective of ensuring that the European Union is represented and votes as a single block within the International Monetary Fund, which seems to me to be an absolutely vital step. Why is it vital? Because it would give the European Union the blocking minority that it does not currently have, in other words 15% of the voting rights within the International Monetary Fund. The United States are currently the only ones to have a blocking minority, and we know what impact it can have on the major political and strategic choices that the International Monetary Fund has been able to make. That is a very important key element.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would add that these changes in the European Union's representation may also make it possible to resolve the issue of the distribution of voting rights and thus of the influence of the emerging economies and developing countries within the governing body of the International Monetary Fund. We feel that the representation of the emerging economies should be in better proportion to their economic weight. It is also necessary for the countries with the biggest populations but the smallest economies, in other words the developing countries, to have much greater voting rights than they currently do, for the simple reason that they are the 'beneficiaries' of the International Monetary Fund's policies. That is why the report advocates increasing the number of basic votes: in any event, this is one of the possibilities to explore in the immediate future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point we are emphasising relates to the issue of the legitimacy of the International Monetary Fund's interventions, particularly when the scope of those interventions is becoming ever wider. We favour improving the transparency of the International Monetary Fund and the way it works. I am thinking in particular of the recruitment of experts and of the need to diversify their profiles, so that they can more easily adapt their recommendations to the diversity of the situations they encounter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The final point, which is just as tricky, relates to the way in which we can assess the structural adjustment policies and the International Monetary Fund's recommendations over a number of years. Today, the Fund is much criticised for the implementation of some of its recommendations, for its macroeconomic doctrine and for its rather too strict application of the Washington consensus. That is what led us to call on it to demonstrate greater flexibility and to find the best way of ensuring that the local authorities and countries concerned establish poverty-reduction strategies. This seems to us to be a very important step.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have also suggested that some of the Fund's interventions have not been infallible if you look at the results obtained, the social costs of the structural adjustment plans, or the spread, or even reappearance, of crises. We have emphasised these points to encourage the Fund to alter some of its choices as part of its strategic review.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would add, and I would like to stress this point, that we must not end up, in terms of world governance, with a kind of implicit hierarchy of standards that tries to place the Fund's recommendations at the pinnacle under the pretext that they affect not only macroeconomic stability and growth policies, but also labour market policies, the funding of social programmes, education and health. We must not end up with this hierarchy of standards placing the Fund's recommendations above all other international organisations, sometimes to the point of producing out-and-out contradictions between the Fund's recommendations and those of the international agreements of the International Labour Organisation or the World Health Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, we hope that the European Parliament feels more involved, particularly with the prospect of a single representation for the European Union, in the responsibility of the EU's administrators within the International Monetary Fund. We hope that, just as the Fund maintains regular relations with the US Congress, it will maintain regular relations with the European Parliament and that it will be equally accountable and responsible to the representatives of the European people.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Committee on International Trade has issued an opinion that very closely matches Mr Hamon's excellent report, and I think that they really do contain very convergent opinions and very similar concerns.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have three main concerns. First of all, like the rapporteur, we aspire to better coordination of all development policies. We have put our finger on a contradiction: the International Monetary Fund is a part of a whole, with a specific responsibility, but at the same time it is much more than a part of a whole, because, as the lender of last resort, it has, as Mr Hamon has just mentioned, a sort of de facto pre-eminence that is not without its problems, resulting in a quest for better coordination with other international organisations, particularly the World Trade Organisation, the International Labour Organisation and the World Health Organisation. We need to think carefully about these coordination methods.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, we want to see a redistribution of powers. We do not want to succumb to an excessive demographic fever that would cut us off from the global economic reality, but we feel that, as it stands, the emerging economies are not adequately represented and that power must be redistributed to those economies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we, like the rapporteur, would like Europe to speak with one voice and act as one. It really is distressing to see that Europe, which, across all the Member States, has almost twice as many votes as the United States, counts for so little within the organisation. Can we start moving towards the single seat right now? Probably not, but we do need to start moving towards informal models comparable with shareholder agreements, starting with the Eurozone and with the aim of subsequently getting the whole of the European Union to speak with one voice. Those are our concerns, and I do not think that they contradict Mr Hamon's.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would first of all like to thank Mr Hamon for the enjoyable way in which we have worked together on this report. It has been an interesting and, I hope, ultimately productive example of collaboration between our respective groups.</p>
      <p sl="de">The PPE-DE Group welcomes the IMF’s review of its activities and of its future direction. The Fund has played an important role in the global economy for more than 60 years and we want it to carry on doing so, but to do this it needs to refocus on its core mandate of promoting financial stability and supporting countries with balance of payments difficulties. It has a key role in supervising the world’s monetary system and helping to prevent and deal with crises. Its surveillance role needs to be stepped up to concentrate on reducing global financial instability and advising individual countries about financial stability, economic growth, exchange rates and reserve accumulation, because these are essential preconditions if countries are to avoid and get out of difficulties and poverty traps.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Fund has been criticised for its conditions when lending to financially stretched countries. I share the concerns that these conditions may have been too rigid at times but, as a responsible lender and custodian of funds, the IMF must be able to impose conditions when lending money. The requirements it sets out are there to improve a country’s economic situation by opening up markets and promoting sensible economic policies, good governance and sound financial management. Often, indeed, the IMF is a useful scapegoat for governments having to force through unpopular reforms.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning to Europe’s role in the IMF: as Mr Hamon said, the EU is currently spread over nine constituencies – I thought it was ten but perhaps he is right in saying nine – and has lacked any semblance of a cohesive position in setting IMF policy. A first priority, therefore, should be better coordination. There are advantages in being in different constituencies, not least that the EU has greater voting power than any other part of the world and can better influence non-EU countries within these constituencies, but this counts for little if our Member States are at sixes and sevens. A single EU seat is not a realistic goal just now, even if it is an aspiration for the long term, but much more could be achieved right away by better coordination of Member States’ positions.</p>
      <p sl="de">My group will submit some amendments and some split votes in order to help improve Mr Hamon’s report which, overall, we hope to support.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur and the other groups for their good cooperation in committee. I hope that the decision to postpone the vote on this report will provide an opportunity to assess which of the amendments tabled improve the report and which have the opposite effect. Perhaps we can find some compromises in the meantime.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also agree that this is the right moment for Parliament to have this debate and that this is the right moment for this report, given that a strategic review of the IMF is taking place and the Economic and Financial Committee has produced a paper that will be discussed in the Ecofin Council. For us, too, the role of the IMF in strengthening the stability and solidity of the international financial system is a core issue. However, we should also like to see more focus and attention on social and public policy aspects, and that is why my group retabled some previous amendments.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the constituencies issue and the single seat, both of you have already touched upon how we could strengthen the European voice vis-à-vis other parts of the world. The rapporteur is aware of my own observations on this debate concerning the situation in the Netherlands, in particular, and Belgium, which are in a broader constituency and subject to effects of this kind, but I believe that we could try to find a good formulation on strengthening the European voice and on strengthening the voice of the less-developed countries in the structure in particular.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other amendment we would draw attention to is that concerning transparency and dialogue with NGOs. Here, the IMF could learn from many other international institutions, including our own European Investment Bank, on how to improve dialogue with, and consultation of, NGOs in their work. It might be important to stress this, as well as the issue of the accountability of EU representatives in the IMF. We see a role for the European Parliament in that as a follow-up to this debate, and we hope that we can agree on finding methods and structures, such as the ad hoc working party proposed in our amendments, to create a follow-up on this.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, multiple financial crises, the rise in the number of poor countries and the exponential increase in their debts prove that the International Monetary Fund is the main means of promoting imperialist interests. It is an international organisation at the service of capital, which uses it to impose its choices on the peoples whose countries need loans, on the sole pretext of currency stability and balanced development.</p>
      <p sl="el">The International Monetary Fund is engaging in political blackmail against the countries which need its loans, by imposing despicable conditions relating to all public policies and cutting public spending, especially on education, health, social protection and every sector which affects a balanced budget. The policy of harsh austerity and the unacceptable social terms imposed on countries which take recourse to it are designed to protect lenders and safeguard their capital, privileges and profits. They are characterised by disdain for the social consequences and provoke a general outcry and mass demonstrations when it meets.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, it is not the outcry which results in its strategic review. On the contrary, the International Monetary Fund will acquire an even more aggressive character towards the interests of the workers following a review which will adapt its structure, administration and action, as well as its sectors of direct and indirect intervention in the new reality which emerged from the overturning of the socialist regimes and the new balances between the imperialist centres and the new targets of imperialism, which result in even greater exploitation of the workers and of wealth-generating resources, under the umbrella, of course, of the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Union, in other words Euro-unifying capital, is seeking joint and coordinated participation in the International Monetary Fund, so as to increase its share of influence and profitability, not to change its policy, given that it is promoting a similar policy through capitalist restructurings and the Lisbon Strategy, by commercialising basic grass-roots needs.</p>
      <p sl="el">The proposed administrative changes are nothing more than make-up which tries to conceal the truth. Only the fights of the peoples against imperialism and its institutions, against the choices of capital, can bring about changes on the basis of equal relations and mutual benefit, in order to achieve development which will guarantee grass-roots prosperity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this debate gets to the very heart of what the European Union is all about.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the United Kingdom – and I am sure in many other countries – the argument that was used when we first joined and continues to be used is that we are in the EU because we have greater influence in the world if we speak together with one voice. Well, I look at the WTO; I look at trade talks, where already no individual state may speak on her own behalf. What do I see? I see a Hong Kong summit that failed in December, despite the generous offer made by the Americans, and I see a situation where certainly the globe’s third largest trading nation could have done a rather better job for herself.</p>
      <p sl="de">This proposal for a single European seat is certainly not going to suit Britain, Denmark, or Sweden. We are not even in the euro. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, 1976 – when we went cap in hand to the IMF – is a dim and distant memory. A single IMF seat is not about economic logic; it is purely about politics. It is purely about turning the European Union into an international superstate. As we heard in one or two of the previous speeches, it is about standing up and forming a bloc to oppose America. The same logic is being applied elsewhere when it comes to the United Nations Security Council. I ask myself – whether it is the United Kingdom, France, Germany or any other country – do we have more influence in the world speaking as 25, speaking with one voice? Or do we have more influence if we are able to put our own opinions forward and speak on behalf of our own people? I know the answer, but I suspect that most people in this House do not.</p>

      <p sl="sk">More than five years ago, financial authorities, including the financier Mr George Soros, were already issuing warnings and calling on the governments of the world to adopt measures to ensure the stability and transparency of financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The proposed European Parliament resolution on the strategy for reviewing the International Monetary Fund is therefore correct in highlighting the role of this international institution in securing financial stability. The draft resolution also correctly points out that this task has not been fully implemented, as a result of a lack of transparent global scrutiny over the standardisation process in the area of financial markets. The full implementation of this task by the International Monetary Fund would undoubtedly have a positive impact on financial market stability.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Increasing pressures in the financial markets also result from the constantly increasing volume of trading in derivatives, with the United States of America playing a leading role. The volume of trading in derivatives has long since become many times greater than the volume of transfers in the real money sector. Developments in derivatives’ trading may therefore become a time bomb for the world’s financial markets and the world economy as a whole, and I believe that our report should give much more prominence to this issue. For this reason, I am going to support the resolution proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Hamon. I would also like to express my thanks for his work.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, this report is very timely at this point, since the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral bodies have been with us for some years now, with the task of regulating the conditions of the world economy.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that this is a story of success. A relative success, like all successes, ladies and gentlemen, but a success nonetheless, in relation too to the functioning of the International Monetary Fund, which has now put the kind of world crises that we have experienced during the history of the developed countries and in the developing countries behind us.</p>
      <p sl="es">The emphasis placed by the International Monetary Fund on macroeconomic stability is fundamental in order to promote equal opportunities for economic development for everybody. Today we see it as essential for economic development to be based on a healthy balance of payments, inflation control and the balancing of budgets in the developing States. These healthy balances of public finances are fundamental to creating climates of confidence and, ultimately, to enabling a State to progress and develop higher levels of well-being and, in turn, to promote economic growth. From that point of view, our report must place clear emphasis on stability.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the European Union’s presence, we must not forget the problems we are currently facing within the European Union in terms of coordination and, therefore, although in the medium and long term we must move towards a single voice in the Monetary Fund and in other multilateral bodies regulating the world economy, we must be prudent and modest, as Mr Purvis pointed out, bearing in mind that, at the moment, we proceed on the basis of our various countries being represented in different categories.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, it is important, as in the case of Spain, that we stand shoulder to shoulder with much of Central America and Latin America, so that we also take more account of the economic development of a region as essential as Latin America in order to ensure balance in world development and to ensure development and equal opportunities for Latin American countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">This report therefore offers an opportunity for this Parliament to express its opinion and, in this regard, I hope that we are also working to achieve the greatest possible consensus and that this report will make a positive contribution to defining the role that needs to be played by multilateral bodies in modern economies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to ask a number of questions about this report. Many of them have already been addressed, however, so I restrict myself to talking about two of them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I wish to remind the Chamber that on 12 April 2005, Parliament adopted an important resolution, which set out the EU’s role in implementing the Millennium Development Goals. This commitment for the EU to eliminate poverty has been repeated on countless occasions, which, quite apart from being consistent, provides real substance to policies specifically geared towards global development.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is from this perspective that we should be analysing the own-initiative report by Mr Hamon, which is commendable for the information it provides and for the solutions it proposes for the much needed strategic reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
      <p sl="pt">The international community’s concerns and commitments as regards the development goals should also be attributable to the IMF, at least on an instrumental level. The Fund must also undergo a thorough-going transformation of its action towards the indebted countries if it is to make full use of its capacity to meet these objectives.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Whatever opinions may have been formed of the IMF since it was set up in 1944, what is indisputable is that it is facing a crisis of legitimacy, firstly relating to the nature and scope of its recommendations and the structural adjustment policies, and secondly relating to the allocation of voting rights and the marginal representation of the emerging countries and developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This brings me to the second question, which is that of the European dimension. On this issue I have high hopes. Although I appreciate the difficulties mentioned here of setting up a single representation and a single place immediately, I am very much in favour of a single representation and a single place. This is a political problem mentioned to me in a critical tone by an MEP who had the floor before me. It is actually a matter of choice and a political problem that lies within the EU itself.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is the EU that needs first to pave the way for conciliation and coordination if it is to deserve this position of single representation in the IMF.</p>
      <p sl="pt">One thing I know without fear of contradiction: a single, coherent, audible European voice in the IMF is an essential prerequisite for a genuine cooperation policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is also the thrust of Mr Hamon’s message, and he has my full support.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I should firstly like to thank the rapporteur for a generally constructive report. I share most of the views expressed in it. The report contains an in itself unobtrusive, but nonetheless clear, criticism of the International Monetary Fund’s structural programme and of the conditions imposed on recipient countries. Such criticism is crucial because this policy has, in actual fact, exacerbated poverty and increased social problems in many countries. It is therefore vital that the issues highlighted by the report, namely the fight against poverty and the need to achieve the Millennium Goals, be incorporated as overarching objectives of IMF policy. In the longer term, this type of institution ought no doubt to be a part of the UN system and of a coherent development policy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I also join in the criticism of the lack of democracy in the IMF. What is crucial in this area is that the developing countries should have more power, and what is perhaps most important in this respect is their need to be given a fairer share of the votes when decisions are taken. Democratisation must, however, also mean that a developing country can be given the Managing Directorship. This post should not go automatically to one or other of the richest countries. Democratic control within the EU should also increase, but it should be exercised by the national parliaments. I do not think it would be fair to transfer power over IMF policy to the EU institutions, and I am therefore opposed to Amendment 5. I believe that policy within the World Trade Organisation is a shocking example of a lack of democratic control over EU policy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">For many years, there has been a prevailing tendency to place undue confidence in deregulation and free currency speculation. The majority of monetary movements are now downright speculative. If macroeconomic stability is to be achieved, there is a need for self-protection against these trends, at both national and international levels.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We have tabled an amendment of our own which is, I suppose, in keeping with the demands for increased democracy in the IMF and through which we wish to increase scrutiny, and we hope that it will be adopted. We shall vote against the proposal by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but in favour of most of the proposals by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as a rule we do not go in for plain speaking in this House. We tend to prefer euphemisms and diplomatic niceties, but today I will venture to call a spade a spade. The report before us is basically a scathing criticism of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, the European Parliament has the opportunity to say what critics of the Fund have been saying for years. The report rightly highlights the fact that, I quote, ‘the stabilisation policies implemented by the IMF have not always achieved the objectives hoped for and whereas stabilising economies too suddenly is likely to result in undesirable social adjustments’. We also agree that, I quote, ‘the monitoring of these programmes should be the subject of transparent democratic supervision’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Fund sometimes acts as if it were operating in the middle of the jungle, though it is a jungle whose rules it has itself created.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The number of conditions poor countries have to comply with in order to obtain assistance has been growing year on year. An example is the absurd situation that sub-Saharan African countries find themselves in, where they have to fulfil an average of 114 conditions in order to have access to funding.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The rapporteur has rightly emphasised the need to set up new financial tools. The Fund has too many priorities when it comes to reducing the debt of the poorest states. The IMF has to go back to its original role. Its main aim used to be global exchange rate stability, and this should still be the case today, as a previous speaker mentioned a short while ago.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In his report, Mr Hanon is right to state that the increase in the Fund’s tasks has not been accompanied by any significant reform of its management. We are therefore entitled to demand enhancement of the Fund’s legitimacy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The rapporteur quite correctly points out that the Fund, and I quote, ‘has sometimes failed to prevent crises from becoming infectious and recurring’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We wholeheartedly agree with the criticisms levelled at the Fund. We agree that its policy fails to take account of the fact that inflation is not the only economic problem facing developing countries, and that the Fund should focus on achieving macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth. Finally, we are pleased with the conclusions drawn in the report, namely that macroeconomic stability is not at odds with the fair distribution of growth.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would simply like once again to thank the rapporteur and the members of the committees who have been involved in the drawing up of this report, which, as I said in my initial speech, seems to me to be extremely useful.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would emphasise the importance of the discussion that is taking place and that, it is hoped, will end at the Fund’s Assembly in Singapore, in September, with a new distribution of quotas which, in turn, will be linked to a new distribution of voting rights and hence to the governance of the Fund, which is something that can be improved.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that it is important for the European voice to cooperate in establishing a clear approach to improving the governance of the Fund and the representation of the different States in the Fund’s governing institutions, in accordance with fair criteria.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would emphasise the importance — and I believe that the huge majority of you will agree with me — of greater coordination of the countries of the European Union in terms of the positions taken by the European Member States in the Fund.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we want the coordination of economic policies to progress, if we want there to be greater integration amongst the different Member States in the internal market and in the Economic and Monetary Union and if we want Europe’s external influence also to have an economic dimension, it is important that the European Union’s external economic dimension is also reflected in the deliberations and discussions of the Monetary Fund.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that the European Parliament’s role with regard to the Monetary Fund will progress as we move forward with the coordination of the European voice in the Fund’s institutions, until eventually — I am convinced that we will get there, though not in the short term — we have a single voice and single representation for the countries of the European single currency in the Monetary Fund. This will not happen today, or tomorrow, but it is a direction that I believe to be both inevitable and desirable.</p>
      <p sl="es">I shall add finally that reference has been made — and I share this concern — to the need for the Monetary Fund to act in coordination with the strategies also set out in other fields by multilateral organisations and, in particular, by the organisations of the United Nations system.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that we must be pleased that the Monetary Fund is involved in and committed to the achievement of the Millennium Goals. Achieving these is one of the international community’s fundamental objectives. I believe that the Fund’s involvement and commitment, which would perhaps have been difficult to imagine fifteen years ago, are today a reality.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The IMF’s board of directors consists of 25 people, each of whom represents an individual country or group of countries. The EU countries are represented individually or as members of nine of these groups.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Nordic Group consists of the Nordic countries and the Baltic states and thus includes countries such as Norway and Iceland, which are not members of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The IMF’s role has changed since the organisation was founded immediately after the Second World War. Operating within a system of fixed exchange rates, its main tasks from the beginning were both to help countries with balance of payments problems temporarily to fund deficits in the balance of current payments and to check that the countries concerned were taking good care of their economies. It was also important that the countries did not devalue their currencies in order to become more competitive. Nowadays, the eurocountries, armed with their European Central Bank, have approximately the same role as the IMF. The eurocountries have fixed exchange rates. Possible concessional credits to eurocountries that end up in financial crises need to be handled within the group of eurocountries.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Countries outside the eurozone have fluctuating exchange rates and do not therefore end up with balance of payments problems. They also have better control of their debt ratios. It would be natural for the eurocountries to form a common group in the IMF, with one headquarters. EU countries outside the eurozone should not be part of the group. Nor is there any reason for Sweden to form part of a common EU group. If it were, we should also lose our ability actively to influence the IMF’s relations with the developing countries.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Sadly, in various parts of the globe, as a rule, the destruction of cultural monuments is a consequence of or prelude to the extermination of people. Therefore, I support the resolution and the opinion that we must declare our position on the destruction of cultural heritage in Azerbaijan. In conflicts such as the one between Azerbaijan and Armenia, it is difficult to blame only one side. Cultural monuments there are being destroyed as a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which in 18 years has claimed the lives of 25 000 people and made a million inhabitants refugees. Neither aggression, provocation from one side or the other nor the desecration of cultural heritage will help to unravel this entrenched conflict. Only if the sides seek negotiations, find a common political language and show good will, with the aim of drawing closer to the European Union, can the flames be put out. According to recent surveys, a large proportion of the populations in both states want to bring the conflict under control as soon as possible. Those states, which want to play an active role in the European Union's Neighbourhood Policy, simply must protect the cultural heritage of minorities appropriately.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the destruction and desecration of a cemetery by anyone, anywhere, is a barbarous act. If such a cemetery is also a monument of special archaeological significance, then it is part of our common international heritage and its destruction constitutes, in addition, a crime against humanity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Armenian cemetery at Julfa is a Christian cemetery of exceptional historical and cultural importance. Disregarding an international outcry, Azerbaijani governments, whether by omission or – more likely – by commission, have been responsible for the systematic destruction of this monument over the last few years. The actual perpetrators of that atrocious act are thought to be Azerbaijani forces and Islamic fanatic civilians.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is totally unacceptable for the Azerbaijani Ambassador in Brussels to have recently sent e-mails to MEPs in which he embarks on a viscous personal attack against one of the authors of this resolution and attempts to denigrate and insult the integrity and wisdom of this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I strongly urge you to vote in favour of this resolution and thus send a very clear message of our feelings of concern and disgrace to the Government of Azerbaijan for the destruction of the Julfa cemetery.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the alleged demolition in December 2005 of the mediaeval Julfa – also known historically as Jugha – Armenian burial grounds, with the breaking-up of the khachkars, or beautifully engraved headstones, is a serious desecration of European Christian heritage.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Azerbaijani Government claimed the video footage documenting this is fraudulent Armenian propaganda. But I have received independent verification that the footage is genuine from a British architect, Steven Sim, an expert in the region. Furthermore, if there has been no destruction, why are on-site visits refused by the Azerbaijanis, who also, rather bizarrely, state that this could have been done by looters needing the stone for local building work?</p>
      <p sl="en">Once more Mr Sim has stated that passage into the cemetery requires passing through Azerbaijani army-controlled territory, making such a thing almost impossible without official support and in clear breach of their duty of care to protect the site.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have also been informed by the Azerbaijani Embassy that this destruction is nothing compared to the destruction of Azerbaijani mosques. I was indeed sent photos of destroyed mosques. That mosques in the war zone were destroyed in 1991 is undeniable and to be condemned without reservation, but the photos I was sent I believe represent destruction that took place 15 years ago, not 3 months ago. Furthermore, the Julfa site in Nakhichevan was never part of the war zone. Also, it is worth pointing out that I have been informed that the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities have recently agreed to a project for the reconstruction of mosques destroyed on their territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now at a critical juncture in the talks between the two Presidents, Kocharyan and Aliyev, in Rambouillet, France, on finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute. I therefore believe that any further planned destruction of Armenian heritage will not be conducive to lasting peace in the region.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, there is no doubt that all cultural monuments around the world are part of our common heritage and that they should not become victims of political events or, in particular, of war.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would appreciate it if you would allow me to relate a personal anecdote. When I went to Armenia a few years ago and saw all those monuments and churches which have survived to this day since the early Middle Ages, I was reminded of my earlier visit to Spain, at the other end of the Christian world, a thousand kilometres to the west. I was impressed by how similar the monuments in these two regions were.</p>
      <p sl="pl">They were all monuments of early medieval culture. We are responsible for all the monuments in the world. Nonetheless those European monuments which bear witness to the cultural past and unity of Europe ought to be particularly dear to us, be they located in the remote eastern part of Armenia, the western borders of Spain or anywhere in between.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It seems to me that the events we are witnessing now are particularly distressing because the monuments being destroyed are more than just part of Europe’s heritage. They belong to the whole world. Azerbaijan’s responsibility is particularly clear. As Mr Tannock mentioned earlier, why does Azerbaijan not allow anyone to visit these places and assess the extent of the damage on site? Fortunately, we do know what happened as a result of barbaric decisions made by those in power in the region, and we have evidence of the damage on film.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This resolution must be passed and then we must monitor what happens next. The steps to be taken cannot be limited to words, however noble they may be. Words must be followed by actions and we expect Azerbaijan to take action.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it is vital to remember the importance of the EU's commitment in the southern Caucasus, which is still wracked by frozen conflicts, but is highly strategic and resolutely European. We are aware that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is currently on an official visit to the region, but I would particularly like to launch an appeal to parliamentarians and an appeal to responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when the European Union is negotiating action plans with each of the countries to promote the stability of the region, Armenia and Azerbaijan have entered a delicate, but hopeful, phase of peace negotiations regarding the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Presidents Aliev and Kocharian met last Sunday at Rambouillet, under the aegis of the OSCE Minsk group. The success of the process is the top priority, because it could indirectly lead to a resolution to the other conflicts in the region. It is thus a vital precondition to the general stabilisation of the region.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, ladies and gentlemen, do you really think, in your heart of hearts, that now is the time to throw oil on the fire by deleting, as the amendments propose, the sections that quite rightly allow a balanced approach to the joint resolution that we all negotiated together the day before yesterday? We have already condemned the destruction of the cemetery in Julfa, in Mr Tannock's report from January, and we continue to condemn it. However, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot leave out the global context of the frozen conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which has been responsible for thousands of deaths and refugees; the wounds are still raw. Can we also ignore the fact that 20% of Azerbaijan's territory is considered by Armenia to be a buffer zone for Nagorno-Karabakh and that various elements of the cultural and religious heritage of these occupied territories have also been destroyed? It is high time to stop this dangerous escalation. It would be irresponsible to deny the shared responsibility of the parties to a conflict and to refer only to the destruction caused by one side, and it would also be contrary to our commitment to support our Armenian and Azerbaijani friends in the desire to resolve their differences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, this resolution comes at a time of increased tensions between the Muslim world and the western world. A weak text could reduce these events to a simple clash between the Christian and Muslim worlds. I therefore ask you not to give arguments to the extremists of all sides by voting for a resolution which, if it were amended in line with certain proposals, would be unfairly partisan. It is a question of personal conscience, but it is also the credibility of the European Parliament and, more broadly, the activities of the European Union in the region that are at stake.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in the days when the Russian Tsars ruled, the Transcaucasus was one of the conquered areas on the edge of the Empire, where the territories of Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis were not clearly defined, and where the peoples did not live in peace with one another, but were subjected to the undemocratic rule of the Russian state.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It was not until the 1920s that the three peoples were separated from one another administratively, each with their own territory. While this was necessary to secure peace, development and stability, it did mean that mixed areas had to be allocated to one of the groups that were involved in the conflicts. We can now see the effects this has had in minority areas South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and, above all, in Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakhchivan, which are subject to both Armenian and Azerbaijani influences.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The temptation is considerable not only to drive out from those areas the people who belong to the neighbouring peoples, but also to destroy their historical buildings, places of prayer and burial and wipe out their memories for ever. Now that there is no longer an overarching Soviet Union that could deal with such excrescences, it has become even more critical that the rest of Europe should help to ensure that the neighbouring peoples coexist in peace and mutual respect in what are now independent states.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, for the Armenian people – the victims of genocide and massive expulsion from their homelands – to witness the destruction of their cultural heritage is perhaps the last chapter in their total deracination. ‘Nothing is happening’, say the Azerbaijani authorities. I know that where there is smoke there is fire. This total denial reminds me of the total denial that the genocide ever existed, the claim that it is a figment of the Armenian imagination.</p>
      <p sl="de">In an exchange of e-mails with me, the political affairs advisor of the Azerbaijani embassy wrote, and I quote ‘we cannot exclude that some poor peasants of relevant cultural level might secretly use the stones from the cemetery for building construction or other related works’.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The town of Julfa in Azerbaijan is the site of an important Armenian cemetery that is unique in architectural terms. This cemetery bears witness to the history of a region where, until the first quarter of the 20th century, more than 80% of the inhabitants were Armenian. This site was abandoned in the Soviet era and, in 1998, the local authorities started to destroy it. At that time, UNESCO was very disturbed by this, which resulted in a temporary halt to the work of the bulldozers. UNESCO also contacted the competent authorities to protect this heritage, because the damage caused to this memorial site was very serious.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Corroborating elements and recent eyewitnesses tend to confirm the suspicion that this destruction restarted in December 2005. We should therefore call on Azerbaijan, as soon as possible, to allow a mission to go to the site in order to assess the measures needed, now and in the medium term, to preserve this site, so full of history and, what is more, memories and culture, which constitutes the heritage of a people.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today’s debate on human rights and democracy concerns the protection of the cultural heritage of the Armenian people, which is threatened with total destruction. Armenia, which has a population of 4 million, has been Christian since 301 AD, making it the first Christian country in the world. This fact is supported not only by historical documents but also by the thousands of crosses carved onto stone tablets, called khatchkars, which have been destroyed, just as other Armenian cultural treasures have been destroyed in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The khatchkars, which are literally stone crosses between 0.5 and 3.5 metres high, were made of basalt. They were placed on a cuboidal base and the front of the stone, which bore the image of the cross, was positioned to point west. The Armenians saw the khatchkars as a protective power that would shield them from natural disasters. These structures were erected to commemorate important events they featured as compositional elements in sacred buildings and were also used as tombstones, always placed at the feet of the deceased.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A cemetery in Djulfa was destroyed recently. The cemetery dated back to the Middle Ages and was located in the region controlled by Azerbaijan. The scandalous process of devastation and destruction of Armenian cultural monuments began in 1998, when 800 of the stone crosses I described were destroyed. Although this process of destruction was temporarily halted following protests by UNESCO, it resumed in 2002. It is probable that the reprehensible destruction of Armenian cultural heritage is being carried out with the consent of the government of Azerbaijan, which sent special army units to destroy the stones bearing Armenian crosses.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Armenians have been persecuted for centuries. They have suffered as a result of war, aggression and occupation. They are a nation with a wealth of experience, both as a nation and as a Christian people. The Azeris have experienced destruction and suffering too, but it must be emphasised that no conflict can justify the destruction of cultural heritage, which is a common legacy for the whole of humanity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Culture is an expression of communication between people, of shared thoughts and actions. It is a confirmation of humanity and a fundamental common legacy for communities. We therefore call for respect for our global common legacy, irrespective of religion and origin.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I remember my own impressions of Azerbaijan, of Baku, and of that enormous building in the centre of town, namely the hotel where the Azeris who had escaped from Nagorno Karabakh were camping out. It was a frightening sight. Those people had been squatting there for many years. Obviously, I have them in my thoughts today too, not just the monuments that we are quite rightly discussing.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree with Mr Libicki that as a matter of course, monuments should be protected in all parts of the world, and that their geographical location should be irrelevant. I also think that this issue is a sort of evasive tactic used by the government of Azerbaijan, however. It is an attempt to avoid addressing the lack of democracy, the recent and not very democratic elections, and also the ban on democratic freedom and free speech in that country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is worth fighting to preserve monuments. It is something that we should, quite rightly, do. At the same time though, we should also promote democracy in Azerbaijan.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we wish today to condemn Azerbaijan’s continuing indifference towards the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. Furthermore, the destruction caused to the cemetery at Djulfa casts a shadow on the country’s commitments as a member of the Council of Europe. Twelve years after the main conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, the position of the Armenian minority in Azerbaijan is still very unstable, especially as far as respect for its cultural heritage is concerned. The destruction of the cemetery at Djulfa can be compared, for example, to the Taleban’s destruction of the pillars depicting the Buddha in Afghanistan. It is a matter of respect for the past and for the history of the human race.</p>
      <p sl="fi">What can condemnation of the events lead to? We still hope that an impartial agency can inspect the destruction at the cemetery in Djulfa and that the gravestones that remain can be repaired. We also hope that protest will help prevent the future destruction of cultural heritage. The devastation caused to the cemetery at Djulfa is a crime against people’s heritage and, as such, is to be condemned. The destruction of these unique Christian artefacts constitutes an irreplaceable loss for mankind.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the honourable Members for all their speeches. The Commission has been informed about the alleged destruction of artefacts in the Julfa Cemetery, in the Azerbaijani Autonomous Republic of Nakhichevan. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan delivered a statement at the 586th Meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council of 22 December 2005 and the issue was also discussed in the Council of Europe on 1 February 2006.</p>
      <p sl="en">The protection of World Cultural Heritage sites in third countries is not within the Commission’s competences. We understand, however, that Armenia appealed to UNESCO, asking for a mission to be sent to Nakhichevan as rapidly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is well aware of the fact that episodes like the destruction in the Julfa Cemetery, if confirmed by independent sources, have a direct link with and are symptomatic of the long-standing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which has caused mistrust and destruction and claimed victims on both the Armenian and the Azerbaijani sides since the early 1990s.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will continue to use all the means at its disposal to persuade the parties to find a quick settlement to the conflict and, once a peace deal is hopefully reached, assist in the reconstruction and the rehabilitation of the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh particularly unacceptable today in that both Armenia and Azerbaijan are part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which aims, as a priority, to build confidence in the South Caucasus region, encouraging regional cooperation in as many sectors as possible and contributing to peace, stability and prosperity at the borders of an enlarged European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is an ambitious objective that we will try to achieve, including through the implementation of the action plans that the Commission is currently discussing with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. In these documents we ask the three South Caucasus countries to undertake a number of steps in order to come closer to Europe. The documents cover a very wide range of subjects, including cooperation on education and culture and the protection of cultural heritage.</p>
      <p sl="en">Implementation of the ENP action plans will be monitored closely by the Commission and the benefits which flow from these will of course be conditional on their achievements.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am sure everyone appreciates that we are at a very crucial time, with the peace talks due to start next week.</p>
      <p sl="en">I may be the only person here who has seen at first hand the damage that has been done by the war in the north and east of Sri Lanka: the devastation to property and lives; the real suffering – of the Tamil people in particular – and the dreadful attacks on Colombo, Kandi and other places in Sri Lanka. The deaths of many leading figures and ordinary people have gone without investigation. The tragedy and misery have been compounded by last year’s tsunami.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now there is a real chance to restart. I hope that all those involved in the peace talks will appreciate how important these are, recognise their responsibilities and be prepared to compromise and not look for recriminations. Nobody in Sri Lanka would benefit from a return to conflict.</p>
      <p sl="en">Personally I regret the absence of representatives of the Muslims, Buddhists and Colonel Karuna’s forces there, which I believe will make things more difficult. The ban on the LTTE people travelling to the European Union makes it rather anomalous that we have to have these talks in either Geneva or Norway. Nevertheless, we in the European Parliament should do everything we can, with the Commission and the Council, to assist, not hinder, the negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, most of the people who live in Sri Lanka are Sinhalese and consider themselves to be the only true inhabitants of their island, while, in its North-East, another people – the Tamils – are in the majority. Having as they do a different language, religion and culture from the rest of the country, they are seen by many as unwelcome intruders from the South of India. The parties from the Left and Right that take it in turns to be in government try to win the favour of the electorate by outdoing each other in their disregard for the wishes of the Tamils.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is for that reason that the country has been in the grip of war for many years, with parts of it not under government control; plans for self-government from the North-East ended up not being implemented, and foreign mediation does not lead anywhere. Norway, in particular, has invested much energy in this, and its former mediator is now Norway’s Foreign Minister. It looks like the outside world is resigning itself to this problem never being resolved, to the endless continuation of the violence, which will leave much devastation and casualties in its wake, so that some of the country’s inhabitants will leave and seek refuge elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="nl">From the point of view of human rights and democracy, acquiescence is unacceptable. That is why it would be good if this House were to send a message indicating Europe’s indignation at the lack of willingness to find a solution and highlighting our ongoing efforts to achieve results.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today is a Thursday and as usual, we are dealing with the issue of breaches of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">When we discussed Azerbaijan, we spoke about human rights in a very specific context – a cultural context. Culture is an important element of human rights. The situation is far more dramatic in the case of Sri Lanka. We really cannot wait for peace to be established there. On the one hand, we could remind ourselves of the old saying according to which nations pay for the madness of their leaders, and simply state that the blame lies with those who are behind the conflict rather than with the people of Sri Lanka, who are longing for peace. On the other hand, however, we are faced with a situation that is not uncommon across the world. There are the indigenous inhabitants and the later arrivals. The conflict between the indigenous Singhalese and the later arrivals, the Tamils, has significantly deeper historical roots. We may think today that we can forget about history and speak only of the future, but this is simply not possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have to understand the feelings of humiliation experienced by the indigenous inhabitants who believe that they have more rights than those who arrived later and uninvited. These newcomers did not arrive as a result of any decisions made by the Singhalese. They appeared because of decisions taken elsewhere. That is what happened in Sri Lanka. Let us, therefore, try to ensure that peace is established as soon as possible and that the people of Sri Lanka cease to pay for the madness of those in power. However, we must take into consideration the fact that a historical right to power is the same right as the right to property of someone who has been deprived of that property.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it probably would have been better if we had been able to postpone this debate, but it was already on the agenda. We all know the reason we wanted to postpone it was because of the scheduled meeting between the Sri Lankan Government and LTTE in Geneva on 22-23 February.</p>
      <p sl="en">I, along with everybody else, sincerely hope the talks will be successful. It will be a small step in the right direction if they are. That should improve the implementation of the ceasefire, which, as we all know, is not observed fully by either the Tamil Tigers or the government. We still see a lot of recruitment of child soldiers, which is an absolute scandal.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we want to achieve a permanent political solution, it is important that we do not just look at the security issues. However, any talks that take place on a political solution must involve the Muslims and other Tamil organisations, as well as the government and the Tamil Tigers. Only by doing that can we have a clear way forward to a permanent solution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we very much welcome the negotiations to be held next week in Geneva between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE. Three years have passed since the last talks and, for the sake of all the people of Sri Lanka, it is vitally important that violence should cease and that there should be real progress in the peace process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We do not believe that it would be helpful for this Parliament to express its views formally at this sensitive moment, so we have agreed with other political groups that there should be no resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sri Lanka has suffered from an upsurge of violence since December 2005, which has claimed over 200 lives. Not surprisingly, there has been a breakdown in trust between the Government and the LTTE, which is impeding political progress and economic recovery. We note with concern that even the unarmed observers comprising the Sri Lankan monitoring mission have come under attack on many occasions during this period. Although the Sri Lankan Government has shown restraint in its response so far, both sides must refrain from acts of violence and dedicate themselves to the impending negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">For peace and stability to return to Sri Lanka, the Government and the LTTE must be prepared to make compromises. A useful confidence-building measure would be for both sides to cease the use of anti-personnel landmines and to assist in their removal. To this end, the Sri Lankan Government should set an example by signing the Ottawa Convention, and the LTTE should sign the Geneva Call Deed of Commitment. Such a gesture of good will would verify their commitment to peace and could lay the foundations for further mutually beneficial initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union and individual Member States can take action to facilitate the peace process. European countries should monitor the financial support provided by their Tamil communities to ensure that it is not being used by persons or for activities that undermine the already fragile ceasefire agreement.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, let us hope that nothing goes wrong and that next week, as has been said, these peace talks between the Sri Lankan Government and the Tamil Tiger movement take place, but the process has not been easy so far and it will not be easy in the future.</p>
      <p sl="es">The 2002 ceasefire has been broken many times, hundreds of people have been killed over the last two years and there are thousands of internally displaced people. Kidnaps, torture and other kinds of abuse are still taking place, and the expectations created following the tsunami of December 2004 that that tragedy might help in tackling the internal conflict constructively have been dashed repeatedly. Furthermore, none of the mechanisms for investigating human rights appears to have been implemented satisfactorily.</p>
      <p sl="es">For all of these reasons, we should be glad about the Norwegian authorities’ determination to promote a peace process in such difficult circumstances. This peace process can teach us a new lesson in how important it is to invest in building peace, rather than stirring up war.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we analyse Europe’s investments in recent times, not just in Sri Lanka but in the region in general, we shall see that we have invested a lot in stirring up war and much less — very little in fact — in building and promoting peace.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore hope that these talks next week – and I certainly hope that they will lead not just to a peace process, but to a process of creating a fair and lasting peace – will offer a genuine opportunity that can be copied in other models and that can be assimilated into other peace processes, above all putting into practice what Mrs Lynne has said: all of the actors involved in the conflict must be included; nobody can be excluded, not even those who are considered to be the greatest enemies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as every Member of this House is fully aware, the political, economic and social situation in Sri Lanka is becoming increasingly unstable. The local community, mainly made up of women and children, is the victim of uncontrolled and brutal violence. Murders, and the involvement of military forces in these killings are becoming part of the reality of everyday life in Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The cease fire agreement reached in 2002 is currently under serious threat, and a new conflict may well erupt. Sri Lanka needs significant international support to guarantee a stable cease fire, which is essential in order for any progress to be made in the region.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Parliament should support Sri Lanka in all its efforts to achieve stability, peace and democracy. Combating any kind of racial or ethnic discrimination should be made a priority. Discrimination affects the local community on a daily basis and is an obstacle to obtaining just compensation, especially for the victims of the tsunami.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is not enough to send money and feel satisfied that we have done a good deed. We also need to make sure that the funds are fairly distributed. It is only then that the financial aid provided by the European Union will produce tangible results.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, after years of civil war, and with tens of thousands having been killed, negotiations are again on the agenda in Sri Lanka, and the only thing we can say with any certainty is that there can be no military solution to this conflict; there can only be a political one. I am very glad to see that the Norwegian Government has taken the initiative in setting these negotiations in motion; it is very interesting that it should be Norway that does this and not the European Union. The fact is that there is a quite fundamental problem, in that these conversations cannot take place in a European Union context because of the EU’s so-called list of terrorist bodies, which includes the LTTE, so those in charge of the negotiations cannot even enter the EU. That goes to show just how absurd this list of terrorist bodies is, which I believe is very often used as a means of taking action against political undesirables.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, once again I should like to thank the honourable Members for their contributions.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, let me state that the Commission is continuing to follow the situation in Sri Lanka very closely and we welcome the interest shown by European Parliament political groups in the resolutions calling for a peaceful solution to the conflict for the people of Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to hold talks in Geneva on 22 and 23 February, with a view to reinforcing and improving the implementation of the ceasefire agreement concluded in February 2002. We congratulate the Norwegian Minister, Erik Solheim, for his tireless efforts and reiterate our full support for him and for Norway’s role as facilitator in the peace process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the situation in Sri Lanka, although violence appears to have declined since the announcement of the Geneva talks on 25 January, we are extremely concerned by the escalation of violence in the past few months. Over 200 people were killed between the election of the new president in November 2005 and the end of January 2006. The European Union has expressed its grave concern about the continuing violence in Sri Lanka and urged all those engaged in violence and those with influence on them to put an end to it and stop the descent into conflict.</p>
      <p sl="en">The year 2005 and the early part of 2006 were bad periods for the peace process, with the failure of the P-TOMS, the assassination of Foreign Minister Kadirgamar and the electoral boycott imposed in parts of the north and east. We therefore welcome the Geneva talks as an important step, which we hope will help stabilise the situation in Sri Lanka and lead to the long hoped for peaceful resolution of the bitter conflict.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the comments made about the tsunami funds, we have started delivering tsunami reconstruction, despite the failure of the P-TOMS. The Commission allocated tsunami victims in Sri Lanka EUR 5.5 million of assistance to revitalise livelihoods in the north and east and provide affected communities there with basic economic opportunities. That comes on top of a large EC assistance programme already running in the north and the east.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we expected from P-TOMS was to move to a full reconstruction process where the government, the LTTE and the Muslim community would agree on priorities and projects. We had put all our weight behind P-TOMS and had earmarked EUR 50 million to go through the mechanism. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner made that public in March 2005 in Colombo, where we pressed very hard for a quick agreement. We still consider that that was the right thing to do. If P-TOMS had come to life, we would have reversed the negative trend in the peace process.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to that, we should not forget that the Commission, through its Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid, has provided more than EUR 23 million to victims of the conflict in the north and east since the peace process began, and over EUR 40 million of aid to tsunami victims. A large part of that aid has been directed at linking humanitarian aid to the reconstruction effort.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the detainees in Guantanamo Bay have been held in a legal vacuum, without charge, for four years now. We are alarmed by the continuing allegations of mistreatment: for example, hunger strikers whose self-imposed starvation is the only way they can protest against their total lack of the right to justice are apparently being strapped to chairs for hours so that they can be force-fed until they vomit blood.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would remind you that the UN special rapporteur on torture, Manfred Nowak, has stated that, if this was true, it would be classed as inhuman, cruel and degrading treatment. We call for the UN and the NGOs to be given access to the Guantanamo detention centre and to the detainees. Guantanamo must also be closed without delay, and the detainees should be brought before an independent tribunal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the history of the US military base at Guantanamo is a history of injustice, for the Americans are there at all simply because they concluded what they call a treaty with a former Cuban government, a treaty which, as they see it, is invalidated only if it is cancelled by both parties, something that is quite utterly perverse.</p>
      <p sl="de">Is it not time that we spelled it out that this military base must be closed down, and Guantanamo Bay handed back to Cuba? The reports that reach us from the American prisoner of war camp there are horrific. Over 500 prisoners are still being held there without trial and without due process, and they are on the receiving end of gross mistreatment and torture. Guantanamo is a lawless place. The torture that goes on there must be brought to an end, with those responsible for it and those who carry it out ending up in the dock of a court of law. Let us be quite clear about the fact that the closure of Guantanamo is being called for by a wide range of people, one of them being the German Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel. At the same time, though, her Minister of the Interior can say that ‘If I am rightly informed, one person has been interviewed in Guantanamo by the German authorities.’ It is evident that Germany or other EU Member States are benefiting from what goes on there. Now really is the time for the European Union to abandon its double standards.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, one could not put it in plainer language than did Manfred Nowak, the UN’s Special Rapporteur on Torture, who said, ‘Guantanamo does not meet even the minimum standards of international law.’ That is a devastating judgment, and we, in the European Union, must make it appropriately clear to our American partners that we can no longer regard these unjust acts in Guantanamo as acceptable, and that we never have done so.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very grateful to Mrs Merkel for addressing that issue very forthrightly when she met President Bush. The simple fact is that the war on terror, which is vital and which we support, can be waged only on the basis of law. If certain parties were to get the message across to the world that, ultimately, the strongest get their way, the effect would be catastrophic, for everyone would aspire only to be the strongest, and the law of the jungle would again hold sway.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is for that reason that war, even against the greatest of evils, can be waged only on the basis of law, on the basis of human rights and of international law, with all the determination and single-mindedness that it demands, and these are dependent on strict adherence to the common values and shared convictions of the Western alliance and of the European Union, of which there is certainly no evidence in Guantanamo. All I can do, then, is to urge President Bush to close Guantanamo down as quickly as possible and hand the prisoners over to a proper legal authority.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, ‘when exactly will this nightmare end?’ Those are the words of Moazzam Begg, a British citizen released without charge from Guantánamo in January of last year. But they could equally be the words of all right-thinking citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Guantánamo Bay has become a byword for all that is wrong with the US response to terrorism today. Four years after the first prisoners arrived, not one has received a proper trial and 500 remain in confinement, the vast majority without charge or due legal process. Just today, the United Nations has published a report which suggests that the treatment of detainees meets the definition of torture under the UN Convention against Torture. The authors conclude that the US Government should either expeditiously bring the detainees to trial, or release them without delay.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would go further. We agree with the Amnesty International Director in the UK that there is no middle ground regarding Guantánamo: it must be closed.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, in these urgent sittings during which we normally deal with breaches of human rights in the world, it is a long time since we have discussed the responsibility of the United States.</p>
      <p sl="es">Although the list of issues to be discussed would be extremely long, I am at least pleased to have the opportunity to analyse one of the most shameful blights on humanity and, in particular, on our times: Guantánamo.</p>
      <p sl="es">After four years, the approximately five hundred people currently detained in Guantánamo do not enjoy the minimum legal guarantees required in a democracy that respects the rule of law and the international rules on human rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union cannot continue to be an accomplice, through its silence, in the maintenance of what in reality is quite simply a torture centre, and one in which the death penalty is applied in an arbitrary manner.</p>
      <p sl="es">The existence of Guantánamo represents an enormous stain on the history not just of the United States but of all those on the outside who keep quiet and tolerate the base. And it increases even further the image of an imperialist and war-mongering nation that has absolutely no respect for the very rights and freedoms that the current US Administration claims to defend throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is absolutely no justification for Guantánamo’s existence, therefore, and less still on the grounds of the fight against terrorism. I am therefore delighted that this Parliament has finally had the courage to call for the closure of Guantánamo in such a unanimous fashion.</p>
      <p sl="es">It now only remains for me to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that we must take a further step, that our work must be complete and that we must call soon for a thorough investigation of what is happening in relation to the occupation of Iraq. In particular, we must condemn the events in Abu Ghraib.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it appears to me that, on this issue, the House is very largely of one mind. If the European Union is to demand of states that they adhere to human rights, then it must do so globally and credibly. Neither human rights nor international humanitarian law are negotiable, and that is something we have to spell out to our American allies, with whom, after all, we share democratic values. I really do find it disturbing that this has to become a cause of dispute with the United States, for it is our ally, but that is the difference between them and the other parts of the world in which we call for respect for human rights. It is fortunate, and encouraging, that the USA is a democratic and open society, and that the same debate is going on there. I think that the majority of Americans would agree with us that one cannot, in these matters, simply suspend the rule of law. It is vitally important that we hold on to the moral high ground if we are to be credible in combating terrorism in other parts of the world and take up the cause of democracy. It is not acceptable that we should turn and look in the other direction, especially in our dealings with this great ally of ours, alongside which, in other parts of the world – in Afghanistan, for example – we are promoting democracy and human rights. It is worth considering the political and moral predicament in which we would find ourselves if we were to keep silent about Guantanamo, when we would no longer be able to maintain any credibility in our dealings with those states where we are trying to promote human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it is right to call for this camp to be closed down and for those who are held there to be brought before a regular court. We may well not have put it in such explicit terms, but the conclusion must be drawn that, in the absence of proof against them, these people must be set at liberty, dangerous though that may be in individual cases. Here, too, the rule applies that the accused is given the benefit of the doubt.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in its report published yesterday, the United Nations very emphatically calls on the USA to close Guantanamo down without further delay, and our resolution today is, of course, intended to do the same thing. To date, charges have been brought against only 10 of the 500 persons interned at Guantanamo, and even then, before specially-established military tribunals rather than independent courts. Arbitrary detention, torture and mistreatment are gross breaches of the Geneva Conventions. It surely must, at long last, dawn on the Bush administration just how cynical and wrong this behaviour in the fight against terrorism actually is. The effective combating of terrorism demands that one works to persuade the world at large and stresses the importance of international law, by which the arbitrary killing of civilians is prohibited. It is that law that the Bush administration is disregarding, not only in Guantanamo, but also elsewhere.</p>

Now we hear in the report about people being violently force-fed to end their hunger strikes, not out of a desire to keep them alive, but in order to stop embarrassing the American Government.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, this is a brief resolution that can be summarised in two words: close Guantánamo. Any form of human rights in Guantánamo is conspicuous by its absence, and the whole set-up is, from beginning to end, redolent not of human rights, but of human errors.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the course of a single Presidency, the United States has gone from being a country that most people want to visit, trade with and otherwise engage with to being a country that many avoid. Guantánamo may be situated on a military base in Cuba, but it is a cowardly attempt by the United States to avoid its own laws. We desire nothing more than that the United States observe its own Constitution and that the UN conventions be complied with. In both respects, Guantánamo is an absurdity. The Bush regime is acting like a bunch of old-fashioned, high-handed colonial masters when it comes to the Kyoto Protocol, the International Criminal Court, Abu Graib, the war against the Iraqi people and a list of conventions concerning everything from the fight against tobacco to the right to food.</p>
      <p sl="sv">These departures from international cooperation and international law damage the American people and the world in general. The Guantánamo prisoners are not alone in suffering oppression by the Bush regime, even if they are the ones who are suffering the most. We also have sympathy for the majority of Americans who have never supported the Bush regime and who are victims of its arbitrary procedures. These ordinary people are badly affected by the hatred and threats emanating from the world around them. The Bush regime could make a start on doing penance by closing Guantánamo.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel it is entirely right that a resolution on Guantánamo is being discussed in this Chamber. It should be acknowledged that a similar resolution is required to commemorate 27th January. You are surely aware that this is the International Day for Prevention of Crimes Against Humanity. Naturally, we shall agree that a country which tortures prisoners in Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo on the say-so of its President has no right to ask for cooperation from the EU on military actions launched unilaterally. The time has come to announce sanctions against the United States for its failure to respect human rights. This is a position that we broadly accepted this week when we adopted the report on the human rights and democracy clause in European agreements. Perhaps you do not remember this, or perhaps the argument of the military power in question is too strong. This is of course a matter of double standards.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I believe that once the Resolution, which has my full backing, has been adopted, it should be followed up by a proposal to indict those who, in Guantanámo and Abú Ghrajb, have taken part in acts that contravene the laws of the United States, and are in breach of human rights and international agreements. I should therefore like to suggest that the Commission set up an international criminal court to try these criminals. I also feel it important to recommend that the country holding the Presidency should call on the UN Security Council to table a resolution demanding sanctions against the United States. And incidentally, we are all certainly aware that the US base at Guantánamo Bay has for a number of years been occupied against the wishes of the legitimate government of the Republic of Cuba.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Europe must make its voice heard as regards Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and wherever the Bush Administration is exporting torture via extraordinary rendition.

Such actions will not be tolerated and we have a right to state this fact.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have this right because Europe is the cradle of humanitarian rights, because the first conventions on the protection of the rights of prisoners, the civilian population, and war victims were drawn up here in Europe at the start of the 20th century. After the Second World War, we developed these humanitarian principles. In Europe, we have a European, Strasbourg system for protecting human rights and finally we, in the European Union, have a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will be, and indeed already is, part of the European Constitution.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, again I would like to thank the honourable Members for their very clear remarks. The global fight against terrorism on an unprecedented scale has created new challenges for the protection of human rights. The Commission constantly underlines that the fight against terrorism must be conditional on maintaining respect for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the situation of some 500 individuals who are being detained in Guantanámo Bay, although the Commission does not have competence to intervene on behalf of these detainees, we are following all developments closely. The Member States have also voiced concern bilaterally to the US regarding the treatment of their nationals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission continues to emphasise that all anti-terrorist measures must be consistent with international humanitarian law and international human rights law. It is our firm belief that the Geneva Conventions apply to all persons captured on the field of battle. So far as continued detention in Guantanámo Bay is concerned, according to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, there are absolute rights which are to be respected in all circumstances, such as the right not to be tortured or to be subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this connection, we welcome the recent amendment to the Defence Appropriations Bill introduced by Senator McCain, which puts beyond doubt the fact that the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment applies to persons held in US custody worldwide. Moreover, in our view, every person who has been detained must have some status under international law and is entitled not to be detained arbitrarily and to receive due process and a fair trial.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has also made clear its support for the request by United Nations Special Rapporteurs to visit Guantanámo Bay and to be able to interview detainees in private. The European Union has raised this issue repeatedly with the United States and will continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to some of the interventions, the Commission has repeatedly made clear to the United States that the European Union is firmly opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. I would also like to say that the report by the UN Special Rapporteurs which was published yesterday is being studied by the Commission with a view to taking this issue up again with the United States.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is vital that the international community seeks to reassert full adherence to international law, including human rights and humanitarian standards, in relation to the alleged Taliban and al-Qa’ida members in Guantanámo and elsewhere.
