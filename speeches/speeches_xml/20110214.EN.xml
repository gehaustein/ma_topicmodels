      <p sl="unknown">I would like to make several remarks in connection with the opening of this part-session. Our eyes are turned, today, towards the European Union’s southern neighbours. The groundbreaking events of recent days in Egypt have put new heart into societies across the region. We admire their courage, determination and aspirations for democracy. This stance has already brought significant changes, which we fully support. We regret, however, that this has not taken place without loss of life. We call on all the governments in the region to open up to dialogue with their citizens. We want an end to every form of harassment of peacefully demonstrating people and the abolition of years-old states of emergency. We call for the restoration of full freedom of speech. The voice of the people must be heeded. This is also an important objective for the entire European Union and for all of us. Let us remember that in 1989, many European politicians were afraid of the changes in Central and Eastern Europe, so let us not be afraid to be fully involved politically and economically. Let us help our neighbours achieve their democratic aspirations, so that they will want to live in their own countries and be able at last to do so with dignity, and not be forced to emigrate. Let us work towards this objective together as a true community.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">In relation to the events in the countries of our southern neighbours, I would also like to draw attention to the fact that some of the European Union’s Member States have become the objective of a significant number of migrants from that region. The Union should act quickly and in concert to support those Member States which are experiencing an increased influx of refugees. In the European Union, we also share this obligation and this responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The next piece of information is that on 12 February, we observed the International Day against the Use of Child Soldiers. It is estimated that there are currently 200 000 to 300 000 children directly involved in armed conflicts in over 20 countries around the world. The European Parliament is actively involved in the fight against the shameful practice of using children in armed conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Finally, shocking figures are reaching us from Iran. Since the beginning of the year, three times more people have been executed there than in the same period last year. Particularly alarming are the death sentences being handed down to political dissidents. I call on the Iranian authorities to impose a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty and, in the future, to remove it from the list of punishments prescribed in Iran.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The final draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 20 January 2011, pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Monday</p>
      <p sl="unknown">No amendments have been proposed.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Tuesday</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have requested the inclusion on the agenda for Tuesday morning of a statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the rule of law in Russia. First of all, I would like to call upon Mrs Harms to speak so that she can give the grounds for this request. The floor is yours, Mrs Harms.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I take the view that, in the light of what has happened in the Khodorkovsky case, we absolutely should debate the state of the law in Russia. However, given the Duma elections still to come in the autumn, we have good reason to concern ourselves with the situation in this, our major neighbour in the east of this continent.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, we are all repeatedly confronted at the moment with the question of whether we are actually doing enough in our neighbouring countries to help bring about human and civil rights and freedom. Many of us have also certainly asked ourselves self-critically whether we actually always debated what was necessary when it came to Egypt and to Tunisia. I do not want us to allow ourselves such negligence in the east of our own continent and I therefore call for us to deal with the question of ‘The Rule of law in Russia’ without fail this week – or, more specifically, tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I want to support this request by Rebecca Harms. I also want to tell you that, since we formulated this request in the Conference of Presidents and now here at this plenary session, we have received more and more pressure from the Russian side not to do it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Kristiina Ojuland, who organised a seminar a few weeks ago on the rule of law in Russia, was visited by a representative from the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry saying: ‘do not push for this’ and ‘do not push for a resolution in the European Parliament on the rule of law in Russia’. I do not think it is up to the Russians to decide the agenda of the European Parliament: it is up to us ourselves to do that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as a standing rapporteur on relations with Russia, may I inform you that we have already launched a very thorough process in order to deal with all the serious matters which are important in our relations with Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have already had a hearing with the representative of the External Action Service and a representative of the Russian Government. On 2 March, we are going to organise another hearing with experts which will deal with all the important aspects of relations with Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the second week of March, we are planning to have a comprehensive text, including a recommendation, which will be open to discussion and amendments and which will wind up with a debate in plenary with the participation of the High Representative, who, to our knowledge, is not available this week.</p>
      <p sl="en">So therefore, without neglecting or denying the importance of this topic, it is much better to allow this process to continue and reach its end in such a way as to have a wide-ranging debate which will lend credibility to our decision.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, there is something that I do not understand. Last week, during the Conference of Presidents, you said that we would be holding a debate on Russia in March because Baroness Ashton would be present. Secondly, during the Conference of Presidents, you said that we needed to organise a debate on Russia because Mr Putin was going to visit the Commission, or rather Mr Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="fr">According to the information I have received this afternoon, Mr Putin is not coming to see the Commission. Do you have any information on this issue? The debate was requested last week only because Mr Putin was coming. However, a debate on Russia, together with a resolution, is still scheduled for March.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should now like to receive some information concerning what we discussed.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the rule of law in Russia will be included as the third item on the agenda for Tuesday morning. The deadline for tabling motions for resolutions falls on Tuesday, 15 February at 10:00. The deadline for tabling amendments and joint motions for resolutions falls on Wednesday, 16 February at 10:00. However, the deadline for tabling amendments to joint motions for resolutions falls on Wednesday, 16 February at 11:00. So, after 11:00 on Wednesday, 16 February, no more additional motions or amendments will be accepted. The vote will take place on Thursday.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, there is one more request concerning Tuesday. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has requested the inclusion on the agenda of a Commission statement on the situation in Lampedusa. The reasons for this request will be given by Mr Mauro. Mr Mauro, you have the floor.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-023-000" speaker_id="4393" name="Mario Mauro" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, as you have rightly remarked, we are in the presence of epoch-making events that are shaping an extraordinary increase in the flow of migration into Europe. Although today it may be Lampedusa that is overrun by this extraordinary flow of migrants, it is nevertheless the whole of Europe that will be involved in the process of destabilisation and change being faced by the whole of the Maghreb.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore consider it to be a matter of the greatest urgency for the Commission to take the floor to respond not only to the humanitarian implications but also to those of a more profoundly strategic nature which we must resolve in order to review our policy as regards the Mediterranean. Accordingly, given the urgency of the matter, we are asking for a separate debate to be held on Tuesday afternoon with Commissioner Malmström, by reducing question time to the Commission by half an hour.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament also wish to table a motion of this nature. However, I would like to recommend to Mr Mauro and the House that we formulate it somewhat more precisely. After all, we have to deal with an enormous influx of people. I am sure that Italy, like every other country on the Mediterranean, is overstretched in trying to deal with the current problem alone, and she is not the only country facing this massive flow of refugees. We can assume that Malta, Greece and Spain, too, will be confronted by this problem in the foreseeable future. We would therefore ask that the title of the debate be very precisely worded so that, specifically, we obtain a statement from the Commission on immediate measures on the part of the European Union to support Italy and other affected EU countries in dealing with the influx of refugees.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to speak in favour of Mr Schultz’s proposal because this issue is much broader than Lampedusa alone: there are 5 000 kilometres between Morocco and Syria, and with each kilometre, the humanitarian risk grows larger. It is not a question of knowing if the European Union will help the Italian Government but to know if we are ready to act as a continent to face a continental risk. This is the task that we face.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this oral question is not about the guilt or innocence of Mr Assange in the rape accusations against him in Sweden. It is about the procedures of the European Arrest Warrant and whether it is being misused for political purposes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Arrest Warrant allows any European citizen to be judicially surrendered without a court being allowed to consider the prima facie evidence against them and with almost no power to refuse surrender. The European Arrest Warrant has tremendous potential for abuse and for use against political dissidents.</p>
      <p sl="en">Is the Assange case about the crimes allegedly committed in Sweden or is it about the desire of the United States of America to extradite him from a compliant European country? Discussing the procedures is key to understanding this case and deciding if the European Arrest Warrant is being misused and abused. We need to have a full debate in this House from all sides of the political spectrum. Please vote in favour.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to ask for a clarification of the Rules of Procedure. I do not know whether the European Parliament is able to hold a fundamental debate about the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). One may be for or against the EAW and its implementation, but whether we here in Parliament are able to discuss it in relation to criminal proceedings that are currently under way is something that I venture is doubtful under the Rules of Procedure. If that were the case, I would also have another couple of cases to bring up that we could happily discuss. However, I would urgently advise, at this point, that we do not make legal proceedings currently under way the subject of a fundamental discussion here in the European Parliament.</p>

  <section id="creitem13" title="13. Implementation of the Services Directive (debate)">
    <intervention id="1-035-000" speaker_id="28269" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on implementation of the Services Directive [(2006/123/EC) (2010/2053(INI)] (A7-0012/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-036-000" speaker_id="1913" name="Evelyne Gebhardt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here in the European Parliament, we have been debating the Services Directive for a long time, and we have expressed many concerns in our debates about how it should be implemented and how we can ensure that service providers have free movement within the European Union. This was an important piece of policy. That is why we, as Parliament, decided that we not only wanted to make the legislation, but that we also wanted to monitor how the Services Directive is actually transposed in the Member States. It is in our interest that the directive be transposed properly, correctly and well. The European Commission also agreed to help us in this regard. I would therefore like to thank Commissioner Barnier, who has provided us with valuable information in this connection.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have particular concerns about four specific areas, namely, the evaluation procedure, the points of single contact, administrative cooperation and the scope of the directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the first point, I have the following to say. Mutual evaluation is one of the core items where we, as Parliament, and I, as the then rapporteur, said actually, we are opposed to this, as this means an awful lot of bureaucracy in the Member States. I am also hearing from the Member States today that there are indeed complaints about the bureaucracy. In that regard, however, I would quite simply like to make it very clear to the Member States once again that they were the ones that wanted this, not Parliament! They inserted it into the legislation and, as such, they should take the responsibility for it themselves even if, for example, local communities are beginning to discuss what Europe has done to them again.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the question of the second point – the points of single contact – I would say that this is the answer to what we have done in the political sense. We said quite clearly that the principle of the Services Directive is not the country of origin principle but the country of destination principle. That means that service providers must respect the law of the State in which they operate. That makes it all the more important that they obtain from the points of single contact not only the information about the laws that they have to respect, but also the necessary assistance to enable them to really apply that law properly and consistently in the Member States. I therefore find it very regrettable that, while these points of single contact have been set up in many Member States – although not all of them as yet – this has only been done in a very unsatisfactory way. In some cases, they are merely Internet portals. That does not satisfy us, the European Parliament – there needs to be much more behind these points of single contact. There need to be people behind them who can provide real assistance for the service providers in this area. One issue here is the language that is provided. It is not enough to offer the local language and perhaps English. In my view – and Parliament has spoken in similar terms – it is important for service providers that the language of the neighbouring county is also spoken. I say this with one eye on our Polish President – in the border area between Germany and Poland, German should be offered in Poland and Polish in Germany so that the information and assistance are actually really good, so that even the small businesses, which are not all competent in English, can really get involved in cross-border activities.</p>
      <p sl="de">Administrative cooperation is another important point and it is an area where we are heading in the right direction. In this regard, the Member States still have an awful lot more to do in the area of cooperation and of the education and training of officials, so that this system can be really well used.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, we come to the scope, in which connection I would like to make it quite clear, once again, that we excluded all services of common economic interest from the scope of Article 16. I expect the Member States to respect that. If they want to include these services in the scope of the Services Directive, that is their right, but in that case, they must not sweep it all up as part of the Services Directive; rather, it is their own political statement of intent and something that they should also assume responsibility for themselves. That is what I demand of the Member States in this context.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-037-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, thank you for your welcoming remarks. I, too, am delighted to be back here with you, as I am every month. I should like to thank Parliament, and Mrs Gebhardt in particular, for their impatience and their vigilance. I can understand why Parliament is being demanding with regard to the proper implementation of this directive, which was adopted just over four years ago. Mrs Gebhardt spoke of lengthy discussions here in Parliament. Discussions took place before that; they took place outside Parliament, too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I can recall some of the heated debates on this subject; they were often interesting and, at times, slightly irrational. Moreover, I have not forgotten, Mrs Gebhardt, the vital role that Parliament, spurred on by you and Mr Harbour, played in improving the Commission’s initial proposal and breaking the deadlock that we found ourselves in at the time. It did so while preserving the overall structure of the directive, which is aimed – and this is obviously one of the main issues at stake in the internal market – at boosting growth and employment, because it is clear today, ladies and gentlemen, that nine out of 10 new jobs created in the European economy are created in the services economy. I can also tell you that I am very keen for new jobs to be created in the industrial sector. This obviously raises other issues with regard to the European policies that we ought to promote in order to maintain an industrial manufacturing base. However, services are a key source of growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With Mrs Gebhardt’s new report, Parliament has once again confirmed its commitment to this matter, and Mrs Gebhardt herself has shown that she is very single-minded, if I may say so. I personally am glad, on this occasion, that she is single-minded when it comes to monitoring the transposition and the proper implementation of this directive, which is a prerequisite for completing the internal market in services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I stand here before you, four years after the adoption of this directive, it has already produced tangible results. We have received, ladies and gentlemen, more than 1 000 notifications of changes in legislation within the Member States. At times, it has been global or framework texts that have themselves introduced sectoral changes within each country, or even each region. In fact, several thousand changes in national or regional legislation have already been made as a result of the impetus provided by this directive. We believe that there is still a great deal of potential, and we must therefore press ahead.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Gebhardt raised a very important issue, which concerns one of the tools of the Services Directive – the points of single contact. I fully support the ambitious approach that Parliament is taking to ensure that these contact points very quickly become genuine administrative portals enabling companies to complete all their procedures and formalities online – and this includes, Mrs Gebhardt, ladies and gentlemen, those that go beyond the scope of the Services Directive alone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With this in mind, we are working with the Member States on the cross-border interoperability of electronic signatures. I shall also be presenting you, probably by the end of this year, with a text on electronic signatures and on the cross-border interoperability of electronic identities and documents. I also agree with you on the importance of providing points of single contact that are genuinely multilingual – an essential part of their added value – so that people can use them in their own language and can receive a response in their own language, including across borders, and so that we can therefore make this tool – the points of single contact – accessible, in particular, to small and medium-sized enterprises. Moreover, one of the keys to facilitating this administrative cooperation and developing the points of single contact, as you wish, is for us to improve the quality of electronic translations at the same time. We shall perhaps discuss this later on with regard to the patent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I myself am engaged, within the College, and with my colleagues who are in charge of these various programmes – because they are split between several Directorates-General – in stepping up the research into, and development of, electronic programmes. This is to ensure that we have the highest quality, most sophisticated translations as soon as possible not only for the patent, but for other uses too, such as the points of single contact and the Internal Market Information System (IMI). It will make a big change for all of us here, who have to work in more than 23 languages, to be able to have a perfect translation thanks to these computerised and electronic programmes. I also share Parliament’s view concerning the need to train national officials so that they develop a true culture of administrative cooperation, where they do not already have one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Gebhardt, we will also continue to promote the use of the IMI, which I mentioned just now. Today – I reviewed this matter recently – nearly 5 000 European authorities are registered in the IMI, and my aim is very simple: I want to turn the IMI into a kind of administrative Facebook, if I can use that expression, with a translation facility. Ladies and gentlemen, my portfolio includes three very important tools for bringing Europe closer to the citizens and closer to small and medium-sized enterprises. They are: the points of single contact, the IMI and the Internal Market Problem Solving Network (SOLVIT). Therefore, you can count on me; I shall even be working specifically on these three tools so as to provide them with resources, in particular, translation resources, but others too, and to ascertain how they are being implemented in each country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, I am not content with just explaining matters to you here; I am also going to explain them in each of the capitals, and so, just as I promised, every week, I visit a European capital, and in each of those capitals, I hold a workshop with the national officials in charge of implementing our directives: on professional qualifications, services and public contracts. Each time, I ascertain how and by what means these tools – the points of single contact, the SOLVIT centre and the IMI – are being implemented and used. Thus, I was in Luxembourg last week and I shall be in Slovenia this week, to carry out this check with its officials, whom I need in order to ensure that the internal market functions properly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are therefore going to continue to work in this spirit with the Member States and to verify that, as well as simply being transposed, the Services Directive is actually being implemented properly. Moreover, depending on what is covered in the debate that we are going to have now, I remain at Parliament’s disposal to provide it with other more precise answers concerning the monitoring of the implementation of this Services Directive.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-038-000" speaker_id="96862" name="Sophie Auconie" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim here is not to review the implementation of the Services Directive worked on and subsequently adopted by this House in 2006. It is still far too early for that. Many States have still not transposed it fully or correctly. That is precisely the reason for this own-initiative report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, it stresses the importance in both economic and social terms of this opening up of the services sector in Europe. As you said, Commissioner, the activities covered account for 40% of EU GDP and jobs, and the potential for growth is estimated at 0.6-1.5% of GDP. As you said just now, Commissioner, nine out of 10 jobs translates into a real economic impact.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the report highlights the fundamental elements of the directive’s transposition. I, for my part, will emphasise two aspects which you yourself emphasised, Mrs Gebhardt.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, the points of single contact. We must remember that our aim is, of course, to facilitate the provision of services across Europe. In practice, this means that entrepreneurs who wish to set up a business abroad or provide cross-border services should be able to use a point of single contact. It will explain all the formalities and procedures they must complete in order to set up their business, and it will do so in their own language. These points of single contact are the key to the success of the Services Directive. They must be easily accessible, both physically and electronically – as has been said – and they must be effective and interoperable. It is important not to create a crippling administrative burden for our entrepreneurs, who are more often than not SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second aspect concerns the scope of the directive. The directive excludes a number of fields from its scope because of their specific nature. This is the case, in particular, with non-economic services of general interest, since economic services of general interest have, in principle, been covered. In my view, all of this lacks legal clarity, and we must closely monitor how the Member States apply these rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I believe that we must hold a genuine political debate at European level on what we mean by services of general interest and on the rules that we wish to apply to them.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, the Member States have had three years to implement the Services Directive in their national legislation. One year on since this deadline, we can assess its implementation and outline the perspectives for greater progress.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The report of the European Commission clearly reveals the variety of legal and administrative requirements in the Member States, the different approaches and varying degrees to which the directive has been implemented. Developing a single market for services is very important for creating new jobs. That is why I believe that the Commission and the Member States must be more proactive in eliminating all outstanding legal and administrative barriers.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Additional support must be given to small and medium-sized enterprises. Applying the principle of multilingualism at individual contact points and the more widespread use of the benefits of e-government would make life significantly easier for suppliers of services.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for our very good work together and her openness to compromise. I can safely say that the Services Directive is the key to a properly functioning common market. If it is not implemented properly, we can forget Jacques Delors’ vision, and many of the Single Market Act’s initiatives will be left as empty promises. Therefore, on behalf of my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I appeal most emphatically to the Member States to catch up with outstanding work on implementation. Now that we have come through the crisis, we need the Services Directive more than ever.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report which we have adopted in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection attaches great importance and, in my opinion, the greatest importance, to the points of single contact, which, from the users’ point of view, are still not working adequately. In some cases, many procedures are still not available in electronic form. We want the points of single contact to be comprehensive centres of electronic contact with the authorities. We should not forget, however, that the starting points for the various Member States were different. In some, the points of single contact have been set up based on existing structures, and others have been built from scratch. However, we want them to help service providers in the same way in every Member State. Therefore, it seems to me imperative that the Commission develop a set of best practices which would help Member States in further work on points of single contact.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like briefly to refer to the recently published report on mutual evaluation. The report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has already included the statement that Member States have not been sufficiently ambitious in terms of regulatory simplification, often deciding to replace one requirement with another. Unfortunately, a reading of the report on mutual evaluation confirms these fears. We are still facing situations in which Member States are trying to apply rules which, at times, do not appear to find justification in the provisions of the Services Directive. I hope that further work on the directive will move towards eliminating this phenomenon.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Services Directive was the subject of unprecedented public political debate when it was being discussed in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thanks to the efforts to reach a compromise, which were led by Mrs Gebhardt, whom I congratulate, the text that Parliament succeeded in adopting in 2006 was one that reconciled the need to stimulate the internal market in services as a source of potential growth and job creation, and respect for social rights, labour law and the specific nature of services of general interest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to maintain this very fragile balance, the directive had to be transposed with the utmost care. This caused problems for many Member States, such as difficulties in implementing the points of single contact and the mutual evaluation process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Right now, I am concerned about and question the choice made by France; it is very much a minority choice and will result in provisions being split up between a whole series of laws and decrees. I also regret the very restrictive interpretation of the concept of authorising the provision of services. It will create legal uncertainty for social services relating to the care of young children and the disabled, even though derogation and exclusion possibilities were provided for in the directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament is playing, and will continue to play, a full part in monitoring the successful implementation of this directive, which is key to ensuring that the single market creates jobs and is closer to the citizens, and that Europe is experienced on a daily basis as something positive, not something negative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore call on the Member States and the Commission to step up their efforts to guarantee a completely transparent process for European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, in 2006, I am sure there were few people who realised that we were adopting a tool that would be very important for lifting the EU out of the crisis that was just around the corner. With the potential to increase the EU’s GDP by up to 1.5% and create a great many new jobs, we have to say that, by adopting this tool, we have made a quantum leap towards free movement for services. Today, in 2011, everyone can see that we are experiencing rather an extensive crisis, and for that reason it is, of course, particularly regrettable that several Member States still have not implemented important parts of the directive. This report has therefore come at a very opportune time. It defies common sense to counteract the lever for growth that this represents, and it is the good pupils in the class – those that have seen the sense and benefit in implementing this swiftly, efficiently and properly – who suffer, and that includes my own country.</p>
      <p sl="da">So much for the reprimand. Now on to the glimmers of light and, of course, these are, by and large, what we should concern ourselves with, and indeed what we did concern ourselves with in this report. With this report we have, I think, succeeded in avoiding the political conflicts of the past, and clearly that is important because we have a great many other things on which to focus our energies. Allow me to name just three of them. Firstly, it is important to take advantage of our experience with regard to the screening process and the mutual evaluation process, both of which are beneficial because they can be used in connection with other directives in the future. We therefore need to have a higher degree of transparency in relation to the process, and I hope that the report can contribute to this.</p>
      <p sl="da">Secondly, it is, of course, important to promote administrative cooperation, particularly through the Internal Market Information System (IMI), as has been mentioned a couple of times. Thirdly, it is important – as most people have already mentioned – to develop the points of single contact into comprehensive e-government portals that can lighten the administrative burden for service providers seeking to provide cross-border services.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, I would like to express my thanks for the exceptional cooperation with Mrs Gebhardt and the other rapporteurs on this matter. I think we have succeeded in reaching some sensible compromises on a difficult text.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Gebhardt, in 2006, my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, voted against the Services Directive, and today, we consider the report assessing the implementation of this Services Directive, previously known as the Bolkestein Directive, to be equally unsatisfactory. The Verts/ALE Group will therefore vote against this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to make it clear, Mrs Gebhardt, that you did everything you could to achieve the best possible compromises. However, I believe that some red lines have unfortunately been crossed in this report, which means that we cannot vote in favour of it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to state that you took great care to point out that we should not confuse the various responsibilities, and I certainly do not wish to confuse the responsibilities of the Member States with those of the European Union, either.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If France, for example, transposed the Services Directive and chose to include day nurseries in it, when almost all of the other countries chose to do the opposite, it is clearly the responsibility of the French Government and not of the European Union. Therefore, the Verts/ALE Group is certainly not voting against this report in order to criticise the way in which the directive has been transposed in France. It is doing so on account of two key points.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is that we asked time and again, during the discussions, for the Member States to assess the impact that the initial transposition of the Services Directive had on the quality of jobs and services. Unfortunately, that assessment of the impact on job and service quality could not be integrated into the report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also called for an assessment of the cost impact for public authorities. Every time we try to take steps to regulate the financial markets, for example, we are told that it will cost a fortune. Here, we have a very high cost for public authorities at a time when budgets are tight, and no one wants to assess it in order to weigh up the pros and cons of the Services Directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My final point is in the form of a question to Commissioner Barnier. Unfortunately, we have been unable to obtain an assurance in this report that the European Commission will finally take note of Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon and present a proposal for a directive on public services. Can you tell us when the Commission will finally face up to its responsibilities on this point?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is an important debate tonight with the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, to demonstrate that the Services Directive – into which we put so much effort in the last Parliament under Evelyne Gebhardt’s leadership, with many colleagues, including myself, being involved – is absolutely indispensable to the creation of future growth and jobs in the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I say to Mr Canfin and others that there has been a huge amount of investment in time and resources, and indeed in systems like the points of single contact, in order to generate those jobs and growth, but they now have to come. The issue with this report is the fact that we have done a huge amount of work already, but we now need to see the pay-off from that work.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the issues that I know the Commissioner is very much aware of, and which is reflected in some of the ideas in the Single Market Act which we will be bringing back to Parliament in two months’ time, is the fact that Member States need to start using and deploying these new instruments and encouraging businesses to use them. Colleagues will remember that this is targeted very much at small- and medium-sized enterprises. They are the ones, as all the work in the previous Commission showed, which were discouraged by the administrative barriers they encountered at all stages from going to set up and deliver services within the European Union, which, of course, is a right they have under the Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now need to really make that work. Part of that is to overcome all the ingrained suspicion and problems that they have had, and to make it clear that what we have achieved here is probably the biggest single set of deregulatory measures in opening up markets that has ever happened as a result of one single directive – we have heard about the thousands of measures that have been changed – and similarly the first major investment by Member States in promoting the single market to businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is what the points of single contact are all about. They are actually about providing the simple information that a business needs if it wants to go and deliver a service in another country – that essential research before they start.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is just the first of many reports and many investigations that my committee will continue to make, because this is a long-term project. We are just at the beginning of something absolutely crucial for the future of the European economy.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, when Parliament voted on the Services Directive, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left voted against it. This was because we believed that the core of the Services Directive was based on the EU’s liberal market freedoms, where freedom for companies and the free movement of services are more important than trade union and social freedoms. When trade union rights come into conflict with the rules of the internal market, it is the rules of the internal market that prevail. We have seen the consequences of this in the Laval ruling and several other anti-union rulings.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The country of origin principle was clearly replaced by the freedom to provide services, but we needed a recipient country principle, in other words, for the rules in the recipient country to apply. We tabled a proposal to this effect, but unfortunately, we did not manage to get it through.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I know that the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, wants to protect trade union rights. She writes that the directive must not undermine general welfare services, but this is not enough to enable the GUE/NGL Group to support the report. This is because the anti-union rulings are not mentioned in the report, despite the fact that they have changed labour market policy completely and reduced workers’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Neither does the report mention the demands agreed on previously by the GUE/NGL Group and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, namely, that we need a social protocol where the trade union and social freedoms are not made secondary to market freedoms. We regret the absence of this in the report.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When the Commission comes to review how well the directive has been working, trade unions have been ruled out as a contact point, whereas, in my opinion, this should be an express requirement. Unfortunately, therefore, the GUE/NGL Group cannot support this report.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Allow me to finish simply by saying that trade union and social rights and collective agreements must never be viewed as administrative barriers.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Services Directive has always been surrounded by inexplicably optimistic language. It seems that Europe expected that, with this directive, an extraordinary opening up of the market would follow, accompanied by no ill effects and heralding solely positive developments. Now, when it is still to be fully implemented in all countries, we already know that these expectations have, at least in part, been betrayed.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are certain sectors in which the directive will fail to improve the market or the quality of the services offered, let alone create more jobs. I could quote a host of examples, including local markets and travelling salesmen, who are an important component of regional tradition and identity in some Member States, including Italy.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is a sector that, in my opinion, should be excluded from the application of the Services Directive. For this reason, I hope that Parliament will ask for the Services Directive to be reviewed so that its scope may be amended, because, as it stands, there is a serious risk that it will penalise sectors that are fundamental to the economy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reports on implementation represent an extraordinarily arduous task and they promise little media attention, but they are of major significance for the shaping of Europe’s internal market, particularly in the present era. I would therefore like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to all those who helped produce this report, in particular, the rapporteur and our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Handzlik. The Commissioner made reference to the fact that 90% of all newly created jobs in Europe’s internal market are in the tertiary sector, which is to say the service sector. In my view, and that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) at least, this means that the delay in implementation that has admittedly taken place and is taking place in only a few – but nonetheless in some – Member States must be brought to an end without fail. We ask the Commission to truly take serious action to ensure that the Services Directive, which has already been in force for some time, can be genuinely ready for use immediately.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since 90% of all jobs are created in this sector, that also means, secondly, that the Commission must regularly review the scope and examine whether there is not a need to incorporate further sectors – admittedly possibly very small ones – into the scope.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I would like to point out that the creation of the point of single contact – which has been mentioned in various ways already – represents the nucleus of a European administrative law. Obviously, I therefore do understand the odd complaint from the Member States here or there about bureaucratic processes in the mutual evaluation – as Mrs Gebhardt made reference to. However, if you want a single market, ultimately you have to work to ensure its functioning and success.</p>
      <p sl="de">For that reason, Commissioner, I am extremely pleased to see that you have in any case already received a thousand draft notifications setting out amendments made by the Member States to their national laws. I hope that you continue to receive them. All of this must not serve to burden local communities with layers of bureaucracy but is instead designed to ensure that the single market for service providers is viable.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, implementation of the Services Directive has been a complex process for many Member States. In many ways, it has led to a more open internal market with all that that entails, but we have also seen examples where it has not worked so well.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As a Swedish Social Democrat, I have to mention our own situation, where, following the government’s transposition of the directive into Swedish law, there is absolutely no requirement for foreign companies to have a representative in Sweden with the right to negotiate and enter into collective agreements with the competent trade union federation. This is a typical problem associated with implementation, as the directive does not contain any ban on laying down corresponding requirements and we have several examples of countries that have succeeded in solving the same problems without ending up in the same situation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Swedish labour market model is based on the social partners taking joint responsibility for regulating wages and working conditions. A worker working in Sweden without a collective agreement is therefore at risk of experiencing poorer conditions and a poorer level of protection than other workers. It is therefore of the utmost importance for rules to be in place which ensure that foreign companies have a representative present in Sweden and that this representative has the mandate to negotiate and enter into collective agreements.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I hope that this type of problem, which is a result of over-implementation rather than under-implementation, will also be addressed in the report that is provided for in Article 16(4) of the Services Directive and that is required to have been produced before the end of the year.</p>

      <p sl="en">In June 2010, only about half the Member States had implemented the directive – more than half a year late. Where are we now, Commissioner? Today, more than a year after the deadline, have all 27 Member States implemented the directive? If not, I think that is pathetic.</p>
      <p sl="en">The obstacles to implementation are not of a technical nature; they are a lack of ambition and political will. The Services Directive was, in itself, a very meagre compromise and less than the bare minimum needed to bring about a true internal market. Now, Member States are dragging their feet and implementing only reluctantly and late. That is short-sighted. At times of economic crisis, we cannot afford to waste opportunities for growth and job creation because, while the European Union is navel-gazing and preoccupied with our internal borders, the rest of the world moves on. It is not waiting for us. If we want to make EU 2020 a reality, the Member States will have to step up implementation of the Services Directive.</p>

It is more than a year since the Services Directive should have been transposed into the law of all EU Member States. Unfortunately, however, these thousands of changes are clearly not enough. In an attempt to apply protectionist measures in their domestic economies, some states have failed to regard the implementation of this directive as a priority. Paradoxically, however, the consistent application of the Services Directive and the removal of barriers to cross-border service provision might work as a catalyst for the economic growth of the entire EU, enabling the crisis to be overcome more rapidly.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In connection with the implementation of the directive, I am very concerned that the points of single contact, which are supposed to make life easier for entrepreneurs by providing information on doing business in a given country, as well as in other Member States, are functioning in only 14 countries so far. Commissioner, knowing you as I do, I believe that you and your colleagues will continue the effort to implement the ‘Single Market Act’, and that you will be making consistent representations to Member States to transpose the Services Directive into law, including implementation on the ground. The successful implementation of this directive is a fundamental precondition for creating a unified internal market. You can count on receiving support from our IMCO committee.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, much has been said this evening about technical issues relating to the implementation of the Services Directive, but I believe that it would be far more helpful if we were to actually assess its application together. Why not admit today, when the global crisis is unfolding before us, that all the instances of deregulation are exacerbating the crisis and damaging the services provided to citizens, and that this is happening everywhere, both in the European Union and worldwide?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Barnier, you said just now that there had been some irrational debates regarding this directive. However, you are surely aware that, right now in France, an industrial dispute is taking place within a transport company because Polish and French drivers are being pitted against each other in the name of the country of origin principle.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, services of general interest are being destroyed or privatised everywhere. Now, the aim is to further extend the Bolkestein Directive, together with the Single Permit Directive, which you want, incidentally, to force through this House, even though the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been unable to give an opinion on it! Now you are going to force European workers to compete not only against each other, but against immigrant workers, too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, the situation concerning social services of general interest has still not been cleared up. Healthcare, housing, local communities and childcare must not be treated as commodities. It would therefore help if we had some real assessments of the impact of the application of this directive in terms of employment, regional life and also consumer prices, because everyone can see that energy prices, like transport prices, are increasing all the time, even though we were told that competition would bring them down.</p>

I hold with the view that its full implementation will enable us to unlock enormous economic potential and create jobs. I should like to highlight some aspects that I think deserve to be picked out.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the first place, full and precise transposition of the directive into domestic law must remain an absolute priority for us. In this respect, I think that Parliament should play a greater role in monitoring its implementation by the Member States. This is both because of the significant contribution that it has made to the directive’s long and complex legislative passage and because, given the importance of the subject matter, it is proper that the views of our citizens be represented and taken into consideration in a proper and fair way.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, the questions of interpretation put by some countries concerning the scope of the directive’s application deserve to be clarified without delay so as to ensure the certainty of the law and the effectiveness of the directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">The implementation of single points of contact for services must take place with ever greater use of IT, by providing services online with easy access, primarily, for small and medium-sized enterprises, which will guarantee interoperability with other portals in other Member States, thereby avoiding the linguistic barriers that have to be overcome daily.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as the mutual evaluation process envisaged by the directive is concerned, this can be really useful, if properly carried out, for identifying best practice that can function as a stimulus for those countries that are more backward in transposing the directive and encouraging convergence in laws.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the European single market in services is still not fulfilling its potential. The aim of the Services Directive should be to eliminate barriers to service provision across Europe, and it should bring dramatic improvements. Unfortunately, this is not yet happening. I therefore welcome Mrs Gebhardt’s report. I agree with the view that there is a need to put effective pressure on Member States to speed up the incorporation of the directive into national law, and to complete this fully. In my opinion, however, it is just as important for small and medium-sized firms to know that there are places capable of assisting them with their business activities in the area of services. I therefore consider it vitally important to boost awareness of the points of single contact.</p>
      <p sl="cs">For this reason, I have mainly focused in my amendment proposals on the need to upgrade the information campaign in support of this project. The campaign should be aimed at all those involved, including public bodies. The EU may have the best intentions, and it may prepare the best legislation and support measures, which all of the countries might even implement to the best of their ability, but if firms and entrepreneurs are not aware of this, the outcome will always be mixed.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In this act on the single internal market, we are trying to adapt Europe not only to its citizens and consumers, but also to firms and entrepreneurs. Let us therefore listen to them but, above all, let us give them sufficient accessible information.</p>

I would like to have much more precise information on this.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There is no information, for example, on the extent to which small and medium-sized enterprises have increased their cross-border activities.

The problem is that protectionism still persists in many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Today, as we debate the implementation of this directive after several years, I would like to express disappointment over the fact that it took us five years before the original Bolkestein directive finally entered into force, following abridgement and the addition of a series of items here in Parliament. Now we do not even have clear evidence that it achieved what it was supposed to achieve, the reason being that many Member States still misunderstand the philosophy and meaning of the single internal market. I very much regret the fact that five countries do not have points of single contact in operation, although it is much more worrying that a decent level of interoperability has still not been established between the points of contact in the other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As the previous speakers have already pointed out, the issue is that small-scale entrepreneurs in particular do not yet have enough information about what the points of contact can do for them, and in some countries, these points do not even exist. What I do consider beneficial is that Member States themselves are actually assessing each other. Perhaps this will result in some kind of desirable outcome in the future. I would like to thank the rapporteur and also the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Handzlik, for producing an essentially accurate description of the situation facing us here. I would like to draw your attention to Article 36, in which the report notes that Member States must carry out risk assessments and ensure that companies do not encounter pointless obstacles when performing the necessary procedures electronically.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the European Union does not have the best reputation. This often results from the fact that workers do not feel that the balance between freedom and security is protected or that it needs to be restored in many areas. This can be seen, for example, in the Services Directive, since it is an important driver of the internal market but also throws a spotlight on the limitations of that market at the same time. The review is therefore important. It is a complex task, and one to which Mrs Gebhardt has provided absolutely outstanding answers.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are still some challenges to be overcome, however. The Services Directive must not, under any circumstances, undermine the fundamental principle of equal pay for equal work in the same location. We must therefore carefully ensure, through all the monitoring opportunities that have been made available to us, that cross-border services, too, do not violate this principle.</p>
      <p sl="de">The point of single contact must provide fair access to the market of the country in which the service is to be provided. However, this is not only for the service providers themselves and the companies, for whom in my home city of Essen, for example, there are six officials – for four towns – who feel responsible. It is also for the workers. In that regard, it is absolutely crucial what language these points of single contact speak. In the Committee on Regional Development, we had a fairly hopeless discussion on this. In my view, the languages of the neighbouring countries should be used.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, like many other Members, I, too, recall the great effort required of all of us to overcome the numerous obstacles before we could finally approve the Services Directive. Today, four years later, we are faced with evaluating what has been done, and I believe it is necessary to do so.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that all possible instruments must be applied to achieve full and precise transposition of the directive in every Member State, verifying that amendments to the law are in operation also and, above all, at regional level, in particular, in those countries where federalism is more marked.</p>
      <p sl="it">To this end, I consider it absolutely important that all of them take determined action to ensure that the directive is implemented in sufficient time so as not to nullify the efforts made by those Member States in which implementation is more advanced, and which would therefore be faced with serious difficulties in accessing an internal market, one of the most important components of which would be obstructed.</p>
      <p sl="it">The difficulty of making all the new developments and facets of a directive as substantial as this known therefore requires governments to organise information and communication campaigns through the competent authorities on a systematic basis to the extent contained in the text of the measure. As of now, these campaigns have yet to be organised.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to conclude on a dissenting note as regards the merits of the mutual evaluation procedure, which has proved itself to be extremely useful, by allowing for greater transparency in national regulations and creating a structured dialogue between Member States.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, may I start by congratulating the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs on the report and on the spirit of cooperation which they demonstrated. The main problems with the application of the directive, despite the fact that most Member States have made considerable progress, are basically due, as the report makes clear, firstly, to the lack of information for companies about what applies in each Member State and, secondly, to the unnecessary administrative burden in the form of time-consuming procedures.</p>
      <p sl="el">These problems constitute a serious barrier to cross-border trade in the services sector and to equal conditions of competition on the market, with all that implies.</p>
      <p sl="el">That is why it is vital, if the directive is to be applied correctly, for points of single contact to function as e-government portals, thus allowing procedures and formalities to be completed remotely, while, at the same time, providing information on labour law and, more importantly, on taxation.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, if we are to complete the market, promote growth and create new jobs, I believe that the Member States should not only speed up the application of the directive, but should also take immediate action to address any obscure points in the directive, in order both to benefit society as a whole and small and medium-sized enterprises and to protect workers’ rights.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, may I say, firstly, that I am grateful to the group for giving me the opportunity to speak in this debate and may I commend the rapporteur and Commissioner Barnier, in particular, for their excellent and important work.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Since I came into the European Parliament, I have been hearing all the time about the need for more Europe. I certainly embrace that concept. The recent economic crisis has brought that idea home to all of us, especially in my own country.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We have an election going on in Ireland at the moment, and it is very interesting that there is more talk about the EU than there is about local issues; this is obviously part of the result of the IMF-EU bail-out. Nevertheless, Ireland’s leader has spent two days in Europe, which is unprecedented – one with President Barroso and today with Chancellor Merkel. This all shows an engagement with Europe that we might not have had before.</p>
      <p sl="ga">On this point, the directive has the potential to help us all across Europe to get out of the economic crisis and create prosperity. Unfortunately, many countries, including my own, have not transposed this directive into law. Hopefully, that will change with the new government.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Particularly where SMEs are concerned, there is great potential. It has not been availed of because they are not aware of it, because of difficulties with language, etc. The first thing is certainly to transpose the directive into law. Secondly, the EU needs to impose barriers and penalties on countries that do not abide by the deadlines. It has been far too easy up to now. If we are to have progress, this has to be done.</p>
      <p sl="ga">If each SME had one more employee, unemployment would cease in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ga">This is a great opportunity, as Mr Harbour and others have said. We cannot afford to wait.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, first, I would like to point out that the Hungarian Presidency attributes great importance to the successful conclusion of the mutual evaluation process examining the quality of the Member States’ transposition of the directive. However, it cannot be emphasised enough how important it is that we increase the access to information, competitiveness and, thus, the mobility of businesses, and, in particular, of small and medium-sized enterprises. Naturally, we can also contribute to this by facilitating the cross-border activities of SMEs. Multilingual single contact can, and indeed does, play a highly important role in this. The Hungarian Government has always respected, and will continue to abide by, the deadlines in order to transpose all elements of the Services Directive into Hungarian law and practice. In my opinion, the directive is appropriate, but in order to achieve its objective, it is important that all Member States follow and comply with all elements of the directive in time and observe the deadlines.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the free movement of workers, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services are vital pillars of our internal market. Of course, these must not act as a gateway for social dumping. Service providers must respect the law of the State in which they operate. The country of destination principle must thus also be enforced consistently. For that to happen, all the Member States must also do their homework.</p>
      <p sl="de">My home country of Germany has not done its homework in this regard, as there is quite clearly a lack of framework conditions for fair mobility and social security. There are no binding wage floors in many areas, the monitoring of undeclared work is inadequate and we have fictive self-employment as a common way of circumventing labour law. As Mr Geier already said, we also need advice centres in different languages for posted workers, not just for companies. If the freedom to provide services is also to benefit workers, there is still some homework to be done.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the Services Directive establishes a general legal framework for Member States, public administrations and local authorities aimed at simplifying procedures and harmonising provisions concerning the right to establish and provide services. It also sets up points of single contact intended to offer assistance to service providers and, in particular, SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We call on Member States to turn points of single contact into an e-government portal which will offer a complete range of online services to service providers wishing to set up an enterprise or offer cross-border services. Member States must ensure that points of single contact are accessible, including the opportunity for any formalities and procedures to be completed remotely by electronic means. To ensure the electronic interoperability of the points of single contact and mutual recognition of electronic signatures, we call on the Commission to speed up the review of Directive 1999/93/EC on electronic signatures and the adoption of a legislative act on the mutual recognition of e-identification and e-authentication in order to facilitate the provision of cross-border public services in the single market.</p>

It has a great pulling effect on each single government to change to e-governance and use new ICT technologies. The minor problems with the languages have to be looked at carefully and this we have to improve, but the great success of the Services Directive is that it will have a great impact on the European economy in the coming years.

Many of us who have spoken today have mentioned that there are countries that have still not got their points of single contact in place, so I would just like to make a direct appeal to the Commissioner to intervene personally when you now visit all of these countries, and ensure that you emphasise once again to the Member States that these points of single contact must be provided. Proper conditions must be in place. I will not claim to be an expert in how to put more pressure on those Member States that have not done this, but I very much hope that, as Commissioner, you will personally do your bit to put pressure on these countries. I think it is quite simply scandalous that, after 14 months, we still have countries that have not implemented this.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, it is both useful and necessary to remind ourselves here of the struggles fought by workers in various countries against this directive, struggles which came together to take on an expressive dimension on a European scale, struggles that allowed some of the more negative aspects of the first draft of the directive to be deleted or amended. However, this discussion clearly demonstrates that the causes for concern and the motives for the struggle have not gone away.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is primarily because all the areas in which the states can and must perform their social duties through public services have not been clearly excluded from the scope of the directive. As we well know, the concept of public services has been distorted to offer a narrow view of it. Why has the Member States’ ability to intervene in safeguarding their uniqueness and defending their productive and business fabric been limited? It is because freedom of establishment and the free provision of services continue to take precedence over social and labour rights, which are increasingly degraded as this single market is strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, a genuine contribution to defending the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises would be to put an immediate stop to the so-called austerity plans that are stifling them, as is happening in innumerable countries such as Portugal.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, you will have observed that there are many, many MEPs wishing to use the catch-the-eye procedure because this subject is so ridiculously important to us. I come from a country – Austria – where the Services Directive has not yet been implemented. The reason for this relates to constitutional law – the requisite majorities were needed in order to pass a Federal Constitutional Act, and they are not easy to obtain. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, not only because she has shown such commitment to this subject for so long, but also because she attempted, together with the shadow rapporteur, to accommodate both the principles and the practical in this report. Those principles included emphasising how important it is to exclude social services and health services. The practical included, for example, the ability to find what you are looking for and obtain the necessary information via the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="de">The main reason why I wanted to speak was in order to express our disappointment with the fact that, even on implementation of the Services Directive, it has still not proven possible to get a grip on wage and social dumping.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I come from Greece and, unlike Austria, Greece started to apply the Services Directive just a few months ago, in 2010, when it was transposed into national law.</p>
      <p sl="el">We are very proud of this, because we achieved it at a very difficult time for Greece, in a period of crisis, and the fact that we achieved it is very important, because the first to be supported by the Services Directive, especially the points of single contact, will be small and medium-sized enterprises, which we need in the European economy above all else.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would like to reiterate two things said by another Greek member who spoke. Mr Poupakis of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) said that it is very important to have information and it is also very important to remove the administrative burden.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I honestly must thank Evelyne Gebhardt from the bottom of my heart; like a mother, she has nurtured this child, by which I mean the Services Directive, since the last legislative period; she has raised it and I think that, in cooperation with the ‘daddy’, Commissioner Barnier, they really will be able to raise the directive like their child, for the benefit of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it is true that Mrs Gebhardt and I have a real rapport, but that does not mean that we always have to agree with one another. I have no other comment to make apart from to say that we must work together intelligently, Mrs Rapti.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I was also struck by what you said, Mrs Rapti. I myself was able to see, during my recent visit to Greece, and echoing the concern expressed by Mr Harbour about the potential for growth found in this directive, that, if it is used intelligently, within the limits laid down but to its full potential, there clearly will be potential for the services economy, which is so very important – I will say it again: other agri-food and industrial economies should be equally important or more important – to grow. Moreover, this directive, if used properly, will be an opportunity for open economies such as the Greek economy, in which services, especially tourism services – the tourism industry – are so important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say to Mr Schwab, and to Mrs Gebhardt also, that they are right to point out Parliament’s role in improving this directive and to confirm that Parliament will be vigilant in ensuring that it is implemented properly. As I have often said to Mr Harbour, I personally am keeping a close eye on its implementation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, almost all the Member States have opted to adopt a horizontal legislative act. Mrs Vergnaud and Mr Canfin pointed out – they were sorry to have to do so, but they have a responsibility to give their opinion – that France, and Germany too, had preferred to integrate principles from the directive directly into their existing sectoral legislation. People may question or criticise that approach, Mrs Vergnaud, as you yourself have done, but we believe that it is clear and valid in the European context.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to point out to Mrs Hyusmenova that 23 Member States have already adopted their horizontal transposition legislation. Mr Kelly mentioned that Ireland was the very last country to do so. In two other Member States – Mrs Regner spoke of Austria and Luxembourg – the legislation is currently being examined by their parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to point out to Mrs in ’t Veld that infringement proceedings are still open with regard to seven Member States that have failed to communicate their transposition measures. Therefore, as you can see, ladies and gentlemen, the spirit is one of agreement and proactiveness. I myself am visiting the Member States, as was noted earlier. Mr Løkkegaard mentioned my visits concerning these issues in particular. However, you will see that, if necessary, we can be even more insistent by opening infringement proceedings to ensure that this directive is implemented properly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Auconie, Mrs Handzlik, Mrs Sehnalová, Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Harbour stressed the importance of multilingual points of single contact. We share this view of the importance of multilingual services, of services that are also very interoperable, electronic and accessible from the wonderful tool that is the Internet – Mrs Comi and Mrs Roithová mentioned this, as did Mrs Herczog just now when she spoke about these points of single contact.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to point out to Mrs Handzlik that the Commission is working with the Member States to exchange good practice on issues such as the Internal Market Information System (IMI) and the Internal Market Problem Solving Network (SOLVIT). We have a group of experts tasked with facilitating this exchange of good practice; we have begun a study to check how things are going and, at the end of 2011, we will organise a conference on the practical operation of the points of single contact, in the same spirit as the forum on the single market that I would like to organise – this was a suggestion made by Mrs von Thun und Hohenstein and Mr Harbour. It will be an annual single-market forum enabling us to take an approach that is more human, more practical, more citizen-based and closer to this market, with businesses and with professional organisations or trade unions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Løkkegaard and Mrs Gáll-Pelcz, who reminded us of the commitment of the Hungarian Presidency, mentioned the mutual evaluation process. This is another new method which, if we can make a success of it, will, I hope, be useful for other European texts. I am paying close attention to this constructive mutual evaluation, which is a modern tool consisting of a case-by-case evaluation, before applying it to other legislative instruments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Harbour mentioned the performance tests that we have begun. Why have we begun these performance tests for each service to see the positive or negative interactions between certain European texts? Because we realise that, in order to apply the Services Directive properly, we need to have regard to other texts, and I would offer the example of an architect based in Belgium who works with clients in the Netherlands and who, depending on the circumstances, may be subject to the Services Directive, the Professional Qualifications Directive, the E-Commerce Directive, the Consumer Protection Directives, and other instruments besides. This is why we need to ensure – and this is what we are going to do with the performance tests – that these different European texts tie in well together.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to conclude, Mr President, by raising a highly political point, which is important to me too, ladies and gentlemen, and which Mrs Gebhardt was the first to raise: this directive must be applied for the purposes for which it is intended; it must not be applied to other matters. I will therefore be as vigilant as you with regard to the temptation of certain Member States to use this directive for purposes other than those for which it is intended, in particular, for issues that might relate to services of general economic interest. Mrs Auconie raised this point, as did Mrs Svensson and Mrs Bizzotto just now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also remind Mr Canfin, who questioned me, that the Commission is honouring its commitment by working on a text that will clarify a communication on public services, on services of general economic interest. My colleague, Mr Almunia, the Commissioner responsible for competition, is, for his part, working on updating the Monti-Kroes package. Therefore, you will have two tools, in communication terms, which should clarify matters and prevent ambiguities and, at times, controversies or misunderstandings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The communication on services of general economic interest or public services will be produced sometime this year. I would also say to Mrs Geier that the Services Directive should not affect workers’ rights, because the directive does not deal with this issue. Indeed, it does not deal with the issue of rights or the issue of the posting of workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I should like to say to Mr Le Hyaric, whose criticisms I listened to carefully just now, that transport is not covered by the Services Directive, and neither is healthcare. This directive does not stipulate that public services must be privatised in any way; I will pay extremely close attention to that, and to other matters besides, in the communication that we are preparing on services of general interest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In other words, ladies and gentlemen, I know that this directive has provoked debate. I would remind you that it has been greatly improved, that it is now fairly clear and that we can use it to create jobs and growth, which the citizens are waiting for. I want us to be demanding – and you are right to be so – but I would also like us to be objective with regard to this directive and to build this single market in services together, in the spirit of partnership and using partnership methods. In any case, that is what I am determined to do – and what I promised you I would do – over the next four years so as to enable this directive to realise its full potential.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this debate was very interesting and illuminating. There was one observation I have to make, though, and that was that there are still people who continue to have in their heads the old Bolkestein proposal, which actually provided for liberalisation and deregulation, despite the fact that that really is a thing of the past and that the Services Directive, as constituted at present, is about enabling people to use their qualifications to offer services across the European Union. That is what this Services Directive is about, and it is important to keep saying so. I would like to stress that once again and we have also made that change quite clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, I would also like to remind you all that we absolutely do have a social clause in the Services Directive. This is because we have included, in Article 1, a clause whereby the labour and social law of the Member States cannot be jeopardised by the application of the Services Directive. Thus, if something like that were to happen in a Member State – and I did say this at the beginning – that would be an incorrect implementation of the Services Directive. If you want to speak of the Rüffert case and others, that has no relevance to the Services Directive. Such cases relate to the Posting of Workers Directive and its implementation and to the public procurement directives. Please do not fall into the trap of comparing apples and oranges. While apples and oranges perhaps both produce a good fruit stew, that is completely the wrong approach to take in politics. We therefore really need to very closely monitor what happens.</p>
      <p sl="de">I repeat my call for us to ensure that the Services Directive is correctly transposed in the Member States and not used to take rights away or to deregulate – that is not the job of the Services Directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, it remains a quite clear demand for us that we in the European Union in any case need a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest. I am eager to see what the Commission will produce for us in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="it">The market in services represents two thirds of the gross domestic product and two thirds of jobs in the European Union, but even so, only a fifth of total intra-EU trade. All the same, I can only agree with the priorities enumerated by the rapporteur and, in particular, as regards the completion of the points of single contact and the strengthening of administrative cooperation. As things stand, the first generation of points of single contact exists in 22 Member States. This would appear to afford us some comfort, were it not for the fact that in only 14 of them is it possible to complete the process online. On the contrary, it is essential that points of single contact become an integral part of greater e-government in the EU, making the offering available in different languages. Finally, it is essential to strengthen administrative cooperation so that the whole of this communication-based system can function efficiently. The Internal Market Information System (IMI) has already become a vitally important tool. It supports the work done by administrations, enables different administrative methods to be coordinated and deficient information to be supplemented. In spite of this, monitoring will, in future, be necessary to make sure that this system is not only used but also, and above all, correctly applied.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing with the subject of enhanced cooperation here for a second time. A few months ago, we decided on enhanced cooperation for the first time under the Treaty of Lisbon in relation to the field of family law. Now we are to do so a second time. It is a purely procedural decision that is to be taken here. I want to make that clear, because at this point, we will not be debating the content of the issues in question. That will take place at a later date.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me start by observing that I have been very pleased to see that the Hungarian Presidency is also present here today. This is a first, you might say, as I believe this is the first time in the history of the European Parliament that the Presidency has been present on a Monday evening. This also shows, perhaps, how important this portfolio that we are debating today actually is.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have been debating the issue of the European patent on the basis of a proposal from the Commission since 2001. Within the framework of the Palacio report, Parliament took a very specific position, including in relation to potential solutions, in respect of first reading. It proved impossible to reach agreement about the patent in the Council, which was essentially due to two problems. One of the problems is the courts issue – which courts are to be competent for which disputes – but there was also the language issue. The courts issue will possibly be resolved soon through a decision of the European Court of Justice in an opinion at the beginning of March, at which point we will know precisely what can and cannot be done.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to the language issue, no progress has been made. Last autumn, the Belgian Presidency had to concede that it was clearly impossible to reach a solution on the language issue, or at least to do so and also meet the requirement for unanimity as envisaged under the Treaty of Lisbon. There is quite simply a diametric contrast between the principle that the European Union has 23 official languages that are supposed to be equal and the fact that a patent can give rise to enormous costs, specifically through translation. Against this background, there is also always the problem that, if we have a patent translated into all the languages, this patent is of no use to small and medium-sized enterprises as it is much too expensive, irrespective of the risk of the legal disputes that may exist in the various Member States. This type of patent in many languages under the current European Patent Office system is actually only for large companies rather than for small and medium-sized enterprises. That is something that surely has to change.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since 2000, the European Parliament has, on dozens of occasions, called in its resolutions for progress to finally be made on the European patent – with a view to the Lisbon process and the new 2020 process. I think it really is enough now. The Belgian Presidency asked the Commission to bring forward a specific proposal for the enhanced cooperation process. The Commission has taken on this initiative. The Council has formally asked us for our assent. The Committee on Legal Affairs has emphatically given its backing, by 16 votes to 5. In the meantime, 25 Member States are now behind this proposal. It is now quite simply time to take a step forwards and to give consent from our side – Parliament’s side – to this procedure so that there is finally some light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one more point to close with. We do not have many resources in Europe. What we do have is our intelligence, our creativity and the ideas that are born on this continent. It is therefore also of critical importance for us that these ideas are also protected. I ask myself, how can we actually turn round to China, India and many other major developing countries in the world and tell them that they must protect intellectual property rights when we are not even in a position to do that here in Europe? We therefore need this qualitative progress to a European patent now. That is why I am backing this proposal for enhanced cooperation and why I am calling on you all to support it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is a privilege and an honour for me to address this distinguished audience today. As Mr Lehne has just mentioned, the presence of the Presidency on a Monday bears witness to the importance of the issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its constructive approach with regard to the Council’s efforts to improve conditions for obtaining patent protection in the European Union. I also wish to extend our gratitude to the former Belgian Presidency for its relentless efforts to further the cause of the creation of a unitary patent protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, I would like to report that this morning, the Council decided, by an overwhelming majority, to request your consent for the authorisation of enhanced cooperation in this field. Subject to your consent, the Competitiveness Council on 10 March is expected to give its authorisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Hungarian Presidency attaches particular importance to improving the EU’s competitiveness and to supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises operating in the EU. It is our joint responsibility to help them with innovation, which is one of the driving forces of competitiveness of SMEs both at European level and globally.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has been clear from the outset that one of the key elements in fulfilling this objective would be the creation of an EU patent, which has been delayed for more than 30 years. Maintaining the status quo is not an option. Millions of euro are spent every year on translations and on administrative paperwork to obtain patent protection in the 27 different legal systems in the EU, while in the US, an inventor can acquire a patent for the entire US territory for an amount equivalent to EUR 1 850. In the EU, it costs EUR 20 000 for only 13 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to calculations, European enterprises suffer a loss of seven to eight hundred million euro because of the lack of an EU patent. Needless to say, this amount could be put to much better use if channelled, for example, into technological research.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is currently no internal market in terms of patent protection. The applicant is obliged to work with 27 separate national legal systems. As a result, in practice, protection is often sought only in a certain part of the EU territory, thus creating serious problems in terms of the free circulation of goods, which are protected by a patent in some jurisdictions, but can be freely produced in others.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our clear preference has always been the creation of a truly EU-wide patent that would cover the territory of all 27 Member States. We profoundly regret that negotiations relating to the linguistic regime have resulted in a stalemate, with no prospect of reaching the necessary consensus in the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also need to stress that EU decision makers are under pressure to make rapid progress in this field. The freshly released Innovation Union Scoreboard confirms that there is already a yawning gap between the innovation performance of the US and Japan and that of the EU, and the major emerging economies are rapidly catching up.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although patenting rules are not the only factor determining innovation activity, their importance is obvious to all. Each year, we keep on working with the current set of rules, our fragmented system becomes less attractive and competitive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under these circumstances, the overwhelming majority of the Member States consider that the creation of unitary patent protection within the framework of enhanced cooperation is the only way forward for the time being. 27 Member States have submitted official requests with a view to establishing enhanced cooperation. Their clear expectation is that visible results be achieved within a reasonable time.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Presidency-in-Office, we will do our utmost to make substantial progress in the field. On the other hand, the Presidency has to pay attention to the objections and reservations voiced by Spain and Italy too.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me turn now to address the distinguished Spanish and Italian members of this House in their mother tongue.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, I would like to address the honourable Members from our partner, Spain. We are confident that, through enhanced cooperation, with the creation of the unitary patent protection system, we are taking a significant step towards an ideal situation in which the unitary patent protection system covers all the Member States and the whole of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">I turn now to our Italian friends. In order to avoid any doubt, I must stress that no business and no individual, regardless of the country of origin, will be excluded from the benefits of a future unitary patent.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, thank you for your patience. I very much look forward to working with Parliament in the future on this subject.</p>

    <intervention id="1-083-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by giving your support to this enhanced cooperation, as Mr Lehne is proposing, you will be taking a decisive step, if you like, towards making the lives of European businesses and inventors easier, thanks to what is at last unitary patent protection in Europe. The inability to provide better and more affordable protection for inventions and creations, particularly in the industrial sector, is an incredible and, I believe, unacceptable weakness in terms of the competitiveness of our continent, which is up against extremely tough international competition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, at my hearing before you on 13 January 2010, and on many occasions since then, I made a commitment – a vow of sorts, really – that I would move this dossier forward so as to ensure that I am the last EU Commissioner to raise this issue. We made a proposal. Thanks to the Belgian Presidency’s proactive and intelligent approach, the proposal was supplemented, enhanced and improved, but, as you know, we failed to receive the unanimous support that I had hoped for on this matter. That is why and how this idea of enhanced cooperation, within the context of the new Treaty of Lisbon, was born. The Commission quickly responded to the request for enhanced cooperation that was initially submitted to it, as Mr Lehne said, by a dozen Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At this moment in time, ladies and gentlemen, 25 Member States have given their consent to the introduction of this enhanced cooperation. The Hungarian Presidency has taken over from the Belgian Presidency, and it too is showing great resolve, for which I thank it. It wants this cooperation to begin from March, and I am very grateful to Parliament and, in particular, to you, Mr Lehne, and to the members of your committee, for the pivotal role you are playing, with the Committee on Legal Affairs, in order to make progress in this work and to produce results quickly on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission wants as many Member States as possible to be involved in this enhanced cooperation, and I personally hope that all the Member States will ultimately be able to support this proposal, which, I shall say it again, is politically acceptable to all the Member States, and financially necessary for all businesses. The broadest possible support – indeed, unanimous support if possible – will ensure that this advance provides the maximum number of benefits for European businesses and inventors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In my capacity as Commissioner responsible for the internal market, I shall take care to ensure that enhanced cooperation remains compatible with the treaties, and with the rules on the functioning of the internal market in particular. That means, ladies and gentlemen, that unitary patent protection – as Mrs Győri explained very well in Italian and Spanish – will be accessible to all businesses in the EU, no matter which Member State they are based in. There will be no discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, the benefits of this unitary protection will be the same for all inventors and for all innovative companies in the EU, and this applies both to procedures, which will be streamlined, and to translation costs, which will be reduced. An analysis of the global impact of this project has already been carried out, and we are currently working on an in-depth assessment of its economic impact.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, the Commission, which regrets that an agreement among the 27 has not yet been possible, will do its utmost to establish this enhanced cooperation quickly – as soon as the Council of Ministers has given its opinion in March – by presenting the draft regulations necessary to establish it, so that we can very quickly bring this real added value to European businesses. Thank you for your attention, and thank you, in advance, for your support for this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with exceptional speed and dynamism, this Parliament is about to consent to the first instance of enhanced cooperation that specifically concerns the internal market. The accepted justification for this is that the discussion on a European patent has been on the agenda for many years. We should therefore do well to specify that the draft regulation on the translation regime was not adopted by the Commission until 30 June 2010 and that the Council took note of the lack of unanimity and the difficulty of reaching a unanimous decision in the near future in November 2010.</p>
      <p sl="it">I shall gloss over, then, the pace at which we in Parliament have dealt with the dossier, which I hope will serve as an example for the future, because we have broken records of some significance in favour of a speedy and efficient legislative passage.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nevertheless, since it is not my intention to act solely as a spokesman for the interests of my country, which is currently opposed to enhanced cooperation, and since I believe that the subject of the patent is fundamental to the development of industry and the European entrepreneurial system, I should like merely to raise certain questions that I consider to be important for the exercise by this House of its legislative functions and for the future treatment of regulations on the patent.</p>
      <p sl="it">First and foremost, we should do well to recognise that a vote in favour of enhanced cooperation will systematically legitimise the application to the development of the internal market of an instrument that should instead have the quality of a last resort. We are therefore creating a precedent that could be used in all areas of the internal market. Furthermore, I believe that this Parliament can, when we are faced with other subjects, subsequently state its view in a manner that is exhaustive and autonomous, and that individual proposals are at the centre of users’ and businesses’ interests rather than those of individual groups of countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the explanatory statement from the rapporteur is quite correct and needs no amplification. For this reason, my group will give its consent to enhanced cooperation. There were also some contrary opinions among us – this is quite legitimate and these voices should be heard. However, what the rapporteur, Council Presidency and Commissioner have had to say shows that the time has really come and that we cannot drag our feet any longer.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not the case, as some people claim, that this has all been agreed in haste without any discussion – like many of the other arguments, this is patently untrue. The language issue did not just become the subject of debate when the Commission presented its last proposal last year; this has been under discussion for a decade or more. There is nothing new about it. Anyone who looks at how different models have been presented and discussed in recent months cannot say that there has not been sufficient discussion. It is time to cut the Gordian knot!</p>
      <p sl="de">The second argument always used here is that we risk destroying the internal market. The fact is that we do not have an internal market where patents are concerned, so we cannot really destroy it. If – as has been the case for a long time – we are clear about the fact that the internal market really does need a uniform patent process in order to reach completion, then the entire internal market cannot be destroyed by this move. In the worst case scenario, things would remain as they are. I do believe that we will make progress, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third specific argument used is that Parliament would weaken its rights by consenting to enhanced cooperation: none of this is true. I would advise you to take a look at the Treaty of Lisbon and our Rules of Procedure. We will not relinquish a single right. We are now approving enhanced cooperation and, when this begins, we shall all have our individual rights. With regard to the language regime, of course this is simply a matter of consultation, since unanimity is required here. Codecision should apply to the actual patent regulation and the approval of patent jurisdiction, however. We are not relinquishing a single right, quite the opposite in fact.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks to Mr Lehne for the fine work that he has done on this issue and also to Commissioner Barnier, who is efficiently and successfully taking this matter forward.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This issue has, as we have heard, been under discussion for many decades and it is now clear that the Council is not going to achieve the unanimity required by the Treaty in order for a decision to be made. Many Member States have therefore asked to enter into enhanced cooperation in this area. I would like to emphasise that this is an open form of cooperation that all Member States are welcome to join if they so wish.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The matter that we have to decide on today is therefore whether or not Parliament should grant its approval to the Council’s request for this enhanced cooperation. It is my opinion and that of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that the European Parliament should approve this request, in line with the recommendation of the rapporteur, Mr Lehne.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Receiving protection for an invention or scientific discovery is extremely important for converting innovation and knowledge into useable, useful products, which, in turn, will create growth and jobs. At present, it is difficult for an individual inventor or a small company to get patent protection across the whole of Europe. It is quite simply too expensive and complicated, as we have heard. An American patent currently costs around EUR 1 800, whereas a European patent costs more than EUR 20 000 – 11 times as much, which is clearly unreasonable. Multinational companies with large resources and legal expertise will always cope with this, regardless of what the system is like.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is Europe’s individual innovators who are paying the price in the current system. It is high time that they, too, received protection for their achievements so that they grow and become the major employers of tomorrow that our Union so desperately needs. We need this now. We have no time to lose.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a European patent regime would probably improve the situation for some areas of business and science. However, I must say that the hopes placed in this patent are somewhat over-optimistic. We need to keep a sense of proportion here.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am opposed to enhanced European cooperation. We recently dealt with the issue of divorce in the context of enhanced cooperation. Now, directly following on from this decision, we have the next issue relating to enhanced cooperation on the table. If we simply wave this approval through, we will be encouraging a situation where soon, enhanced cooperation will be the only mechanism for reaching agreement because it is too difficult to reach agreement at Council level. This was not the intention of the convention when we discussed enhanced cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Good governance, something we talk about a lot here, means transparency and clarity among other things. However, transparency and clarity are not promoted by enhanced cooperation in its multiplicity of forms in a wide variety of areas. I believe we will be establishing a major problem for the future if we constantly have different subgroups of states coming together to agree on a particular issue. Of course, it is all very well to say ‘The invitation is open to everyone’. The question is, under what conditions? I would have thought that this time – unlike in all the preceding years – we actually would have had a chance of reaching agreement if only the negotiations had gone on longer.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not believe that enhanced cooperation is the right path for the issue of patents. For this reason, I do not intend voting in favour of this regulation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, for several years, discussion has been taking place in Europe on the introduction of unitary patent law. Economists and business people are of the opinion that its introduction would significantly reduce the costs of patent protection for businesses throughout the European Union and would allow cheap, effective and improved protection. This is particularly important, especially for the small and medium-sized enterprise sector. The recommendations and proposals of the European Commission also point in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, notice should be taken of certain controversial proposals which are the subject of discussion in this matter – this has already been mentioned in the House today – namely, the questions related to translations of patents made by the European Patent Office and the proposal that these translations be made into only three languages. This is something which requires further thought and consideration as to why it should be those three languages and not other ones, particularly because this would give a certain advantage to business people who use one of these languages as their mother tongue. I think we should give more thought to this.</p>

The Commission, however, wants to forge ahead with this. The fact that it does so is just another example of EU empire-building. The proposals are unnecessary and will impose yet more administrative and cost burdens on innovative companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">So exactly who is in favour of this? It is being driven forward by 12 countries that include the United Kingdom. It should surprise no one that the British coalition government is a prime mover in this, just as successive British Governments have been prime movers in most EU projects, while pretending to do the opposite.

      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I would like to commend the work and perseverance of Mr Lehne in this undertaking, and to thank him for the attention he had paid to our Spanish and Italian colleagues. I, too, listened to their arguments, and I completely understand them. However, we are not here today to resolve a linguistic issue. The European Commission proposal of 1 July 2010 is based on the language regime of the European Patent Office, which has proved its effectiveness. However, once again, this linguistic debate is not on the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today is about enabling those 25 Member States that wish to make progress by establishing enhanced cooperation to actually do so. Today is about responding to the request of European businesses, which pay 11 times more for their patents than US businesses.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, US President Obama, in his annual State of the Union Address, called for the US to be strengthened in the area of innovation. He referred to innovation as ‘our generation’s Sputnik moment’. I am pleased that the EU is sending a clear signal through the ‘Union of Innovation’ programme regarding the importance of innovation for maintaining the economic position of Europe in global competition. In my opinion, one of the key instruments for the success of the ‘Union of Innovation’ project, and for maintaining a lead against innovation tigers such as China and Brazil, is the establishment of a single EU patent. The single patent would help to give a considerable boost to the competitiveness of European businesses. I therefore feel very frustrated that the creation of such a key instrument for the development of innovation in the EU is being held up by some countries over secondary issues such as the protection of language. I therefore back the proposal to enhance cooperation, even at the expense of some Member States not participating. We must not allow ‘our generation’s Sputnik moment’ to slip away.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the European Union is founded on values such as equality, solidarity and respect for all languages. We all share these principles.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Spanish Members, we support the idea of having a patents system for the whole of the European Union, and I congratulate my colleague, Mr Lehne, on that part of the report. We support anything that improves and expands the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, for such an important matter, a course has been chosen that is provided for in the Treaty – enhanced cooperation – which should be the last resort and fulfil a series of conditions. In our view, enhanced cooperation, on which we will vote tomorrow, is contrary to Articles 118 and 326 of the Treaty. Moreover, I believe that in the Council, the rules of the game have been changed, but my government will deal with that.</p>
      <p sl="es">The new Treaty is an unquestionably useful tool for the EU, but it cannot be used to establish a multi-speed Europe. Many countries that currently support enhanced cooperation will soon suffer the consequences themselves and, if the Council and the Commission continue to use enhanced cooperation in this way, ultimately we will all lose.</p>
      <p sl="es">Spanish is spoken by 850 million people. Out of the three languages proposed by the European Commission for the patents system, only one of them is comparable to Spanish in terms of size. What criteria were used? Efficiency? Are we talking about EUR 1 850? Then why not use only English and leave the other two languages, so we will also save by doing it three times rather than 20 times. Is it about timing?</p>
      <p sl="es">It was not Spain that opposed a patent in the past, it was other countries, which are now rushing to have one. Is it to do with politics, as I suspect? Care should be taken with bureaucratic manoeuvres that distance millions of citizens – and thousands of businesses that use Spanish – from the reality of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">The system proposed by the Commission is contrary to the right of Europeans to express themselves in their language, it prioritises one language over others, it is clear discrimination against competition, it fragments the market and creates legal uncertainty. This battle has only just begun. Due to the haste of some, we are going to be faced with a legal action lasting several years in the Court of Justice, as my government has already said.</p>
      <p sl="es">The three institutions will have to give an account of the procedure followed and of why the warnings were ignored. This situation can be remedied if we return to the spirit and the letter of the treaties, which Spain has respected.</p>

Besides, the fragmentation of copyright in patents is one of the causes holding back economic recovery.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission is offering us enhanced cooperation with a specific language regime, something that we do not welcome. Nevertheless, there is something new. 25 out of 27 states are participating. The political framework has changed. Positive development may be possible, with an enhancement even of the proposer’s language, for example.</p>

They would also be coming before Italian – as has quite rightly been said – because Italian and Spanish were already recognised as languages for trademark registration.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we are all aware that multilingualism is a reflection of the cultural and linguistic diversity to be found in the EU and, as such, is extremely important. However, the dispute over the language used in EU patents has been going on for more than 30 years. Over the course of these 30 years, European countries have had to cope with high translation costs and, in some cases, competitive disadvantages on the global market. There is no denying that it is hard to put a figure on intangible fixed assets like trademarks and patents. However, these are used to secure loans and are also taken into account in ratings.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context, the new patent law drawn up through the process of enhanced European cooperation, which is valid at least in parts of the EU, only requires patents to be translated into German, English and French, which will certainly make matters easier in bureaucratic terms. This is particularly the case because English is used as a universal technical language in some sectors, such as IT and medicine. Last but not least, the consistent use of the three working languages – German, English and French – would make it genuinely possible to reach a majority of the population. On a personal note, I am pleased to see that the new regulation also strengthens the position of the German language, which is still the most widely spoken native language within the EU according to a survey from 2006.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, knowledge creation within the European Union is always a priority, which we manage successfully. However, knowledge management is not so well dealt with in the European Union. I was very sorry to hear that the Belgian Presidency could not finish the Patent Directive as planned, but I hope that the Hungarian Presidency will be committed to doing its best in the coming months to get to the next phase, which is enhanced cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Time is the only resource which is not renewable. The time we lose never comes back. We cannot experience Europe solely through austerity programmes. We need exploration of knowledge, we have to expand, and therefore it is of critical importance for Europe that patents, whether with enhanced cooperation or with the common European directive, get off the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to wish great success to those who participate in this and to those who are in favour of it. Being Hungarian, we will lose the Hungarian language, but that is a small price to pay compared to the advantages we will all benefit from.</p>

I would also like to thank my fellow Member, Mr Lehne, for his approach.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now, we need only to decide whether we should agree on enhanced cooperation. That is the first thing that has to happen. However, I regret that a distinction has been made between the importance of language and identity as a cultural phenomenon and what actually happens in practice.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Because, in practice, the system which is now being proposed has been used by all Member States for 35 years, and I think that we can be a little more prudent economically about the way in which this is being proposed. I regret that the debate is getting bogged down to some extent in the conflict about languages and I hope – and this is also what Parliament has expressly requested – that the Member States that are perhaps not involved at this stage will be able to join up at any time. That, I believe, will help us put an end to this debate and enable us to finally get a European patent.</p>

      <p sl="en">We cannot underestimate the importance of this proposal to the competitiveness of the European economy. We are currently debating a very imaginative new plan from Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn called the Innovation Union. This continent – the European Union – needs to be more inventive. We need to create more inventions and exploit them more. It is absolutely indispensable that we have a competitive patent system.</p>
      <p sl="en">This enhanced cooperation move is an imaginative one to move the debate forward. I hope our Spanish and Italian colleagues will come into it, but we cannot leave this waiting any longer, because the whole world is after the innovation market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In this case, and let us not lose sight of key issues relating to the EU patent concept and its objectives and implications for one second, the objective will be to impose a privileged status for English, French and German on the patent register for no other reason than the one I have just mentioned.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union has been pushing since 2000 for enhanced Member State cooperation in the area of patent protection.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The final round of negotiations, however, which took place in December last year, confirmed that many Member States have serious reservations over the proposed translation arrangements for EU patents, which are based on the current language regime of the European Patent Office. It is therefore impossible to achieve the positive unanimous decision of the Council necessary for further joint progress. In such a situation, it is therefore natural and logical that those Member States which see the need to enhance Member State cooperation in protecting intellectual property are responding by trying to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves in the area of creating unitary patent protection, by means of the process under Article 20 of the EU Treaty.</p>

We should support the call made by Mr Lehne and accept the proposal put forward by Commissioner Barnier. At this point, I would like to draw attention yet again to the successful work of the Belgian Presidency of the Council. This Presidency has achieved a great deal in other areas too.</p>
      <p sl="de">The issue at stake here is a procedural decision. Mr Lehne has already pointed this out. The question at issue here is not which European language is spoken by how many people worldwide or which is the most aesthetically beautiful, but rather a procedural decision that the Council is anxious to take. I would agree with the previous speaker from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance when she said that we should exercise care when considering this procedural decision. However, we are not faced with the desire of a subgroup within the European Council of Ministers to establish a language regime, but rather the wishes of 25 out of 27 Member States. It is for this reason that I believe that, even if the decision to approve enhanced cooperation is to be made with caution, this is something that the European Parliament can agree to.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European patent is intended to support innovativeness. In which case, why can the patent itself not be innovative? We are only talking about patent law, but we ought also to be talking about what would be the best form for the patent, for we have short-term patents and long-term patents, but the latter are certainly not necessarily better as patents or better written. I think we should create a form of patent and a procedure for describing inventions which will make best use of the Internet and electronic methods of registration, and therefore also of language. I think the cheapest form, which would not need to be translated into other languages, would be a European e-patent.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I have long supported the single European patent, as it will make it more attractive to invest in innovation, enable companies to better protect their know-how, speed up the transfer of knowledge from research into practice and perhaps better protect us against the influx of counterfeits onto the internal market. It is also a great challenge. Our competitiveness will be undermined by the fact that, after 10 years, the Council has achieved nothing more than enhanced cooperation. I welcome the fact that the Czech Republic has reassessed its position and has decided to join the negotiations. At the same time, I recognise the sensitivity of the precedent set by enhanced cooperation, particularly for some of the large states, as it involves a language regime. However, I believe it will benefit all researchers in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is important for patents to be as inexpensive as they are in the US, and I therefore hope that the Council will carry out further simplifications.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, much has already been said, today, about how Europe and European enterprises need a patent, and I agree with those voices. Without patent legislation, it will be more difficult for our firms to compete with the increasingly dynamic and innovative enterprises of emerging economies. We should not forget, however, that enhanced cooperation on patents is not, after all, the most advantageous solution from the point of view of the common European market. As a supporter of a strong common market, I prefer market barriers to be removed and not created. Therefore, I appeal to all those involved in developing the form of patent legislation to provide solutions which will benefit the whole of Europe. I am thinking here chiefly of the languages to be used, because in my opinion, we must not discriminate against people who do not understand French, German or English. I think that basing the system on one language would be the best solution.</p>

    <intervention id="1-106-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I will reply to your last comment, Mrs Handzlik, so as to point out, before I come to the procedure, the substance of the matters on which we have worked so hard, as has been said, with the Belgian Presidency and, over the last few weeks, with the Hungarian Presidency. If a Bulgarian, Slovak, Latvian or Portuguese company wishes to apply for a patent in its own language, it can do so under the proposal we are discussing, and the cost of the translation will be refunded.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If there is a dispute, the company will receive a manual translation in its own language. If, before receiving that translation, it fails to comply with the patent because it does not understand it properly, its good faith will be protected. In other words, it will not have to pay any damages.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So that we are all clear about what is being discussed here, I would like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, of what has been or will be proposed. I have proposed that a company wishing to apply for a patent may do so, including in its own language. Legal protection will be guaranteed in one of the three languages of the Munich Convention, which is part of the history of the European patents. I did not invent that convention; it has been around for a long time. There are three languages. One of the three – English, French or German – will be used to automatically guarantee legal protection throughout the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Under the Belgian Presidency, we added a proposal, which will doubtless be discussed. It was to use two other languages with manual translation, in addition to one of the three languages for legal protection. Those two languages will have no legal value, but they are of great value in terms of providing information about and communicating what is included in the patent. English, for example, can be used if so desired, as can Portuguese, Latvian or Dutch, with a translation in one of the three languages. Moreover, the translation will also be free of charge – its cost will be met. The situation, then, is as follows: one of the three languages will be used for legal protection and two other languages for information and communication. I would add one last time that no European companies will be discriminated against, and that includes those located in a Member State that is not participating in enhanced cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In other words, if a Spanish company applies for a European patent, it will be able to use it without being discriminated against if Spain does not participate in enhanced cooperation straight away. That is the aim, and that is why, ladies and gentlemen, I have worked hard on this matter, as I pledged to do. I have worked on it seriously; I have not been ideological or biased, and I have taken account of all the obstacles and been anxious to make progress.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I believe that the proposal is politically acceptable to the 27 Member States and financially necessary for all EU companies. Mrs Herczog made the very good point – as did Mr Harbour and others too, such as Mr Schwab – that this issue is important from an economic point of view. We need to encourage, stimulate, protect and remunerate creation and innovation. This is one of the areas in which Europe has another advantage. Let us guard that advantage; let us strengthen and protect it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many small businesses are no longer financially able to protect their inventions, because they do not have this European patent. And what happens? Mrs Roithová mentioned the word ‘counterfeiting’ just now. If the patent is not protected because there are not the means to protect it throughout the Union, will it be protected in two or three Member States? And will counterfeit goods be able to enter all the other Member States? Once they have entered, they are in the internal market, and jobs are destroyed and public safety and public health are put at risk. I am referring, for example, to inventions of medicines. This is an extremely serious matter, which is why we have dealt with it seriously, without being ideological but simply being anxious to make progress and to find a reasonable solution, which, I honestly believe, is acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, Mr President, I should like to respond to a comment made by Mr López-Istúriz White, to whom I listened carefully, and by Mrs Lichtenberger. They said that this enhanced cooperation, which currently involves 25 of the 27 Member States, could be used to fragment the single market. I sincerely believe that no such risk exists. Why? Because we are in an altogether exceptional situation: we have a single-market law that requires unanimity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For almost all of the other single-market regulations and laws, we have a qualified majority. In this case, we need unanimity. That is why I believe that there is no risk of fragmentation; indeed, the European Commission will be vigilant in preventing any kind of fragmentation of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like once again to thank Mr Lehne for his determination and commitment, as well as the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs. I should also like to thank you in advance for lending your support, on the basis of this objective proposal, to this enhanced cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, in my first speech this evening, I spoke in a language which is the language of the European patent and in two languages which, for the time being, are not the language of the European patent. Allow me now to speak in my mother tongue, which is likewise not the language of the European patent as things stand at present, and is a language that is spoken by a total of only 15 million people worldwide, 10 million of them in Hungary. Thus, I am saying to the Spanish and Italian Members in particular that believe me, we do devote great attention to the equality, importance and use of languages.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Allow me also to make a brief digression on behalf of a Member State which, in a sense, I represented until six weeks ago – because now I do not represent a Member State – but until six weeks ago, I represented a Member State that held a different opinion on the issue of the patent. Over the last few months, the Hungarian Government has changed its former position. This was not a simple decision. As regards the factor that caused the Hungarian Government to change its mind, this was the very serious dialogue held with the ‘business community’, with the representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises, and they unambiguously asked the government to change its earlier reluctant, or rather negative, stance in order to enable Hungarian small and medium-sized enterprises to benefit from the unitary European patent and to make savings thanks to a functioning linguistic regime.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The situation which has evolved now – 25 out of the 27 – is far from ideal. We all are, as Hungary has also been from the start, supporters of the single market. We trust and believe that accomplishing this will strengthen European growth, which – as a great many honourable Members have said – is now a necessity in the post-crisis European Union. To achieve this, we must do everything we can. I am convinced that the unitary European patent and the linguistic regime as one of its elements must be seen in this context. Moreover, as Commissioner Barnier has also pointed out, I believe that both Italian and Spanish companies will also benefit from the creation of the unitary European patent system.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would also like to react to two other remarks. One is, why this great haste and why this fast pace, because the Commission only tabled its proposal in July. As a matter of fact, you have already answered this question as well. Let me remind you that the debate on the linguistic regime alone has been going on for ten years in the European Union, so I believe this is not a matter of haste. Another comment concerned the ultima ratio, whether we have actually done everything possible to find a solution that is acceptable to all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I believe that the Belgian Presidency actually did do all it could. We only need to recall that even during the autumn, more and more new proposals were tabled with the intention of establishing this system in all 27 countries of the single market. Unfortunately, in spite of all the efforts, eventually, 12 Member States asked in December for closer cooperation to begin and, as has already been mentioned, their number has now increased to 25. Thus, there was nothing more to be done here, and the Presidency was unable to do anything other than to appeal for closer cooperation, and to this end it has asked, and now I ask personally as well, for your support in the voting. We need the single market and we need to strengthen it. We know, as several studies have shown, that one of the principal obstacles to this is the absence of unitary patent protection and so we should act to stop this hindering our small and medium-sized enterprises in particular in innovation and in enhanced performance.</p>

    <intervention id="1-108-000" speaker_id="2224" name="Klaus-Heiner Lehne" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude with three observations: Commissioner Barnier has already indicated that the principle of enhanced cooperation was specifically established to overcome obstacles in the area of unanimity. According to the Treaty of Lisbon, unanimity is the absolute exception. In other words, we only require it in a very small number of cases, This is precisely why the procedure for enhanced cooperation was established.</p>
      <p sl="de">While we are on the subject of language: language is not the issue at stake today. Let me repeat clearly: the issue under debate today is solely the procedure. However, let me point out that we already discussed the fact that one language is more cost-effective than three in relation to the Palacio report. However, as has already been indicated, we are dealing with the European Patent Convention (EPC) here. The European Patent Office works in the languages agreed in the EPC. A change in this regime would necessarily mean making a change to the EPC. However, the EPC cannot be changed by the Member States of the European Union acting unilaterally because the EPC includes all European countries, with the exception, I believe, of Malta. All of these countries, including Switzerland, for example, would have to agree to the change. If we cannot reach an agreement between the 27 Member States of the EU, how can we hope to find common ground between the 39 countries in the EPC? If we go down this route, then the entire issue will simply be put on the long finger indefinitely. However, we will have to discuss this question when we come to consider the material proposal from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">Incidentally, the legal services of all three institutions have expressly confirmed that enhanced cooperation is an option.</p>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps I might add another comment on the subject of language: practitioners find it hard to understand the political battle being waged here. That is because the practitioners – by which I mean those who register patents – in fact only operate in a single language as they carry out their research work. Accordingly, this dispute over the principle of language is something those involved find difficult to comprehend.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to conclude with some remarks on discrimination: if I have understood correctly – and I am certain that I have – this new European patent is open to all enterprises and all inventors, including those from countries that are not party to the enhanced cooperation, in other words, to every country in the world. This is absolutely self-evident.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is no disadvantage to those states that do not participate in enhanced cooperation. The European Patent Convention will continue to apply for them. In other words, if I wish to pursue a package of patents in these countries, then I must have these translated.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one final comment on the language dispute: there is nothing to stop anyone having all of these patents translated into all 23 official languages. If a Member State considers its language so important that all patents need to be translated into its language, then it should simply set the process in motion. However, this should not be at the expense of the patent holders, whose innovations help our economy to develop. Instead, the principle should be: he who pays the piper calls the tune. It is then up to the relevant states and their taxpayers to pay for this.</p>
      <p sl="de">If any Member State considers its language so important that it should be used for every patent applicable in Europe, then it needs to take a consistent line and have a legally binding translation of these patents produced in the relevant language. However, it should also pay for this itself. That is my final point, which I hope will help to clarify this discussion.</p>

They must therefore be protected in every way and in every form. I value the fact that the European Parliament is engaged on this matter, and I am very happy to be able to take part in the vote on this issue. Nevertheless, ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions’, as they say. In other words, it is not enough to have the good will to make good law that would really facilitate the work of businesses and shield them from unfair competition from competitors making copies that cost less because they do not have to bear the burden of the onerous and drawn-out work involved in researching new solutions to various problems. In this case, based on the knowledge I have of the area that I represent, I believe that the language barrier introduced by a patent application is an exorbitant cost for our businesses. I have a provocative question, however. What impact would a trilingual regime have on the work of this Parliament? The budget amount devoted to translation and interpretation speaks volumes more than any reply. I have no choice but to vote against.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am delighted that the Council has agreed that 12 Member States will use the enhanced cooperation mechanism to push ahead the creation of a unitary EU patent. This project has been on the table for more than 10 years and has regrettably been plagued by divisions among the Member State governments. The lack of legal certainty and the high costs associated with the current system whereby patents have to be validated separately in each Member State is strangling the Internal Market's potential for development, innovation and growth. Currently, it costs 10 times more to obtain a European patent that is valid in just half of the Member States than it does in the USA. Half of these costs are associated with translation. A more streamlined approach is essential for the Union to remain competitive. This EU-wide patent makes sense! I urge progress to be made in finalising the legal arrangements as soon as possible and express the hope that in future, all Member States will see the imperative of being part of this system.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We often talk in this Chamber about the progress and development of new technologies, while the procedure for patenting inventions in the European Union is one of the most expensive in the world. The costs incurred by inventors are too high and procedures are too complicated. There is also no doubt that a decision on the EU patent has been blocked in the Council. In this situation, the Treaty of Lisbon gives Member States the right to set in motion an enhanced cooperation procedure. The ideal situation would be to reach a compromise on the question of patents at the level of all Member States, but I think a 20-year wait is long enough. I do realise that using the enhanced cooperation mechanism gives rise to many fears. Let us remember, however, that to use it, specific conditions have to be met, and that applications are always considered individually in accordance with the subject of each application. I think, too, that enhanced cooperation can become an instrument which opens the way to further negotiations while also giving greater guarantee of success. I would also like to emphasise that at the present time, we are speaking only in the context of procedure and not of anything related to patents themselves. Nothing has been decided yet. We have a new round of negotiations before us. This is only the beginning of work on the structure of the EU patent and the linguistic regime which is causing so much controversy. Therefore, I hope all of us will be fruitful and persevering in our work, so that the final result will satisfy all interested parties.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we are talking here about the safety of food for humans and the safety of feed for animals. These are, obviously, top priorities for the European Union. Needless to say, this is an important piece of legislation and one which will hopefully never, or never again, have to be applied, because this is about radioactive contamination. The highest safety standards are therefore called for.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The current standards and regulations have been in place for at least 20 years. Meanwhile, the constitutional and social contexts have evolved radically. We therefore need a number of adjustments. It is these improvements which, hopefully, this House will adopt tomorrow and which, let us hope, the other institutions will take into account.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, it is essential – and I hope that the Commissioner shortly will be able to take note of what I am saying – that the Commission should play a key role in such emergencies, and not the Council. It is in the interest of all citizens, Commissioner, that the situation after a nuclear accident is managed by the Commission, given that this quite clearly transcends the interests of individual national governments.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The current regulation, to which I have just referred, was therefore laid down ​​in the immediate wake of the Chernobyl crisis. That was in 1986. It must therefore be updated and brought in line with the new institutional environment within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that the Commission should update established standards to take account of technological progress, and has done that on the basis of consultation with experts, experts in the field of public health and experts in the field of food safety. That goes without saying, but has not been spelled out as such in the current regulation. We are therefore proposing to make explicit provision for this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this context, we explicitly ask the Commission to publish a report next year on the adequacy of the standards as they currently stand, on whether it is desirable, possibly, to do some more work on what is known as the list of minor foodstuffs and on whether it is still appropriate to maintain that list any longer.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My third point, Commissioner, Mr President, concerns the definition of baby food, which is obviously a very delicate matter and one which should be improved. The current text has not really been adjusted to the recent European food regulations and it is essential that we intervene in this text. That is a proposal we are going to present to the plenary tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fourthly, Parliament has proposed to provide compensation to any farmers who might be affected by such an incident. No explicit provision has yet been made to that effect. We ask the Commission, and we will do so tomorrow by an oral amendment, to consider this and, if it so wishes, to come up with a proposal.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Last but not least, there is the question of the legal basis. Commissioner, this Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs has unanimously found that this question should come under Article 168(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. After all, this is about – and here I am quoting the Treaty – ‘measures … which have as their direct objective the protection of public health’, end of quote. This, of course, is a fundamental change, because it means that we will have to adjust the codecision procedure, rather than resort to consultation on the basis of the Euratom Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are assuming that the Council and the Commission will take this into serious account, in the interest of all Europeans, and that they will move with us in this direction.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, firstly, please accept the apologies of Mr Šefčovič and Mr Oettinger, who are otherwise engaged and who have asked me to represent them. It is on their behalf that I should like to thank Mr Belet, your rapporteur, for having highlighted important aspects resulting from the need to strengthen health protection measures in the event of the radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to point out that the Commission’s proposal for a recast of Council Regulation No 3954/87 contains only one provision subject to review. It is a recital in the preamble added to justify an existing provision in the regulation, namely, the reservation of implementing powers by the Council. All the other provisions, ladies and gentlemen, have been submitted for codification and therefore remain unchanged in the proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is therefore unable to accept, and I say this very sincerely, the amendments tabled in the Belet report. There are two reasons for this: the first is of an institutional nature, and the second relates to substance. The first reason concerns the need for strict compliance with the agreement on the use of the recasting procedure concluded between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Given this interinstitutional agreement and the very logic of recasting, the codified parts of a recast proposal cannot be subject to amendment, except in truly exceptional circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The aim is to provide a tool for, among other things, ensuring consistency when changes have to be made. Strict compliance with this agreed rule is an important condition for ensuring interinstitutional balance and the Commission’s right of initiative.</p>
      <p sl="fr">An institution’s failure to comply with the interinstitutional agreement would actually make it impractical to use this legislative technique and would deprive the institutions of an important tool for achieving the ‘better regulation’ objective that has been set as part of the objective of increasing transparency for the benefit of the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second reason relates to substance. The first amendment adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy concerns the legal basis. Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty would be replaced by Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Most of the other amendments relate to this change of legal basis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission believes that this amendment to the legal basis is unjustifiable. It would even contradict the principle contained in Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty, which is that, where this Treaty contains specific provisions regulating a particular subject, it shall take precedence over the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, the validity of Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty was confirmed by the Court in its ruling C-70/88. Chapter 3 of the Euratom Treaty and, more specifically, Articles 31 and 32 thereof, also regulates issues pertaining to the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I must mention at this point the established case-law of the Court, which holds that, and I quote: ‘The rules regarding the manner in which the Community institutions arrive at their decisions are laid down in the Treaty and are not at the disposal of the Member States or of the institutions themselves’. Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty is the only objectively justifiable legal basis for this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those are the legal constraints, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and it was on the basis of those legal constraints that the Commission concluded that it wished to reject the amendments tabled in Mr Belet’s report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is what I wished to say on behalf of Mr Šefčovič and Mr Oettinger.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, radioactivity is something of a mysterious topic and one about which people generally have reservations. What they are afraid of, in particular, is the fact that, although radiation cannot be seen or felt, it can cause great harm to living beings.</p>
      <p sl="sl">However, it also has many positive characteristics, which is why it is used in both medicine and research, for research into materials, for sterilisation and for power generation.</p>
      <p sl="sl">If we are to take advantage of such benefits, we obviously need to respond properly to people’s fears and we need to ensure their safety. Our rapporteur, Mr Belet, made an excellent job of that when he drafted amendments to the regulation which addresses contamination of food and feed in case of nuclear accidents.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I congratulate him on these amendments and I sincerely hope that the Commission will change its opinion and that it will pay greater attention to what our rapporteur has said. I also hope that the Council will take more seriously Parliament’s efforts in this regard, although I am very saddened and concerned about the fact that the representative of the Council is no longer present. I wonder whether this is a sign of ignorance of the European Parliament’s opinion on the situation in the field of nuclear energy.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I believe that the Council and the Commission will have to take into account the democratic development which has been in evidence since the adoption of the Euratom Treaty, that is, from somewhere around 1958, and pay more attention to what acts Parliament is adopting in the field of nuclear energy. Otherwise, we might have to open Pandora’s box, or the Euratom Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, nuclear energy, as well as the whole area of the technology for producing isotopes in experimental reactors for medicinal and other purposes, including the production of sensory measurement devices and sterilisation, requires appropriate safety standards to be developed. Among other things, this concerns the use of safe foodstuffs, animal feedingstuffs and medicines after they have been irradiated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In today’s world, the risk or likelihood of a radiological emergency is indeed very small, but it should always be made as small as possible. Accidents at reactors, including the Chernobyl accident, resulted in far more stringent criteria of protection from the effects of ionising radiation, but, as was later found, those effects proved to be much less significant than had been predicted. A minimal contamination of soil also occurred due to radioactive fallout, which contributed to a small growth in the radioactivity of forest and agricultural foodstuffs obtained from the affected areas. However, it would seem that this was an overreaction and that the area from which the population was resettled was too large. Villages inside the contaminated zone in Belarus which were abandoned are now being populated again. Some experts are saying that there is even some evidence of hormesis, a beneficial effect caused by the therapeutic action of high energy radiation below, of course, a certain dose threshold. However, it is a linear approach to the action of radioactivity, not a threshold approach, which has resulted in this quasi-administrative treatment of these matters rather than a scientific one. The logical consequence of this is to restrict radiation exposure to doses even lower than naturally occurring levels, which means the levels of radiation to which we are always exposed. This is economically absurd. For in any case, every year on average, we absorb a dose of around 2.4 millisieverts, which, after around 70 years of life, adds up to a dose of around 200 millisieverts. Medical investigation is therefore needed to study the simultaneous action of the dose from contamination following a radiation emergency and the much higher dose resulting from natural radiation, including that of volcanic origin. In the first case, this mainly concerns foodstuffs and the effect on the thyroid (iodine), bones (strontium) and muscles (caesium), while in the second case, it concerns the effect on skin and the lungs (radon).</p>

    <intervention id="1-118-000" speaker_id="28477" name="Fiona Hall" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, this debate on permitted levels of radioactivity in food is timely, because this April will be the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. Many of us will remember how anxious members of the public were at that time and just how long the radioactive contamination lasted in certain places, such as the English Lake District, where soil conditions and heavy rainfall caused the ground to be contaminated for many years.</p>
      <p sl="de">So it is very important to have in place a system which will give the greatest possible reassurance to members of the public in the event of a nuclear accident. That is why we need a different legal basis and a panel of experts broadened to include independent scientific experts on public health and food safety. This is not just a technical subject that can be left to nuclear boffins. It is of much wider public concern.</p>
      <p sl="de">Similarly, it is essential that the levels of permitted radiation are set in a way that means food is safe to be consumed by people of all ages. Can you imagine the stress that would be caused if advice went out that said that carrots, for instance, could be safely eaten by adults and yet not by children? We need clear guidelines that everyone can have confidence in. I therefore believe that we should follow the US model here and set the maximum effective dose limit at one microsievert per year for everybody. It is in any case high time that the levels in the annexes were reviewed, because they do not take account of changes in diet and cultural preferences. For example, cassava is a staple food for many people, not a minor substance. So the Commission needs to submit a full report on maximum permitted levels.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belet, for the very consensual approach that he has adopted on this report. I hope the Commission will bear in mind that Parliament is remarkably united on this dossier.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the reason we are discussing these proposals from the Commission is that the previous regulation lapsed in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="de">As I worked on this proposal, I was reminded how, in the mid-1980s, I worked with my predecessor from the Green Party here in Parliament, Mrs von Blottnitz, on the fall-out of the Chernobyl disaster. One of the biggest problems after the Chernobyl accident was a lack of transparency and the failure of comprehensive democratic controls. To be honest, I find it astonishing that we now find ourselves having to take an almost defensive line of argument because we cannot consider this issue on the basis of the Euratom regulations alone, but that we also have to consider consumer protection, protection for the population in the event of major accidents in nuclear power plants, based on the rules of the European Treaty, so that we have complete control and a say in the final outcome. I would like to call once again on Mr Barnier, who is from France, to ensure that things change here. At the time, France acted as if there was no problem and the radioactive clouds would somehow take a detour around its territory. This was a shame, as people in France have become aware in retrospect.</p>
      <p sl="de">Otherwise, I agree with Mrs Hall that we should follow the example of the United States by adopting a very conservative approach to the issue of regulation: limit values are not set for young people and the elderly, for the strong and the weak, but purely on the basis of what children can tolerate, so that the lowest possible limit values are applicable in the event of an accident. The recommendations in the United States are ten times lower than those published today by the European Commission, based on the advice from Euratom. I believe that you really should follow the lead provided here by myself and Mrs Hall.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I also would like to start by supporting those of my fellow Members who agree that, when we talk about radioactive contamination of food or the soil, we are talking about a public health problem. This is basically the central question. To begin with, the impact of these problems of excessive radioactive contamination is felt in health terms, particularly through an increase in cases of cancer and other health problems. It is therefore no use having a legal basis that does not place public health at the centre of the issue.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are all well aware of the importance of this debate. We know this from Chernobyl, yet not only because of Chernobyl. In fact, the importance of Chernobyl has been to show us the magnitude of this problem and the extent to which it can affect people’s lives. It is vital that we learn the lessons that history has to teach us. It is therefore down to us to put preventive measures and regulations in place.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With regard to the proposal that is being presented here, I feel that that the discussion today is clear. Firstly, there is the positive aspect of attempting to bring this regulation into the public health domain, as I have already mentioned. Secondly, we are trying to do away with certain inconsistent and sometimes even arbitrary measures. Thirdly, the intention is to make the updating processes and the decision-making process more transparent and democratic.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The problem of the maximum levels remains, however. We cannot continue to expose the most disadvantaged and most severely affected groups to such high levels. The maximum levels must guarantee the safety of all citizens and we are all well aware of the fact that there are life-threatening cases like these in every country. We have the case of Urgeiriça in Portugal, for example.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is important that we take all this into account.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, we are about to make some important and necessary revisions to the limit values for radioactive contamination of foodstuffs. I, of course, support the proposals that will ensure the best possible protection for citizens, including with regard to medical equipment. Therefore, we clearly must make use of all of the new scientific data that is available and update the limit values accordingly, because it is self-evident that we must have a high level of health protection in the EU. The Treaty of Lisbon enables the adoption of joint measures in the veterinary sector for monitoring safety standards for food and feed with the direct aim of protecting public health, and that is a good thing, because it is extremely worrying that the EU is currently operating with higher limit values than the United States. Radioactive radiation is not less dangerous for people, animals and crops in Europe than it is in the US. In general, this proposal demonstrates how important it is for us to establish clear procedures and to update the old standards. I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for these excellent and important amendments.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regrettably, the Hungarian nation had direct experience of the serious contamination of foodstuffs due to a nuclear accident during the Chernobyl disaster. We must do our utmost to prevent the recurrence of such a dreadful event as the Chernobyl disaster. One element in preventing this is that existing and functioning nuclear power stations must be inspected extremely strictly. With a view to the future, however, I believe that the acceptable solution would be to place the emphasis on renewable energy sources, and not to increase, by any means, but rather reduce the role of nuclear energy in energy supply to the fullest extent possible. In any event, this is indispensable for the European Union from the aspect of energy security. This is the only way we can enhance our own security.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We do not need to support and to take into consideration the atomic energy industry, but only the health of European people, our electors, and what is good and bad for them. I believe that devising an accident scenario for a potential disaster is important, but I see our primary task clearly to be the reduction, and indeed minimisation, of risks. This can be done: all it requires is political will and due determination on the part of my fellow Members as well. We must tackle the roots of the problem and not await a disaster passively.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is a well-known fact that the Chernobyl disaster and the subsequent radioactive contamination of foodstuffs took neighbouring countries unawares in 1986. Thankfully, the European Union learned lessons from this and set down limit values for similar disasters. It is known that radioactive contamination can be significant in some foodstuffs for many years, even though it cannot be seen, tasted or smelled. That is precisely the problem when contaminated foodstuffs, such as forest fruits, from areas that have been exposed to radioactivity for centuries, are not only consumed at local level but also freely sold as safe in otherwise uncontaminated areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">The consequences of radioactive foodstuffs, which are particularly dangerous for pregnant women, the infirm, small children and the elderly, often take years or even decades to come to light. Our current level of knowledge would indicate that there are no levels of radiation that can be classified as harmless with any absolute degree of certainty. Research into the cause of a wide range of new illnesses, such as allergies, is still in its infancy; despite this fact, foodstuffs are still being irradiated. What is more, no one has considered the question of possible interaction with genetic engineering.</p>
      <p sl="de">If people in sensitive categories still cannot safely eat large quantities of indigenous mushrooms a full 25 years after Chernobyl, surely the time has come not only to shut down nuclear power stations, but also to put a stop to all nuclear testing. In the final analysis, all of this is pointless if checks on foodstuffs in and around contaminated regions do not really work.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I think that to achieve an appropriate level of health protection for European citizens in the event of radioactive contamination and to give democratic legitimacy to the adoption of this regulation, safety standards must be established to protect the health of workers and of the general public so as to ensure that they are applied in all Member States, in accordance with the Union’s decisions. Member States are also responsible for monitoring compliance with the levels laid down for protection against radioactive contamination in this regulation, in particular, through the surveillance of the safety standards for both foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, as well as through monitoring environmental parameters. This will guarantee compliance with the maximum permitted levels, safety and the management of radioactive contamination risks.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, given its gravity and cross-border nature, a nuclear disaster or any other radiation emergency clearly requires coordination and pooling of efforts and the establishment of a set of common procedures, with a view to containing and minimising the effects on people and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This need for coordination also extends to the establishment of maximum tolerable levels of contamination in foodstuffs. However, we cannot accept the argument that, in order to serve the interests of the citizens better through improved management of post-disaster situations, we need to limit the Member States’ involvement and room for manoeuvre. On the contrary, it is the Member States themselves that hold the responsibility for safeguarding and protecting the health of their citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is also particularly true in emergency situations, and therefore they must be able to adopt stricter levels of protection if they so wish. That must, in all respects, depend on their ability to adopt emergency measures, in order to safeguard the health of people and the environment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, there are things that I can say as a politician and as a citizen, and things that I must say from a legal point of view, on behalf of the Commission. Mrs Harms, you mentioned the fact that I am French, but I am going to go further than that. I happen to have taken an interest in these issues for a very long time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I had to deal with these contaminated soil issues when I was France’s Environment Minister. I believe that I was even one of the few ministers in 1993 and 1994 to have gone to Chernobyl and spent 17 seconds under the sarcophagus. I have not forgotten my visit to Pripyat, a ghost town, where curtains are still up at the windows and children’s toys are still lying about. I have not forgotten that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As a French politician, I worked on an environmental safety initiative in Europe. I even wrote a book, an atlas of major risks in the world, describing all the risks of contamination, especially nuclear contamination, in those places in which there is an inappropriate culture of risk. Therefore, these are issues that interest me, Mrs Harms. I was also the French Agriculture Minister not so long ago. Human safety and human health, the protection of the general public and consumers, and animal health, which is also important, are all subjects that interest me, and I can understand why, at this late hour, the MEPs are being attentive and vigilant with regard to them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, as I said to Mr Belet, I have personally listened carefully to the concerns that you have unanimously expressed and I will relay them to the Commission President and to my colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That, then, is what I am able to tell you; it is what I have just told you and what I am committed to. Then, there is what I have to tell you from a legal point of view, as well as the two points on which the Commission position, which consists of a legal assessment by our service and by my colleagues, Mr Šefčovič and Mr Oettinger, is based.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those two points are, may I remind you, firstly, that the Euratom Treaty contains the appropriate legal basis for the health protection rules regarding radioactive contamination – and those rules take precedence – and, secondly, that the interinstitutional agreement on recasting must be adhered to by the three institutions – and naturally I say that on behalf of the Commission. Those are the points on which the Commission based its assessment and its position as a College in calling for the rejection of these amendments.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, I have every respect for you, particularly because of your experience from your visit to Chernobyl at the time and obviously, also because of your expertise in agriculture, but allow us, as the European Parliament, fundamentally to oppose the vision commonly shared by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You have referred to judgments of the European Court of Justice in other cases. Now, that is a different matter and we would like to challenge it with the unanimous, consensus-based, vision of Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs that the legal basis should be changed and brought in line with the new institutional context of the Treaty of Lisbon. This is not about a power struggle between the institutions; this is about the health of our citizens, one of the pillars of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We therefore regret the fact that the Commission is persisting in its view. Once again, this is not an accusation against you, on the contrary, but we do think that an enormous opportunity has been missed. That is why Parliament is reserving the right to consider this consolidated dossier in a broader context. Mr President, Commissioner, the existing arrangements in the event of an accident involving radioactive contamination are totally out of touch with the current institutional situation. The proposals which we, the European Parliament, will be tabling here tomorrow, and which will hopefully be adopted with a large majority, provide a fundamental improvement to the existing legislation, which really is no longer adequate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I will give you a concrete example, Commissioner, if I may have another moment of your attention: we are explicitly asking that the Commission evaluate the standards in the annex; we are asking for an evaluation carried out by public health and food safety experts. These rules, Commissioner, are ones that date back to the late 1980s, when you visited Chernobyl. The review clause that we, as Parliament, will be demanding here tomorrow will come none too soon.

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-132-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, honourable Members, the question before us is ‘How does the Commission intend to help small businesses find the finance they need for growth?’ In the Europe 2020 strategy, the Commission promised to concentrate on growth based on knowledge and innovation. Entrepreneurs who start up new businesses and launch new ideas produce jobs and create growth. We must accordingly direct our efforts so that such businesses can have the necessary resources at their disposal, obviously including finance, in particular, the means for innovation. In fact, I shall never tire of repeating: there is no growth, there is no competitiveness, if there is no innovation.</p>
      <p sl="it">First and foremost, the Commission intends in its proposals to place the emphasis on research and innovation. As shown by the Green Paper adopted by the European Commission last week on future research and innovation funding, the Commission will be trying to simplify the management of these programmes by making use of joined-up instruments. Joined-up instruments of this sort will simplify management and relationships with our partners and will also serve as a guarantee for greater transparency in the market. Simplification and flexibility will therefore be the key words for our work in future, which will focus on encouraging growth and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
      <p sl="it">Programmes and common funding must, in fact, be easily accessible to all European businesses, above all, to those who have the potential for growth. I am convinced that, in order to achieve this objective, programmes for SMEs must be reorganised in a single common programme for growth and competitiveness, taking into account the experience that has been obtained to date, particularly with a view to providing for the kind of flexibility needed to respond to changes in the markets and in our economies over the next programming period.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, in its proposals, the Commission intends to place emphasis on funding instruments, that is, to pass from a culture based on grants to one more oriented towards lending to businesses. Obviously, this approach will favour those who are able to produce a well-grounded business plan. One achievement we can take as a starting point is surely that represented by the guarantees and investments in venture capital provided for in the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP). These instruments have met with great success. To date, we have helped more than 100 000 SMEs, and by the end of the programme, we shall have helped over 300 000.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should, moreover, like to stress that the first generation of Union investments in venture capital comprises 98% of capital investment, which becomes even more relevant when one considers that with scarcely 2% of funding, we have been able to help many European SMEs to grow. Besides, another important aspect is the fact that this is not a question of bureaucratic instruments. They are, in fact, available from banks and venture capital funds. In short, there is no need to ask Brussels for them. We know that SMEs appreciate the flexibility of these instruments and the fact that they are easily accessible.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should also like to emphasise that a few days ago, the European Council invited the Commission to put in place an EU-wide venture capital scheme. The Commission intends to do so. In fact, we share the Council’s concerns as regards the gaps in the venture capital markets. Moreover, we are perfectly aware of the usefulness of loan guarantee schemes, which help a great number of small businesses. I can assure you that the Commission is convinced that loan guarantees are necessary, whether at the European or at regional level. This is why the Commission will be representing a coherent series of instruments intended for SMEs. We are therefore inviting Member States, who are codecision partners as regards the application of structural funds, to join us in this task. This is what has been done as regards future financial programming.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should, however, like to clarify the fact that in the meantime, the Commission has not been idle. On 28 October last year, I launched the SME Finance Forum, with the aim of monitoring the progress of SME funding, promoting best practice and encouraging new solutions. This standing forum provides a regular opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises to meet lending institutions. The market situation and the legal framework under which SMEs access funding are being kept under review. There have also been discussions on ways of developing the European market for mezzanine financing and I am pleased to let you know that we are making progress from this point of view.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, it is equally important to have another look at the regulatory framework. Here, I should like to record a special ‘thank you’ to my colleague, Michel Barnier, whose communication ‘Towards a Single Market Act’ proposes important initiatives that make our legislation more effective, including the legislation on the single market for venture capital. Our common objective is, in fact, precisely this: to foster the single market and to bring about the best conditions for growth, competitiveness and entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as the capital requirements for banks – ‘Basel III’ – are concerned, which are also within Commissioner Barnier’s remit, the Commission will make legislative proposals in June 2011. The Commission’s proposal will include a thorough appraisal of the micro-economic and macro-economic effects of such measures, which will ensure that our proposals are well thought out, in terms of their timescale and impact, and also take into account what is happening in other parts of the world.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, it is incumbent on the budgetary authority, the European Parliament and the Council to decide how to use the limited resources available at the European level. In this period when finances are restricted, it is clear that it is becoming ever more important to spend these resources more wisely. I am convinced that the financial instruments will contribute to raising the European Union’s resources and mobilising private investment.</p>
      <p sl="it">You can be sure that the Commission will continue to work to make sure that our proposals always focus on the importance that the development of SMEs has for the future of Europe, convinced as we are that all the work that will have to be done in the next few months to emerge finally from the crisis, including the restructuring of major industries, will have to take account of the role that small and medium-sized enterprises can play. In my opinion, only they will be able to create new jobs, and hence cope with the social aspects of the financial crisis that we have faced, and they will naturally form an important springboard for initiating the new phase following the economic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Commissioner Tajani for his statement. We have chosen to address this matter today because it is more important than ever to focus on providing finance for our small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe. There can be no doubt that SMEs’ limited access to financing is a major barrier to the creation of growth and to new enterprises starting up, and this situation has become worse during the current economic crisis. It has become much more difficult to obtain adequate financing from Europe’s banks. Europe’s SMEs are highly dependent on bank financing – in comparison with American enterprises, for example.</p>
      <p sl="da">In addition, the Basel III rules are about to be implemented; in other words; we have a new Capital Requirements Directive that is to be implemented. There is a risk that this will result in even greater difficulties when it comes to the provision of venture capital for our small and medium-sized enterprises. It is worrying that the increasingly capital- and risk-sensitive banking sector is now demanding higher collateral security and higher risk premiums. Both of these will result in insufficient financing and lost business opportunities, which again, ultimately, means the loss of jobs.</p>
      <p sl="da">Europe needs to become more competitive. We therefore need to strengthen those EU instruments that can help to increase investment, innovation and the development of SMEs, and I would like to call for an increase in budgetary resources for the financing of innovation and for the instruments that are already in place. The Commission must, of course, ensure that, in the next generation of programmes, much greater importance is attached to mezzanine financing, and that greater coherence is created within the SME support measures that are already in place, in other words, programmes like the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), the structural funds, the Seventh Framework Programme for research, and so on. Therefore, it just remains for me to say that this is an issue on which there will be a great deal of focus in this House in the coming months.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, this evening I, too, would like to speak in my own language so that the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can follow my comments. At the time, the legal package on small and medium-sized enterprises set three main targets for itself. The first was to help SMEs with greater revenues, by getting into European markets and by placing innovative products on the market. The second was to reduce costs by cutting red tape. An excellent example of this is the Services Directive. Our third target was to simplify and facilitate access to financing instruments for the SME sector.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Within the European Union, small and medium-sized enterprises produce one third of GDP. If we calculate in this way, the SME sector also contributes an amount of about one third to the European budget. In contrast, if we look at the proportion the SMEs represent in the European Union’s budget, we cannot be satisfied. We can see that by the end of 2010, about 100 000 SMEs received some form of bank guarantee within the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), which is a huge number, but for 23 million enterprises, this is very little. This is likely to grow by 200 000 SMEs, but even then, this is little compared to 23 million. We have managed to mobilise venture capital of 1.3 billion, but again, if I compare this to the 23 million enterprises and their economic values, it is very, very little. We must succeed, Commissioner, in devising a procedural system within the European Union which, on the one hand, enables the use of instruments allocated at the EIB in a much easier and much more effective manner than at present. On the other hand, we must succeed in ensuring, through encouraging annual reports, that the Member States themselves support the small and medium-sized enterprise sector not only with words but with deeds.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We wish to ask you, Commissioner, through our request proposed on behalf of five political groups, through our letter in which we turned to you, not to neglect this entrepreneurial sphere, as this is the entrepreneurial sphere which is trying to survive having been put in the most difficult situation after the austerity packages. This is where an upsurge in growth can first be expected and this is where an increase in employment can be expected. We will provide our support for this in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission has every reason to be ambitious in view of the fact that you, and we too, are facing a very major challenge. We have 20 million small and medium-sized enterprises, which together constitute 99% of all European enterprises. We often say that Europe’s small businesses are the heart of the European economy. That is true, but it must not mean that small businesses are not allowed to grow big. We therefore need financing facilities, which my fellow Members have mentioned and which you touched on yourself, Mr Tajani. Among other things, we should utilise the financing facilities that are already available, and I would advocate the greater utilisation of the structural funds, for example.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As Mr Bendtsen mentioned, the problems faced by European small and medium-sized enterprises have increased. Parliament has created a large number of rules within the financial market, most of which have been necessary. However, these rules have increased the loan costs for small businesses. We ought to be aware of this, and we ought to be careful when we propose different rules. We should, in any case, be aware of what it will ultimately cost.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Mr Bendtsen also mentioned the Basel criteria, with which we are all familiar. Commissioner Tajani, you spoke about simplicity and flexibility and you believe that these attributes should be reflected in the EU’s programmes and financing facilities. You want us to do away with bureaucracy and complicated procedures. However, do you really believe that this is what small businesses and their employees think that the European Union is doing? Is it not rather the case that we are creating more bureaucracy and complicated procedures? In this regard, I believe that we need a complete change of attitude.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As I said, we have 20 million small businesses in Europe, but we also have over 20 million unemployed in Europe. We know that social exclusion and poverty are increasing, and in order to deal with this we, and the Commission too, must be able to act in a resolute way to provide financing facilities for the small and medium-sized enterprises, because that is where the jobs will be created in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are talking about a sector of the economy which is of absolutely crucial significance, because taken together, small and medium-sized enterprises are, in fact, the European Union’s biggest employer. They provide many more jobs than do the larger firms. Furthermore, SMEs, which are often family-run businesses, were worst affected by the economic crisis. I will go even further and say that the social costs of the loss of strength in this sector are of absolutely fundamental significance. Of course, it may be that the largest firms and the biggest industrial lobbies are more effective in speaking up for themselves, but SMEs should be protected, because this is, in fact, protection of the citizens and the taxpayers of EU Member States. I have one further comment – I would like to emphasise very strongly that the EU’s Member States should not shift responsibility for everything onto the European Union as such. They should themselves take care of SMEs, but to a large extent they are not doing so. Here, I agree with what Mrs Herczog said.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few years, and the global financial crisis has played a role too, it has become ever more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to obtain loans and to have easy access to credit when it is essential.</p>
      <p sl="it">The instruments that have been employed so far by the European Union within the financial framework 2007-2013 have proven to be seriously deficient in some areas, such as the scarcity of resources and coverage, the existence of heavy administrative constraints, let alone the fact that they are dispersed over multiple and different lines of action. With the new financial framework, we must focus on simplifying the rules for small and medium-sized enterprises – rules that have been a major obstacle for smaller businesses in particular – and think, for example, about setting up a point of single contact for access to European funding.</p>
      <p sl="it">It will be necessary to incentivise recourse to new funding instruments that will facilitate access to credit, provide precise loan guarantee schemes and give priority to real assistance in the difficult initial phase of development, especially as regards largely innovative and technological businesses. We must therefore try specifically to make the route as easy as possible for a sector that employs over 100 million people and is, without doubt, the most powerful engine for growth and development.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, I would go along with the general view I sense in this House regarding small and medium-sized enterprises and give my wholehearted support to what has just been said, in other words, that the businesses that have been hardest hit by the economic crisis are SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I am also in agreement with Mr Czarnecki, who said that these are most often small, family-run businesses from which families earn the bulk of their income. When a major corporation is hit – because they, too, suffered during the crisis – only their profits suffer. However, when a small business is hit, the family that relies on the business loses a vital source of income.</p>
      <p sl="bg">For these reasons, I would like to say that we should tread carefully when making changes, because both right and left-leaning measures can have a detrimental effect on SMEs, depending on where they are targeted.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I should like to say that simply doling out financial and bank guarantees will not be enough, and that we need greater legislative development – greater regulation of the banking sector, if you like – to secure funding for small businesses, and to finally stop posing the question in terms of some non-existent level playing field – for small businesses can never be equal to big businesses – but to help them to be truly competitive when a big corporation does come along.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Bendtsen because the CIP programme is one of the key pillars for enterprise and for funding in this area. The JEREMIE and JASMINE programmes, as well as the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs, are extremely important in helping people to get to know the markets. I would like to thank Mrs Herczog for her backing for the EIB and for the EIF, the European Investment Fund, and for her call for an increase in the available finances. However, I would call on Commissioner Tajani to ensure that the objectives for 2020 also include a mandatory requirement for a 20% capital base for SMEs. This is something we already require from the banks, so the same should apply to SMEs. This is important for both sectors.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also suggest that a tax on profits should only be imposed when proceeds are taken out of a company. In other words, it should be possible to re-invest profits as equity capital. However, if an entrepreneur or employee takes money out of a company, then this should be taxed in the normal way.</p>
      <p sl="de">One final point that seems particularly important to me is the possibility of writing off debt of not less than EUR 5 000. We believe that a depreciation right should be allowed on profits of up to EUR 5 000. This would provide the best basis for striking a balance between risk capital and equity capital for the orderly financing of loans.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the ‘Think Small First’ principle, which forms the basis of the European Commission’s policies on entrepreneurship, is important. We must not forget that two thirds of jobs in the European Union are created by SMEs. However, in the current crisis, SMEs are having difficulty in accessing loans as banks regard them as risky ventures. Indeed, the promotion of public guarantee schemes in Member States and the provision of access to the guarantees offered by the European Investment Bank group in order to ease the financing restrictions need to be monitored.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We also notice difficulties in providing information about the terms for allocating funds and, in certain cases, even the lack of administrative capacity required locally to mediate access to loans.</p>
      <p sl="ro">During the 2014-2020 period, the European Commission must focus on greater transparency in relations between financiers and business and on access to consultancy services for providing information about the lending platforms and terms available to SMEs. At the same time, it is the European Investment Bank’s duty, as an advocate of EU policies, to offer technical assistance to national and local administrations in order to make it simpler for entrepreneurs to access financing.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is fundamentally important to strengthen the pan-European commitment to support small and medium-sized enterprises, because, as has been said, they have a decisive weight and role in the Union’s social fabric and they are the real providers of economic recovery. In this context, I should like to recall that between 2002 and 2008, with the strong growth they exhibited in 27 countries, they created 9 400 000 new jobs, and already represented the driving force of employment. Today, as a result of the crisis, they have lost a third of the jobs that were created.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is therefore necessary to conceive specific instruments that will give small and medium-sized enterprises back their capacity to produce and create new jobs, because the whole of society will benefit from this. Access to credit is certainly one of the key issues, the one most valued by entrepreneurs. In the first part of 2010, 18% of small and medium-sized enterprises had bank loans refused. In the previous year, the relevant percentage was 12; these data come from a survey carried out by the European Central Bank.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is precisely access to credit, together with administrative simplification and access to markets, that will be among the key priorities set by the Small Business Act, which will be presented in Rome next week by Commissioner Tajani, and which we warmly welcome. I should like finally to mention my origins in a part of Italy – the North East – that has seen enormous development and considerable growth due precisely to an intelligent lending regime, which has been able to go hand in hand with the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises. Let us follow this example.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, I would like to join with my fellow Members in proposing that politicians, Member States and the European Union put small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of their economic recovery efforts.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Ninety-nine per cent of all enterprises in the European Union fall into this category and they generate more than 100 million jobs. What is it then that a small or medium-sized enterprise in the European Union is concerned about? Let us not forget this question in today’s debate.</p>
      <p sl="sl">First of all, such enterprises are concerned about the non-payment of invoices, a lack of payment discipline. Enterprises are receiving no payment for their invoices for 90 or 120 days, or indeed never. The financial and economic crisis has greatly exacerbated this problem and SMEs are the most helpless in the face of these difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We in the European Union have adopted new legislation. Now is therefore the time for Member States to improve their discipline, their payment discipline. That is where it all starts and then moves down the chain.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Secondly, these companies, SMEs, are concerned about finance. Many would not have any financial problems if their invoices were paid. The banks have retreated into their shells and are not serving their purpose. This is why economic growth in the European Union is much smaller than it could be. I support the Commission’s measures advocated by Commissioner Tajani, and I call on the Commission to put small and medium-sized enterprises at the heart of its efforts. Now is the time for us jointly to implement the recommendations of the ‘Small Business Act’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is a good afternoon for the European Parliament and the European Union in terms of the topics we are discussing, which has a real impact on the real economy. We have discussed the Services Directive, the unitary patent and now new instruments to support SMEs. It has been said that SMEs are absolutely vital, and that if each SME created one extra job, then unemployment would cease in Europe. For many of them, creating one extra job would not be too difficult, particularly if they get credit, but the evidence is that they are not able to get credit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Every weekend, I meet business people who cannot get credit, particularly in my country. I met a person last weekend who wanted EUR 4 000 for an SME as cashflow and could not get it. So the situation in my country is chronic. Despite the fact that the ECB has capitalised the banks, it is not being passed on. This certainly must be looked at. It is not good enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have heard the mantra of banks being too big to fail. We should change that to a mantra of SMEs being too important to fail. If we give them the credit and the support, each of them could certainly create one extra job, and one extra job would get us out of the economic recession we are in. It is not too much to ask, and this evening, by discussing the new instruments to support SMEs, we can certainly go a long way in doing that.</p>

Indeed, 23 million European SMEs are expecting positive action from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Another important aspect is also the development of alternative sources of funding. Initiatives must be adopted with the aim of increasing access to the capital market and creating better tax incentives for investors.

      <p sl="lt">I believe you are familiar with the analytical report by the international organisation Bankwatch, which analyses a breakdown of European Investment Bank lending in four Member States. The report shows that hitherto, loans provided by the European Investment Bank were fundamentally only of benefit to the banks themselves, which were allocated EUR 15 billion and given a deadline to find companies that require this support.</p>
      <p sl="lt">There is concern that although money was received from the European Investment Bank, commercial banks tightened bank credits for small enterprises, and the money was mostly used to fund large and prosperous companies.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I believe such a situation shows that in this area, there is a need for far more stringent monitoring and control of commercial banks, and the European Commission must also play a greater role so that this aid is not misused.</p>

It is very clear that the cost, and indeed the availability, of credit remains the single biggest challenge facing the SME sector in Europe, and indeed in my own country of Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many viable businesses continue to have difficulties in accessing affordable credit from the banks. That is unacceptable. I can only speak for my own country, but bearing in mind the support that the SME sector has received from the taxpayer in Ireland, that sector is the engine of growth in the economy. It is the private sector that creates the jobs. All that we in the Commission, Parliament and the Council do is to create an economic atmosphere conducive to investment, and we must continue to do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am delighted that the Commissioner has referred to flexibility and said that access to capital should not be bureaucratic, but he is merely following through on the statement by the President of the Commission in his State of the Union address.

In Portugal, tens of thousands of small, family-run businesses, that is to say, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are closing down in a wide variety of sectors – industry, commerce, services and agriculture – thus increasing unemployment and poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The problems of bank credit, bureaucracy and the difficulty of accessing EU aid, particularly by these micro- and small enterprises, are strangling the economic development of large areas and impeding the growth of employment. A complete change in policy in these areas is therefore required in order to support these SMEs effectively, and the financial system must be urged to provide accessible credit for SMEs, alongside sufficient EU aid.</p>

At the same time, these very enterprises have been overloaded with bureaucratic red tape for decades, also suffering disadvantage when it comes to EU-wide subsidies. On paper, we encounter one SME initiative after another. In practice, however, small and medium-sized enterprises find themselves unable to access capital as a result of the provisions of Basel II, and now Basel III.</p>
      <p sl="de">Innovation is vitally important for the survival of SMEs into the future. However, innovation also requires money and research. Of course, it is commendable that SMEs will receive greater attention in the future under the new EU rules on public procurement and that it will be made easier for them to access EU research funding. However, the fact is that many SMEs may not survive long enough to see these long-discussed measures come to fruition, because they will find themselves choked off by a lack of finance.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I consider it necessary to increase access to good quality information and competent services. I should remind you that, during the plenary last September, the European Commission’s representative stated that in 2011, an online learning platform specifically for SMEs was scheduled to appear on the Internet. The aim of this is to facilitate SMEs’ access to research and development projects and to utilise their results by providing free online training, personalised information and making a communication forum available. Training SME managers in how to use financial instruments may, apart from supporting the relevant procedures and cutting red tape, lead to achieving much more effective results.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Tajani’s speech was most welcome. He laid stress once again on a factor of prime importance: that of small and medium-sized enterprises seen and experienced as a model of production, hence, as a social model, because they form the basic building block when it comes to employment.</p>
      <p sl="it">The economic crisis we are experiencing is not transient but structural, and connected to changes in the markets as another consequence of globalisation. Small and medium-sized enterprises account for 99% of the entire structure of European industry. The draft resolution spotlights certain unavoidable requirements, namely: better information, facilitated access to credit and less red tape, to make the means of access to European Union resources easier to navigate.</p>
      <p sl="it">As the Commissioner himself just confirmed, there is a need for more simplification and flexibility, as well as more resources for innovation and research; the need for the European Commission to develop new guidelines that are clearer and more comprehensible so that small and medium-sized enterprises have easier access to useful information; and a need for a new perspective on lending. At a time of crisis, it is not fair that only small and medium-sized enterprises pay while the banking system continues to make and grow its profits.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is important to ensure that the European Commission’s new framework take account of these requirements, so that the Europe 2020 strategy is more than just an empty shell, and in fact contains instruments appropriate to achieving the objectives that it sets itself.</p>

The free flow of goods means that all businesses have access to a higher number of potential consumers, although they also have to be ready for greater competition. Legislation on the single market needs to be constantly adapted to ensure equal treatment of all firms in the Union. It is essential to monitor Member States’ inclinations to protect their own national industry.</p>

Let us bear in mind that a difficult situation in SMEs affects, first of all, the fortunes of the people who work for them, because they are, to a great extent, family firms. These firms go under only at a later point, so most of them seem to have reacted slowly to the crisis, but this does not mean the crisis has not affected their economic condition.</p>

At present, it is up to us to urge the Member States to speed up the rate at which they transpose the directive into their domestic law (they have 24 months from this October), even if I personally wish that the Member States would put more urgency into transposing a directive that also has a direct effect on opportunities for recovering outstanding debts so that they can be applied to innovation. When the directive enters into force, approximately EUR 180 billion will be released into circulation.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is not enough, however. As far as aid to small and medium-sized enterprises is concerned, on 23 February, the Commission will adopt the revised Small Business Act, which contains a series of important measures, including the point of single contact for access to funding, which will be one of the proposals that we shall be putting to the Member States. What is more, we shall be inviting all Member States and all local authorities to nominate a Mister or Miss SME.</p>
      <p sl="it">On 16 February, I shall be appointing Daniel Calleja, as Deputy Director-General, to a new office in the European Commission. He will be responsible for monitoring and verifying the application of the Small Business Act and acting as a contact point for European SMEs on Commission policy. In the text of the Small Business Act, which, please note, we shall be adopting on the 23rd, all Member States are invited to do likewise, just as we shall be inviting local communities with lawmaking powers to do.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as funding is concerned, the problem of access to outstanding debtor balances, to which we have already referred in the context of the Late Payment Directive, and of access to loans requested or wanted by small and medium-sized enterprises, can only be solved by trying to activate links between lending institutions and business, but also the European Investment Bank. I therefore acknowledge the declarations of those who agree that it is necessary to grow these relationships, as well as to clear the bottlenecks that have, in the past, especially during the crisis, delayed the disbursement of the famous EUR 30 billion intended for small and medium-sized enterprises and which, due to the difficulty in making transfers to national credit institutions, have delayed their receipt by SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="it">I must say that at the first meeting of the SME Finance Forum, attention was paid precisely to this bottleneck that exists between the European Investment Bank and national credit institutions. The sherpas are at work, and at the next meeting, a series of proposals will be put forward to try to facilitate access to credit by small businesses.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are, of course, working to simplify specific issues already, and what follows is one such example. As regards the REACH Regulation, I have had translated into every European Union language the application rules for a regulation that is rather technical. This has been a strong signal to small and medium-sized enterprises that they do not have to employ an expert in technical English or in chemical technology. In point of fact, we have virtually abolished the registration fee: we have achieved a 90% reduction for REACH registration by micro-enterprises and a 60% reduction for small enterprises. These are some of the specific things that also relate to simplification.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, the test for small and medium-sized enterprises, which came into being with the Small Business Act, continues to exist. We shall continue with it and apply it strictly. The competitiveness test, known as the fitness check, which we introduced with the paper on industrial policy, which also affects competitiveness and existing legislation, will clearly and certainly also help small and medium-sized businesses. I must congratulate Mr Rübig, and I am delighted at the invitation and the support of Parliament to commit to increased funding for the next CIP II.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, I can only assure you of my commitment, inasmuch as I agree with everything that has been said. As I have always averred whenever I have had the opportunity to state my views on SME policy, I can confirm that I shall make it my absolute priority to contrive that bureaucratic barriers, access to credit and a policy of support for small and medium-sized businesses will be the principal agenda of the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship in the next few years, that is, until the end of the current Parliament. For me, the support of the European Parliament is of fundamental importance also because, as I said at the beginning of my reply, there is a perfect identity of views between you and me.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is widely accepted in the European Union that SMEs need better, more direct access to finance. As highlighted in the 2020 Communication, the financial crisis has halved Europe’s growth potential. The impact on real economic activity could be said to be more pronounced in Europe, due to SMEs high reliance on bank loans. The way out of this crisis for SMEs would be to further support and develop equity markets and small innovative enterprises. The establishment of an SME finance forum last May signalled a positive move towards improving SMEs’ financial prospectus and their future viability in Europe. I believe that over 1.8 million SMEs benefited from loan guarantees in 2009. Let us not forget that SMEs are the bread and butter of the European economy. It is crucial that adequate bank lending is returned to normal levels as soon as possible. Europe must work towards creating a viable venture capital market as a priority.</p>

      <p sl="pl">As a result of the crisis in the financial markets, small and medium-sized enterprises have suffered reduced access to finance. Particular difficulty in obtaining financial support is being experienced by new start-ups and innovative enterprises, whose operations are considered to be risky. Economic recovery will, in large measure, depend on the possibilities for development open to SMEs which, after all, account for almost 99% of all businesses. Therefore, I welcome today’s initiative regarding the revision of EU instruments to support SME finance in the next programming period. In particular, enterprises working on innovative methods should be given access to new forms of finance. I think, too, that simplifying administrative procedures and existing regulations will contribute to increased effectiveness in the management of European programmes created with SMEs in mind, and also to significant savings for SMEs themselves, which will spend less time on administration and more on the projects on which they are working.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I am very pleased with the motion for a resolution and the debate on the revision of EU instruments to support SME finance. Support for SMEs is important because these firms are important for the present and future of Europe. SMEs are of key significance for maintaining our competitiveness, for recovery from the crisis, for creating new jobs and for increasing innovativeness in the European economy. We do need to support SME finance, but the European Union can and should also take other steps to support this sector. I refer to the need to reduce administrative and bureaucratic burdens. SMEs must be able to operate without hindrance and to act quickly. In the United States, there are places where starting a business takes 10 minutes. If we want to use Europeans’ entrepreneurial potential, we have to make it easier for them to carry out their business and to free the European market from the restrictions which mean, today, that we are not making use of all opportunities for development. SMEs represent an economic model which is very effective in and beneficial to social development. Most poor and developing countries do not have this sector, or it is very weak there. This is indirect evidence of the great significance of this sector for the entire economy and the quality of life in particular countries. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="et">It is good to see that the European Commission is dealing with the reviewal of EU resources to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially given the following programming period. However, it must be said that SMEs have required additional help over the last two and a half years in particular, because many of them have had liquidity problems due to the recession. To put it plainly, the banks refused to give loans to SMEs, or did so with extremely high interest rates, which further aggravated the situation of those enterprises. Both in Estonia and in the European Union as a whole, SMEs account for 99% of all businesses, and micro-enterprises account for 83% of all businesses in Estonia and approximately 92% of all businesses in the EU in total. For this reason, it is important that financial means should be available for this particular majority, especially during difficult crisis years. I sincerely hope that both the European Union and SMEs will shortly set the economy on an upward curve and that we will be better prepared for any future crisis. The current economic crisis, preceded by the financial crisis, was greatly amplified by the decreased liquidity of SMEs as a result of the position of the banks in the economic crisis. Over two thirds of business people work in SMEs and two thirds of additional revenue is created by these businesses. This must not be forgotten, and we must therefore stand up for the wellbeing of these enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="cs">EU support instruments for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) must, above all, be flexible and as unbureaucratic as possible. Banks continue to be unwilling to finance riskier business plans, including newly-established firms and innovative products. Access to funding is therefore one of the greatest obstacles confronting SMEs today. It is therefore necessary to strengthen the various methods of supporting microfinancing for companies, and to secure the better coordination and interlinking of the individual programmes that already exist. However, the complexity, the time and money expended, and the excessive administrative demands in relation to the relatively small sums involved, also present a barrier to availability. I also think that it is important to raise general levels of awareness regarding existing options and instruments for supporting SMEs in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the Commission published the European Union strategy for the Danube region and the associated action plan, which are due to be adopted by the European Council during the EU’s Hungarian Presidency, on 8 December 2010.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Parliament has helped develop the strategy both through its resolution of 20 January 2010 and the activity of its Danube Forum, and will continue to be an active partner as well in implementing and updating it.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union strategy for the Danube region is the result of wide-ranging consultations which saw the participation of local, regional and national authorities, as well as of representatives of civil society, academia and the business sector. They will play an even more significant role in the process of its implementation. The strategy reconfirms the importance of mobility and comodality, as well as of the need to invest in improving navigation and interconnections, in developing multimodal ports and in using new technologies so as to make the Danube cleaner and help remove more quickly the obstacles preventing the free movement of ships.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Completing the TEN-T projects relating to the Danube region, developing tourism and the energy infrastructure, preventing and combating natural disasters and the impact of climate change, as well as cultural and academic exchanges, will yield benefit in the region. Given the complex ecosystems and biodiversity in the Danube region, it is important that, in keeping with the joint statement on the development of inland navigation and environmental protection in the Danube River Basin, integrated project teams and win-win solutions are available both for improving navigation and providing environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We welcome the appointment of the Priority Area Coordinators on 3 February and ask them to devise work programmes and identify the financial resources required, as well as improve cooperation between countries and regions so that we can proceed immediately with the strategy’s implementation. Member States can review their operational programmes and reallocate unused funds for priority projects relating to the Danube region. In addition, the provisions of the future multiannual financial framework should include specific provisions for macro-regional strategies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to end, Mr President, by saying that, bearing in mind the link between the Black Sea and North Sea via the Rhine, the Main Canal and the Danube, we call for the European Union strategy for the Danube region to be extended to the Black Sea region.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European Union strategy for the Danube region is an integrated strategy which will interconnect different European policies, with the focus on the main problems affecting the entire macro-region. The aim of the contribution from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is to improve the transportation of freight by widening the navigable channel, develop the cities along the Danube by increasing port capacity, and develop the necessary terminals and an adequate infrastructure that will support multimodal transport, not to mention encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to access European funds.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to stress the quite specific economic interdependence of the countries in the Danube region and the importance of investments not only in ITC, but also in developing small and medium-sized enterprises and their research departments in order to ensure sustainable growth and efficiency and boost the growth of the green economy. If we want to achieve economic growth and create jobs in the Member States bordering the Danube, we must provide the conditions for the successful implementation of this strategy not only by involving local authorities, but also through public-private partnerships.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Member States must identify priority development areas and prepare relevant projects in good time, making sure that they are integrated projects targeting all the European funds available and, in particular, the opportunities for regional cooperation. In this context, I think that it is essential for us to know exactly what the European Commission’s action plan is for implementing this strategy and the model of governance adopted to this end.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a comprehensive strategy for the Danube region that brings together all the affected regions, their peoples and Member States is a major boost and offers enormous potential for sustained development for the entire river region. Economic and ecological aspects can be balanced in a rational manner that will point the way for the future. Social problems can be resolved together. The biological and cultural diversity of the entire area along the river can be successfully marketed in joint tourism projects. The most important point, however, is that such cooperation should primarily aim to avert destructive flooding. We can all well remember the years when many parts of the region experienced need and misery. That is why it is important for the regions along both the upper and lower parts of the river to collaborate in a joint strategy for the Danube region under the European Union, aiming to sustain the natural character of the river.</p>
      <p sl="de">Which is not to say that innovation and progress are to be abandoned. After all, it is possible to learn from the mistakes of the past, rather than repeating them. That is why the ships need to be adapted to the river, rather than vice versa. We have an enormous opportunity here because we have the technical expertise at our disposal and the potential within the region is huge. This may entail enormous innovation and a worldwide marketing strategy for the entire river region.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this context, it also seems important to me that the European Parliament should correct one item in the Commission’s proposal in its resolution: as in the Baltic region, an important international agreement for joint cooperation on river-related issues already exists; this agreement represents a consensus and has resulted in this joint statement which permits the conservation of the river, while, at the same time, allowing for its development as a transport route for ships. It is very important that the Commission should not go beyond this.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order for this to happen, we need independent experts and, above all, transparency. Experience in the Baltic region has shown that transparency and the involvement of local people play a key role in ensuring that the measures taken in the river area enjoy broad support, that we carry out our work with the future generations in mind, and that such a cooperative approach is successful.</p>
      <p sl="de">It makes a great deal of sense to use the available funds here and to consider whether all of the measures originally planned were correct and how corrective measures can be taken in the interests of rational, ecologically and economically balanced cooperation and development throughout the Danube region.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the macro-regional strategies are, first and foremost, a political instrument representing one of the possible forms of regional cooperation. They should serve as an instrument for the effective exploitation of existing initiatives, programmes, financial instruments, cooperation platforms and institutions. The macro-regional strategies should also provide a framework for the better functioning of the Union and its internal market, as well as a platform for corporate networking. They should assist in the rationalisation and better structuring of access to tenders, which is an issue confronting Europe’s larger cross-border geographical units. However, both tenders and instruments must be clearly defined.</p>
      <p sl="cs">From the perspective of our group, the Group of European Conservatives and Reformists, it is vitally important for the concept of macro-regional strategies at the EU level to be resolved in a structured and systematic way in relation to other policies. It is therefore desirable to select a strategic approach to this issue, particularly regarding the number of strategies, and the concentration and nature of the projects and administration.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We support the concept of macro-regional strategies, including the Danube one, on condition that the Council will continue to observe the approved principles (the ‘3 neutralities’): budgetary and financial neutrality, legislative neutrality and institutional neutrality.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The role and future of macro-regional strategies may be related to the debate over the future use of European funds, although in our view, it is unnecessary for today’s debate to extend into a discussion on the future architecture of the cohesion policy and the anticipation of potential financial allocations designated for individual states in the coming financial perspective. The macro-regional strategies should not have an influence on the future architecture of the cohesion policy, except for supra-national cooperation, or on financial allocation for individual objectives.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what exactly are we talking about when we speak of the European Danube strategy and mention the Danube region? This region connects 14 European countries and 115 million European citizens. Perhaps it is no exaggeration to say that the European Danube strategy is the strategy of the future; not simply the future of Central Europe, perhaps not even the future of the European Union, but the future of Europe in a broad sense. It does not simply look back, does not merely seek to solve the problems we brought with us from the past, but it seeks to create a recipe for cooperation which can tackle the tasks of the future. In devising the strategy for the Danube region, we employed a method last used long ago through which we have perhaps really managed to take the European Union, the initiative of the European Union, close to the citizens of Europe, as it took a very long time for the Commission to develop its concept announced in December last year by listening to and considering the opinions of an extremely large number of stakeholders.</p>
      <p sl="hu">A similarly very, very important question is that the countries and regions of the Danube region, the people living here, were affected severely by the crisis, the economic and financial crisis, so the strategy for the Danube region must be a strategy of recovery from the crisis which must have increasing employment at its centre in any event. I believe that all of us here in the European Parliament can welcome the approach of the current Hungarian Presidency of the European Council which considers the strategy of a developing, increasingly prosperous Danube region, on the one hand, and the strategy of an inhabitable Danube region, on the other, to be extremely important. From this aspect, it is vital for the realisation of the strategy of cooperation to have at our disposal the EU funds which have not yet been used by the Member States involved in the Danube region strategy for the implementation of their cohesion policy.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-165-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Johannes Hahn" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, the Commission is very enthusiastic. That is why we were so pleased to take up the task of developing a strategy with the relevant regions and Member States. We have presented a draft with the aim of significantly intensifying cooperation between the regions and Member States and improving living standards. A broad consensus exists in relation to the priorities of the strategy, namely mobility, the environment and its improvement, and an increase in prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very pleased that Parliament has repeatedly approved and backed the integrated approach taken in this new macro-regional strategy. As the strategy for the Baltic Sea region also shows, the active engagement of all those involved is vital, from a local, national and regional level, to a European level. However, civil society, the business community, etc. must all play their part. This seems to be the case in the Danube region. What is required here is genuinely sustained development. Thus, for example, three of the eleven priority areas relate to the improvement of water quality, the protection of nature and the issue of risk management and ecologically sound flood prevention measures, not just on the Danube, but also on its tributaries.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are faced with an incredible opportunity here. Let us not forget that the Danube is by far the most international river in the world. There are ten countries along this river. There is not a single river in the whole world with so many adjoining countries along its banks. For this reason, it is very important for us to exploit the opportunities for institutional cooperation and for establishing new institutions – particularly in view of the fact that this macro-regional strategy involves eight EU Member States and six non-Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me talk about financing: the important thing here is that the resources already available should be used. There are plenty of opportunities for this in ongoing programme planning. The point is to link operative programmes together in an intelligent way, so that certain projects that can only be implemented on a cross-regional basis can be worked on in parallel. In many discussions, whether multilateral or bilateral, I tell people that they should start their preparatory work for the next round of funding applications now by considering which projects can be implemented on a joint basis and what financial resources these might require.</p>
      <p sl="de">The point is also to make use of the existing additional resources, such as the EUR 30 billion provided by the European Investment Bank for three years, in the region. I am certain that we will still be able to address one or two of these specific issues directly today. For the Commission’s part, we shall supervise and support this strategy, which has evolved from the bottom up. A high-level group from all Member States will be convened to which regular progress reports will be made. There will be follow-up conferences, reports, etc. Above all, there will be a plan of action with specific measures and deadlines and it is important that these matters are supported.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would call on you in your capacity as local representatives to ensure that the many measures already considered, assessed and approved today really do get implemented, so that all of our shared intentions actually bear fruit.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes the document drafted by the Commission and will support its approval during the Hungarian Presidency. We believe that there are basically three prerequisites for implementing the strategy effectively: a list of priorities and common projects, coordination at Commission level and appropriate funding so that we can achieve the goal we all want.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Why include a list of priorities? The reason is that this list should be available for all the countries involved, a list of projects which will be implemented jointly, at the same time, to help boost the region’s economic development and, by extension, make it more attractive. All partners must implement these clearly defined projects, which will have a set of common priorities and will be implemented simultaneously by all the players involved. The next point is coordination. The European Union’s experience from the Baltic Sea strategy has provided proof of the need for an adequate framework set up at EU level to ensure the strategy’s coherence. The coordination framework should not affect regional and local responsibilities but guarantee the implementation of the appropriate priorities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Admittedly, what is not required is more funds, new institutions or new legislation. However, a strategy is needed which will be based on a common list of priorities, good coordination and effective funding. This plan must be put into action and the resources already earmarked in the structural programmes must be supplemented both by the contribution from the states involved and also by the possibility of reallocating unused funds from other segments.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Commissioner, you have proposed a contract for the future cohesion policy. Perhaps you could repeat this exercise for the implementation of the Danube strategy as well.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, it is fortunate that Mr Hahn is the Commissioner responsible. He, too, comes from a Danube country and certainly a huge amount of work awaits both the Hungarian Presidency and the European Commission in order to create harmony between the 11 policy areas. There are too many priorities, Commissioner and fellow Members. How will it be possible to create balance and harmony between the different priorities? It is not doubt that makes me say this, as I too would like this strategy to be successful, and the best thing in this strategy is that it encourages and forces countries in the Danube region to cooperate where frequently, cooperation has been wanting. At the same time, it is questionable how sometimes contradictory objectives laid down in the Danube strategy, such as water quality, improving the state of the environment, navigability, energy exploitation or ecotourism, can be harmonised. For this reason, the Commission faces a huge amount of work to create harmony between the 11 countries and the 11 policies after adoption in June.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, the strategy for the Danube region is to be approved by the Council of Ministers in April. This is a signal to the general public that there are no impediments to it getting under way.</p>
      <p sl="bg">In practice, however, Member States and non-Member States of the region face many challenges associated with the actual implementation and coordination not only as regards priorities, but also as regards the mechanisms for funding, assigning, accounting for and monitoring implementation. This applies particularly to major trans-boundary infrastructure projects.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I believe that the Commission should carefully scrutinise the issue of monitoring projects carried out under the Danube strategy not only for financial discipline, but also for adherence to deadlines, contractual undertakings and the quality of the results. Clear responsibilities need to be laid down regarding who will monitor the fulfilment of undertakings made, how and where, and how problems will be communicated, analysed and resolved.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Another major issue is that of communicating and publishing the results achieved through the strategy. Transparency and access to information during the course of projects is extremely important, both as regards the actual internal administrative processes between project coordinators and contractors, and as regards the citizens of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Before drafting the strategy, we held wide-ranging discussions and consultations on issues relating to the priorities and the actual projects under the strategy. This increased European public interest in the projects. How will they be informed about the progress or otherwise of the strategy, and what is the mechanism for public supervision? This is a question that also needs to be answered at European level.</p>
      <p sl="bg">That is why I believe that the debates and information campaigns must be continued. It is necessary to maintain public involvement in this ambitious European project, which we would all like to see come to fruition.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is important that the drafting of the strategy should be an open process, and that a small number of influential players are not allowed to dictate the outcome. This means that we also need to find solutions for conflicting interests. It is not possible to reconcile all forms of development for the waterway with the objective of protecting the unique natural heritage of the Danube region. The point must be to make use of the technical opportunities available to us and to adapt the ships to the river, rather than vice versa.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am referring here to the Danube as it flows freely through Bavaria. I believe we should strongly criticise the fact that a communication issued by the Commission does not seek to follow the path of what is technically viable and most environmentally compatible. Contrary to the recommendations to date, the Commission is now committing itself to a development that will enable type 4B vessels to navigate the river throughout the year by 2015. This will inevitably lead to conflict, even though this would not be necessary if a consensus were to be reached on how to exploit the existing technical options while, at the same time, protecting the natural amenity. This prior decision must be withdrawn at all costs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would also call for the EU strategy on Roma inclusion to be linked with the strategy for the Danube region. This should also be reflected in Parliament’s resolution.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, at the end of last year, the European Commission presented a communication – the Action Plan of the European Union strategy for the Danube region. Part 2.1 of the communication talks about the challenges and opportunities which a common coordinated approach of the countries involved might bring to the development of this region.</p>
      <p sl="sk">One of these is the exploitation of the Danube waterway for the efficient and environmentally friendly transport of goods. We know that the current transport capacity of the river is well below what it might be. However, in connection with the construction of a broad-gauge railway to transport goods from Vladivostok across all of Asia, the Caspian region, Russian, Ukraine and all the way to the port in Vienna close to Bratislava, the importance of the Danube waterway will surely increase sharply. In my opinion, it is therefore necessary, in the interests of reviving and boosting the economic growth of the region, to examine again the planned projects for environmental water infrastructure, which will make it possible not only to reduce the risks and consequences of flooding, but also to improve the navigability of the river, while producing inexpensive, clean electrical power from renewable sources. For infrastructure such as this, it will surely pay also to mobilise existing unused funding, particularly from the Cohesion Fund, if we can find a suitable mechanism for this.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is a positive thing that we are speeding up the Danube strategy. There are major problems, we know this, environmental problems, hillside erosion, water quality, and – more importantly – we are making insufficient use of the potential that this area offers to citizens and businesses.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As a Dutch member of this Parliament, I know that we used to have a similar approach towards the Rhine. Improvements in water quality, the functioning of transport and tourism, and agriculture go hand in hand. With nothing working against each other, an integrated approach can really help.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Turning now to the legal basis. The legal basis for enhanced territorial cohesion has been laid down in the Treaty. This new article provides an opportunity for good cooperation between and across the borders of the fourteen participating Member States. The instruments, Objective 3 of Cohesion Policy, provide an excellent basis as they cover municipal regions, companies and citizens. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is saying ‘yes’ to this strategy. Under these three conditions, as the Commissioner has just said: no new structures, no new legislative frameworks and no new separate funds. However, ‘yes’ to using the current funds and ‘yes’ to the European Investment Bank’s funds.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The macro-regions, which are still in the experimental phase, should not make administration in Europe more complex. No, the region, the Member State itself, will remain the starting point and we are going to deploy that money and those tools to better effect. Then, I think, we will be able to work very effectively on those action programmes which offer advice and assistance and which are backed by the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Under those conditions, we are currently moving forward with the Baltic Sea. That is running smoothly, now the Danube, and soon the Atlantic Coast.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This morning, I talked to Schuttevaer, a Dutch skippers’ association; they are saying that 10% of transport on the Rhine originates from the Danube. We could easily increase this if we made better use of that broad waterway between the North Sea and the Black Sea. Good for the east and good for the west!</p>

It has to improve the implementation of common targets and to make an impact clearly felt by our citizens along this important European artery, which, as a colleague pointed out, has also been heavily hit by the present crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is of crucial importance that the Danube strategy be based on a bottom-up approach. This partnership should be followed up in the future development of cohesion policy programming documents. The active participation of local and regional stakeholders is a guarantee that they recognise as their priorities the actions and projects included in the strategy. By this I mean real ownership of the process. The willingness of the Danube regions to allocate funds from their own programmes to common projects is a precondition for the successful accomplishment of their goals, but they should also strengthen the coordination of the existing transborder programmes. That is the only way for the strategy to become a good example of interregional cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the Danube strategy is the second macro-regional strategy to support territorial cooperation where there are common characteristics and joint challenges.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We certainly agree that the main objective should be to ensure sustainable development, jobs and prosperity in the Danube region. The greatest possible use should also be made of existing instruments and policies. I therefore fully support the so-called principle of the three ‘NOs’: ‘no’ unnecessary bureaucracy, ‘no’ new institutions and ‘no’ new or additional funding. At the same time, however, a specific question arises for the Commission over these objectives. How can you ensure that the strategy is properly implemented under these conditions?</p>
      <p sl="cs">The regional and municipal authorities, in cooperation with the voluntary sector, must play a particularly important role within the framework of the principle of subsidiarity. These bodies should cooperate effectively together and their activities should be monitored and assessed by the Commission. Implementation should be regulated through a Commission action plan. However, is the Commission also drawing up an abridged and more easily comprehensible version of this document, which would communicate the main practical advantages of this strategy directly to citizens and to local and regional authorities? One last question: what possible link is there between the Danube strategy and the new financial framework for 2014-2020? Is there an overlap?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to offer my very sincere thanks to you for coming here today. You listed eleven priorities today and one of your first comments was that ‘the Commission is very enthusiastic’.</p>
      <p sl="de">The strategy for the Danube region is genuinely a bottom-up process. Wherever we look in the Member States, but particularly in the communities along the Danube, this strategy is universally agreed to be essential.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we listen to today’s discussions, it is quite clear where the greatest fears lie. Cooperation in the cultural sphere is not a major problem – this is something that will work. The Danube region already has a long history of cultural cooperation. The fears relate to sustainability and the threat to the Danube itself.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have heard today that we need to develop the Danube as a transport route because we – I am also speaking in my capacity as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – genuinely see this as an alternative way if not to cut CO2 emissions, which is perhaps too ambitious a goal, then at least to avoid increasing them. However, we do recognise the major threat to the Danube as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we regard the Danube and its tributaries as one large ecosystem, then I can see that this strategy for the Danube region represents a major opportunity, although, on the other hand, it requires a great deal of foresight in the way the strategy is drawn up.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are calls for more money and indeed monetary support will be required. Yet, it will be up to you and the Commission, as well as Parliament, of course, to ensure that all the resources deployed here really do play a role in ensuring that the ecosystem comprising the Danube, its tributaries, forests, dry meadows and wet meadows, is preserved for the future. This is a fundamental requirement if Europe is to develop.</p>
      <p sl="de">This strategy for the Danube region really does offer an opportunity to invest in green energy and to establish sustainability from the bottom up. We now have an opportunity to harness the enthusiasm of the population, stakeholders and other responsible parties. Together, we should make the most of this opportunity because we can provide an excellent example here.</p>

      <p sl="bg">There are plenty of ideas for the countries along the Danube, but what is important are the priorities used to launch the strategy. Joint tourist trails and the development of transport, the environment and contacts between universities will be high-visibility projects and will create an image for the Danube strategy.</p>
      <p sl="bg">In particular, I would like to point out the need for the active involvement of structures of civil society in the implementation of the strategy from the very start. It can only be successful when the citizens living along the Danube feel that it has taken concrete form and that they can be involved in it.</p>

      <p sl="sk">On the other hand, however, it is good that multimodal transport is one of the main focuses. I know, for example, that the river ports on the Danube, either at Vienna or Bratislava, will, after modernisation, make a very significant contribution to the area of multimodal transport, ensuring that not everything is transported just by lorries, as this damages the environment, of course. The recent Bratislava conference on the Danube strategy, attended by Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport, Ján Figeľ, outlined the main trends and involvement of all the countries on the Danube that are taking part in the strategy. The issues of the environment, purity of ground water and also prevention of natural disasters and environmental disasters are all topics which must be incorporated in a sensible way. In my opinion, this strategy will not have an impact on the future allocation of structural funds for other regions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, after the accessions in 2004 and 2007, it became legitimate for us to talk about the Danube region as an area in the European Union. As a result, following the request made by the European Council in June 2009, the Commission drew up the strategy for the Danube region. I would like to congratulate the document’s focus on 11 key areas which will result, provided that they are implemented properly, in achieving sustainable development and creating jobs and security in the region. I think that one of the conditions for ensuring the success of this strategy is to overcome the insensitivities which exist between the different regions through intensive financial and institutional cooperation and by providing better access to existing funds at regional level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, one factor which may play an important role in the success of this strategy is energy. Fragmentation of the energy markets results in high costs and a lack of real competition. This is why I urge diversification of supply through interconnections and genuine regional markets which can ensure increased energy security.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, the strategy for the Danube region is intended, among other things, to promote long-term cooperation in order to improve the transport network and infrastructure for greater environmental protection. This will certainly include sewage treatment plants and projects to promote environmental technology and biodiversity. This is a good thing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yet, what I believe is missing under the environmental heading, Commissioner, is the issue of environmental safety in the context of nuclear power. After all, some of the most controversial nuclear power stations in Europe – Mochovce, Temelin, Belene – are located within the Danube region and, for the most part, the construction methods used there date back to the Soviet period, so that the power stations have some serious and dangerous deficiencies. Despite the serious international consequences of a laissez-faire nuclear policy, insufficient attention is paid to the adjoining regions of neighbouring states, which are not included in the environmental assessments to the appropriate degree. Unfortunately, this results in tensions between adjoining states and regions on the subject of environmental policy. I believe the strategy for the Danube region would provide an excellent basis for resolving these issues.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, when, in my childhood, I swam in the Danube, I always got covered in oil and smelt of it too, so I hope this will change in the future. Nowadays, the situation is entirely different and in the future, when the Danube strategy reaches fruition, I think and very much hope that through the cleansing of the Danube, the differences between the regions will also disappear gradually. I regret that there is no separate financial framework and that it was put under cohesion policy, which is otherwise entirely correct because if you proceed all the way along the Danube, you can see the awfully big differences that exist between the different regions. Another reason why this strategy is good is because the Danube links the old Member States and the new Member States, and this provides inspiration for us to homogenise these regions and lead them towards development. The macro-region of the Baltic states is a very good example for us, and we can transpose a great many positive impulses into practice based on their experiences, primarily in environmental issues.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is not possible to deal with all of this in the short space of time available, but allow me to address two or three points. The first of these points relates to the issue of navigability. This is an issue for which we need to find a clever, ecologically acceptable and economically justifiable solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two approaches that can be combined intelligently. First of all, we need to energetically engage in work such as developing ships’ hulls in order to lower energy consumption and lessen the negative impact on river beds. Secondly – I believe that too little attention has been paid to this hitherto, and I agree with all those who believe that ships should be adapted to the river, not the other way round – we should free ourselves of the notion that ships need to be of the same size right along the Danube. The ships that sail the Mediterranean are not the same ships that sail the Atlantic, and vice versa. We know that the average distance for freight transport is around 800 kilometres and I am convinced that if the choice available is sufficiently attractive, then that distance, too, could be reduced. It is therefore also interesting to consider whether it would be possible, in this regard, for us to also put in place or offer adequate choice in relation to ship size for different sections of the river.</p>
      <p sl="de">One issue that will also be of importance in this context that has been mentioned a number of times is what is known as ‘multilevel governance’. In this regard, we are in a position to try something out, an approach that we intend to put in place quite vigorously in the forthcoming programme period, specifically, an attempt to truly involve all parts of society in the development, but, in particular, also in the implementation, of this strategy. In this connection, I absolutely share the appraisal of Mrs Kadenbach and others. There is an incredible enthusiasm here that must be channelled – bundled, if you will – in order to create the corresponding added value. We can tell that there is a real fervour and passion amongst the population.</p>
      <p sl="de">In basic terms, we now need to jointly realise what we essentially already promised. In this regard, all I can do is call once again for us to truly put into practice the interventions that we have jointly envisaged. Above all, I would like to stress once again that there is enough money in principle, at least for the time being. What we have to do is use the money that is available to create the corresponding added value for the Danube and for the citizens, all 115 million of them, who live along it.</p>

      <p sl="hu">It has long been considered a hackneyed saying in scientific life that there are three main strategic treasures which man will even go to war to obtain. These treasures are the earth’s oil, food and fresh water reserves. In Europe, the Danube is the river with the largest fresh water reserve. All its other advantages – from transport to energy production – can only be secondary in the light of the importance of water as a strategic commodity. As I have emphasised in several of my speeches in Parliament, it is for this reason that for me, the Danube strategy must be primarily a means of protecting potable water supplies. Incidentally, my position on this coincides with EU endeavours aiming to ensure compliance with the European Union’s water quality requirements set out in the Water Framework Directive. I therefore believe that if, during the implementation of the strategy in practice, the interests of water source protection and energy production, or water source protection and inland shipping and transport, potentially clash, concessions must be made to this as the number one priority. In the light of all this, I find it surprising that the Commission’s communication includes specific targets under the scope of the development of Danube shipping which stipulate that there must be a 2.5 metre draught for vessels on the river every day of the year. One reason why this condition is particularly strange is because, to the best of my knowledge, it failed to win the approval of not only Hungarian water specialists but also their Austrian and German colleagues.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Danube has, for a long time, served not only as a natural border between states and regions, but also as a prospective source of energy and a little used means of transport. The Danube strategy is based on the principle of lowering these internal barriers until they are removed, with the aim of improving cooperation between the countries bordering the river. The Danube River Basin is the backbone of a sustainable macro-regional structure. The European strategy in this area is targeted at communities, regions and European states, harmonising their needs for economic, social and cultural development, while also complying with the environmental standards of the Danube’s natural habitat. The coherent development of this macro-region will help narrow the disparities between regions and achieve the EU objective of territorial cohesion. The strategy will provide a platform for strengthening the partnerships between authorities at different levels, as well as between authorities, the private sector and civil society. Without the specific involvement of all the players mentioned, the implementation of such a complex and comprehensive structure as the Danube strategy will remain nothing more than just an aspiration. The development of a regional energy market is another area of interest for the countries bordering the Danube. Strategic interconnections between neighbouring states will have a positive influence on energy security and environmental protection, bearing in mind the potential as a source of sustainable energy offered by the Danube macro-region.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Danube is a lifeline that, despite Europe coming together, seems to form a separating barrier as much as ever, with the Danube region a practically closed cultural zone from Passau to the Black Sea. The Danube strategy aims to improve how this river, which flows through eight EU Member States and six non-Member States, is used as a transport route, which is likely to involve deepening the navigation channels. In addition, the Danube strategy also covers the field of energy, which, in some circumstances, could include an expansion of hydroelectric power. The strategy is furthermore intended to be an important stimulating factor for the economy. We must hope that the EU’s new flagship project that is the Danube strategy will subsequently actually be given some observable and tangible content. How much life will actually be breathed into this project will certainly depend, amongst other things, on how the tension between the objectives of environmental protection and drawing the Danube region together are resolved and whether the Danube will suffice as the common denominator for the implementation of this mammoth project. The scope of the Danube strategy will not be limited to taking account of environmental aspects in order to prevent further damage to the Danube ecosystem. It would be especially welcomed if the cooperation with Croatia as part of the Danube strategy could bring about progress in relation to the restitution claims of those Danube Swabians displaced after the First World War.</p>

      <p sl="el">The strategy for the Danube region is proof positive of the crucial importance of an ‘integrated approach’ to the development of areas which face common challenges, challenges which do not stop at the EU’s borders and which require common action if they are to be addressed effectively. By coordinating policies, financing mechanisms and the agencies involved at various levels of governance, we shall be able to formulate integrated responses to a series of challenges: the untapped potential for river shipping, the lack of roads and railway lines and environmental threats. We all need to help to ensure that the strategy for the Danube region is implemented as quickly and as efficiently as possible. This and the strategy for the Baltic region will function as pilot projects and will provide best methods and mechanisms for their application to other ‘macro-regions’. The challenges which the strategy for the Danube region needs to address clearly exist in other, broader, geographical areas, such as the Balkans and the Adriatic. There is no need for me to mention the consequences which climate change is expected to have on these areas and their potential in terms of developing a green economy, transport and renewable energy sources.

However, the main problem, as usual, is posed by the issues of transparency and financing. Grant aid allocated from the Cohesion Fund and available from regional cooperation programmes must reach the local level. The current regional differences can only be diminished through the application of a thoroughly considered and transparent strategy which distributes unused funds effectively, supporting local entrepreneurs and investments directly. Member States wishing to accede to the European Union, such as Croatia and later Serbia, will also be natural partners of the Danube region. For this reason, the strategy should give far greater weight to cross-border cooperation and the role of new Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, scientific advances over recent decades have contributed to an increase in the use of cord blood stem cells in medicines. The use of such cells has led to positive results in treating patients with blood disorders such as leukaemia.</p>
      <p sl="en">In future, cord blood stem cells could possibly be used to treat other conditions, in particular, genetic diseases. Similarly, adult stem cells are also showing promising potential. However, research still needs to bring proof of such potential benefits for both kinds of stem cells. The transplantation of substances of human origin, including cells, carries risks of disease transmission and that is why there is a European legal framework in place to ensure the quality and safety of human tissues and cells throughout the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, let me make this very clear: Member States alone decide whether and how to use cord blood stem cells. The EU has no competence to harmonise the use of cells. The Tissues and Cells Directive explicitly mentions that the EU should not interfere with national decisions concerning the use or non-use of any specific type of human cells. If, however, a Member State decides to use cord blood cells, then it must fulfil the directive’s requirements on quality and safety, protect public health and guarantee respect for fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with you that it is important to provide accurate and objective information to citizens about the advantages and limitations of the use of cord blood stem cells. Providing such information is, again, the competence of the Member States. The Commission encourages Member States to take such action and some have indeed already done so.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I can reassure you that the Commission regularly monitors the transposition and implementation of the Tissues and Cells Directive. In fact, the Commission adopted a communication on the application of the directive, which was sent to Parliament in January 2010.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, it is good to see that, even at this late hour, you are taking the time to join the debate in this House on this important issue. Ladies and gentlemen, stem cell research offers great opportunities for patients to whom we are unable to offer adequate help at the moment. In this field, much is not yet beyond the stage of fundamental research and still uncertain, but there are still over 70 diseases for which help can be offered to the patients in question in one way or another through adult stem cells and cord blood cells.</p>
      <p sl="de">The cord blood cells are currently predominantly used for allogeneic transplants, in other words, the cord blood can be used to help children – from whom this blood does not derive – with conditions such as leukaemia. There are also autologous therapy techniques, however, where the child from whom the cord blood is obtained can already benefit from this today in a small number of narrowly restricted areas. I am therefore of the opinion that policy must be oriented in such a way that, within the scope of our competences, above all, support is given to public cord blood banks. We can encourage it; we cannot dictate it. That said, we should also not prohibit autologous treatment and the relevant measures. Ultimately, the parents should decide this themselves, but State policy should inform them about the chances and risks.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need clear standards for quality and safety. We must be constantly vigilant, in this connection, that cells are not offered that are no longer useable at the point of use due to a failure to adhere to quality and safety standards. We need to prioritise research in this field, as it is clear that research of this kind is something very close to the patients. Moreover, we must ensure that parents are able to decide that the cord blood should not simply be thrown away, as it may possibly be valuable in future for other children, or even for their own child. We should organise ourselves with that in mind, within the sphere of our competences, as I say, but there is much that we can already do in this area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, wish to thank my co-authors and, in particular, Mr Liese, who spoke just now, and Mr Peterle, for this very satisfactory initiative on the donation of cord blood – a donation of life, then – which has enabled extraordinary and significant medical advances to be made over the last 20 years thanks to the transplantation of its plentiful supply of stem cells. They are used today in the treatment of more than 80 diseases, and especially of cancers – brain cancer, blood cancer, leukaemia, lymphoma – anaemia, autoimmune diseases, certain rare diseases, and the list keeps on growing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Despite this, just 1% of this cord blood, which is so full of possibility and promise, is preserved in Europe, 1% of more than 15 million births per year. In addition, there are huge differences between countries: 7 000 registered donations in Belgium, and 7 000 in France, even though its population is six times that of its neighbour to the north.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore call on the Commission to launch, in conjunction, of course, with the 27 Member States – as the Commissioner mentioned – an information campaign aimed at parents-to-be, so that these donations become a reality, if not a necessity. Well-informed mothers in Europe will clearly want to give life twice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I, and why we, think it is crucial, over and above the uniform transposition of this 2004 directive on the quality and safety of tissues and cells, which has already been mentioned, and which is the subject of our second question, that Europe strongly encourages the Member States to simplify their maternity hospital accreditation procedures and systems. The number of maternity hospitals authorised to preserve and store cord blood is still too small, and the figures prove it. We can no longer allow the passionate debate – which we are not here to resolve – and controversy surrounding the purpose and use of this blood – whether it ends up in public or private blood banks – to actually stop us from talking about this technique, and this is the appeal launched by Professor Eliane Gluckman, who has dedicated her entire career to making the donation of cord blood a donation of life.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, of course, I too agree with what has been said with regard to the importance of us building up these cord blood cell banks for both research and treatment. These stem cells are easy to get hold of if someone is prepared to do it, and I personally do not believe that this should even be treated as a transplant matter. In fact, I believe we should simply be able to take these cells and that parents should be able to oppose this, but they should not need to give their consent. I think that this aspect is less important.</p>
      <p sl="da">I do, however, think it is important that – in addition to the safety measures that Mr Liese and others drew attention to – we remember that we still do not know very much about the possibilities for development in this field. It is therefore important for us to have these banks. I believe, first and foremost, that these banks should, of course, be public, as they are something that we should be able to use for everyone. By far the largest area of application will be the treatment of other people. However, it is also important that we draw attention to the fact that there are pitfalls here. We have seen cases of attempts being made to get parents to pay a kind of security for their child by having a ‘reserve store’ for the child placed in a bank. Doing so is to pay unnecessarily.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is quite rare for someone to need to have their own child treated in this way, and I firmly believe that these banks should be established primarily for the purpose of general research and general treatment. That should be the opening that we aim for. I feel that we could almost be deceiving parents if they believe that they will be able to invest a great deal in the protection of their own child. They should invest cord blood for the protection of the public in general and I very much hope that we will be able to make this more widely available. It is a shame that such an important substance that we have available to us right now simply goes to waste because too little attention is paid to it.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to say that I feel that this issue is too important for us to continue to live the lie that we have been living in Europe. It is a lie or a false promise, whichever you want to call it, as we have been continuing to operate particularly in the area of stem cell collection from umbilical cords based on misleading information.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As we well know and as has already been mentioned, in Europe, the collection of stem cells from umbilical cords barely reaches 1%. However, we also know that their potential for treating illnesses may be endless – illnesses such as those that have already been mentioned: cancer, Alzheimer’s and rare diseases. The possibilities are immense.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, what we have allowed to happen is that a series of private cell banks have been set up and parents have been told that they can store their children’s cells when they are born, which can then be used to treat them in the future if necessary.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I think that we need to be much more responsible than this, as the probability of guaranteeing that this will happen is very low, as we all know. This false promise that is being sold to parents costs money. In Portugal, for example, this false promise costs three and a half times the minimum monthly wage.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The solution, then, is clearly to create public stem cell banks, as it is only with public banks that we can guarantee equality of use, equality of access, effective medical treatment and more research that is equal for all and not just treating stem cells as some sort of commodity or a business which is expanding, but is only for the privileged few.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore feel that solidarity, common sense and impartial information are ultimately not things that can be classified as an extra demand. We do not have the power to impose, but we have the power to promote. This is within our capabilities, and I think that we need to do it in the name of equality.</p>

      <p sl="sl">I was once rapporteur for the approval of hydrogen-powered motor vehicles and I believe that we need to pay at least as much attention to cord blood stem cells. Indeed, you have said yourself that you were positively impressed by this fact, which is a source of excitement not only for those who are ill or for parents, but also for researchers, who are finding an increasing number of areas of application.</p>
      <p sl="sl">What you said about the European Commission encouraging Member States to take measures in this respect is very important. It really seems to be the case that what we largely see as waste today could later become a source of our or someone else’s health.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In this context, I believe that we need a strategy. We need to know what we are encouraging, what information we are giving to parents and other people and, of course, what research we are doing.

      <p sl="it">You have just maintained that all this is not within the competence of Europe. However, could the transposition of Directive 2004/23/EC not define quality and safety standards for the donation, testing, preservation and distribution of the selfsame cells?</p>
      <p sl="it">It is, in any case, necessary to ensure that the diverse national legislation be applied coherently over the different European countries to guarantee that all European patients and parents have the same rights and are subject to identical rules.</p>

This time, medicine is scarcely being mentioned as the elections take place. Obviously, the economy has taken centre stage, but also medical science has moved on considerably. We are very fortunate with the quality of medical research we have in various institutions throughout the European Union, and also with the quality of medical practitioners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cord blood stem cells are one example of where progress has been made. It has been said that this research has the potential to help deal with 70 to 80 diseases. That is something that we should encourage, and therefore it is important that this type of research and facility be made available – obviously within ethical constraints.

I keep swinging between the two: on the one hand, there is my Catholic upbringing, and on the other, modern science and the benefits this can bring.</p>
      <p sl="en">That said, for the first time probably ever, I am going to commend a Commissioner. What he said was absolutely correct: this should be left in the hands of the Member States.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I would like to talk about the issue of collecting and storing cord blood, which is a major source of stem cells. Through the collection of cord blood at birth, which, in the past, used to be discarded with the placenta, we can obtain a significant source of undifferentiated stem cells without causing discomfort to the mother or child, and these can be modulated and used successfully at any time in the future to treat leukaemia and at least 70 other conditions. I would like to ask why it is that in Europe, we collect less than 1% of stem cells at birth, and I would like, of course, to agree with the Commissioner, who says that it is mainly up to Member States to regulate this, although the Commission, along with the Member States, could surely help to improve the provision of information to parents concerning the advantages of stem cells, in light of progress in stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine.

      <p sl="en">However, because of the concerns that have been raised, maybe one solution could be that the national registry of blood banks could be used as the registrar, the resource, for maintaining the cord stem cells for future use. This would overcome some of the problems and difficulties some of my colleagues have already mentioned with regard to the cost of storage.</p>
      <p sl="en">As well as that, we already have a system in place within the existing national blood banks that can regulate and control the quality of that supply. That could be a good way of overcoming some of the difficulties. I, like many colleagues, believe that the use of stem cells has a huge potential for future disease treatments.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we must also be cautious about giving false hope, because too often we have heard, not just with stem cells but also with biotechnology in other areas, of people being given false hope.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, clearly, there is a general appreciation of the progress that has been made in the application of stem cells for therapeutic purposes. We agree that this needs to be encouraged.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issues as raised by the honourable Members are firstly on information and secondly on storage.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as information is concerned, it is important – as we all agree – to provide accurate and objective information to parents and to the general public about the advantages and limitations of the use of stem cells, including cord blood stem cells. Providing such information is the competence of the Member States, which sometimes vary in opinion and policy regarding the advantages and limitations, as well as the uses, of stem cells. Many Member States already have in place information campaigns and other information activities. The Commission encourages Member States to take such actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">As to storage, we know that private firms already offer parents the service of storing cord blood cells. However, several Member States have established public cord blood banks based on altruistic and voluntary cord blood donation.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU law on tissues and cells regulates all tissue establishments, whether public or private. It specifies principles of voluntary and unpaid donation, anonymity, altruism of the donor and solidarity between donor and recipient. In 2004, the European Group on Ethics recommended public storage of cord blood banks to ensure solidarity access to all patients in need.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The value of the global market for cord blood stem cells was approximately EUR 3.34 billion in 2010. Future projections, based on an annual growth rate of roughly 27% in the coming years, indicate that this figure will reach EUR 11 billion by 2015. At a time when stem cells seem to be the new ‘El Dorado’ in medical research, many researchers are in a hurry to move into this niche area without ensuring that they achieve all the quality and safety standards required for these procedures. I think that the Commission must step up its efforts in terms of informing patients and medical staff about the benefits of extracting cord blood stem cells. However, it must also make a special effort to ensure that the minimum quality and safety standards for donating, acquiring, testing, processing, keeping, storing and distributing human cells and tissue are, and will be, complied with in all Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">We have heard from Commissioner Dalli the very cautious position of the European Commission regarding research on stem cells from cord blood. This is hardly surprising. The Commission proposed and pushed through in the Seventh Framework Programme an enormous package of support for contentious stem cell research and is afraid to admit that this research failed to fulfil expectations. Moreover, it is now clear that the research on stem cells obtained from the bodies of unborn children did not produce anything like the results from research on cells obtained from cord blood. Until recently, this blood was regarded as biological waste. In light of the latest reports of successful experiments and even treatments using stem cells from cord blood, how can the Commission defend the morally unacceptable production of human embryos for research purposes? Also, why has Commissioner Dalli not presented us today with a concrete plan for the Commission to increase the percentage of cord blood collected at birth, instead of a meaningless opinion? I hope it is because his staff are still hard at work on such a plan. I assume that the Commission will propose a mechanism in the plan which will relieve parents of the burden of paying for the collection and subsequent storage of cord blood. I also expect that the plan will include a reassessment of priorities in the area of stem cell research.</p>

Moreover, the regulation of the international financial system is not a matter for the right, the left, or even the centre: it concerns everyone throughout the world. I firmly believe that Europe must play a leading role, as it was able to do last March when it called on the Commission and the Member States to focus on the issue of taxing international financial activities.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the price of food has reached an all-time high and is rising again for the seventh time in a row. There are various factors that may account for this increase, the first of which is a short-term factor. It has to do with the coinciding of bad weather in certain countries, such as Russia and Argentina.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, there are two factors that are structural in nature, which is why I am bringing up these two factors here. The first has to do with the fact that some food producers and consumers that used to be exporters are now importers, as is the case of China. The second has to do with the fact that the clout of some of the large multinationals enables them to influence prices in their favour. Cereals are a very clear example of this: they are dominated by six large multinationals.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This situation therefore leaves farmers feeling very unsure about the price of food products. Europe must once again do what it stopped doing some time ago, which is to protect its producers and consumers.

An eminent role awaits the European Police College, with an important task to perform. It is regrettable that CEPOL, the European Police College, became known here, in the European Parliament, due to the suspected illegal and corrupt operation of its former management. At the same time, it must be said – and perhaps fewer people are aware of this and fewer people are interested in this than in the scandals – that the appointment of new leaders in 2010 initiated highly favourable processes in the functioning of the European Police College. It is therefore important to deal not only with the past but also with the future. As regards future objectives, in a nutshell, two things are needed: to ensure the organisational legal autonomy of the European Police College and the development opportunities required for its renewed operation. For this, I would like your support and attention.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, 14 February, is European Epilepsy Day. This is a condition from which 6 million European citizens suffer, of whom some 300 000 are Italians.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is therefore important that associations, including the Italian Epilepsy Association, dedicated to increase awareness of such a serious condition about which there is still much ignorance, a lack of clear information and regarding which many extremely delicate aspects remain unknown, should organise meeting opportunities over this period.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some steps forward have been made in the last few years at European level, especially through a 2009 directive, but there is still much to do, especially to guarantee full civil rights to sufferers from this condition in the world of work and of mobility, and in guaranteeing the availability of medication during school hours.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore consider days of reflection on such fundamental aspects of these problems to be very important.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, in December 2010, the unemployment rate in the EU-27 hit 9.6%, reaching a figure of 23 million unemployed. Compared with the situation last year, the unemployment rate has risen in two thirds of Member States. Young people and women have been hit hardest by the economic crisis. The EU unemployment rate for women in the EU-27 rose to 9.6%, with the rate of youth unemployment reaching 21%. In some countries such as Spain, Slovenia and Lithuania, this figure has even exceeded 35%. Similarly, only 50% of people over the age of 60 are still in work. Jobs remain the main concern of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the Commission and Member States to take the necessary measures to make social Europe a reality. European citizens are looking for a decent job, offering a salary which they can reasonably live off, as well as for access to good quality social and healthcare services.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I urge the Commission and Member States to allocate as a priority financial resources to the measures which can generate jobs and promote industrial development across the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, in November 2008, four-year-old Adam Azab, a citizen of the Slovak Republic and the European Union, was forcibly separated from his mother in Egypt. The courts in both Slovakia and Egypt had decided to entrust the child to the care of the mother. The child’s father, an Egyptian national, is ignoring this decision. The Egyptian police and Interior Ministry are neither able nor willing to discover little Adam’s address. His mother, Mrs Katarína Azab, has been in Egypt for two and a half years looking for her son with the help of the Slovak embassy. The unrest in Egypt has forced the mother to return to Slovakia, but without her son. She continues to live in fear for the life and health of her child. I call on the Commission and Parliament to rapidly intervene and defend the fundamental rights of their citizens. I ask for your assistance in returning young Adam to his mother.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it really is not that long ago that the rapporteur on the SWIFT agreement stood here in plenary and assured us that internal European transfer data would not be covered by the agreement. That was not true, however, as we now know. The reality, in fact, is that only SEPA transaction data are excluded from the agreement, while standard EU transfers and even express transfers via the SWIFTNet FIN are not. It is thus proving to be the case that the SWIFT agreement will result in a major leaking of data and that one of the major arguments of the advocates of the SWIFT agreement has fallen apart.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yet what does the European Parliament do now? Nothing. Absolutely nothing! There is no outcry, just an attempt to brush this new information under the carpet. This is in stark contrast to events in the German Parliament. There has already been a debate in the German Parliament and I also received an email today from the Social Democratic Party of Germany which very clearly argued that the European Parliament must be active in this area. That is exactly what I want to call on Parliament to do. I believe it is very important for us to stop this mass data transfer and to re-start the negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in connection with our recent debate on international adoption, I should like to draw attention to the institution of the foster family. It is an alternative to residential care for children awaiting adoption or the resolution of problems in their natural families. Foster families are an effective and desirable form of caring for children and are a particular opportunity for socially maladjusted children, whose chances of adoption are the lowest.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should encourage the Member States to make changes to legislation which will improve traditional forms of care in foster families as well as care in foster families with many children or with specialist carers, and also ensure that appropriate financial support is made available. Foster family organisations could be involved in drafting proposals for the legal measures which are really needed in this area. Foster parents need, in addition, the establishment of groups made up of parents, carers, guardians and social workers, which would work together effectively and whose objective would be to give mutual help and support for parenting. Of no less importance is general promotion of the idea of foster families in society, so that there will be more of them and that they will enjoy respect and recognition, and that their huge contribution to caring for children will be appreciated.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the situation of national minorities primarily depends on the constructive cooperation of the political representatives of the majority society and the minority. Over the last 20 years, it has been demonstrated that those Hungarian minority communities outside Hungary have been successful where the willingness of the minority political leadership to cooperate encountered a constructive attitude on the part of the political leadership of the majority society, who regarded the minority as partners, whether they were involved in government or not. There is no alternative to this cooperation. I am very pleased that the current Slovak Government has set off on the road which one day may lead to an historic Hungarian-Slovak reconciliation. The nationalist bidding of one country’s nationalism provoking the other country’s nationalism must be brought to an end. I hope that forms of minority-friendly cooperation will come to compete with each other in Hungarian-Slovak relations instead of nationalism. I trust that the historic Hungarian-Slovak reconciliation will bring major results, as there is no other alternative for the two countries.</p>

      <p sl="el">Now, the European Union and the United States of America are up in arms about grassroots freedoms and democracy in Egypt and other countries. For years on end, the USA, NATO and the EU have supported and done everything within their power to strengthen these barbaric regimes and to upgrade their trading, economic, political and military relations with them, with big business and with their political spokesmen, thereby creating mass poverty, misery, persecution and massive waves of economic migrants and refugees, who are crammed into and held in concentration camps in the Member States of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my intention in making this speech is to voice the concerns of thousands of fishing families from southern Italy, in particular, from the regions of Campania and Sicily, who represent one half of the small fishing fleet. These people are suffering from an unjust and needless ban on fishing for fry; a ban that has no scientific basis whatsoever and makes not the slightest political sense. By acting in this way, the Union will increasingly come to be seen as the enemy of our fisherfolk, who carry on an activity important to both the national and European gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
      <p sl="it">Two or three days ago, we asked some Members, some of whom are also here in this Chamber tonight, for a meeting with Commissioner Damanaki. Although this was promised to us, we have not received a reply since then, notwithstanding that the Commissioner committed herself to look for a better solution for the whole issue, showing great political sensibility at that time.</p>
      <p sl="it">Yet again, it pains us to conclude that the Brussels bureaucracy has triumphed over politics. I therefore consider it opportune that, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, this Parliament assert itself once and for all to strike down certain types of stale and myopic reasoning.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, although the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement has been renewed for four years, the Protocol that establishes the fishing opportunities and returns expires on 28 February.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is a risk that the activities of the EU fleet that practises mainly small-scale fishing will be interrupted, which will have a major impact on European areas and towns that are highly affected by the crisis. There is also a risk that the development of sustainable fishing in the context of the Protocol and the flow of investment to the population of the area will be interrupted.</p>
      <p sl="es">On Friday, the Commission asked the Council to authorise the opening of negotiations for the renewal of the Protocol, and on Monday, the Agricultural and Fisheries Council will meet.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to act swiftly. I therefore ask the Council to give the Commission a mandate at this meeting, and I ask the Commission to initiate conversations in the coming week in order to secure a new protocol with all the guarantees in place, and to arrive at a provisional extension of activity in order to ensure that it continues for a sufficient period of one or two years, in order to reach a final, entirely satisfactory agreement.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, around a billion of the world’s people are chronically undernourished or are starving. In 2008, food prices rose dramatically, which caused food-related riots in about 30 countries around the world. Today, food prices are approaching those of 2008. The general economic crisis has also contributed to this, which means it is even more necessary to make strenuous endeavours at finding fair ways of distributing food products on a world scale. Unfortunately, it is being forgotten in the European Union that the common agricultural policy is principally a policy intended to secure the supply of high quality food at a suitable price to all European consumers. We must not allow further elimination of instruments which regulate the market and maintain stocks at suitably high levels, and this includes cereal stocks. It is also essential to eliminate speculation in this market – it is reprehensible and immoral that capital groups chasing higher profits are distorting the rules of the free market and condemning millions of people across the world to suffer hunger.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, the results of a representative study show that just 4% of Bulgarian students take part in student exchange programmes such as Erasmus. The main reason for this low figure is to do with financial constraints.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The only way of achieving the target of 20% student mobility by 2020 is to review the funding mechanisms. Two types of measures can be devised for this. The first is credits for student mobility. A study by the London School of Economics proposes setting up a European instrument for crediting student exchange, which will result in greater interest on the part of the students.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The second type of measure relates to increasing grants for student exchange. Grants reduce social inequality and are the most effective investment in increasing educational standards and the competitiveness of the European economy. More resources need to be allocated from European as well as national budgets so that students can afford to participate in European mobility programmes.</p>

On top of concerns for the future of the Arab world, on whose stability the balance of global order is dependent, we must add a more serious concern about the welfare of citizens both inside and outside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">From the outset of the economic crisis, the priorities have been to save the financial and banking system and balance the state budget. However, here we have a situation where the burden of recession is causing unpredictable effects with a major geopolitical impact. In Tunisia and Egypt, the rise in food prices and unemployment increased the exasperation caused by the dictatorial regimes. The lack of prospects and the increasingly oppressive current climate are also having an impact on the mood of citizens in some Member States, especially in the eastern and southern regions of the European Union. I believe it is time for more attention to be focused on people’s living standards. Otherwise, we risk seeing unexpected displays of discontent by a population which is permanently being asked to make sacrifices.</p>

Firstly, this model is only intended for euro area Member States. Other Member States only have the right to assist in the coordination of this model.
