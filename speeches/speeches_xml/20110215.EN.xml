      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Martin Callanan, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles as part of the Community’s integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles (COM(2009)0593 – C7-0271/2009 – 2009/0173(COD)) (A7-0287/2010).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am delighted to be able to open our debate today on my report about emissions from light commercial vehicles (LCVs).</p>
      <p sl="en">Before I get to the detail of the text, please allow me to express a few thanks: first of all, to the shadow rapporteurs from all of the political groups; secondly, to the rapporteurs and members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their opinions; and thirdly, to the Commissioner and her team – we have had a number of very constructive meetings about this. Fourthly, I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for its very hard work during the trialogue negotiations; finally, my thanks go to Jos Vervloet and Isobel Findlay from the ENVI secretariat, who have provided some incredible support throughout the process. In particular, Isobel’s help on the complex comitology issues is very much appreciated.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposed legislation has been expected ever since similar legislation was passed concerning passenger cars. Personally, I was not entirely convinced of the need for this legislation because most vans are bought by businesses, both large and small, which are already very conscious of the need for economy and fuel efficiency. Because of this, it has been my belief throughout the process that it is crucial to have an ambitious but realistic long-term target and an appropriate short-term target that takes into account both the needs of industry product cycles and the need for environmental improvement. It has always been the long-term target that has been the main focus throughout our debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s original proposal was 135g CO2/km, which was deemed by many sources to be simply unachievable. The LCV sector has longer development and production times than the passenger car sector. Similarly, LCVs, as their name implies, are used mainly for commercial purposes. Unlike passenger cars, there is less scope to modify either their shape or their weight in a bid to reduce emissions. The principal way to accomplish this in LCVs is through modification of the engines and mechanics of the vehicles – a much longer and more expensive process than simply altering the body or reducing the weight of the vehicle.</p>
      <p sl="en">It should also be noted that there is already much greater penetration of diesel fuel usage in the LCV sector than in the car sector. When the Commission published its original proposal, many of the manufacturers made it clear that they wished to settle for nothing less than 160g CO2/km, a figure which, in turn, struck most of us in Parliament as being far too relaxed and complacent. In the end, the package that we have all agreed on, and which is before you today, has a fairly sensible compromise position of 147g CO2/km.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given the higher costs of reducing CO2 in LCVs compared to cars and the longer development and production cycles needed, my personal belief is that this provides a good balance between ensuring improved environmental standards, on the one hand, and giving a realistic and achievable target for the LCV manufacturing sector, on the other. The fact that, by reaching this compromise figure, we are being attacked on one side as being too pro-industry and on the other as being too environmentally friendly, suggests to me that possibly, we have just about got the balance right.</p>
      <p sl="en">One area of the Commission’s proposal which all groups agreed was unworkable concerned the very complex issue of multi-stage vehicles. Obviously, it is unfair to penalise the manufacturers of the base vehicle when they are not responsible for what happens to the vehicle at a later stage of its production. The package that is before you today includes a very sensible proposal that the Commission will review this issue before the end of the year and sets out the basis under which this review should take place.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the package that we have negotiated, and which will be put before Parliament today as amendment 58, is the best possible outcome. I am pleased to have the support – I hope – of most of the main political groups. It balances the need for improved environmental standards with realistic and achievable targets that will not prejudice manufacturing industry nor pose a risk to jobs in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Generally, I am not in favour of first-reading agreements, believing that they are best avoided if at all possible. However, in this case, a first-reading agreement provides clarity and certainty to a sector that is still suffering in the wake of the global economic crisis, whilst also setting the bar for the tough but fair environmental standards that we all wish to see. I hope that colleagues will join me in supporting the package today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, and the shadow rapporteurs, on their efforts in reaching agreement on the Commission proposal on light commercial vehicles. In the aftermath of the economic downturn, as Mr Callanan mentioned, these discussions were indeed difficult.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me be clear: the compromise package resulting from these interinstitutional discussions is less ambitious than the Commission proposal on a number of points. Mainly, full compliance with the short-term target is delayed by one year; the level of the penalty for non-compliance – the ‘excess emissions premium’ – has been lowered; and the ambition of the long-term target has been decreased. It will therefore not come as a surprise to anybody if I say that I would have preferred a more ambitious outcome, and many of you probably share that view.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, this compromise still represents an important step forward. By 2020, it will bring down the average CO2 emissions of vans from the 2007 baseline of 203 grams of CO2 per kilometre to 147 grams per kilometre. This will mean an average emission reduction in the van fleet of 28% over 13 years. In view of the expected growing demand for light commercial vehicles, the increased efficiency will represent an important contribution to the reduction of transport emissions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The compromise will also generate lifetime net savings for consumers, mainly small and medium-sized enterprises, of over EUR 2 200 per vehicle. Moreover, the targets will stimulate innovation in industry and enable manufacturers to take advantage of the transition to a low carbon economy and thus enhance their long-term competitiveness. Let us not forget that this regulation should give manufacturers a first mover advantage in world markets where similar CO2 standards are likely to follow and the demand for efficient vehicles is expected to rise.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, this regulation will close a major regulatory gap between cars and vans and therefore minimise potential perverse effects on the regulation on CO2 in passenger cars. Large cars will not be able to escape the CO2 emission standards simply by changing the vehicle’s category to ‘van’ when type-approved.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, as you know, transport is today emitting more than in 1990, thus offsetting to a large extent the reductions made in other sectors. This is, of course, not sustainable. Transport must make a substantial contribution to the EU’s overall CO2 targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">This regulation is one more instrument that will help the Member States to meet their 2020 commitments to reduce CO2 from sectors outside the EU ETS.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that this agreement is yet more proof of the European Union’s commitment towards meeting its climate goals and I hope that you will lend your support to the compromise package when you vote later today.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the first reading should be the exception. In this case, it was possible because we came to a compromise between the proposals of the Commission, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the most controversial topic. The fact that we went into the negotiations with a common negotiating mandate from all the groups is the only thing which enabled us to produce this result. I would like to thank Mr Callanan in particular for the commitment he has shown. We can be proud of what we have achieved. The result is identical in many areas to the proposal made by the Industry Committee. I believe that we have launched an ambitious project which is achievable for industry and which will, in particular, give users the opportunity to buy affordable, modern vehicles with lower CO2 emissions. This applies specifically to small and medium-sized businesses, tradespeople, retailers and micro-enterprises which use this type of vehicle.</p>
      <a text="(The President interrupted the speaker)"/>
      <p sl="de">There is an item in my dossier for the Industry Committee which was not incorporated, but which nevertheless was adopted with a narrow majority. It concerns the proposal for speed limiters. This is now a matter for the Member States, which will have to establish their own regulations. Overall, we are therefore pleased with the compromise. The Industry Committee is prepared to support the entire package.</p>

    <intervention id="2-010-000" speaker_id="28323" name="Oldřich Vlasák" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism">
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, it is true that transport is one of the sectors where emissions need to be reduced. In our rush to cut emissions, however, we should not undermine the competitiveness of European car manufacturers. This requirement is particularly pressing in view of the ongoing financial crisis, which has had serious repercussions on the European car industry so far.</p>
      <p sl="cs">From this perspective, I consider the achievement of 147g CO2/km for the average emissions of new vans to be rather ambitious, and I am very curious to see the feasibility study which the Commission is to draw up on the basis of the updated results.</p>
      <p sl="cs">At the same time, I am following with great attention the repeated efforts of the Commission and certain other parties, for whom the proposed target seems, on the contrary, rather unambitious, to reopen the debate on this topic and to try and change this regulation in order to set more stringent targets. I firmly believe that the economic actors need certainty that the legislation will not be changing all the time. It is now time to give car manufacturers breathing space to work and to develop new engines so that they can adjust to the regulations and the new objectives.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In conjunction with this, I think we should keep our eyes firmly fixed on justification 24, which considers expanding the use of speed limiters to light commercial vehicles as well. I am pleased that we will be addressing this issue in particular and that this debate will be businesslike and not ideological.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, today, I am representing Mrs Weisgerber, our shadow rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, who is on maternity leave. We all send her our very best wishes. She has done an excellent job on this dossier.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, we are all pleased with the compromise. It was not as difficult to achieve as in the case of cars, because this is not such an emotional subject. Nevertheless, we faced major environmental and economic challenges. From a climate policy perspective, it is important that the load is distributed evenly along all the links in the chain and this link must make its contribution. However, we also had to ensure that we did not grind so much off this link that we caused it to break. What do I mean by that? Of course, the costs involved in measures of this kind for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent a significant challenge for them. Small businesses will be considering very carefully whether it is worthwhile replacing their old vehicle and investing in a new one. Therefore, we had to focus less on the technical aspects and more on the economic ones. In technical terms, we could have achieved a great deal more, but the costs would definitely have been passed on to the SMEs and that would not have produced the desired results.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will have to wait for a few years to find out whether this regulation is a good one, because that will only be the case if we actually reach the required emission levels. If we end up imposing fines, then we will not have achieved our objective. We must keep a very close eye on how the situation develops.</p>

    <intervention id="2-013-000" speaker_id="34728" name="Matthias Groote" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude for the way in which we have been able to work together so constructively. We have reached a good compromise today from an environmental and an economic perspective. Even though we could, in my opinion, have gone further with regard to the limit, the legislation that we are adopting today is still the strictest in the world for light commercial vehicles. We must not forget that. Mrs Hedegaard has already said that, outside the Emissions Trading System, these small sector-specific pieces of legislation which we are introducing are very important in allowing us to achieve the goals that we have set ourselves. If vehicles use less fuel, this brings added value not only for the climate but also for air quality. With a limit of 147 grams, which is the equivalent of 5.6 litres of diesel, vehicles will produce less pollution. This means that the air quality in our cities will improve. We are taking an important step forward today.</p>
      <p sl="de">My group is voting in favour of this compromise package because it includes an important point which states that we must evaluate in 2014 at the latest whether the targets that we are adopting today have been met or exceeded and whether we need to make adjustments in this area. This was a fundamental requirement for our group. I have had long discussions with my colleague, Mr Pirillo, about the nature of this compromise and that was one of the basic prerequisites of the compromise package.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some comments have already been made about the first reading. We should make sure in future that we reach fewer first-reading agreements. In this case, it is acceptable because the negotiations ultimately only concerned 2 grams. We did not need to introduce that into the second reading. However, if we adopt everything during the first reading, Parliament will be depriving itself of its rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one further point I would like to mention and that is the test cycle. It will be very important for us to have a standardised test cycle in future which will hopefully come into force throughout the world at some point and which will represent reality. Our current test cycles are not realistic and we need to make improvements in this area. International negotiations are under way and I hope that they can be brought to successful conclusion, because this will mean that the legislation will reflect the actual driving cycles. I would like to thank everyone concerned once again. Today is a good day for the European Union’s climate and environmental policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in the discussion about whether or not it is sensible to come to an agreement during the first reading, we should not stick as closely to our principles as some Members have recommended. This should depend on the dossier. How are the discussions going? How controversial are they? In the case of the regulation of CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles, it is clear that the positions of the institutions were not very far apart. Therefore, it would not have been worthwhile to start the second reading process, except in the case of an issue which is the subject of heated discussions, in other words, the long-term target.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Commission has never explained properly and it is also not clear from the impact assessments how a reduction in emissions from 203 grams today to 135 grams within 10 years – these are the figures just mentioned by Mrs Hedegaard – can be implemented in an economically viable way. This represents a cut of 34% and goes far beyond our other climate targets. Parliament’s most important job was to bring this target back to reality and to make it feasible in economic terms. This is what we have done. I am pleased that Mr Groote took up my argument, because a fleet average of 147 grams is a long way from what the Commission originally proposed, but it is also by far the most ambitious target set anywhere in the world. We should not try to persuade ourselves that a CO2 limit for light commercial vehicles will save the world’s climate.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank everyone, including the rapporteurs, for their hard work. I am pleased that we have achieved a large majority for this compromise.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, for being extremely professional and inclusive when conducting the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, I will not be expressing my thanks for the agreement. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believe that the Commission’s original proposal was a good and realistic one, but unfortunately, the agreement that has been reached is far too weak. It will not do the competitiveness of the car industry any good. The question is where are we going to sell cars in 2020? Well, we will sell them in Asia, and there they will demand extremely low energy vehicles. So if we want to benefit the competitiveness of the industry, we should set much higher targets. The agreement will not benefit the environment either because, even if every commercial vehicle emits 28% less, no one believes that the amount of traffic will not increase by 2020. Thus, the emissions targets aimed at a reduction of 30%, which we will presumably achieve through the negotiations in Durban in South Africa, will not be met either. Moreover, not even the economy will benefit from this, because no one is expecting the price of petrol in 2020 to be around SEK 13 or EUR 1.30 per litre. It will, of course, be much higher than that. Thus, the calculations on which the Commission’s original proposal was based were much more realistic and even then they were almost too high to be able to make effective economic calculations. So, unfortunately, this agreement will not benefit competitiveness, the economy or the environment.</p>
      <p sl="sv">On the contrary, I believe that natural technical progress will actually go further than this agreement states. The planning horizon for the industry will be worse because consumers in 2020 will almost certainly demand cars that emit no more than 120 g CO2/km.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is also unfortunate that we reduced the fines for those who do not achieve the targets. That means we will not even achieve the goal of the legislation – unless it turns out as I believe it will: in other words, that we will nevertheless achieve this by means of natural progress. It is the same with super-credits: they fool us into believing that the emissions are lower than they really are if an electric car is counted three times. Unfortunately, therefore, we cannot support this agreement, but I would nevertheless like to thank all those involved.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I would like to thank you for moderating part of this debate in Czech. However, I would chiefly like to thank the rapporteurs and the lead rapporteur, Martin Callanan, for the work they have done. The law we are debating relates to climate change policy as we know it from the European Parliament, and this is not the place to be criticising the policy and the entire concept. It is necessary to realise that these are predominantly unilateral steps by the European Parliament, which have no counterparts outside the EU in the rest of the world. We must consider what would be a sensible motivation and what would be an unreasonable burden for European businesses, and I firmly believe that this report has come close to a sensible motivation. In this case, I strongly disagree with what was said by the previous speaker, Carl Schlyter. European competitiveness is not and will not be assisted by hobbling European industry. All the evidence so far points to the fact that European industry is on the decline and is relocating beyond our borders. The measures in the area of vans are far more complicated than for cars, and place a greater burden on small businesses, as has already been said here. I would like to end by thanking all of the rapporteurs. I regard the compromise that has been reached as an outstanding piece of work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin discussing light commercial vehicles, I would like to remind you that European car manufacturers have achieved the EU’s CO2 product targets for cars several years before the deadline in 2015, by taking the appropriate technical measures. It is now clear that the manufacturers were seriously exaggerating during the negotiations on the time period and the targets for the CO2 reduction measures for cars when these were subsequently watered down. The manufacturers have taken the same approach in their lobbying activities concerning the CO2 reduction targets for light commercial vehicles. I would like to know how a majority here in Parliament can knowingly repeat this mistake and give in once again to the demands of the automotive industry.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this era of climate change, I believe that the important issues are protecting the environment and safeguarding the future of the human race. If Parliament would at least support the Commission’s proposal, this would put the European automotive industry at the cutting edge of technical development and, therefore, allow it to remain competitive. The Commission proposed a reduction target of 135 grams of CO2 per kilometre. Following a transition period, the manufacturers would not be required to reach this limit until 2020. In my opinion, that would have been feasible. Instead of this, under pressure from the Council, a poor compromise was reached behind closed doors, according to which car manufacturers must now reduce the CO2 emissions of light commercial vehicles to only 197 grams of CO2 per kilometre by 2020. This feeble compromise is a gift to the industry. Super-credits, phase-in periods and pooling will water down what is already a weak limit even further. Lobbying by manufacturers among Members of this House and pressure from the vehicle manufacturing countries, namely Germany, France and Italy, in the Council have produced this poor result, which contains a whole series of loopholes.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report is unacceptable. It conflicts with the climate objectives of the EU and will slow down the pace of technical innovation. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will be voting against this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as I hear discussions on ways to screw more money out of the little people in the name of climate change, I am struck by two things. The first is how no one talks about global warming anymore. Even the most out-of-touch MEPs have clearly realised that exposés of fraudulent pseudoscience and record cold winters across the globe have made the public, rightly, very sceptical about all the deceitful propaganda about drowning polar bears.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second is the car park beneath us – Porches, Mercedes, BMWs, SUVs, a showroom of gas-guzzling luxury from the people who tut-tut in disapproval at many white vans and plot to make working lives even harder with speed limiters and financial penalties, all for a dogma based on discredited statistics pedalled by a clique of bought and paid-for academics, funded and hyped by super-rich vested interests in the green industrial complex – Al Gore, Prince Charles, Shell and Goldman Sachs – all of whom stand to steal a fortune from the taxes harvested through wind factory subsidies and carbon trading.</p>
      <p sl="en">While I appreciate the efforts of some MEPs to blunt the worst excesses of this CO2 hysteria, the plain truth is that anyone who even gives credence to the threadbare hoax of man-made global warming is a collaborator with the deadliest scam in history. Yes, deadly, because it is not only robbing ordinary people and de-industrialising the West; it is also right now starving to death hundreds of thousands of the world’s poorest children as food crops are replaced by taxpayer-subsidised biofuels. But it is boosting profits for Monsanto and giving MEPs all expenses paid trips to palm oil plantations in Malaysia, so that is all right is it not?</p>
      <p sl="en">No, it is not, particularly as it is diverting attention from the real crisis – not that we are releasing carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, but that we are beginning to run low on the oil which powers our civilisation. Every day wasted talking about limiting emissions of nature’s most important fertiliser is a day lost in the struggle to sustain more and more people on less and less energy. If it was not such a tragedy, it would be a farce.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Mr Griffin was wrong when he said that this has been a cold winter across the globe. It was actually just some parts of northern Europe and some central parts of the USA. Globally, 2010 was one of the two hottest years in recorded history. The fact that it is colder here now is also quite predictable, because if the Gulf Stream is pressed down by meltwater from the Arctic, this is an explainable effect. So no, 2010 was a very hot year, climate change is real and the measures we are taking are good for the economy.</p>

Just as it was two years ago in Copenhagen, when the climate change conference was there, it was the coldest at the climate change conference in Cancún that it had been for decades.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, there is no evidence whatsoever of meltwater from the Arctic impeding the Gulf Stream. There has been no change in that whatsoever. Thirdly, your arguments would be more effective if the climate change computer models had foreseen this a couple of years ago. They did not. A couple of years ago, we were told that our children would not know what snow was. What an absolute nonsense this has been.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, as for the statistics showing a global warming trend, the key factor everyone is ignoring here is that 65% of the world’s weather stations are within 10 metres of an artificial heat source. They are virtually all in cities. The collapse of the Soviet Union meant that most of the weather stations in naturally cold areas were closed down. That is what has skewed the statistics, which are fundamentally bogus because people, boosted by the United Nations, set about finding man-made global warming in order to impose the solutions they wanted.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on securing this agreement. It was a difficult agreement to reach, as our debates have clearly shown. I think everyone will agree with what has been said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, of course, climate change exists, but commercial vehicles are not vehicles that people buy for the sheer pleasure of driving or because they are passionate about them. They are vehicles that people use as a tool for their work, which means that the target of 147 grams of CO2 by 2020 strikes the right balance. I would have even preferred slightly more, but at least this is a proposal that seems to me to be more balanced than the one initially put forward by the Commission. That proposal would have resulted in technological targets being imposed on manufacturers, with the associated innovation costs having a major financial impact on end consumers, who we do not want to penalise, given that they are going through an exceptional period of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, I embrace the introduction of incentives for manufacturing high-efficiency vehicles and of penalties for car manufacturers that do not meet the targets. Therefore, all this is really a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also glad to see that there are penalties. I am pleased that we have been able to find common ground regarding penalties which are the same as those applied to passenger vehicles. For these reasons, I will be delighted to vote in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transition towards a low carbon economy and the achievement of the objectives set out in the climate change package mean that we need to establish rules to regulate CO2 emissions in various sectors, including the automotive sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am very pleased with the negotiations, which led to an agreement with the Council to limit emissions to 147g CO2/km by 2020. This is a realistic limit that also represents an excellent balance between environmental, social and industrial rules. I hope I also played my part in this as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.</p>
      <p sl="it">The agreement reached takes account of the economic crisis that the sector is experiencing and also makes reasonable allowances for the difference between the passenger car sector and the light commercial vehicles sector. Just as we saw with the regulation on passenger cars, the European automotive sector will also manage to develop green, competitive and environmentally beneficial technology for light commercial vehicles. I hope it will also manage to take advantage of the environmental challenge to invest even more in innovation and research.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, maybe we should question whether or not we might have achieved more if this measure had been introduced to improve the fuel efficiency of commercial vehicles rather than to reduce CO2. In practice, of course, it is the same, but one is seen as a cost to business, and the other as a saving.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Nuttall says that this measure will increase the price of vehicles by EUR 5 000. I suspect it will not increase it by a single euro. Let us have this debate in three years’ time and see who is right. The fact is that oil prices are now at USD 100 a barrel. That is more than the Commission estimated when it undertook its assessments. The potential savings to business are greater, and I wish the EPP would recognise this. The EPP has been talking on behalf of big business, of the manufacturers, instead of on behalf of all the businesses which use light commercial vehicles and which need more fuel-efficient technology to drive down costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The manufacturers have made great technological progress over recent years. We should be driving forward that ambition. I hope that the Commission will come back in its review in a couple of years’ time and ensure that this ambition has a chance to be properly realised.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal initially set a long-term emissions limit of 135g CO2/km for light commercial vehicles, to be achieved by 2020. However, in the unanimous opinion of manufacturers, it was technically impossible to respect this limit.</p>
      <p sl="it">If the report had been approved as it was, the level of CO2 would have been reduced by 0.00014% at a global level, compared to an extremely high economic impact of more than EUR 45 billion for Europe alone, which would inevitably lead to an average price hike of around EUR 3 800 per vehicle.</p>
      <p sl="it">Despite these problematic issues, an agreement was reached with the Council at first reading that sets the emissions limit to be achieved by 2020 at 147g CO2/km, subject to feasibility, which must be assessed by the Commission before January 2013. In any case, this decision is purely political and has absolutely nothing to do with real industrial or market conditions, or consumer interests.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, who has worked very hard and, most importantly, achieved an optimum result. It was not at all easy to reach an agreement at first reading on a regulation as complex as this one.</p>
      <p sl="es">The motor industry is of vital importance in the European Union. It is, moreover, an industry that is committed to the European Union’s objective of reducing emissions and to technological innovation.</p>
      <p sl="es">This agreement is a stable framework that gives legal certainty to our vehicle manufacturers. I believe that the targets for reducing emissions are both ambitious and realistic. Manufacturers will have to achieve 147 grams of CO2 per kilometre by 2020. I am sure that they are going to succeed, and they will therefore have contributed to the European Union’s objective of reducing emissions by 20% by that year.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, there are also other elements of interest in this new regulation, such as super-credits and promoting alternative fuels. Biofuels are clearly promoted, in line with the EU’s objectives regarding renewable fuels for 2020. I am highlighting this obvious fact because if the Commission continues with its hesitant proposals on biofuels, we will not achieve our objective for 2020.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I would like to end my speech by congratulating the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), who has just become a mother and has worked very hard and also helped to make this agreement a success.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, the shadow rapporteurs and everyone else involved in the work on this directive. We will now finally also have a regulatory instrument for emissions from light commercial vehicles, and that is important. The directive now needs to be introduced as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="sv">At the same time, we did not go as far as many of us would have liked, and I think we should talk openly and honestly about that. What we are seeing is an environmental and industrial policy decision that has clearly been influenced by the economic crisis and by the fact that so many European governments, conservative, right-leaning governments, have chosen to respond to this economic crisis by simply making cuts and not making any investments. The result of this is high unemployment and low demand, and it is affecting both the passenger car industry and the light commercial vehicle industry. Of course, this could be called realism, but what it amounts to is enforced adaptation to the economic crisis and a policy of cuts.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Commission was therefore more ambitious even than Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and that is unusual. I am grateful for the fact that this decision nevertheless contains a review of the emissions targets for 2014. I therefore hope that we will get another chance to show that we mean business when it comes to not allowing competitiveness and lofty ambitions on climate policy to conflict with each other, but instead enabling these two factors to drive each other forward.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, it is with reluctance that I will vote for the final compromise. The negotiations were dreadful, and to my mind, this vote is a decision imposed as a result of the power play within Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The major producing countries, supported by a majority of MEPs who are sensitive to the industry’s arguments, have succeeded in preventing us from setting an ambitious emissions reduction target. I would point out that the Commission had suggested a target of 135 grams per kilometre by 2020. Parliament is therefore being less ambitious than the Commission, and that is regrettable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The automotive industry, which fought against this text – and we have just had some more examples of this – has evidently not realised that it has everything to gain from pioneering a reduction in emissions, especially since the study by the European Federation for Transport and Environment carried out last November showed that technological solutions do exist. The study notes that car manufacturers in Europe reduced CO2 emissions for non-commercial vehicles by 2-10% in 2009, and that one Japanese manufacturer has all but reached its target six years early.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will vote for this compromise because we run the risk of destroying this achievement, as small as it may be, with a second reading. However, I would stress that we are not doing manufacturers any favours by defending the status quo and that, as far as the public authorities are concerned, by failing to encourage innovation, they are not fulfilling their role.</p>

I should like to note that CO2 emissions from these vehicles are currently around 200 g per square kilometre. Reducing this to 147 g therefore cuts this threshold by more than 25%. Furthermore, I would emphasise that marginal reductions are the most costly, so we should be careful.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also think that this particular category of vehicles cannot be compared to passenger cars, as has often been the case in this House. The cycles of production are much longer and it would have a mere 1.5% effect on CO2 emissions across the whole transport sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">If we do not establish our central aim, we will end up penalising a sector that has already suffered an abrupt contraction of more than 30%, above all, hurting small and medium-sized enterprises, which, just 12 hours ago, all of us in this House confirmed we wanted to support due to the huge economic and social role they play as the only true engine of employment in Europe. We must therefore be very careful.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the text before us is, indeed, a compromise and we would have liked to have been a little more ambitious here and there, particularly when it comes to the timing and the level of the penalties.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On the other hand, it is important that emission standards are established for this category of vehicles - something which seems to have slipped through the net a bit, seeing as a number of rules already exist for both passenger cars and goods vehicles. The trend is heading in the right direction, but – as you have said yourself – the number of LCVs has increased enormously in recent years and it looks as if that number will continue to rise in years to come.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to return briefly to speed limits. We in the Committee have proposed that the speed limit be set at 120 kilometres per hour from 2018, which is really not unreasonable. As you know, there is already a limit for goods vehicles, and I think that, for both environmental and road safety reasons, it would be advisable to lay this down in law. It seems to me that you have to do that at European level, because there is little sense in leaving this to Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Consequently, Commissioner, I would like to invite you to revisit this issue, together with your colleague, Mr Kallas – he is here in the Chamber with us – study it and put forward a proposal.

I welcome the compromise that has been reached. By restricting emissions to 147 grams per kilometre from 2020, we are setting very clear standards. This will create incentives for the development of new technologies to increase energy efficiency and combat climate change. The users of the vehicles will also benefit from these innovations, which will save them fuel and therefore money.</p>
      <p sl="de">Small vans are primarily used by tradespeople, small and medium-sized companies, farmers and winegrowers. They generally only travel short distances and are often driven for many years until the company is passed on to the next owner. Therefore, the costs of these vehicles must remain manageable. Higher investment costs must be funded on the basis of energy efficiency and energy savings. The long-term goal of 2020 leaves enough time for transition periods so that research organisations and the industry can develop and manufacture new engines. The target which we have set for ourselves is realistic, achievable and still efficient. I hope that it will receive broad support.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Setting mandatory and ambitious limits which are also realistic will pose a challenge to the innovative potential of the European automotive industry. It will act as an incentive to step up research and development efforts aimed at finding new design solutions which can be used to manufacture vehicles which are more environmentally friendly.

This is therefore a balanced position that remains ambitious, since the target of 147 grams in 2020 will give industry the time to make the technological leap while simultaneously encouraging it to be highly efficient. The extension of the amendment period until 2018 is positive and will make research into, and the production of, non-polluting vehicles more attractive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to make two comments by way of conclusion. Naturally, I welcome the fact that the proposal has been passed at first reading, and I did not fully understand the comments by our fellow Member just now, when he said that he preferred second readings. Secondly, like Mr El Khadraoui, I deplore the absence of speed limitation devices, as it means that we will continue to be overtaken on motorways by the only vehicles that no longer keep to the speed limit, namely, light commercial vehicles.</p>

This will be possible to achieve by creating incentive schemes for making vehicles more efficient and by imposing penalties on manufacturers who do not meet these targets.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I do not think that the new legislation on CO2 reduction should jeopardise the position of either car manufacturers or the customer. The new regulations must pay heed to the concerns of SMEs and European car manufacturers, which are asking for the gradual introduction of the pollution limits to start after 2015, as the vehicles which will be sold in 2014 are already at the development and production stage. The figure of 147 grams is an acceptable compromise compared to the figures which have been mentioned. However, the Commission must monitor closely relations between the car industry and users to assess this measure’s impact on prices and, by extension, on the activity of small enterprises.</p>

Approval of such a long-term goal was essential in this respect in order to provide industry with guaranteed security of manufacturing. On the other hand, we should not neglect the target limit of 147 g to be achieved by 2020. The initial short-term goal which has been set of a limit of 175 g, with a view to achieving the goal of 147 g by 2020, will significantly increase the cost of manufacturing light commercial vehicles, making them more expensive for many small companies which use them as tools for their daily work. I hope that this will not result in a marked drop in sales of new vehicles, which, in turn, would mean that technologically older vehicles which are responsible for much higher levels of emissions would stay on the roads longer.</p>

Overly ideological environmentalism always runs the risk of making tangible results less likely, resulting in harm being done to the environment.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my opinion, despite the fact that the long-term objective of 147g CO2/km by 2020 is not yet optimal, it could turn out to be more reasonable and realistic than what was originally proposed.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also welcome the planned incentives for eco-innovations but, in my opinion, a critical issue remains: the decision on emissions from so-called completed vehicles, meaning those built in a number of stages.

At the same time, it will help meet CO2 emission reduction commitments, in line with the European Union’s strategy.

These principles, rather than the narrow commercial interests of industry and business, should primarily guide the efforts towards innovation and the management of their implementation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This also applies to the case of vehicle emissions. Given that the transport sector accounts for a substantial proportion of CO2 emissions, an appropriate part of the efforts at reduction should be focused on this area. It is therefore important to pursue an increase in vehicle energy efficiency, a reduction in fuel consumption and, in general, the development of low carbon technologies. This is now made possible by scientific and technical developments, which take into account the progressive and inexorable scarcity of fossil fuels at the very outset, something that it is already vital to heed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first, a brief remark to Mr Pargneaux who asked what the plan was for the next few years.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, of course, as we have agreed, the Commission must assess the progress made and ascertain whether things are feasible. That is what we have all agreed, but, of course, we have reason to believe that it is feasible because our impact assessment has already demonstrated this. We are aware of the cost and consequences of whatever we do, and the level we choose to impose. So we believe that it will be feasible but we are, of course, looking into this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would just like to say that reopening the debate as to the 2020 target could lead to uncertainty in planning, so, of course, we should now stress that a long-term target has been set. Many manufacturers appreciate that because that gives them the long-term planning that they really need, the predictability that they need. In the end, they appreciate that. That was also an answer to Mr Vlasák and his concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just a brief remark to Mr Nuttall – I do not know if he is still here – or rather to Mr Nuttall’s father, because he has absolutely nothing to worry about, except that his son is using figures from a source I am not familiar with. The fact is that the cost of doing this is much less than Mr Nuttall claimed and the money saved in fuel consumption is greater than the cost.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, in the end, Mr Nuttall’s father will not only save money, but will have a net gain. He can also explain that his children and his grandchildren will have cleaner air. At the same time, what we are trying to do here is to boost innovation in a very important industrial sector for Europe. This is what we are trying to do.</p>

In every case, it turned out that the manufacturers could comply with legislation faster and with less expenditure than they had claimed. I would not be surprised if the same thing happens with vans.</p>
      <p sl="en">So regulation for cars is in place. Now it is the turn of vans. I appreciate the very broad support for this piece of legislation. The next thing we have to look into in this field will be heavy-duty vehicles and there, of course, I greatly look forward to working in cooperation with the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me respond briefly to many of the points that have been made.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Schlyter said he thought it was bad for European industry and it would result in more light commercial vehicles being built in Asia. I have to say that I simply do not understand that remark. We are setting the most challenging targets in the world by far, much tighter than the rules in the States or anything that exists in China or the Far East.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Wils compared this regulation with the passenger car regulation. In my view, that is a false comparison. The opportunities to reduce emissions in passenger cars are much greater in terms of lightweighting and changing the fuel mix. There is already a much higher diesel penetration in the vans market. Of course, by their nature, vans are already much more utilitarian and are bought by business customers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Nuttall, I am afraid, has not stayed for the end of this debate, but he is wrong in the figures that he has given. This will result in overall cost savings for many businesses. I have to say that I would have a little more respect for the remarks that he made if indeed the EFD Group had bothered to send a single representative to any of our trialogue meetings or to any of our shadow meetings to make the point that they are fond of quoting on behalf of small businesses.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I think this is a good result. It produces the best balance, first of all, in favour of costs for businesses, but also in terms of environmental improvement. Whatever view you take of climate change, fuel efficiency – using precious resources more efficiently – has to be a good thing.</p>

      <p sl="en">The agreement which has been reached with Council is the result of tough negotiations in the face of intense lobbying from industry. Throughout the whole process, we have resisted heavy pressure from manufacturers to weaken the regulation and, in particular, to reduce the ambition of the long-term CO2 reduction targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was a difficult dilemma, as many of us have car industries which are already struggling because of the economic context. But we knew from our experience with the passenger cars regulation that the car industry has made enormous progress in terms of innovation and developing cleaner technology because the legislative framework encouraged them in the right direction. We wanted to repeat this success with legislation for vans – not just for environmental reasons, but because greater fuel efficiency will ultimately bring costs down for many businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a compromise text which, although not as ambitious as we would have liked, will lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions from vans and contribute to the EU’s emission reduction ambitions for 2020 and beyond. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and shadows on their successful negotiations with the Council.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The road transport sector is the second highest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, and its emissions have not stopped increasing. All types of vehicles, including light commercial vehicles, should therefore be covered by regulations aimed at reducing these emissions. The objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be better achieved if there is legislation covering the whole EU, rather than national legislation with different objectives. That said, we need to combine ambition with realism and good sense. Therefore, and given that small and medium-sized enterprises are most likely to use light commercial vehicles, and that these make up 99.8% of companies and 67.4% of jobs within the EU, we should not pursue goals that might jeopardise them. I therefore agree with the target of 147 g of CO2 emissions per kilometre for new light commercial vehicles in the EU, if it is confirmed that this option is viable. I also welcome the fact that a single speed limit for this type of vehicle has not been introduced at EU level.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiation that I led by myself for the first year and then, during conciliation – the first conciliation procedure after the Treaty of Lisbon, I would note – with the guidance of Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou and the support of the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Simpson, has been more arduous and difficult than expected.</p>
      <p sl="it">Through this regulation, Europe’s 70 million bus and coach passengers will also enjoy a range of rights that until now were much reduced or almost non-existent in comparison with other means of transport.</p>
      <p sl="it">During negotiations on this important issue with three rotating presidencies, the goals we wanted to fulfil were as follows:</p>
      <p sl="it">a regulation that would protect non-discriminatory access to transport by bus and coach;</p>
      <p sl="it">a regulation that would bear in mind the particular characteristics of the sector, which involves small and medium-sized enterprises which could not have additional and excessive economic burdens imposed upon them;</p>
      <p sl="it">a regulation that would fill a regulatory vacuum that left the bus and coach transport sector in an anomalous position compared with other means of transport and would therefore ensure minimal guarantees for all passengers;</p>
      <p sl="it">a regulation that would protect the rights of persons with reduced mobility as much as possible, given the intransigent attitudes within the Council;</p>
      <p sl="it">a regulation that would bear in mind the needs of an ageing population for whom public transport will be an essential resource in the coming decades.</p>
      <p sl="it">The text voted on today is the fruit of a very hard-fought compromise, but one which pleases us given the direction taken in the debate and in the negotiation itself.</p>
      <p sl="it">The main problems were primarily encountered in defining the scope of application. In fact, the regulation applies to all regular services, whether regional, national or international, over a distance greater than 250 km. In any case, we have prepared a list of fundamental rights that cannot be ignored, irrespective of such a distance. These rights focus principally on the right to transport, as well as training, information and responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="it">At distances of over 250 km, the regulation essentially provides for compensation and assistance in the event of an accident, the rights of passengers in the event of cancellation or delay, and the rights of persons with disabilities or persons with reduced mobility. Furthermore, with regard to complaints, the carriers must set up and activate a system for dealing with complaints relating to the rights and obligations referred to in this regulation. The time needed to provide a definitive response cannot be more than three months from receipt of the complaint.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, each Member State must designate a new body or, better still, an existing body, responsible for enforcing this regulation. The Member States will be able to avoid implementing the regulation for a period of four years, which can be renewed once upon prior notification to the Commission of the reasons for this.</p>
      <p sl="it">Member States are also asked and urged to develop a future single ticket for each transport type and a single national body responsible for passengers’ rights in all means of transport. The final text can be deemed a pleasing and balanced compromise. The outcome of the conciliation procedure must be seen as a victory for Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to take part in this debate on the proposal for a regulation on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport. This is a very important moment, as our discussions on this legislative act are coming to a close after two years.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, on behalf of the Council, I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the European Parliament for its cooperation and for the sprit of compromise that allowed us to reach an agreement in the Conciliation Committee to the benefit of EU bus and coach passengers, in particular, as regards disabled persons and passengers with reduced mobility.</p>
      <p sl="en">The discussions among the three institutions have not been easy, but they were always constructive and guided by a spirit of compromise. The joint text on which an agreement was reached at the Conciliation Committee meeting, and which will hopefully be adopted today, represents a compromise across political groups. Therefore, I would like to pay tribute to all involved in the work on this legislative proposal and, in particular, to Vice-President Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, Brian Simpson – Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Cancian – the rapporteur, and the shadow rapporteurs, for their work. Together, they have had to bring the legislative process to a successful outcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">My thanks also go to Commissioner Kallas and his team and to their counterparts from the secretariats in Parliament and the Council. Together, they worked tirelessly in helping to move things forward. Last but not least, I would like to express my appreciation for the excellent work of the Belgian Presidency in securing the necessary support within the Council for the compromise reached in the Conciliation Committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that the joint text resulting from the Conciliation Committee meeting represents a fair balance between the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport and the interests of carriers, most of which are small- and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Council’s view, the main objective of the regulation is to grant rights to passengers travelling on regular services where the scheduled distance is equal to, or more than, 250 kilometres. Furthermore, a guaranteed number of rights will apply independently of the distance travelled. The new rules focus, in particular, on helping disabled persons and passengers with reduced mobility.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the discussions between the three institutions, we were able to find mutually acceptable solutions on a number of difficult issues, namely the scope, the rights of passengers in the event of cancellations or delays, compensation and assistance in the event of accidents, provisions easing the transition to the new rules, and finally, the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you already know, the Council approved the joint text at its meeting on 31 January 2011. This legislative act will therefore be signed tomorrow. Its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union can be expected in March.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, lastly I should like to congratulate Mr Cancian on his excellent work.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the legislative proposal on the rights of passengers travelling by bus and by coach that we are discussing today is the result of a very difficult process, including conciliation. Long negotiations on the night of 30 November 2010 at the Conciliation Committee led to a breakthrough and a compromise after more than two years of negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me convey my heartfelt thanks to you for making this happen. First, to Vice-Chair Madam Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her skilful leadership, to Mr Simpson, Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Cancian, the rapporteur, and, of course, we should also mention the Belgian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am grateful to Parliament for always having pushed for a high level of passenger protection. After the endorsement by the Council on 31 January, I invite you to also adopt this regulation and formally conclude the procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal on the rights of passengers travelling by bus and coach now completes the arrangements for the protection of travellers and will ensure that passengers benefit from the same basic standards of service quality wherever they travel in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The compromise text contains important achievements: it provides a set of basic rights for all passengers travelling by bus and coach. As Mr Cancian has already mentioned, there were difficult points unresolved until the last moment of negotiations. Some may say that the scope of the regulation on bus and coach services of 250 km and more is too limited and they would have wished to see passengers in local transport protected too. Others may claim that the text contains provisions whose implementation would be costly, in particular, for smaller operators. I am of the opinion that the text represents a very well-balanced compromise.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not forget that a number of basic rights apply to services of all kinds and provide special protection to the most vulnerable passengers. On the other hand, potential cost implications for the industry have been kept to a minimum. All in all, the compromise text constitutes a real advance for travelling citizens and for the image of the industry.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Cancian in particular for his hard work, because this was not a straightforward dossier, but we have reached a good conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="de">Compromises obviously always have their advantages and disadvantages. Some people will think that we have gone too far and others that we have not gone far enough. The process in the Council was not easy and, therefore, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Council for enabling us to reach a compromise at the last minute. I think the scope of the report is correct. We have said that three countries are not directly affected. However, because Luxembourg is involved in a cross-border context, there are actually only two countries which the regulations do not affect directly. In the case of local public transport, it will be easy to include provisions in the requirement specifications for tenders which state that passengers’ rights must be respected and reinforced. Therefore, it is not realistic to criticise us for excluding local transport. This can be dealt with at a regional level.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will give its overall support to this compromise. We see passengers’ rights as a complete package and we hope that it will be possible in the near future to produce a consolidated version covering the whole area, so that we can soon put in place rights which will benefit the citizens rather than the lawyers. In my view, there are still a number of problems, particularly with regard to the implementation, where the regulations are not useful to citizens and where they are not clear enough to establish passengers’ rights. Against this background, I would like to thank everyone involved for their hard work. I hope that we can achieve a large majority in plenary in support of this healthy compromise.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my thanks, and the thanks of the S&amp;D Group, to Mr Cancian, for his hard work on what was indeed a very difficult and very complicated dossier.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two questions spring to mind when you look at this particular agreement. The first is, ‘Is it ideal?’, and the second is, ‘Does it move us forward?’. In response to the first question, from a parliamentary point of view, I think we have to say that it is not ideal. By the very nature of it being a compromise, there are things there that Parliament has had to give up, particularly on the scope, where we would have liked to have seen a smaller distance before the regulation kicks in.</p>
      <p sl="en">But does it move us forward? Well, yes it does, because we will now have in place a similar set of rights for buses and coaches to those that we currently have for other modes of transport. It also moves us forward in our commitment to improving access to bus and coach travel for those people with reduced mobility, and indeed disabled people, throughout the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would just pick up on one issue, which concerns asking for staff to be trained to help people with reduced mobility and disabilities so that they can have the same access to public transport as those of us who are able-bodied have. I know there is a derogation for Member States to push this back for five years in this area, and I hope they will not use that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I think it is important for us to support this final agreement so that the rights for all the modes of transport are now in place. I know we will go forward in future to look at them again and revise them again, but I think we have made a step forward in this area and that Parliament should support the agreement that Mr Cancian reached with the Council in conciliation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, a long procedure has now come to an end, which is good news. There are some positive aspects to all of this. One is that the basic rights for people with disabilities include the right to information and the right to access. Another positive feature is that the damages paid by small and medium-sized businesses have been kept to a reasonable level, which was not originally the case. It is also good that we have reached an agreement, because otherwise, we would have been stuck in the conciliation procedure and there would have been no regulations at all covering one specific area of transport.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would also like to pick up on some negative points, as we have not been able to produce a genuine European solution. Although we say that the free movement of people, goods and services is a European principle, we have not reached a European solution in this area, if three countries are not included and other countries do not have bus routes of this length. The right of people with disabilities to be accompanied, which is something they often need in order to be able to travel, is only guaranteed over long distances. In addition, the clause on major natural disasters, which does not apply to air travel, because damages had to be paid in the case of the ash cloud, has been applied to buses and coaches. This means that poorer passengers in particular who are making short journeys will not be compensated and have no rights. That, of course, is not a good thing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, because of this mix of positive and negative features, we abstained from voting during the midnight session in the conciliation procedure and we will do the same today.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, despite the EU being a signatory to the relevant convention, the rights of people with reduced mobility are not taken into consideration in this dossier.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have mentioned this at the beginning of my comments on this report, because I think its most serious failing is the fact that we have always included the restriction ‘if possible’. Unfortunately, I am sufficiently familiar with these situations to be able to say that this ‘if possible’ generally results in it not being possible to provide an efficient solution for people with reduced mobility.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was particularly disappointed when a restriction was placed on the formats used to make information available about bus and coach travel. This has also been toned down, so that people with reduced mobility cannot even find out about where they can get assistance and so on.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are other problems resulting from the last round of negotiations, which Mr Cancian has really put his heart into, and I would like to thank him for that. He has made every effort to produce a good result, but his attempts have been blocked by the Council’s hard-hearted approach. Another aspect is the distance of 250 kilometres which has already been mentioned. I am afraid that longer routes will be divided up and that routes of 500 kilometres will be broken down into two parts, so that there is no risk of having to grant passengers their rights. This must be taken into consideration during the implementation process.</p>
      <p sl="de">One good feature was the introduction of an arbitration body, which will be helpful for consumers. Other positive aspects include the fact that the principle of constant improvement applies and that training will be provided for staff. However, in other respects, ladies and gentlemen, this is by no means a masterpiece of European legislation.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, I, too, should like to add my thanks to all parties involved in reaching this compromise, but I should especially like to thank Mr Cancian, who, I believe, found absolutely the correct possibilities for compromise on behalf of Parliament. With the inclusion of the rights of passengers travelling by bus and coach, we have, in principle, now introduced passenger rights in all modes of transport. Of course, it could be said that as between different modes of transport, these rights vary greatly, when it comes to levels of compensation, depending on the length of delay or the removal of a route served by that mode of transport. Yet, even if our passengers in the European Union may get confused in the initial years, this still represents a step forward in ensuring passenger rights, and the fact that these rights for passengers travelling by bus and coach are the very last to be introduced shows that this was perhaps the most difficult step of all.</p>
      <p sl="lv">I am particularly pleased about basic rights for the disabled and persons with special needs, and also that these rights apply to them on bus journeys of below 250 km, with the one exception referred to by Mr Simpson, namely, that operators offering these services may defer staff training. I very much hope that this will not be done maliciously, just as the Member States may not defer implementation of this directive for four years twice over, until the latest possible date. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the rights of passengers in all forms of transport have become an increasingly important topic of debate in the European Parliament in recent years. I must say that in many cases, I see problems which may arise from the application of passenger rights, and insuring against these problems will surely be a very lucrative area for many financial institutions.</p>
      <p sl="cs">On the other hand, fares will logically rise as a result of these new costs. It is nothing new that the Council has attempted to change the basic elements of the draft regulation fundamentally with regard to passenger rights in bus and coach transport. We are familiar with this position of the Council from previous conciliation proceedings. In this context, I would like to thank the Vice President of the delegation, Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Brian Simpson, and the rapporteur, Antonio Cancian, for a fine piece of work. They have achieved what is a genuinely very reasonable compromise.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I regard the following elements as being particularly positive:</p>
      <p sl="cs">1. the definition of long-distance transport as transport where the length of the entire route is in excess of 250 km, with the proviso that the regulation will also apply to people using the long-distance route only as part of their journey;</p>
      <p sl="cs">2. improving the position – even if it is not ideal – of people with disabilities and reduced mobility in connection with this mode of transport;</p>
      <p sl="cs">3. compensation and assistance in case of an accident. I would like to note here that, in the case of damage to equipment such as wheelchairs, compensation of the full amount is envisaged, which entails a level of uncertainty, and it will surely be necessary to clarify the formulation for insurance purposes, for example, through an upper limit;</p>
      <p sl="cs">4. the rights of passengers where journeys are disrupted or delayed are relatively clearly set out. I also consider the improved information for passengers to be positive;</p>
      <p sl="cs">5. like most of my fellow Members, I welcome the fact that the transitional period for implementing this regulation should be reduced to a maximum of four years. On the other hand, I am not at all pleased at the possibility of extending this period by a further four years.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I believe there will be no fundamental problem even in setting out the application of passenger rights on routes parallel with sections of long-distance transport in the near future. A question remains as to the setting of financial limits, of course, with the absence of an inflation supplement to adjust the financial limits in accordance with the euro exchange rate, so that the limits remain the same in real terms.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I believe the agreement is a good compromise. The ultimate aim is the further expansion of passenger rights on all forms of transport, and this additional step in bus and coach transport is definitely a successful outcome for the conciliation process. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left supports this outcome.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, it is good that following the debate and coordination of positions, the final text can be regarded as a very satisfactory and well balanced compromise. It manages to secure the rights of passengers without, at the same time, imposing a heavy burden on carriers, most of which are small and medium-sized enterprises. In particular, the outcome of the conciliation procedure can be regarded as successful for the European Parliament, and I congratulate it on this.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Taking account of the steady growth of this transport sector, the aim of this proposal is to establish EU-wide rights for the protection of passengers comparable to those in other modes of transport and to secure a level playing field between carriers from different Member States as well as the various modes of transport.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The regulation strengthens passengers’ entitlement to compensation for death, including reasonable funeral expenses, or personal injury, as well as for the loss of or damage to luggage due to accidents. Moreover, in the event of an accident, passengers are entitled to assistance to cover their immediate practical needs, including, where necessary, provision of food and clothes, transport, facilitation of first assistance, and accommodation. Where travel is cancelled or delayed for more than 120 minutes, passengers shall have the right to compensation amounting to 50% of the ticket price, in addition to the reimbursement of the ticket price.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The regulation also strengthens the provision of assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, which is very important. Passengers must receive updated information in real time by electronic means.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, improving the rights of passengers on regular bus and coach services is a desirable goal. However, some points in the proposal go too far. For example, passengers are entitled to up to two nights in a hotel if the departure of a regular bus service is delayed by more than 90 minutes. However, road transport is often subject to factors which are outside the control of the individual bus operators, such as traffic jams caused by accidents, poor weather conditions and inadequate snow clearance. The consequences of this will be costly liability cases where it will not be possible to apply the principle that the party responsible is liable for the damages.</p>
      <p sl="de">The most recent EU regulation on rail passengers’ rights is in a similar position. Companies now have to pay for delays which they have not caused. For example, the Austrian federal railway company is liable for the number of hours that trains are delayed, which amounted to a total of 2 800 last year, when they arrive very late from Germany. We must avoid inappropriate measures like this in future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the result of the conciliation procedure. When the regulation is implemented, bus and coach passengers, including those with reduced mobility, will have the same high level of protection that applies on other forms of transport. In addition, the regulation guarantees a high overall level of consumer protection and takes into consideration the fact that this transport sector consists mainly of small and medium-sized companies. The extreme requirements which would have made bus transport almost impossible have been removed, together with those that would have excluded the majority of the Member States from the scope of the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Bus and coach services which benefit the majority of citizens must also provide a high quality service for disabled people and people with reduced mobility. They should have the right to receive help and this must be provided free of charge in the interests of social integration.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to thank Mr Cancian for his efforts in obtaining this difficult compromise. Thanks to this regulation, bus and coach passengers can enjoy rights similar to those of passengers on other modes of transport, such as trains and boats.</p>
      <p sl="it">The regulation, which applies to all national and international services wherever the distance to be covered is equal to or greater than 250 km, also protects passengers using regular services over shorter distances. I am referring, in particular, to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, who have been guaranteed non-discriminatory access to transport, the right to compensation in the event of loss of or damage to wheelchairs, as well as training on disabilities for bus and coach employees.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am also delighted that an agreement has been reached on compensation for death, including reasonable funeral expenses, or personal injury, and loss of or damage to luggage due to accidents. I also consider it a positive step that passengers can choose between continuing the journey at no additional cost or reimbursement of the ticket price in case of cancellation, a delay of more than two hours, or overbooking.</p>
      <p sl="it">In terms of information for passengers, I think it would have been useful to provide them with information on connections with other means of transport, thereby also ensuring dialogue between bus and rail passenger transport services. Lastly, I am very pleased that during negotiations, we managed to research and guarantee the maximum level of assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, giving them the option of being accompanied at no extra cost.</p>

The people who vote for us and pay our wages expect us to take concrete decisions of precisely this kind. There have, of course, been comments in this Chamber to the effect that this is not the most important of matters in the wider scheme of things, and no doubt it is not. However, I believe that it is a very significant step forward which will make Europe and the European Union more humane and more open to the needs not of politicians, but of consumers, or, in other words, those who use the various means of transport.

      <p sl="da">Madam President, bus passengers on long journeys have more or less the same rights as air, train and boat passengers in respect of delays, cancellations, lost luggage and in a large number of other areas. This is fine in principle. However, I would nevertheless like to raise a couple of points of criticism. People with reduced mobility have been granted more rights in this regard here. However, not all buses can accept both disabled and able-bodied passengers at the same time, and not all buses can be converted to enable them to carry disabled people. Thus, there is still a long way to go in this area if we want to achieve the highest possible level of equality. Ticket prices for long journeys are most often kept as low as they can go in order to be able to compete with air traffic. I therefore consider it impossible for small bus companies to be able to pay all of the claims for compensation and rights that are being called for here. Their ability to be competitive will be severely reduced and they will rapidly come under threat of closure. This can hardly be in the interests of the Union, because the EU very much wants to support small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="de">Some of the successes have already been mentioned, but there were also disappointments, in particular, with regard to the scope and other small points which have been referred to. By coming to this compromise on bus and coach transport, we have established passengers’ rights on all types of transport. The next step which we need to take is to create a common, coherent and efficient framework programme for all passengers’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is particularly important for the credibility of the EU among the citizens of Europe that we put in place fair and clearly defined rights. In order to be credible, we must ensure that the rights across all the different means of transport are coherent. The criteria relating to air passengers’ rights must not be fundamentally different from those of rail passengers, for example.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, it is particularly important that we do not base our framework programme on the lowest, weakest standards. Instead, we must set ourselves ambitious goals on behalf of the citizens of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I would, of course, like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his efforts, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Simpson and everybody who has contributed to the result; the Belgian Presidency should not go unmentioned, either.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, let me start with a point of criticism, addressed to the Council, in particular. I regret the fact that the scope applies only to journeys of 250 km. From a European perspective, it would make sense if all cross-border links fell under the provisions of this directive. Even when confined to those 250 kilometre journeys, the directive barely received enough support from the Member States to pass.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Judging not just from this dossier, but also from many other dossiers, it appears that it is becoming increasingly hard to get a majority of Member States to reason in the interests of the consumer or from a European perspective, and I find that very worrying.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Having said that, this regulation completes the list. We now have European rules on passenger rights for all transport modes. The next step – and the Commissioner has announced that he will take action on this – must be to learn from the experience gained in the various sectors and to achieve a more integrated approach to passenger rights. This should be enforced on the ground, in particular.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This regulation will mean a step forward, in particular, for people with reduced mobility. They will no longer be refused access and will be able to count on assistance, if needed. That is important, in my opinion. As with other transport modes, compensation has been provided for in a number of cases and there are accommodation arrangements for stranded passengers in the event of lengthy delays.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For these reasons, we want to support this compromise. We are not doing so with a great deal of enthusiasm, because the regulation will not come into force until two years from now. However, it is a step in the right direction and it represents a compromise between the Council’s extreme position, on the one hand, and our more ambitious targets, on the other.</p>

Unfortunately, this cannot be said for the directive on coach passengers’ rights, which, following a long conciliation procedure, ultimately distanced itself from the principles that had been requested by the European Parliament. It is indeed good that we now have minimal fundamental rights, but it is unacceptable that the agreed 250 km route denies these rights in three states. In addition, these rights are minimal in three to four other states because there are perhaps only one or two coach routes that long.</p>
      <p sl="et">Furthermore, it is not acceptable that cross-border coach services were excluded, irrespective of the distance, and also we cannot support the eight-year period given to Member States where implementation of the said directive is not compulsory. Unfortunately, the Estonian Government supported these very conditions, and furthermore demanded a longer route. Now we need to ask ourselves whether we are indeed supporting passengers’ rights, or those of coach companies and their profits. In any case, while I support the citizens of the European Union, I do not understand why part of Europe is excluded from this directive.

      <p sl="en">However, we must have a sense of proportionality and look at what effect this will actually have. We have to compare the real benefits for users with the true costs to businesses in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">This House and the Commission often take a ‘one size fits all’ approach, but we must accept that passenger rights differ across different modes of transport. Air travel is not the same as bus travel. Most importantly here, the difference lies with the number of small- and medium-sized businesses in this sector. I believe everyone in this Chamber knows the importance of reliable and profitable bus and coach services to our local economies, and it is for this reason that I strongly support the introduction of the 250 km rule. It is simply not right that small local companies providing very local or regional services should have these burdens put upon them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Of course, we need to protect the rights of passengers, and particularly those with disabilities, but the initial proposal – as Philip Bradbourn has said – if adopted, would have serious consequences for small transport providers. Indeed, it would put many of them out of business. For that reason, the conciliation process was vital and the compromise reached strikes a fair balance between passengers’ rights, on the one hand, and those of service providers, on the other. I fully agree with Mr Bradbourn that you cannot equate sea passenger rights, air passenger rights, rail passenger rights and bus passenger rights all in the same package. For that reason, talking about a consolidated package simply is not something that is feasible and realisable.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, in recent years, the European Parliament, together with the Council, has adopted laws relating to passenger rights in air and rail transport. It is therefore logical for us now to adopt an analogous measure for bus transport as well, despite the fact that travellers in Europe still prefer individual transport and that standards on bus and coach transport itself are rapidly improving.</p>
      <p sl="cs">However, our effort and enthusiasm for regulation should have clear boundaries. It is logical to define basic standards in the European Union for cross-border travel, protecting vulnerable groups of passengers and securing their rights. On the other hand, an effort to extend rights to local transport, and attempts to secure the maximum possible compensation or to regulate down to the last detail, constitute an inappropriate interference in the internal market. It is clear that all superfluous obligations mean greater costs for transport operators, which will ultimately be reflected in ticket prices.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As a former mayor, I therefore followed with concern the proposal to include urban and suburban transport within the scope of the directive.

Unfortunately, the European Council proved to be more short-sighted and inflexible on this matter. I deeply regret that the European Council is unable to recognise that we are living in a rapidly ageing society. The number of people with disabilities will skyrocket overnight. We should realise that all EU citizens will suffer from this problem, and sooner or later, everyone will require assistance. Lastly, I would like to stress that our work is not yet done.

I particularly support the right of disabled people to information and assistance services, at least in line with what was finally agreed in the conciliation process. Public transport is a fundamental and important part of the everyday lives of people with reduced mobility. It was not easy to reach the compromise, and therefore I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and all members of the negotiating team for the work carried out.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, with the Liberals, I will abstain during today’s vote on the regulation concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport. This is the last link in the package on the protection of travellers, after air, rail and sea travel, but unfortunately – as has been said – it is much less ambitious. This has been said by, among others, Mr Simpson and Mr El Khadraoui, for the Socialist Group; this is exactly what they said. As a result, people will have to travel more than 250 km to be protected by this regulation. If you travel from Brussels to Amsterdam by air, you are covered; if you travel by coach, you are not. And this is all the more unjust, I might add, since those who use this type of transport are often the least well off.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, it is a good thing that we now have passengers’ rights across all means of transport, but these rights cannot conceal the fact that rail transport, which is environmentally friendly, has once again been put at a severe disadvantage. The railway companies pay track access charges for every kilometre travelled, but the same system does not apply to buses and coaches, which benefits bus companies. Railways are included in the Emissions Trading System, but buses are not, which again puts buses at an advantage and trains at a disadvantage. If a train is delayed, 25% of the fare is repaid in compensation after an hour. In the case of buses, it is two hours.</p>
      <p sl="de">All these advantages are unacceptable. This is why we need an integrated approach. We need passengers’ rights across all the different means of transport, but we also need fair basic conditions. It must not be the case that one passenger only receives compensation after three or five hours, but for another passenger, the period is one hour. A great deal remains to be done here and this is not a good compromise in this respect. I do not understand why environmentally friendly rail travel is constantly being put at a disadvantage.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The most important benefit for passengers will perhaps be the definition of their rights in cases of cancelled or delayed services, since it penalises transport operators for organisational failures in transport with an obligation to reimburse up to the entire fare, as well as reimbursing other losses up to the amount of 50% of the fare. The only issue which, in my opinion, might have been better handled, is that of the time schedule exemptions, which allow Member States to postpone implementation of the directive by four years, with a subsequent extension of this time period by a further four years.

This debate illustrated very well the difficulties Mr Cancian, as well as we in the Council, the Commissioner and the experts had to overcome. I do not believe that this is the best of all possible worlds for travellers using bus and coach transport, but I believe that perhaps the main question we must ask ourselves is whether the situation will improve once the new legislation comes into effect. I believe that we can answer this question with a definite yes; that bus and coach passengers will indeed enjoy more rights in the future, even if this is not a perfect compromise.</p>
      <p sl="hu">A compromise is about having to come to an understanding with each other on difficult issues. This was noticeable in almost all speeches, the question of where the boundary is, beyond which we would guarantee rights to such an extent as to cripple important economic actors and small and medium-sized enterprises, whose situation we are trying to keep an eye on. At the same time, however, we very much intended to provide additional rights to passengers. I can very well understand those who are looking at the issue from the perspective of those with disabilities. I believe that we took a significant step forward in this respect as well. I feel that this is a well worked-out part of the draft and I trust that the legislation will bring about progress for these people, indeed, especially for these people.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would only like to remind the honourable Members that the Hungarian Presidency is thinking in terms of a strong European Union, a European Union which provides additional rights to its citizens and always puts citizens at the centre of these strong policies.

      <p sl="it">It is a balancing act between the need, on the one hand, to protect small and medium-sized enterprises – a topic we have discussed at length over the last few hours – involved in the bus and coach transport sector and, on the other, the need to protect the rights of persons with reduced mobility, disabilities, old-age pensioners, persons with temporary reduced mobility, and vulnerable users overall, in order that there may also be fewer disputes. This is the balance we were looking for and, with everyone’s contribution, we hope we have achieved it.</p>

The Council did not agree with the European Parliament’s amendments, and it was therefore necessary to launch the so-called conciliation procedure. The chief points of the agreement that was reached are mainly compatible with Parliament’s original proposals. It is particularly important that the regulation will apply to all regular domestic and cross-border transport, and Member States will be able to apply exemptions for regular services and some specific services for up to eight years. In the event of an accident, passengers will have the right to compensation of up to EUR 220 000 per person and EUR 1 200 for baggage. Transport providers must, moreover, provide basic assistance in case of an accident (food, clothing and medical assistance), and lodging for up to two nights. In the event of a delay in excess of 120 minutes or the cancellation of a connection, transport providers must offer passengers the option of continuing the journey, rerouting the journey at no additional cost to the passenger or refunding the ticket price. If this is not within their power, they must reimburse the ticket price and pay an additional 50% of the ticket price. The agreement also protects the rights of people with disabilities and people with limited mobility. For the above reasons, I fully support the adoption of the report.</p>

Given the stable growth of this transport sector, I believe that it is essential to establish rights for the protection of passengers which apply throughout the EU, similar to the rights enjoyed by passengers travelling by other means of transport, and also to ensure equal conditions for carriers, no matter which Member State they come from or which means of transport they operate. In view of the fact that these rights focus, in particular, on the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, this initiative deserves our support. It is of key significance that the resolution establishes compensation rights for passengers who have been injured in coach accidents. The provisions mean that passengers will be entitled to compensation in the event of death or injury or loss of, or damage to, luggage caused by an accident.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to congratulate Mr Cancian on his work. I am pleased that we were ultimately able to reach agreement in the Conciliation Committee. Our principal achievement is, of course, the matter of passengers’ rights to compensation and assistance in the event of an accident, guarantees for passengers in the event of cancellations and delays, and guaranteed rights for disabled persons and passengers with reduced mobility (PRM). I am particularly pleased by the fact that passengers with reduced mobility have been included in the document, as I mentioned previously, but, at the same time, I have well-founded concerns in this respect: in the case of air passengers, neither the airlines nor the airports know exactly which passengers are to be regarded as passengers with reduced mobility. It is common for help to be refused to mothers and father travelling alone with small children as a result of this lack of knowledge among carriers and airports. I would therefore like to make the following appeal: our work will not be complete after voting through the document during the plenary session. We also have a duty to monitor whether the regulation is properly applied.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his hard work, which has been exceptionally effective. Up until now, there has been no guarantee of appropriate protection for passengers travelling by bus and coach, since it was the only form of transport which was not subject to any EU regulations in this respect. One of the consequences of the changes which have been made will be that passengers will be able to claim compensation in the event of an accident. The fact that assistance for disabled persons will be guaranteed by carriers, and that an accompanying person can travel at the carrier’s expense as part of this guarantee, are further extremely significant points.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I will not hide the fact that it was an exceptional challenge for me personally to be able to play an active role in the conciliation procedure for the first time in history under the Treaty of Lisbon. During the negotiations, which lasted until late into the night, together with Mr Cancian, we succeeded in voting through a compromise making the provisions mandatory for distances of over 250 km. It should be noted, and this is quite a significant point, that 12 fundamental rights are guaranteed in the regulation, particularly for disabled persons. We should currently be placing a great deal of emphasis on an appropriate information campaign to ensure that the citizens of the European Union are aware of the rights to which they are henceforth entitled.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The legislation on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport, which we will be voting on today, might be considered unambitious. The compromise reached after much wrangling is, however, better than nothing at all. It is regrettable that the proposal for a regulation only applies to national and cross-border bus and coach journeys that are at least 250 km long. This being the case, Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus, for example, will not be affected at all. It is also unfortunate that the legislation will only enter into force years from now. Four, or possibly even eight years, is a long time to wait at bus stops for new legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There is, of course, something good to be found in the compromise achieved. In the original Council position, there were only three basic rights for passengers regardless of distance. I am pleased that there are 12 in the final compromise, and that special attention is being paid to the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. The entry into force of the regulation will make it easier for the disabled to travel on buses and coaches. At the same time, it puts them on a more equal footing with other passengers.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When the new legislation enters into force, the Member States must ensure that the regulations are implemented effectively and appropriately. This is in the interests not only of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility but also of our other citizens that travel by bus or coach.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The regulation voted on today marks a highly significant success as it is the first time that the rights of passengers travelling by bus and coach will be protected by law. After two years of difficult negotiations, the European Parliament and Member States have reached agreement on the key points which will consolidate the rights of passengers using this means of transport. These include compensation in the event of the journey being delayed or cancelled, compensation for loss of, or damage to, luggage, as well as the assumption of liability by companies and the provision of assistance in the event of accidents. Non-discrimination against and the provision of assistance to persons with disabilities and reduced mobility, as well as the right of passengers to be informed before and after their journey, have been incorporated into the regulation as fundamental rights which will be applied regardless of journey length. The regulation does not impose any new technical requirements, but requests that carriers assume liability for their passengers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We also took into account the current economic climate and its impact on companies targeted by this regulation, by offering an exemption period of four years, which can be renewed once.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that once this regulation comes into force in 2013, it will help achieve the objective of harmonising and consolidating passengers’ rights at EU level, no matter which means of transport they choose.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, at the request of Baroness Ashton, the Hungarian Presidency of the Council is representing the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission during this debate. Baroness Ashton, as you may know, is travelling in northern Africa and in the Middle East this week.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish to thank you for raising the issue of the situation of human rights and the rule of law in Russia. Despite some very positive signals from President Medvedev last year, the actual human rights situation in Russia and, in particular, in the Northern Caucasus region, remains deeply preoccupying. Violence, harassment and intimidation against activists, lawyers and independent journalists are of great concern to us.</p>
      <p sl="en">The number of cases to support this statement is unacceptably high. The brutal attacks on Russian journalists, Oleg Kashin and Anatoly Adamchuk, and environmental activist, Konstantin Fetisov, are among the latest reminders of the climate of insecurity and intimidation that journalists, activists and human rights defenders in Russia face in their day-to-day work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite assurances at the highest levels, the perpetrators are rarely brought to justice and sentenced. Accountability for violence and intimidation against human rights defenders – let me mention the cases of Mrs Estemirova, Mrs Politkovskaya, Mrs Barburova and Mr Markelov among a great number of others – remains an important test for the independence and efficiency of Russia’s judiciary. As long as the crimes remain unsolved, a climate of impunity will continue to prevail.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are, however, also positive developments. I should mention here the Moscow City Council’s decision to authorise peaceful and regular demonstrations – which were forbidden until last year – such as those in support of Article 31 or the day of press rallies. We have welcomed this decision. At the same time, we continue to receive reports about arbitrary arrests of peaceful demonstrators, including opposition leaders, at these very same authorised demonstrations, as well as others across the country. This is a matter of serious concern to us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and association are preconditions for the development of modern societies. All of these freedoms are enshrined in the Constitution of the Russian Federation. They also form part of the commitments that Russia has entered into as a member of the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe. The EU urges Russia to uphold its commitments and guarantee this right to citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Medvedev has asked his Presidential Human Rights Council to examine the Khodorkovsky, Lebedev and Magnitsky cases. We very much welcome this decision. The EU has made no secret of its serious concerns with the way these cases have been handled.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Medvedev has often spoken out against what he has termed the legal nihilism prevailing in Russia. The EU stands ready to support Russia’s efforts to overcome this, starting with the reform of its judicial system. Convinced that real modernisation needs established respect for the rule of law and its equal and fair application, we have put the rule of law at the core of our partnership for modernisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, concrete activities have already been prepared – for example, the setting up of an appeal system for civil and criminal court cases in Russia – in close cooperation with the President’s administration and the Council of Europe. We are ready to work with Russia on this, as well as on new projects on corruption and the Hague Conventions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation in the Northern Caucasus is particularly worrying and needs urgent action. We welcome the new strategy for economic and social development and the efforts by Deputy Prime Minister Khloponin, but much more needs to be done to provide a lasting response to the barbaric acts of terrorism against civilians. The continuing immunity and impunity of security forces operating in Chechnya is fuelling grievances and terror in the region and is a source of deep preoccupation for us.</p>
      <p sl="en">We pay tribute to all those who have lost their lives and to those who have fallen victim to aggression because of their professions or beliefs, as well as the courageous ones who cannot be deterred from their civil engagement in such a precarious environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall, the current report has not been a very positive one. However, there are positive signs in the situation of human rights in Russia. These are often offset by backward developments and, overall, have not been enough to achieve real improvements, but we must not be discouraged.</p>
      <p sl="en">The significant body of European Court of Human Rights case-law provides an important incentive for the development of Russian law with regard to respect for human rights. We are engaged in a serious dialogue with Russia on human rights. Russia accepts this and, of course, also uses it to criticise what it sees as imperfections in the EU. We will continue with that dialogue. There is no alternative.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, those who know Russia will know that what passes for a legal system there does not measure up to the normal criteria of the Rule of Law.</p>
      <p sl="en">This affects Russia’s relations with the rest of the world and equally with its own citizens. It follows that, when the European Union deals with Russia, it must take into account a variety of non-legal factors, notably, political interference, corruption and occasionally violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The relationship between Russia and the West, then, is subject to uncertainty, not to mention the complete absence of transparency and accountability. Where Russia’s own citizens are concerned, they lead lives more affected by arbitrariness and violence than can be reconciled with the European Union’s commitment to universal human rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the model of power sharing between the state and the members of society determines the content of political decisions, while the predictability of the decision-making process and the correct enforcement of decisions are guaranteed by the honesty, professionalism and independence of the judiciary.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union and Russia can do business together only if there is compatibility between their power-sharing models, their decision-making mechanisms and their judiciary systems. The achievement of such compatibility is an exercise in partnership and cooperation, in consensus, confidence and interoperability-building, not in advocacy, lecturing and finger-pointing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia is a full member of the Council of Europe and a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights. Consequently, it is the Council of Europe that has competence to look into the functioning of democracy and the Rule of Law in Russia. The European Union should therefore rely on the Council of Europe in order to achieve, together with Russia, a common area of freedom, democratic security and justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, since the European Union is itself on the way towards accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, it should use its future status as a party to that convention to accelerate convergence and interoperability with Russia in the field of democracy and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Years ago, when the European Parliament had little more power than a militant NGO, its only tools were the rhetoric of naming and shaming. Today, after Lisbon, we are a powerful political institution. This imposes on us more responsibility, pragmatism and self-restraint. We should not let ourselves be led by emotions. We should not be casual with our values either. We are not allowed to be simultaneously prosecutor and judge. We should not act on the basis of mere allegations, rumours or various interest lobby groups. Our credibility, generated by the fairness and maturity of our approach, as well as our firmness and openness, is the best weapon we have in our dialogue with Russia at a time when our citizens have instructed us to develop a strategic partnership with Russia, not to restart the Cold War.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we consider Russia to be an important partner of the European Union. Therefore, we expect Russia to respect her international obligations and implement the constitutional rights of her own citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is a fact that violations of human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law have become commonplace in Russia. Unlawfulness and widespread corruption led to the emigration of 300 000 citizens from Russia last year alone. It is hard to envisage both foreign and domestic business investments in such a climate.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Russian authorities are evidently implementing unconstitutional law and order. The situation in the North Caucasus is one of the vilest examples of that. The Russian constitution provides a basis for a multi-party system, but de facto it has become a one-party system with a marginalised parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to ask the representative of the Council which punitive measures and sanctions will be applied against the Russian officials who are directly responsible for human rights abuses and perversion of the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union must be consistent in its policy towards third countries. It would discredit the European Union if we turned a blind eye to some severe offences in some countries, while imposing sanctions on other countries for identical offences. We cannot continue normal relations unless concrete improvements are made in Russia. We have to face the truth.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite its excellent constitution, the Russian Federation is still not a state under the rule of law, because there is a huge gap between constitutional law and constitutional reality. The fundamental requirements of a functioning state under the rule of law – an independent judiciary and a free press – are unfortunately lacking. As one sarcastic commentator said: ‘The best Russian court is in Strasbourg’. The fact is that around one third of the cases brought before the European Court of Human Rights come from Russia. Russian citizens do not have any confidence in their own courts, which only rarely dispense justice. This is also clear from the fall in the number of appeals.</p>
      <p sl="de">The country is headed by two lawyers, President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin, who have repeatedly expressed their intention of combating legal nihilism. However, their words, which are usually followed by completely contrary actions, have been shown to consist merely of legal cynicism. None of the courts in Russia dare to pass judgment without consulting higher authorities. This system of telephone justice has created judges who are no longer independent and who are more concerned about their own safety and progress than about justice. The Khodorkovsky case clearly demonstrates this. An employee of the justice system has recently said that Judge Danilkin’s judgment was dictated to him from above. The reconviction of Khodorkovsky and Lebedev is a sign that the rule of law in Russia remains in the era of the gulags. As in Soviet times, the judgment was made in advance by the political leadership.</p>
      <p sl="de">Controlled democracy goes hand in hand with controlled justice. Although the Russian justice system is the embodiment of the punitive state, it fails completely when it comes to solving, prosecuting and passing judgment on politically motivated crimes. The attacks and murders of journalists have created a climate of fear and oppression.</p>
      <p sl="de">Conditions in Russian prisons are also appalling. One example of this is the case of Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who uncovered a case of corruption and, as a result, was imprisoned arbitrarily and without charge. He died a horrible death in prison because of a lack of medical treatment.</p>
      <p sl="de">A modernisation agreement between the EU and Russia will only be successful if it is based on a modernisation agreement between the Russian leadership and its own population. This involves ensuring that the rights of the citizens, which are guaranteed under the constitution, are finally respected and fulfilling the obligations which have been entered into with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Russia needs to make the transition from a controlled democracy to a developing democracy. Essential prerequisites for this include free and just elections to the Duma and the Presidency, an easier process for registering political parties, which meets European standards, and a fair election campaign which gives all the candidates the same opportunities and access to the public media.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Russia is an important partner for the EU on many fronts, but we cannot pretend that Russia is a genuine democracy with a rule of law. Unsolved murders of journalists and human rights defenders to politically-motivated show trials with acquiescent judges say it all in my view. Why, then, is Russia tolerated as a member of the Council of Europe? That is a very good question.</p>
      <p sl="en">Undoubtedly, the Kremlin treasures this international legitimisation of a government described in the US diplomatic cables recently leaked by WikiLeaks as a virtual Mafia state.</p>
      <p sl="en">Conversely, the Council of Europe is discredited by its continued acquiescence towards Russia’s authoritarian government. The European Court of Human Rights has a backlog of 27 000 cases from Russia alone, yet a Russian judge on the court is able to order the British Government to give British prisoners the right to vote. This not only exposes the absurdity of Russia’s membership of the Council of Europe, but also encapsulates why the Council of Europe is, in my view, increasingly ignored internationally. Sadly now, and as a result of this, many Britons, including politicians, think it is time for the UK to review its membership of this organisation and its very intrusive court.</p>

For example, Mr Tannock mentioned Mr Julian Assange, a dissident publicist and founder of the WikiLeaks site, whose actions I do not, for all that, endorse. He has been detained for weeks in the UK because of a totally outrageous and ridiculous extradition request from Sweden, and it is plain to see that this could be a step towards his being handed over to the US.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, Mr Assange has been accused of rape by two young women, one of whom actually pressed charges on the grounds that the condom tore during consensual intercourse. The other accused him of surprising her in her sleep following earlier consensual intercourse. Who are they trying to kid? It is obvious that if these two young women did not want to be ‘raped’ by Mr Assange, they should not have slipped into his bed naked! They have not been outraged; they have been honoured.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we are having this debate today because the Russian leaders and, in particular, President Medvedev, have themselves so often emphasised the importance of the rule of law to the modernisation of Russia.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At the same time, though, we are finding many specific examples of things which are impeding that very modernisation; for example, if I look at corruption, which is reportedly continually on the increase, despite a good, new corruption law being in place, or if I look at the Yukos case; or the repeated arrests of opposition members and the human rights activists who were awarded our Sakharov Prize.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The modernisation that is being declared in Russia has not yet actually become a reality. Given that we are supposed to be working together with Russia on the Partnership for Modernisation, and supposed to be negotiating an EU-Russia agreement, I find it unbelievable then that only five sentences in the progress report on the Partnership for Modernisation have been devoted to the modernisation of the rule of law. I also think that we need to develop more expertise at home.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret the fact that this debate was put on the agenda at such short notice that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was not able to be here. In recent months, Baroness Ashton has worked with the Council to improve internal EU coordination on cooperation with our strategic partners, including Russia. With regard to her efforts to achieve a coordinated position, I think it would have been sensible to involve her in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">None of the other strategic partners of the EU is as close to us as Russia, either geographically or in relation to our historic experiences. This is why we take great interest in the internal political developments in Russia. At this point, I would like to make specific mention of the work programme drawn up jointly by the coordinators of the Partnership for Modernisation, both in Russia and in the EU. This joint work programme for modernisation contains important measures which will provide active support for the development of the rule of law in Russia. This is the right way of ensuring that our partnership brings real benefits, in particular, for the citizens. The initiative to modernise Russia launched by the Russian President gives the country’s international partners the opportunity to begin a fruitful cooperation with Russia. We must make use of this opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="de">As my fellow Members have already said, if the modernisation process is to be sustainable, it must not only be based on technological developments. A modern Russian economy must be founded on the reliable principles of the rule of law. Only when citizens and business people can rely on the rule of law will they have the courage to introduce innovations and make investments. Let us take the hand that Russia has reached out to us and help the country to modernise.</p>

It is also no wonder that we are so interested in the situation in the most important of our neighbours. It is now turning out that there are some very alarming trends emerging in the country. I would like to quote from some social research recently carried out, according to which only 3% of Russians believe that they have any influence over political life in their country, 61% believe that they cannot defend their rights effectively and 82% believe that state representatives do not observe the laws enacted and in force in Russia. This is a sorry state of affairs in a country whose development is so important to us, but relations between Europe and Russia should not, under any circumstances, stop at development in a strictly economic sense and economic modernisation. Human rights and the rule of law are also important aspects upon which we should concentrate, as is the case for our other neighbours, including Belarus, for example.</p>

      <p sl="de">In recent weeks, we have discussed the stability of the Mediterranean region on many occasions and we have defined what the concept of stability does not consist of, namely, authoritarian structures. At the same time, this means that for Russia, stability cannot be based on political influence over the courts or the persecution of journalists and of people who stand up in support of human rights. Therefore, from my point of view, it is always the right time to discuss this issue.</p>

The Kremlin regime, by its unwillingness to bring about justice and transparency, can be seen as complicit in these crimes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yesterday, the young assistant judge, Natalya Vasilyeva, dashed the network of falsehood around the Khodorkovsky trial by declaring that the verdict was not reached by the judges, but was dictated to them from above.</p>

Let us talk to them and engage with them on trade, as we need to. Let us endeavour to discuss with them human rights, as we should, but let us not allow their leaders to launder their money through Europe’s banking systems, to educate their children in our schools or universities, or to take holidays in our holiday resorts.

      <p sl="en">I would like to ask the Council and Commission Representatives here whether they are prepared to take measures against those who violate human rights, in the manner indicated in Parliament’s resolution of 16 December 2010, which called for an asset freeze and visa bans on those 60 officials implicated in the case of Mr Magnitsky, who unfortunately died in prison in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Would there be one or two courageous foreign ministers – or indeed Ms Ashton’s representatives – who would take up this initiative, and if it proved to be true that Judge Viktor Danilkin did write the verdict on Khodorkovsky and Lebedev taking direct orders from the Moscow city court, would such a judge be on their list?</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, Russia is one of the most important and most stable partners of the European Union. It is a country where democracy does not have a very long tradition, and it might be said that Russia is still getting used to democratic rule. We must also remember that it is a country which is still struggling with relentless Islamic terrorism, and the social standing of the security services is therefore higher than it is over here. From this standpoint, it is necessary to judge the frequent departures from our usual standards for the democratic functioning of a state in a principled and sensitive way. It is good to have proper discussions with our Russian friends on all of the issues that concern us regarding the running of the country by the Russian authorities. However, this dialogue must be businesslike, in a spirit of partnership, and motivated by an effort to improve the functioning of the democratic system in Russia, rather than by the lecturing of a self-styled custodian of global democracy. Let us negotiate with Russia as with a friend, in a correct manner, openly and decently. After all, we have a common interest in the peace, harmony and prosperity of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, I wish to thank all the Members for the pertinent questions they raised during the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I very much share the concerns expressed here by many of you. I believe that the European Union as a whole will have to continue raising these concerns at all levels with our Russian interlocutors. We should not shy away from speaking directly when we have real and concrete issues to raise. If we are to act as strategic partners – and I believe that we are strategic partners of Russia – we must also be prepared to tackle difficult issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two things in particular delighted me during this discussion. The first is that nobody questioned the fact that Russia is an important strategic partner for the European Union. Second, there was a general consensus in this room that modernisation and the establishment of a fully-fledged democracy and the rule of law has not yet finished in Russia, and there are many problems with the workings of democracy there.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will certainly bring all the points raised to the attention of the High Representative in order for us to follow through the various means at our disposal. I am sure the coming visit of the Russian Government to Brussels on 24 February will provide us with a good opportunity to reiterate our concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia is a permanent issue on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council. You may know that since last year, a regular European Council meeting has been dedicated to discussing issues with our strategic partners. This happened first – and most recently – in September 2010, and I think Mr Van Rompuy will do the same in the course of this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">I shall now answer some of the specific questions Members have put to me. First, on Ms Hautala’s question on human rights, I would point out that the High Representative takes Parliament’s resolution of December 2010 very seriously. The circumstances surrounding the deaths in pre-trial detention of Sergei Magnitsky and Vera Trifonova must be duly investigated and the Foreign Affairs Council will, of course, pay special attention to that. We continue to raise these and other concerns at all levels, not only in the twice-yearly human rights consultations, but up to summit level, insisting on Russia upholding international commitments. Any decision on restrictive measures would be for the Council to take. Such instruments should be wielded wisely on the basis of clear evidence. First of all, we keep calling on Russia to ensure a proper investigation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would say to Ms Oomen-Ruijten that human rights are at the core of the negotiations on the new agreement and will be addressed on a number of fronts. We can assure you that the commitments of the EU and of Russia to uphold human rights, including those of persons belonging to minorities, will figure very prominently in this agreement and indeed constitute an essential element of the future agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I will briefly sum up some of my previous points. The rule of law and independence of the judiciary must remain an integral part of the modernisation effort currently under way in the Russian Federation. The European Union must stand ready to support Russia in these efforts. Freedom of speech, assembly and association are the building blocks on which all Western democracies rest. Russia should uphold the legal commitments which it has entered into as a member of the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the OSCE.</p>
      <p sl="en">The North Caucasus region remains a source of deep concern for us. We must encourage Russia to seek a sustainable solution to this endemic problem in the region. The important thing to bear in mind is that, in spite of the many concerns we have and the number of challenges Russia is currently facing, there have also been a number of positive developments. We must take President Medvedev at his word and continue to engage in a serious dialogue with Russia on human rights. So if there are cases, we have to be alerted and we have to follow what is happening in Russia very closely.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you very much for your valuable comments. The High Representative will be duly informed of your opinion.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The international press has discussed at length the case of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and there actually seems to be every indication that this case has been exploited for political purposes. The recent statements made by Judge Danilkin’s press officer clearly show the Russian justice system’s lack of independence. On the other hand, it is important to stress that this is not an isolated case. On the contrary, the NGOs operating in Russia regularly report that the standards for a fair trial are not met in this country. Furthermore, in September 2010, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly asked the authorities in Moscow to adopt reforms to guarantee the independence of the justice system and to end the harassment of lawyers. Lastly, it is important for us to stress the critical situation in the North Caucasus, a region where a climate of impunity reigns and where, even worse than this, victims are afraid to defend themselves so as not to put themselves even more in danger. If they want to show their credibility through announcing their intention to respect the rule of law, the Russian authorities clearly need to make greater efforts than they have done so far.</p>

      <p sl="en">The rule of President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin is not compatible with the rule of law. For more than 10 years, Putin and Medvedev tolerated, and possibly protected, an appalling catalogue of abuses and crimes, including stage-managed trials, press control and political murder.</p>
      <p sl="en">The horrendous record of lawlessness in Russia is not a question of private delinquency. The real problem is state-sponsored lawlessness. The Russian justice system, and indeed the Russian state, never dealt with crimes aimed at journalists, human rights campaigners and whistle-blowers in the army or in the judiciary. The lawlessness in Russia was regarded for too long as an accident or as a problem beyond state control.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU policy should hold the Russian authorities responsible for their collusion with criminal elements. Recent developments seem to indicate that the second Khodorkhovsky trial was conducted at the behest of high political figures. The extrajudicial record of the Russian state is already a tradition. The EU’s policy should take stock of this deplorable practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">The usual soft EU rhetoric is not appropriate. It should be replaced by a resolute policy, including credible warnings that future cooperation with Russia requires an immediate improvement in Russian law enforcement.</p>

      <p sl="pl">At the start of his term of office, Mr Medvedev promised Russians a ‘dictatorship of law’ and full democracy. The Russian President is, I think, aware of the fact that his country is struggling to build a democratic state under the rule of law and to create a modern economy which can respond to global challenges. Recent events in Russia, in particular, the numerous attacks on journalists and representatives of independent non-governmental organisations, and the judgment handed down in the Khodorkovsky case, mean that there are grounds for wondering whether there is any real understanding of human rights and fundamental freedoms behind the noble-sounding demands. Russia’s observance of its international obligations can also be considered controversial in a number of respects. The unresolved conflicts in regions such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria and Abkhazia and South Ossetia should be ended as soon as possible, in accordance with international law and the obligations undertaken by Russia. Russia should fulfil unconditionally all the provisions of the 2008 agreement between Russia, the European Union and Georgia. In particular, the representatives of the EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM Georgia) must have guaranteed and unlimited access to the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, in order to guarantee peace and stability in these regions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, the aim of the Services Directive, which entered into force in December 2006, is to open up the market for service providers in the European Union and get rid of all protectionist barriers, arbitrary hindrances and any discriminatory rules.</p>
      <p sl="it">In any case, the European Parliament has always insisted that this directive must not form a pretext for dangerous deregulation and liberalisation of the sector, thereby harming workers’ rights. The country of origin principle, which was criticised as paving the way for social dumping, was discarded and replaced by the destination country principle.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, development of the European services market plays an absolutely essential role in stimulating economic growth in the European Union. It is therefore very much to be welcomed that the European Parliament is closely examining the way in which the Services Directive is being implemented. Further measures to support the proper development of the European services market are also essential. Our overriding aim was to facilitate the provision of services throughout Europe. We are therefore alarmed to note that some of the Member States are showing a tendency to enact and apply laws which are in no way justified by the directive’s provisions. Artificial barriers are thus placed in the way of the activities of service providers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At present, as many as 90% of new jobs are created in the services sector. I therefore believe that an efficiently functioning directive is an essential condition for the development of the single market, and a key project for the European economy.

The aim of the directive should have been to create greater competition in Europe, assisting in the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, however, the real aim appears to have been to beat down and attack our small and medium-sized enterprises. In Italy, there are sectors that represent real strengths, such as beach concessions, in which the owners have invested all their possessions and made enormous sacrifices. Now, thanks to this directive, they have lost everything.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is not the system we should be bringing in, with a bureaucratic Europe and major corporations and multinationals that want to invade Italy and overpower our enterprises.

However, the implementation of the directive is stalling. The main problem areas are the failure to comply with the scope of the directive, delays in creating points of single contact, shortcomings in administrative cooperation and differences in mutual assessment. The report I have supported considers it very important to set up the points of single contact rapidly. They will be able to handle everything necessary for cross-border service provision, including information that is easy to understand on the formalities and administrative procedures of a given country. Services represent up to 40% of the gross domestic product of the Union. The elimination of unnecessary obstacles and delays could make a significant contribution to increased competitiveness and the creation of new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there has been a misunderstanding from the earliest days of the European Union as to what we mean by a free market in goods and services.</p>
      <p sl="en">When my constituents voted in favour of EEC membership in 1975, they understood the common market to mean mutual product recognition. If you can sell a bottle of mineral water in the UK, you should be allowed to sell the same water in France, Germany or Italy and vice versa. What they found in practice is that it means standardisation – that ‘the mineral water has to contain the following minerals but not any of these’, that ‘the volume must be not greater than x and not less than y’ and so on. You can then find that a product that was never intended for export can be criminalised in its own nation of origin.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is what we have seen again and again, both with goods and with services. Instead of having an increase of consumer choice, we have a restriction of consumer choice, often driven by one particular producer somewhere in the European Union which happens to meet a load of specifications anyway and which sees EU legislation as the way to export its costs to its competitors. This is why our share of world GDP continues to shrink and how my country has shackled itself to a cramped and confined regional bloc.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I remember when the Services Directive first went through this Parliament in the last mandate, how controversial many of the elements were. I also remember personally, as the rapporteur for the trade and services report, the great controversy when I spoke about the need to liberalise many services – financial services, health services, education services, water services – to provide consumers with more choice and better services, rather than relying on clapped-out old state monopolies, which quite often taxpayers were underfunding.</p>
      <p sl="en">Here, we have this definition of services of general economic interest, as if somehow the disciplines that allow us to have a wonderful choice when it comes to supermarkets or other types of services do not apply to water, education and health. It is time that we moved on from the politics of 30 years ago when certain things could only be state-provided. The implication has been that they have been underfunded and not provided well.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to explain why the majority of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has abstained from voting on this directive. It is good that we have made a decision and that the rights of people with disabilities are being respected. However, that is only the case over longer distances. Many of the other points are not worthy of a European directive. For example, because the directive only covers journeys over 250 kilometres, there are many countries where it does not apply. Cyprus, Malta and Luxembourg have no rights, in just the same way as some other Member States which do not have bus routes that are longer than 250 kilometres. The free movement of people, goods and services is one of Europe’s central principles. Now it is the poorer passengers who are not protected, because some Member States have no system of passengers’ rights. This is why we have abstained. There are some positive aspects, but also many negative aspects, and this is the reason for our abstention.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, the proposal for a regulation tabled by the Commission in 2008 aims to introduce new, Europe-wide rights to protect bus and coach passengers which are similar to those applied to other means of transport, thereby assuring equal conditions of competition between carriers and the various modes of transport within the different Member States. A long and difficult negotiation with the Council, including recourse to a conciliation procedure, was required in order to reach the text voted on today.</p>
      <p sl="it">The final text can be considered a very satisfying and well-balanced compromise, since it succeeds in guaranteeing passenger rights without simultaneously imposing heavy burdens on carriers, which – lest we forget – are mostly small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="it">The result of the conciliation procedure can quite reasonably be considered a success for the European Parliament, since some of our main requests were incorporated, namely in terms of its scope, fundamental rights for passengers irrespective of distance, derogations and, lastly, providing for accidents, cancellations and delays with suitable forms of reimbursement, assistance and compensation for passengers.</p>

We must be aware that at distances of less than 250 km, the rights of the most vulnerable, of disabled people, old-age pensioners, and persons with reduced mobility, are not addressed at all in this measure.</p>
      <p sl="it">If it is true that homogenised quality standards are being established, it is just as true that excluding local transport seriously limits the number of passengers affected. Implementation over the course of the next four years will allow the sector to prepare itself as well as possible, but we will also need to monitor the establishment of the enforcement bodies.</p>
      <p sl="it">The result of this process represents a victory for Parliament and is a positive sign of our attention to citizens’ needs.

      <p sl="it">Mr Mastella will allow me to disagree with him on the idea that this measure represents a great victory for our citizens. One cannot but note that citizens are only protected if they travel further than 250 km by coach or bus. Where is the protection for the rights of citizens of Europe if – as Mrs Meissner has already stressed – entire States such as Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are excluded from this protection?</p>
      <p sl="it">These are the reasons why our group abstained in the vote. We did not vote against the report because some rights are protected, such as those of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. That is why we abstained.

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, first of all, I wish to say that it is excellent and important that we concern ourselves with the rights of our citizens. Whenever rights are spoken of, we must remember that obligations come with them and so there are no rights without obligations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There is a lot that is good and positive about the report on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport. We also need to remember that pan-European bus and coach companies differ greatly from one another. For example, in Finland, there are many small family firms, and we might ask whether we should be continually burdening these small companies with new costs and obligations, since they are struggling to make their enterprises profitable.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I can say that we have shown flexibility on this issue in a variety of ways, and that the rights of different passengers have been taken into consideration. Acknowledging the needs of the disabled always brings with it clear added value. It is very important that we ensure that disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility are better able to travel and get about generally, and that greater account is taken of their needs. This is a good thing, but as I said earlier, the matter is slightly inconsistent, as when we talk about rights and obligations, it is also important to make sure that costs do not rise too high for those small companies in the bus and coach transport industry.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is unfortunate that some Member States are outside this regulation and, indeed, that it applies only to journeys of distances greater than 250 kilometres. I certainly would have preferred the ALDE line, where passenger rights would have applied to journeys of a much shorter duration. I am, however, pleased to see that some of the basic rights in the regulation apply to passengers travelling over shorter distances. Those rights, in particular, apply to persons with a disability, or indeed, persons with reduced mobility. Some of these rights include non-discriminatory access to transport and disability-related training for staff on coaches and buses.</p>

The level of rights being sought in terms of compensation is disproportionate to the type of service operating in rural areas.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, every year, more than 70 million passengers in Europe travel by bus or coach. It is high time that a regulation came into effect protecting passenger rights in the same way as in air, water or rail transport. Passengers will have 12 basic rights applying to any length of journey. In addition to this, in the case of journeys in excess of 250 km, they will have the right to compensation for delays, assistance in case of accident or death, compensation for lost or damaged baggage, and better information. For small countries in particular, however, the 250 km minimum is rather extreme. I applaud the fact that passengers with reduced mobility will have the right to special assistance, as is already the case with air transport. In the future, I will certainly support the introduction of a common regulation to unify the already existing regulations on passenger rights in various transport systems, which will substantially clarify the entire system of passenger rights.</p>

I particularly welcome the recognition and consideration of the special needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. Guaranteeing the right to compensation for loss or damage to a wheelchair or other device providing mobility, and the training of staff on buses or coaches in the area of transport for disabled persons, are becoming important tools in the fight against discrimination and against the social exclusion of these people.</p>

We have been able to achieve a balanced solution which protects the rights of bus passengers and guarantees the continuing existence of small and medium-sized operators. The regulation covers journeys of more than 250 kilometres and gives bus and coach passengers the right to claim compensation if journeys are cancelled, overbooked or delayed by more than two hours. Bus operators are often small or medium-sized companies which would be brought to the brink of ruin by excessive claims for damages. This is one successful feature of the regulation which will ensure that compensation payments cannot get out of hand. As far as the distance of 250 kilometres is concerned, there is no reason why we should not allow the new legislation to come into effect and then see how it can be improved.</p>

This Parliament must remember that many coach firms are privately owned, are relatively small and are under an increasing financial pressure as a result of the huge rise in fuel prices experienced over the last 12 to 18 months. For many private firms, and indeed government transport schemes, additional cost will only result in two things: higher ticket prices for customers and reduced routes.

The new emissions standard which has been introduced is acceptable to manufacturers and users and is important in terms of the costs incurred by users as a result of increased prices for such vehicles. This group of users is made up, primarily, of small and medium-sized enterprises, tradespeople and family businesses, and we have just been discussing EU instruments aimed at providing financial support to small and medium-sized enterprises during this part-session. One of the goals in this area is to reduce barriers to the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.

This is, of course, an absurd claim inasmuch as we do not have an internal market when it comes to the unitary patent. It costs around ten times more to obtain a patent in the EU than it does in the United States, corresponding to an annual turnover of EUR 250 million for our enterprises.

Patents play a significant role in the development and growth of a modern economy and in supporting scientific research. Given that global markets are becoming ever more competitive, we cannot afford to put off decisions on this matter any longer. We therefore need to step up work on the creation of a unitary patent market.

Moreover, it is well known that there are currently two legal systems in Europe, with different characteristics and rules. I think it would have been a better idea to start harmonising them.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, starting enhanced cooperation is not only against the spirit of the European Union, but it also harms the internal market, which is thereby subject to geographic segmentation and distortion of competition between Member States, meaning that some States will certainly find themselves worse off than others.</p>

It is quite incredible that a government that does nothing to spread Italian culture throughout the world, that cuts funds to cultural institutes and fails to value the language of the country that is host to the largest number of World Heritage Sites, can ride roughshod over the language issue while our enterprises have actually always asked for patents to be drafted only in English, which is now the lingua franca of the global economy. However, we have reached a result that allows anyone submitting patents to do so in their own language.</p>
      <p sl="it">Madam President, there was nothing that made it compulsory for Mr Barnier to force this through with such a hasty vote before the opinion of the Court of Justice which, as we know, will be expressed during the first week of March and will deal mainly with two crucial points: the use of one’s national language to defend oneself before the European Union Patent Court and the very legitimacy of creating a patent court. As we well know, these are important issues to resolve before taking any decision. Hence, the Italian delegation of the Democratic Party (PD) decided to abstain.</p>

General Electric have done some surveys right across the European Union which show that most people believe that progress out of recession can only be achieved through innovation.

We have to try and aim for a system right across the European Union that is as easy and as cost-effective as it is in the USA.</p>

In this case, I agree with the opinion that Article 168(4b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides a legal basis for the proposal, since the direct aim of the measures passed on this basis is to protect public health, which is the case when (and I quote) ‘laying down maximum permitted levels of contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs’.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, regulations ensuring that foodstuffs are not contaminated by radioactive substances came into being after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. This is a very important issue, in particular, from the point of view of public health, but it is, at the same time, a difficult subject. Implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon means that certain regulations need to be updated, including these ones, even though there is a dispute between the European Commission and Parliament’s proposals as far as the legal basis is concerned. Parliament cites Article 168(4) of the Treaty of Lisbon, whereas the Commission cites Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty. It is important to reiterate the need to protect consumers, but also to emphasise the need to protect farmers, who should receive compensation for the losses they suffer following an accident. The debate we have held has also shown the large differences in opinion when it comes to assessing possible threats, including levels of radiation caused by accidents or those from natural sources. The fact that an increasing proportion of the European Union’s market is occupied by imported agricultural products and foodstuffs from various parts of the world should also be highlighted, since public health standards, including those ensuring that foodstuffs are not contaminated by radioactive substances, must be met.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, the insertion of a new recital in the proposal for a codification of three regulations adopted between 1987 and 1990 laying down levels of radioactive contamination in case of radiological emergency brings the necessary ex post motivation to an existing article and justifies the right for the Council to exercise direct power in terms of adopting a regulation to promptly endorse the emergency measures proposed by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Belet, that this cannot be disassociated from the article to which it refers. In any case, in the light of the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, we need to clarify whether this justification provides sufficient motivation for the reservation of implementing powers to be exercised by the Council and whether those implementing powers delegated to the Council are properly defined and framed.</p>
      <p sl="it">Citizens’ interests in the effective management of post-accident situations must be guaranteed. The measures designed for this purpose include streamlining the procedure in the event of nuclear emergency and the clear assignment to the Commission of a supervisory role, which, at the same time, clarifies the regime of its acts.</p>

The TDCA has exacerbated the economic asymmetries between the two parties to the EU’s advantage, as it has increased its exports to South Africa.

      <p sl="en">I voted against this report as I question the propriety of granting Iceland any concessions regarding the importation of fisheries produce into the EU when they continue to persist with their approach on the management of mackerel, with the negative impact this is likely to have on EU pelagic fishermen. Established in 1994, the agreement permits Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway to participate in the EU’s single market without conventional EU membership. In exchange, they are obliged to adopt all EU legislation related to the single market except those pieces of legislation that relate to agriculture and fisheries. Iceland can export fisheries produce to the EU tariff-free.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a difficult pill to swallow that having blatantly disregarded international management of the mackerel stock and, in 2010, declared a catch of 100 000 tonnes, Iceland has the freedom to export its entire mackerel catch into the EU. While the fisheries concessions granted to Iceland may not have changed in the new agreement, Iceland’s behaviour with regard to fisheries management has certainly changed and in this light, I would question if this agreement should be ratified.</p>

Two of these agreements, on financial mechanisms for the 2009-2014 period, provide for an overall package of EUR 1.8 billion.

The other two agreements are related to fisheries concessions for Iceland and Norway between 2009 and 2014, and provide for their renewal.</p>

The most recent five-year period of financial contributions expired in 2009 (EUR 1.467 billion). The Commission’s current proposal includes four agreements. These agreements provide for a package of EUR 1.8 billion, comprising a 31% increase in the EEA financial mechanism and a 22% increase in the Norwegian financial mechanism, compared to the period 2004-2009. This outcome reflects the negotiating directives agreed by the Council, which requested a ‘substantial increase’ in the funds. The EEA funds will be made available to the 12 most recent Member States, as well as Greece, Portugal and Spain. Priority sectors include the environment, climate change and renewable energy, civil society, human and social development and the protection of cultural heritage. The funds earmarked for Norway will be made available to the 12 most recent Member States. Priority sectors include carbon capture and storage, green industry innovation, research and scholarship, human and social development, justice and home affairs, promotion of decent work and tripartite dialogue. Two protocols concerning certain fisheries concessions for Iceland and for Norway for the period 2009-2014 provide for a renewal of the previous 2004-2009 protocols with unchanged concessions for Iceland and a relatively modest increase in concessions for Norway, on the basis of which Norway will renew the fish transit arrangement.</p>

The agreements make provision for an increase in the European Economic Area Financial Mechanism for climate change and renewable energies, civil society, humanitarian and social development, and the protection of cultural heritage.

Since the Agreement on the EEA entered into force in 1994, the EEA/European Free Trade Association states – currently Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway – have contributed towards reducing economic and social disparities in the EEA. These contributions were always agreed for five-year periods, and the aim is now to renew the agreements for the 2009-2014 period. In parallel to those negotiations, but independently of them, negotiations were also launched on the basis of the two bilateral fish protocols with Iceland and Norway, and concluded on 18 December 2009. With regard to the outcome of the aforementioned negotiations, it is worth highlighting, in particular, the significant increase in the financial mechanism, although the position of Iceland is unchanged due to the severe crisis that it is experiencing. As regards the agreements concerning certain fisheries concessions for Iceland and Norway for the period 2009-2014, I share the favourable opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, which highlights the modest increase in concessions for Norway, on the basis of which Norway will renew the fish transit agreement, which expired on 30 April 2009.

This agreement, which I believe to be the first step of many towards a new EU civil aviation policy with Brazil, is to establish the general framework for developing relations in this field.

It was hoped that Liechtenstein would become associated with Schengen at the same time as Switzerland, in 2008.

      <p sl="pt">The agreement on the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland – the Dublin/Eurodac agreement – was concluded in 2004. Given that an open borders policy for the free movement of people had existed for decades between Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the association of the latter country with those negotiations would have been logical. Although it expressed its interest, Liechtenstein was left out, since it had not yet concluded a savings taxation agreement with the European Community.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I welcomed the results of the vote. It is my firm belief that every measure which means that the citizens of all the EU Member States enjoy equal rights deserves our support. I am all the more pleased because these equal rights relate to key matters such as the freedom to cross borders. As a Pole, I remember the numerous difficulties involved in crossing the border before Poland became a member of the European Union, and so I regard every step we take towards the full and mutual abolition of visas as being of huge significance. The Macovei recommendation is also significant for another reason. In the explanatory statement, the rapporteur notes that two third countries, namely Canada and the United States, are still imposing visa obligations; on three Member States in the case of Canada, and on four Member States in the case of the United States. I believe that the measures taken recently by Parliament, such as Written Declaration 89/2010, will have the intended effect and bring about a change in the visa policies of the United States and Canada.</p>

Since the changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon imply that the common policy on visas with third countries is now the exclusive remit of the EU, all the Member States will benefit from the visa waiver with Brazil. In addition, the existing bilateral agreements between the Member States and Brazil are still ensured, as they include some categories of passengers that are not covered by the EU-Brazil agreement.

It is important to note the conditions for non-application of the country of origin principle in certain matters or activities, in particular, with regard to different legislation contained within other EU instruments and to the set of guarantees that the administering state should provide for posted workers. This matter caused a long discussion, and prevented the early application of the directive.

The aim of this directive is to open up the market for service providers in the European Union, phase out the Member States’ protectionist barriers on the exercise of service activities and fulfil the principle of freedom of movement, the basis for the common market. In other words, European service providers must be able to work without bureaucratic hindrance anywhere in the EU. The directive covers various services, whose gross domestic product (GDP) accounts for 40% of EU GDP. We expect the implementation of this directive to potentially bring a profit of up to EUR 140 billion and for EU GDP to grow by 1.5%. However, for the directive to deliver the expected benefits, it must be properly implemented. Unfortunately, it has been established that not all EU Member States managed to transpose it fully into national law by the end of 2009. I agree that setting up the points of single contact is an essential part of effective implementation of this directive.</p>
      <p sl="lt">These PSCs are aimed at providing the required information and creating an opportunity to carry out all procedures by electronic means and not only in the national language.

The quality of the implementation of the directive by the Member States is just as essential as respecting the deadlines set for that purpose.</p>

Firstly, the points of single contact (PSC). Their purpose is to facilitate the provision of services across Europe. In practical terms, entrepreneurs who wish to set up a business abroad or provide cross-border services should be able to use a PSC, which will explain all the formalities and procedures they must complete in order to set up their business.

This directive is an essential step towards a single market for services, which should enable enterprises, and small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, to provide better services at a competitive price throughout the internal market and to unlock the enormous economic and job-creation potential of the European internal market in services. For service providers to properly enjoy the benefits of the Services Directive, the full and timely implementation of the provisions of this directive should be ensured in all Member States.

In my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Employment, I mentioned the legal uncertainty that currently surrounds Services of General Interest (SGI) and the absolute need for their specific nature to be taken into account. While there is unanimous agreement on the need to clarify the concepts (economic and non-economic SGI, social services), Parliament is still very much divided on the subject of how to achieve this. I advocated the need for a clear legislative framework, if necessary, through a framework directive. Although I regret that this is not in the final text, I congratulate Mrs Gebhardt, who has managed to mention these issues in her report on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which focused mainly on mutual evaluation and the points of single contact. Paragraph 45 mentions the need for a legislative framework, admittedly at a sectoral level, and recalls the commitment made by Mr Barnier in his recent communication to submit proposals on SGIs in 2011. Hence, I am waiting for those proposals to be submitted and for measures that can finally provide an answer to service providers and local and regional authorities, but also recognise the vital contribution that these services make to social and territorial cohesion.</p>

This is why it is important for the directive’s area of application to be clearly and transparently defined. There is a need not only to draw a clear distinction between the services coming under this directive and services of general interest, but also to safeguard services of general economic interest by means of a legislative framework with this in mind.</p>

In addition, Parliament has always insisted that this directive must not form a pretext for dangerous deregulation and liberalisation of the sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this report, which does well to note the (often unjustified) delays and the disputes over the implementation of the Services Directive, which concerns a sector that accounts for some 40% of gross domestic product (GDP) and jobs in the EU. Furthermore, the directive also has the advantage of allowing European enterprises – and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises – to provide better services at competitive prices. The correct and transparent transposition of the Services Directive would have the positive effect of unlocking the enormous economic and job-creation potential of the internal market, estimated at 0.6-1.5% of European GDP –something the European Union desperately needs. Therefore, the complete transposition of the directive throughout the EU will introduce aspects of competition to the internal market that will result in advantages for citizens and enterprises.</p>

It is important to consolidate the enormous potential for economic development and job creation that the European internal market for services represents, as it constitutes an essential step towards a real internal market for services, which should enable businesses and, in particular, SMEs, to provide citizens with better quality services at competitive prices throughout the entire internal market. I hope that the aims of the directive can begin to be achieved in the near future, and that the entire EU and its regions can benefit from this, thus contributing to real economic, social and territorial cohesion through the creation of decent, sustainable, quality jobs, and in terms of improving the quality and safety of services provided.</p>

It is true that in France, it has been only partially transposed into national law. And with good reason! To avoid a public debate, and therefore any further outcry, Mr Sarkozy’s government deliberately chose not to use a framework law but to integrate the principles of the directive into all relevant texts. In fact, there is only one principle: the full and absolute freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services! Splitting up the legislative amendments has resulted in a process that lacks transparency. The scope of the text is still not clear: some social services that are supposedly excluded are, in fact, covered by the directive. Those that are actually excluded today have simply been put on the back-burner: every three years, the Commission can suggest getting rid of the exemptions. Moreover, as for the most scandalous clause in the text, the country of origin principle, although it has been formally deleted, it has sneaked back in thanks to the possibilities opened up by the directive on the posting of workers and the regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations.</p>

The parliamentary own-initiative report by Mrs Gebhardt, which proposes an initial assessment of the directive’s implementation, thus touches on some of these difficulties, and especially the uncertainty surrounding social services and services of general economic interest (how are they defined? which areas are affected?), as well as the lack of transparency of the transposition process in some Member States. Moreover, it must be said that France stands out due to its problematic lack of transparency and inflexibility in implementing this directive. It has scores of decrees and implementing laws, and a restrictive interpretation of the exemptions set out in the directive, which raises doubts as to the future of some services, such as childcare and care for the disabled.

The report is also too optimistic about the possibility of jobs being created.</p>
      <p sl="nl">No research has ever been carried out into the number of jobs created, nor has there been any into the number of job losses that have occurred or the quality of jobs available, let alone the increased pressure on labour conditions following the judgments of the Court of Justice. Moreover, the report fails to mention a single word about the legal uncertainty which will arise as a result of the fact that no clear alternative has been formulated for the principle of the country of origin. The Greens, however, did request a review of the ban on Member States imposing additional requirements on service providers, but that request was rejected. I voted against.</p>

The Services Directive implementation deadline passed a year ago, and I welcome the fact that Parliament is shining the spotlight on Member States’ progress. The services sector accounts for a large share of the EU’s GDP, yet the cross-border trading of services still falls well short of the level of trade in goods. This report shows that implementation is incomplete and that the full benefits of the directive have not yet been reaped by citizens. The points of single contact (PSCs) in each Member State, which inform service providers of rights and opportunities in other EU Member States, are an important provision of the directive. In my view, the crucial issue raised by this report is the huge under-use of these PSCs. I firmly support the proposal that an effective information campaign be led to raise the visibility of PSCs. The Commission should earmark funds for a promotional campaign. However, I also underline the role to be played by authorities on the ground in the Member States who have the contacts and expertise needed to ensure this campaign is well targeted. Unless this is done, the Union’s efforts to foster the cross-border trading of services will be in vain.</p>

      <p sl="el">The implementation of the abortive anti-labour law on the ‘liberalisation’ of services, known as the Bolkestein Directive, promotes sweeping reactionary changes at the expense of the working and grassroots classes. The opening up of the services markets, which account for 40% of GDP and jobs in the EU, involves abolishing collective agreements, striking at the wage, labour, social and other rights won by the workers and selling off strategic public sectors of the economy which are the property of the people. The European Parliament has called in its motion for a resolution on services for the EU and the bourgeois governments in the Member States to speed up capitalist restructurings, so that the directive on the ‘liberalisation’ of services can be implemented in full, based on the Commission’s recent communication entitled ‘Towards a Single Market Act’ in 2011, the aim being to make further drastic cuts to the workforce and to enable the monopolies to penetrate new, profitable sectors for capital. The creation of points of single contact (PSCs) for service companies in all the Member States is a pretext for speeding up the implementation of the anti-labour directive, the ratification of which has triggered a storm of protest by workers in all the Member States. The Greek Communist Party voted against this motion for a resolution on the implementation of the Services Directive.</p>

      <p sl="en">I fully support Evelyne Gebhardt’s report on the implementation of the Services Directive. The activities of the 2006 directive account for 40% of EU GDP and jobs. However, the different implementation methods of Member States have made it difficult for the service sector to take full advantage of the directive. Allowing service providers to operate outside their own country is integral to the EU’s single market and reducing the bureaucracy at national level can allow the directive to make a contribution to EU economic growth and its jobs objectives. According to the report, each Member State must ensure that more information is disseminated to businesses that want to provide services across borders. Doing this through points of single contact (PSCs) will allow the service sector to benefit from cross-border trade. Ensuring that the PSCs provide a human as well as an electronic contact point is also vital to ensure that users receive all the relevant information and that questions are answered. The report also proposes the inclusion of services that were exempt from the original directive in 2006: healthcare, transport and social services. This would further expand the scope of the directive and would bring benefits to more service sector workers.</p>

The aim of the directive is to remove unreasonable obstacles to the provision of cross-border services. Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular are frequently confronted with bureaucratic barriers and discrimination which prevent them from benefiting fully from the common internal market. The directive takes into consideration the specific social circumstances of the individual Member States. Strengthening the control options in the destination country represents an important step forward.

The regulation shall apply to regular services, within and between EU Member States, where the scheduled distance is no greater than 250 km. We are talking about the rights of bus passengers when a bus or coach service is cancelled or delayed for more than 120 minutes. Then passengers should immediately be offered a choice between continuing their journey or re-routing to their final destination at no additional cost or reimbursement of the ticket price. If the carrier fails to offer this choice, passengers shall have the right to compensation in addition to the reimbursement of the ticket price. In the event of cancellation or delay, it is also important for passengers to be provided with all necessary information.

The firm stance adopted by the European Parliament on the rights of persons travelling by bus or coach means that, from now on, transport operators will provide information, assistance and compensation across the whole EU to comply with passengers’ rights. Regardless of the means of transport they use, Europeans now enjoy EU-level protection. I support this report which regulates the overbooking of buses and coaches or departures delayed by more than two hours for journeys longer than 250 kilometres, as well as the cancellation of journeys.

      <p sl="ga">Often, the bus services provided by the domestic or voluntary bodies are services essential to local and rural communities. Higher prices and a restriction on the number of available routes would be the result of the additional costs recommended in the report and some bodies would possibly be forced to close. Excessive regulation would place a huge burden on these bodies, some of which are already under pressure, and a restricted service for rural people would be the result. A transport system which works well on the local level is better than a service which is terminated due to excessive regulation.</p>

Similar rights must also be ensured for bus passengers and opportunities to travel must be improved for persons with reduced mobility. I believe that following lengthy and complicated negotiations, it has been possible to reach a really good and balanced agreement with the Council, which fully protects passenger rights without imposing a burden on carriers, most of which are small and medium-sized enterprises.

For this reason, bus and coach companies are urged to be equipped and trained to provide a minimal level of assistance to disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility, as long as the passenger informs the company of their needs not less than 36 hours prior to departure. The compromise reached therefore seems to establish shared minimum standards very much in passengers’ favour, without putting excessive burdens on carriers, which are mostly small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The negotiations have been difficult. However, they will cover all national or cross-border road transport services over distances in excess of 250 km. Road transport norms had to be standardised at a time when European citizens are increasingly using this form of transport as it offers a cheaper and more convenient option for short distances not covered by air transport. In the context of European traffic, it is only natural that the road transport sector has similar compensation rules to those applied to air transport, which were standardised a long time ago.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In too many instances, road carriers apply the rule of using their own discretion, especially in the countries which have recently become Member States. However, making them liable can only help improve the services offered. Every passenger, whether travelling by air or road, must be aware of their rights, especially in situations where they pay for a certain service and sometimes receive something completely different.

I consider it a success that the European Parliament has, against the will of the Council, extended the scope of the regulation to all regular domestic and cross-border transport with a distance of 250 km or more, while the Council was proposing a minimum distance of 500 km. I welcome the fact that in case of a cancellation, a delay longer than 120 minutes or over-acceptance of reservations, passengers will, in addition to the right to continue with their journey or take another route to their destination or reimbursement of the ticket price, have the right to compensation amounting to 50% of the ticket price. In view of the fact that the regulation on bus passenger rights is linked to the regulation on rail passenger rights, I am not pleased that, in contrast to bus passengers, rail passengers in many EU states must wait for their rights to be applied, especially regarding the right to reimbursement of a quarter to half of the fare where there is a delay of more than one hour.</p>

That being said, I regret the fact that this regulation only applies from 250 km, since this effectively excludes three Member States of the European Union (Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus), but also many journeys, such as Brussels-Amsterdam or Budapest-Vienna. Finally, I also deplore the lack of flexibility for ‘journeys’ in cross-border areas, as this impedes Europeans’ mobility.

For me, there was no alternative to voting in favour because this report allows the European Union to insist that the individual Member States bring in legislation on this issue in accordance with the directives of the report, which target greater respect for bus and coach passengers. Given that buses are the most commonly used means of transport after the car – and this is a growing trend – Europe has the duty to stand up for its citizens who use these services. The report represents a good compromise, and I feel I really must emphasise the fact that proper attention has been given to the rights of disabled persons by requiring greater assistance from bus and coach companies for all disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility. The entry into force of this legislation means that citizens will have the right to clear and shared rules on compensation for damage or reimbursements in the event of delays to the scheduled timetable.</p>

      <p sl="pl">On Tuesday, 15 February 2011, the European Parliament adopted a report which will bring about a long-awaited result, namely, equal rights for passengers in all branches of transport. The rights of passengers travelling on regular bus services have been strengthened in relation to the loss of luggage, the loss of personal possessions, death or loss of health, problems which are the carrier’s fault and so on. A positive feature of the regulation is that it regulates the rights of passengers throughout the European Union. It should be stressed that these fundamental rights incorporate the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. The regulation is intended to ensure access to transport without discrimination. It also regulates passengers’ responsibilities and the consequences of them neglecting these responsibilities, which may include forfeiting the opportunity to claim compensation. In view of the above, I voted in favour of the regulation, which is well-drafted and which completes the set as regards the regulation of passengers’ rights in the European Union.</p>

I voted for this agreement because it contains 12 fundamental rights which are of paramount importance to improving the quality of transport services. They concern, in particular, the right of passengers to be kept informed prior to and during their journey and the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility. The introduction of these rights will allow us to ensure non-discriminatory access to transport.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, this report features passenger rights which I regard as very important, namely, compulsory compensation for lost luggage, reimbursement of a certain amount of costs in the event of a passenger’s death or physical injury, as well as compensation of up to 50% of the ticket’s value, in addition to full reimbursement of the ticket price, if an operator cancels a journey and is therefore unable to honour its transport contract.</p>

      <p sl="en">We also oppose the force majeure clause exempting carriers from the obligation to provide accommodation for passengers in case of cancellations or delays if these are caused by severe weather conditions or major natural disasters, as it can set a precedent for other EU passenger rights legislation. Even though this is not a triumph, it is an improvement, especially for travellers with disabilities and reduced mobility. We managed to ensure non-discriminatory access conditions, disability-related training for the staff of carriers and terminal authorities who deal directly with passengers and compensation for damage or loss of mobility equipment on all routes, regardless of distance. Keeping that in mind, and with a view to creating a harmonised EU set of rights for all passengers, we did not oppose the agreement and abstained in the final vote.</p>

Clearly, it is unsatisfactory that the regulation will apply to a distance of 250 km or more.

Furthermore, proper operational assistance must be ensured in the event of an accident, providing passengers with the services and items they most need.</p>

I voted in favour of the report because I think it is a great piece of work which, by striking a good compromise, forces European transport policies to move forward decisively, not only by guaranteeing the rights of passengers, but also by not overburdening the transport enterprises that provide this service.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I abstained on this regulation concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport, which was adopted by a large majority of socialists and conservatives. I regret the considerable step backwards from the position initially adopted by this House, on three main points. 1. Only distances greater than 250 km will be covered. In practice, people travelling by coach from Brussels to Amsterdam will not be protected whereas those travelling by air will be! This is unjust, especially when we know that it is often the least well off who use this mode of transport. 2. The force majeure clause (adverse weather conditions or natural disasters) can be invoked all too easily by coach companies to avoid paying compensation to passengers in the event of a delay or cancellation. 3. The derogations will allow countries that so wish to postpone the entry into force of this regulation until 2021! Nonetheless I welcome the advances of the text: compulsory assistance to disabled people and people with reduced mobility, and rights and compensation in the event of an accident, delay or cancellation. Parliament has, however, settled for a cut-price, poorly drawn-up agreement. The many exceptions and derogations will mean that the scope of these rights will be considerably limited, to the detriment of coach passengers.</p>

Most Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Danish, Dutch and Belgian coach services are also excluded. Unfortunately, I must admit that, during the conciliation procedure, the Estonian Government supported an even longer distance of 500 km, which would have excluded Estonia entirely.

      <p sl="pl">The regulation on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport is an excellent example of how the European Parliament demonstrates its concern for consumer rights. Following difficult negotiations with the European Council, we have adopted a text which deals with the final means of transport for which passengers’ rights had not yet been regulated under EU law. At the start of the negotiations, Parliament demanded that new regulations be introduced for journeys of over 50 km, whereas the Council wanted a distance of over 500 km. By way of a compromise, the distance was set at over 250 km. Passengers travelling on such routes will be granted a number of concessions and rights, similar to those granted to passengers travelling by air. EU legislation clearly regulates the rights I have if my luggage is lost at an airport or a plane’s take-off is delayed for a long time. Until now, bus and coach passengers were in a much worse situation. Today, among other things, they will be able to demand compensation for delays or damage to luggage, while persons of reduced mobility will receive a special escort.</p>

I believe that new requirements and CO2 limits will help to fight global warming, lower running costs through savings on fuel and boost innovation and the competitiveness of European car manufacturers. With these rules, green technologies have to be built into the vehicles which need to stay affordable. Starting in 2014, 70% of new commercial vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes must comply with an average emission limit of 175 grams CO2 per kilometre. In 2020, the limit will drop to 147 grams.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report. At its meeting of 8-9 March 2007, the European Council made a firm commitment to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions of the Community by at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020, and by 30% provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emission reductions and economically more advanced developing countries contribute according to their respective capabilities. Policies and measures should be implemented at Member State and EU level across all sectors of the EU economy, and not only within the industry and energy sectors, in order to generate the necessary emissions reductions. Road transport is the second largest greenhouse gas emitting sector in the EU and its emissions, including those from light commercial vehicles, continue to rise. If road transport emissions continue to increase, it will significantly undermine efforts made by other sectors to combat climate change. Hitherto in the EU, there has not been legislation regulating CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles, although demand for these vehicles is increasing in the EU. I believe we managed to reach agreement with the Council on a balanced document, which will help reduce CO2 emissions and will encourage the automotive sector to invest in new and less-polluting technologies.</p>

However, what is being presented to us as a realistic compromise with the Council is actually a third-rate agreement. The approved report limits the average CO2 emissions of new light commercial vehicles to 175 g/km, while the long-term objective is 147 g/km, which will not be achieved until at least 2020. That is not enough. The European Commission was proposing a limit of 135 g/km, a more ambitious and equally realistic proposal. I voted against this report because I regret that we have not reached a compromise bringing us closer to the European Commission’s proposal.

      <p sl="it">The proposal for a regulation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from light commercial vehicles falls under the Commission’s strategic framework to reduce CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. However, several graphs in the latest report by the European Environment Agency clearly show that CO2 emissions caused by road transport in the EU-15 and the EU-27 have either been stable or decreasing since 2003. In addition, it is worth considering that light commercial vehicles are responsible for only approximately 1.5% of carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">The lengthy and difficult negotiations held in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety focused, above all, on the long-term emissions limit, which was agreed at 147g CO2/km. This figure, though better than initially proposed, does not fully meet my expectations. Indeed, in order to protect industry in the sector, Italy had asked for the level not to fall below 160g CO2/km and, in the Council, many Member States seemed to be moving towards an agreement for a minimum threshold of 155g CO2/km.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, I think that the result reached in the trialogue between the Commission, the Council and Parliament on reducing long-term CO2 emissions is still out of proportion with the special characteristics of the automotive sector and I should like to express my concern about the risk of damaging the industry and employment levels in the sector.</p>

We must also recognise that these vehicles are often bought by fleet buyers in large quantities, and therefore are already closely judged on their efficiency and running costs. The average reduction in CO2 emissions over 2002-2007 for light commercial vehicles amounted to 0.4-0.5% per year, and these improvements in fuel efficiency have been offset by the increase in demand for transport and vehicle size. Therefore, adopting Community-wide targets for new light commercial vehicles is necessary to prevent fragmentation in the internal market resulting from the adoption of different measures at Member State level. Furthermore, setting CO2 emission standards for new light commercial vehicles is necessary to prevent a risk of regulatory gap resulting from a degree of overlap between the registrations for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.</p>

I appreciate the essence of this text, which aims to contribute to the European Union’s aim of reducing CO2 emissions through producing better functioning light commercial vehicles as well. However, it is well-known that these transport methods are used almost exclusively for commercial reasons and therefore, compared with passenger cars, there is less scope to modify their shape or mass.</p>
      <p sl="it">As long as it is understood that the best way to achieve this – as the rapporteur notes – is through modifications to engines and mechanics, I do support the agreement reached on the timescale for the implementation of these changes.

      <p sl="cs">On the one hand, it is understandable that the proposal is largely based on the legislation on CO2 emissions from cars, but on the other hand, we should bear in mind that this sector does not operate in the same way. Vans have a longer development and production cycle, and are used mainly for commercial purposes, and in contrast to cars, there are fewer options for modifying their shape and weight to reduce emissions. The main way to achieve this with vans is to modify the engine and mechanics of the vehicle, which is a far longer and more costly process than a simple change to the bodywork. The fact that vans make much wider use of diesel as a fuel also plays an important role.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I have reservations about the proposal that sanctions against producers who fail to reduce the CO2 emissions of vans should be higher than sanctions for failing to reduce emissions from cars. In my opinion, the sanctions should be the same in both areas. I understand the reasons for introducing mandatory speed limiters for vans, but I am concerned that this might set a precedent for the introduction of speed limiters for other types of vehicle. We must think carefully about whether this is not an excessively restrictive regulation, going beyond the framework of proportionality.</p>

Strict environmental standards will not harm the industry. On the contrary, only challenging targets will generate the necessary pressure to innovate and this is the only way in which our industry will remain at the cutting edge. The watering down of the long-term target in particular demonstrates to me that the automotive industry has not learnt from the legislation on CO2 limits for cars introduced two years ago that it will only be able to sell clean cars in the future.

      <p sl="lt">I agreed with the provision that just as the passenger car sector is making strides towards reduced emissions, so should the light commercial vehicle sector. Manufacturers would thus place new vehicles with improved CO2 emissions performance on the market. This would enable users to upgrade their fleets and lower their contribution to transport’s ‘CO2 footprint’. The purpose of this proposed legislation is to reduce the CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles. This is harder to do than with cars, because the bodies of LCVs cannot be so readily or cheaply altered to make them more efficient. All changes must be made to the engines or mechanics instead. This is quite a major investment. Nevertheless, it is questionable whether this proposal will accomplish this aim: There are significant concerns as to whether the measures will meet the original goal of preventing climate change and whether the targets and timetable proposed are realistic and feasible economically. There is also concern that they may reduce competitiveness in this sector. I nevertheless feel that we should give more consideration to three areas: the economic downturn and its severe impact on car manufacturers and users, the need to support industry (manufacturers) rather than disadvantaging it with onerous measures (or even fines), and the need to support business (users) rather than inducing additional costs via questionable political measures.</p>

For this reason, we need to find alternative solutions which will lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles. There are currently two possible options. One is to increase the reduction for cars, in order to compensate for the emissions from commercial vehicles.

      <p sl="fr">As for the extra costs to manufacturers of vans and minibuses, they will be well compensated for by the fact that these vehicles will pollute less and consume less, and in the end, that is what motorists are interested in.</p>

      <p sl="it">I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mr Callanan. We have today adopted the agreement reached with governments of the Member States over new limits on CO2 emissions for European commercial vehicles, which also includes incentives for industry to produce vans that are more energy efficient and penalties for those who do not respect the new rules. The legislation adopted represents a difficult balancing act and sets a series of ambitious but feasible environmental objectives for manufacturers.</p>
      <p sl="it">The new legislation completes the European regulatory framework, adding to the rules on passenger vehicle emissions set out two years ago. If manufacturers produce a van with emissions of lower than 50g CO2/km then they will be awarded a super-credit, valid for a limited period of time. Indeed, said vehicle would count towards the calculation of the average as 3.5 vehicles between 2014-2015, 2.5 in 2016 and 1.5 in 2017, which is the last year that the super-credit system will be in place. On the other hand, newly manufactured vehicles that emit more than the imposed limits will, from 2019 onwards, be subject to a penalty of up to EUR 95 per gram.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I fully supported the initial proposal for the establishment of CO2 emission standards for new light commercial vehicles (LCVs) in order to prevent a loophole resulting from the certain amount of overlap that currently exists between passenger car and LCV registration. Currently, many vehicles that are homologated as passenger cars, such as SUVs, are registered as LCVs, often because this latter category is subject to reduced taxation or because of other fiscal incentives. Although the legislation covering passenger cars (like this proposal) is based on type approval of vehicles (rather than registration), the absence of regulation for LCVs means that there is a risk that manufacturers of relatively large passenger cars will apply for LCV type approval.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This would mean that these high-emitting vehicles would remain outside the scope of CO2 emission standards. Ultimately, the first reading agreement has turned into a very weak agreement, where the binding target to achieve 175 g CO2/km has been delayed by a year. The 2020 target has been left at 147 g/km and the penalties for non-compliance have been reduced from EUR 120/g to EUR 95/g. This is an inadequate token gesture that will mean that this law will fail to make any significant contribution to the climate debate. The sense of urgency has disappeared, that much is clear.

Bearing in mind the fight against climate change with regard to CO2 emissions and the increased competitiveness of the European automotive industry, this regulation aims to establish incentive schemes, in particular, the granting of super-credits and payments for eco-innovations and also fewer penalties. The agreement reached by Parliament in this respect is ambitious, but also feasible at the same time. The phased, short-term EU target is 175 g CO2/km, to be reached by 2017, and the long-term target is 147 g CO2/km, to be achieved by 2020.</p>

This will enable the regulation both to provide incentives for the production of vehicles offering efficient fuel consumption and to impose penalties on manufacturers who fail to meet the agreed targets.

This proposal for a decision is also incompatible with the requirement of last resort set forth by Article 20(2) of the Treaty on European Union, which establishes that enhanced cooperation can only be permitted when, all other options having been examined, there is no possibility of reaching the objectives within a reasonable period.</p>

I wanted the same to apply to the protection of European inventions, and I wanted enhanced cooperation to be used to create a European patent. The reason is that, while it costs 10 times as much to protect inventions with a patent in Europe as it does in the United States, in particular, because of translation costs, 25 of the 27 Member States want to create a European patent together; such a patent would cost less because it would be unitary. The unitary patent will be filed in French, English or German and will protect our inventions in the 25 countries involved. Furthermore, this protection will finally come at an affordable price.

All that the European Parliament’s recommendation will do is to enable the Council to agree officially to measures being taken. Everything is therefore still possible, or, to be more specific, amendments can be made to the European Commission’s proposals for regulations.

      <p sl="en">In light of the impetus given by the Commission and Parliament to relaunch the single market, the need for a harmonised system for the issuance and regulation of patents has never been greater. It is for this reason that I voted in favour of this legislative resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under the current fragmented patent system, patents have to be translated into the language of each of the States for which they have been granted, imposing exorbitant costs on entrepreneurs, start-ups and other innovation-based SMEs for translations: obtaining a patent is thirteen times more expensive in the EU than in the US and eleven times more expensive than in Japan. Under the new system to be adopted by Member States participating in enhanced cooperation in this area, the unitary patent will fall under a much more affordable translation regime consisting of solely the French, English and German languages; resulting in the cutting of costs. The introduction of a unitary and affordable patent system, albeit only in some EU Member States, will play an important role in the furtherance of the single market, particularly by giving the Union the boost in innovation and creativity with regard to the creation of goods and services which it so desperately needs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">For several years, we have seen the European economy being held back by the absence of a competitive EU patent, in comparison with other large world powers. For around 15 years, the European Commission has been proposing the creation of a single European patent. Finally, thanks to the ‘enhanced cooperation’ procedure, which allows several Member States to cooperate in a particular area when a legislative initiative is being blocked, we have been able to take a step in this direction. I therefore voted enthusiastically in favour of this report, which allows us to launch this enhanced cooperation procedure in order to create an EU patent system.

In spite of the fact that we have only achieved a partial success, since the unitary patent protection system does not cover the entire territory of the European Union, it should undoubtedly be regarded as a significant step forward. The simplification of registration procedures and a significant reduction in their cost will promote the development of the internal market and stimulate scientific and technical progress throughout the EU as a whole, even if they only cover 12 Member States. Although legislation will only be harmonised to a limited extent, this harmonisation will, in reality, affect all EU entrepreneurs, since investors based in Member States which are not participating will also be able to take advantage of unitary patent protection. It will be up to them to decide on an individual basis whether to choose protection under the legal system of one or several Member States, or whether to use the unitary European patent.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that we should continue measures aimed at extending the scope of unitary patent protection, so that it ultimately covers the entire territory of the European Union.

The European Union cannot afford a fragmented patent registration system. Today, it has taken a giant stride forward towards a unitary registration system. The status quo, under which a business must register its patent in every Member State separately, is a significant hindrance to business development. The slow and complicated process for registering a patent in the European Union hitherto has restricted opportunities for our businesses to develop dynamically. A clear and efficient procedure whereby anyone may register a patent valid throughout the European Union will ensure that new products can reach the market more quickly, thereby boosting the rate at which businesses develop. Those countries who take part in this patent registration system and entrepreneurs in those countries, who will be able to supply new products quickly to all European consumers, will be the winners.</p>

The possibility of at least a partial solution is now arising in the form of enhanced cooperation between some Member States in establishing unitary patent protection. The Czech Republic wishes to participate in this enhanced cooperation and also wishes to take part in further negotiations over concrete proposals for a regulation on the unitary patent and its language regime. Failure to participate in the enhanced cooperation would mean not being able to influence the future form of the EU patent system. One significant aspect is the economic benefit, or the advantages for businesses deriving from the new technical solutions, in view of the size of the common market of those participating in the enhanced cooperation.

Enhanced cooperation should remain a mechanism to be used in exceptional circumstances and should not be used to exclude Members States that are prepared to negotiate, such as Italy and Spain. I support the Italian proposal to write patents in the language of the country of the inventor and to provide an English translation as well. This way, we can preserve our linguistic independence and the interests of our country.

I agree that the European Parliament must play a crucial role in situations having a direct impact on the general public’s health. I also believe that, in the wake of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency, the European Commission must play a supervisory role, declaring a state of emergency and adopting lists of basic foodstuffs and feedingstuffs. Member States must maintain an official control system for these products and inform the general public about any risks.

      <p sl="lt">A high level of protection of human health is one of the objectives that the European Union must achieve as it defines its policy. EU regulations laying down levels of radioactive contamination in case of radiological emergency remain unchanged since 1990, and therefore it is necessary to review and update these provisions. We must set up a comprehensive system allowing the Union, following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency which is likely to lead to a significant radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, to fix maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination in order to ensure a high level of protection of public health. I agree that the permitted levels of radioactive contamination must be reviewed at regular intervals in order to take into account the latest international scientific progress and scientific recommendations and to avoid existing divergences in regulatory practice.</p>

At the same time, Annexes I and III set out the maximum permitted levels of contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs. Although this proposal is dealt with through the recasting technique, I believe that we must substantially amend the proposal beyond the sole grey part identified, so as to ensure the legal certainty and coherence of the text. It is necessary to streamline the procedure in cases of nuclear emergency by clearly giving a supervisory role to the Commission and clarifying the regime of its acts (adoption, revision). Furthermore, we must attempt to serve the interests of the citizens through better management of the post-accident situation. We must ensure legal certainty of the whole proposal through the alignment of obsolete procedures – ‘comitology’ procedures in the field of Euratom adopted by analogy – which this proposal intends to codify, with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

Although I am in favour of the change to the legal basis and of strengthening the role of the European Parliament, in order to achieve greater transparency in legislation and broader protection for citizens, I consider the report to be inadequate and several steps behind what would be a substantive approach to the problem. It amends what has already been agreed and simply regulates the consequences, rather than the source, of the problem. Furthermore, it has left the maximum limits for radioactive contamination extremely high and, as a result, it is far removed from the objective of protecting public health. It is for the above reasons that I abstained in the final vote.</p>

      <p sl="en">ECR Group MEPs supported this report as we believed that the legal basis of this legislation should be changed from ‘Article 31 EAEC’ to ‘Article 168 TFEU’. Under the original regulation, Article 31 EAEC (which focuses on the group of persons who might be subject to radioactive contamination) was considered the most appropriate legal basis as Article 168 TFEU (which regulates public health) did not exist. If Article 168 TFEU was the legal base of this regulation, then this would imply a change from consultation to the ordinary legislative procedure and the proposal would then be subject to full European Parliament scrutiny and, most importantly, a full impact assessment, including consultation with food producers and consumers. While there could be certain aspects of Parliament’s adopted report that ECR MEPs do not support, we strongly believe that the legal basis of this regulation should be changed to fully involve the European Parliament in the legislative process and additionally, that it should be accompanied by a thorough impact assessment.

      <p sl="pl">The regulations we have prepared today are of enormous economic significance for the European Union and its single market. The Chernobyl disaster showed us that the linear extrapolation of radiation-related risk results in unnecessary economic losses. Areas equal in size to many a country were evacuated in Belarus and Ukraine. Belarusians are now returning to these areas, where radioactivity is the same as that in the centre of Warsaw, unbelievable as it may seem. Meanwhile, some of the ‘Chernobyl victims’, the around 8 million Ukrainians who receive allowances which are, in any case, too low to live on, will not consider returning for fear of losing this meagre compensation. The European Union should draw conclusions from this experience, which is of vital importance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It was easy to resettle people within the former USSR, and it was accomplished efficiently after the disaster. It is hard to imagine how this would be done in Europe’s densely-populated areas. Who would be given the responsibility for such a task? Financial compensation should be awarded in particular to farmers, who may lose not only their crops, but also the opportunity to cultivate any crops for many years. The same applies to forests, although to a lesser degree. It is well known that the polluter should pay, but how will we decide who is responsible and who should pay if we are hit by nuclear fallout from third countries? Who will deal with this? The EU, of course. I therefore voted in favour of adopting the report.</p>

The maximum contamination levels proposed by the Commission, which have been in force since 1987, are far too high. Studies show that even with low doses, children suffer serious cardiovascular and endocrine problems. The proposed maximum doses would cause an unacceptable increase in the number of cancer cases. Furthermore, given that there is no mechanism in place to compensate farmers in case of contamination which exceeds the authorised levels, the Commission absolutely must propose a compensation mechanism in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle.</p>

      <p sl="de">Radioactive contamination can represent a problem over a number of years in some foods. The difficulty arises when contaminated foodstuffs, such as wild produce from the forests in areas that have been exposed to radioactivity for centuries, are not only consumed locally, but are also sold in otherwise uncontaminated areas, where they are believed to be harmless. Our current level of knowledge indicates that there are no levels of radiation that can be classified as harmless with any absolute degree of certainty. Research into the cause of a wide range of new forms of illness, such as allergies, is still in its infancy. Despite this fact, foodstuffs are still being irradiated and no one has considered the question of possible interaction with genetic engineering.

      <p sl="pl">The rapporteur rightly notes that radioactive substances may continue to have an impact for a great many years, and the overriding aim should always be to protect human life and health. At present, more and more food is irradiated in order to make it last longer. It is worth bearing in mind that irradiation destroys vitamins – up to 90% of vitamin A in chickens, 86% of vitamin B in oats and 70% of vitamin C in fruit juices. Foodstuffs are therefore made to last longer at the expense of their nutritional value. Research has proven that irradiation kills bacteria, but it does not destroy viruses or remove dirt or toxins which could get into meat in non-sterile and unhygienic slaughterhouses and meat-processing plants.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Irradiation also contributes to the large-scale, expensive and wasteful transport of food, particularly by large corporations.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the European Commission has expressed a favourable opinion of the decision taken by the European Council in December to proceed to a limited modification of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, the aim is to allow the Member States in the euro area to create a permanent mechanism to ensure the financial stability of the euro area as a whole. In 2013, this European stability mechanism will replace the current temporary stability instruments – the European financial stability fund and the European financial stability mechanism – and we all know how useful they are.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are talking here about a decision which is essential for confirming our determination to defend our common currency and to guarantee financial stability when faced with economic imbalances in certain Member States, imbalances which we must correct. This is a mechanism which is necessary to complete the framework of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This being so, and as I emphasised myself during the last European Council, every initiative – including those concerning the competitiveness and convergence of the European economy, and I say competitiveness and convergence because this is also about the convergence of our economies – every initiative, I said, must respect the Treaty as well as the principles and rules that have been established for the Union and for its institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will therefore take every initiative – legislative or otherwise – to guarantee consistency between the future stability mechanism and the economic governance carried out by the Union within the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Respect for the Treaty is, of course, very important, and I am reassured that the European Council, on 4 February, explicitly recognised that. The mechanisms for reinforcing the competitiveness and convergence of the European economy, which apply not just to the 17 current members of the euro but to all the 27, will be created with due respect for the Treaties – that is, for the competences of the Union and of its institutions and, in particular, the competences of Parliament and the Commission. The opinion that the Commission has just adopted makes explicit mention of that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we are talking about today is a question of general European interest. It is obvious that safeguarding the euro is not just in the interest of the Member States in the euro area. It is for this reason that the Member States which do not belong to the euro area can be involved, if they wish, in the work of introducing the permanent mechanism. They will also be able, if necessary, to decide to participate in the operations which will be implemented in the context of this future mechanism, as some have already done within the framework of the current temporary mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are also talking today about our global response to the crisis, of which the establishment of the future European stability mechanism is one of the key elements. We must move forward quickly and properly on this subject.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Urgency does not mean haste, and it certainly does not exclude taking time for joint reflection. The decisions that we will be taking in the coming weeks to implement the lessons of the crisis are fundamental decisions for our common future. We must therefore be very clear on the orientation to which we want to commit ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We all agree that we must board the train of reform in order to preserve financial stability, to increase the competitiveness and convergence of our economies, and to release the full potential of sustainable growth which generates jobs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now what remains is to determine the track on which we will make this train run, and I believe that, in order to make this European train move forward, the best tracks are EU ones. The way in which we will introduce the European stability mechanism will make a large contribution to answering this question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as the procedure is concerned, the Commission believes that the conditions have been met for undertaking a simplified revision of the Treaty such as that envisaged in Article 48(6) of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I know that many of you are wondering about the highly intergovernmental character of this permanent mechanism. We, too, would have preferred more rapid progress that was more anchored in the system of the Union. However, we must recognise that this new step does not reduce the current competences of the Union and its institutions. It increases our collective capacity to respond to certain challenges which were not explicitly envisaged in the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to emphasise here certain points of substance that were emphasised in the Commission’s opinion. They will help us, I think, to orient ourselves towards a Union which shows more solidarity, a more responsible, united and strong Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first aspect is solidarity. Here, we are talking about a fundamental value of the European Union, and I want to be very precise on this point. Throughout the discussions on the limited draft modification to the Treaty, the Commission said that this modification would in no way harm the solidarity mechanisms provided for in Article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in the event of difficulties or a serious threat of difficulties in a Member State. As a consequence, and contrary to some people’s opinions, Article 122 is not undergoing any modification.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Solidarity in the Union also means responsibility. There could not be solidarity in Europe without responsibility; nor, of course, could there be responsibility without solidarity. This holds, in particular, for financial solidarity and responsibility, and this is the whole spirit of the transitional stability mechanisms. This will also be the spirit of the permanent mechanism, the conditions for which will be very strict. Let us be very clear: the Member States must all show respect for a responsible financial policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Solidarity and responsibility within the European Union can only be enhanced by greater coordination and better supervision. That is the essential lesson that we have learned from the crisis. The economic governance carried out by the Union within the euro area will thus constitute the basis on which the future stability mechanism will necessarily have to rest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will have to reinforce European economic governance; that is, we will have to enlarge and deepen it to guarantee the stability of the euro area in particular, and the stability of the European Union as a whole. Extending economic governance means including not only budgetary policies but also economic policies and structural reforms. That is the whole aim of the European semester on which we reached an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This process was launched by the presentation of the Annual Growth Survey prepared by the Commission. This document says and shows clearly that the current policies are not sufficient. We must do more to respond to current challenges. We must do more together, and we must not be divided. We must do more to create more convergence, and not to create more differences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Regarding the deepening of economic governance, this is the very aim of the package of six proposals which was presented by the Commission. I know that we will be able to count on strong support for this from Parliament, and I thank you for this support. You can be assured that the Commission will support and facilitate this process up to completion so that our ambitions can be realised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is precisely this package of reforms to which the future European stability mechanism will belong, as, in the more immediate future, will the reinforcement of the European financial stability fund. I am convinced that our approach is the right one, and that everyone has his or her role to play in it. The Commission will play its full role, and intends, in particular, to participate actively in the work of introducing the future European stability mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, it is not enough to have the right approach; we must apply it. I think that we will succeed in implementing our approach if we all respect a few simple and clear rules of conduct. I am thinking here of democratic legitimacy based on scrutiny by the European Parliament. I am also thinking of the strength that we gain from permanent institutions, which act transparently and which are common institutions for the 27, also guaranteeing consistency across the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also thinking of the principle of equality of the Member States in the Treaty and the principle of fair competition, according to which the actions decided on by the Member States cannot affect, alter or harm the efficiency of the cooperation that takes place at European Union level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will be vigilant in making sure that none of the carriages decouples, which would risk derailing the whole train. We must invest more in trust between the Member States, and between the Member States and the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are a Union, and we must act as a Union in order to emerge from the crisis and to build solid foundations for a more competitive, more prosperous, more stable and more inclusive Europe. This is the spirit in which our actions must take place; this is the spirit in which the Commission has acted, and will continue to act. I think I can say that we can count on your support here.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, we are fully aware that we need a provision in the Treaty in order to bring about legal certainty. In my country, this is regarded as a constitutional necessity and this is why we are discussing the need for a modification to the Treaty so that we can guarantee the stability of the euro in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are many other possibilities involving more wide-ranging modifications to the Treaty which would incorporate this fully into community policy. Alternatively, we could use different wording at another point within the relevant article. On the other hand, there is then, of course, the risk that the simplified procedure could no longer be applied, which would result in referendums being needed. As a result, we would not be able to reach a decision in time, which would cause problems that would affect the financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, it is important to explain that the monetary union is a community power. We must ensure that this power is not undermined either by the stability mechanism or the competitiveness pact.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Treaty has deficiencies which can, unfortunately, only be resolved by taking an intergovernmental approach, because of the circumstances that have already been described. However, there are examples of Member States agreeing on joint regulations, such as in the enhanced cooperation procedure, but using the European Union institutions to carry out the necessary work. This should also be possible in this context and it concerns the Commission in particular. It would be wrong to establish parallel structures which would move increasingly far apart and prevent the community from remaining a cohesive whole in the long term. We must avoid this at all costs. If we do not react responsibly and correctly in the weeks to come, we could see a split starting to form.</p>
      <p sl="de">It must also be made clear that the community method and the intergovernmental method are not of equal importance. The intergovernmental method is simply an aid to be used when the community method is not available for reasons relating to the Treaty. Therefore, we must ensure that in the case of a possible treaty modification, the matter can be transferred to community policy without major problems, as we have done with Schengen and with many other examples in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">This calls for a radical solution, which, at the same time, also provides clear legal structures, so that the countries which are not included can be certain that they will be involved when they fulfil the conditions. It must also guarantee that the small countries are on an equal footing, because we know that the community structures not only ensure cohesion but also decision-making ability in the long term. We have yet to find out how difficult the intergovernmental approach will be in the case of the competitiveness pact.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are three areas. The first of these is the stability and growth pact, which involves normal legislation and the community method. There is also the Treaty modification, which brings with it the risk of break up, and the competitiveness pact, which definitely needs further discussion. Parliament must demonstrate that it is responsible and we must do the same within our group. We know how important the date of 24 March and the following Monday are. I believe that we are not working towards an ideal solution, but if we act responsibly, the other institutions and, in particular, the Council should do the same.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our idea is that we should accept the intergovernmental approach as a transitional solution. This is connected with the powers of the institutions and, specifically, the Commission on this issue. The Council should be available for discussions over the next few days. This means that we are prepared to debate this question, in order to overcome the problems that we have in this House, because the small countries and the countries outside the euro area feel that they are at a disadvantage as a result of the specific way in which the competitiveness pact has been initiated. All of this makes our work difficult. I would like to help ensure that there is a majority in favour of this plan within the necessary deadline. I hope that the Council will give us the opportunity during the course of our discussions to put this majority together.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads for the future of the Europe Union. After the many delays that we are guilty of, it has become obvious to everyone that Europe needs real economic governance, which must be particularly stringent for those countries that have adopted the euro.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore welcome the creation of a permanent stability mechanism, which we feel is a key point in the construction of genuine economic governance in Europe, even if we continue to nurture legal and political reservations on the procedure adopted, which we think is risky and does not make full use of the instruments provided for by the Treaty. I am delighted to hear that you also share these reservations.</p>
      <p sl="it">In any case, we are now focusing on a different point: how will the new mechanism actually work? Will it contribute to strengthening the economic governance of the European Union or will it be a step towards a new (and inevitably discretional) ‘intergovernmentalism’, which is the direction that was also taken by the unfortunate wording of the Franco-German competitiveness pact? Basically, in what direction is this train setting off? Who will be driving it?</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, on the one hand, the proposed amendment to Article 136 sets out an intergovernmental mechanism that is entirely disconnected from the Union and its institutions, while, on the other, we can read in the opinion of the Commission that the mechanism shall have to rely on economic governance exercised by the Union and that the Commission will take all measures to ensure consistency between the stability mechanism and the aforementioned economic governance.</p>
      <p sl="it">We do appreciate these intentions but, since there is no sign of any of this in the proposal to amend Article 136, we think that this is the time to clearly define how this mechanism will work. What procedure will be adopted to put the mechanism in place? What role will the Commission have in its management and in defining the conditions for its application? What will be the composition of the secretariat? What does the Council think about what Mr Barroso has just said on the validity of the current extraordinary solidarity mechanisms? Will there be a role for the European Parliament?</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that only a rewording of the amendment to Article 136 or, alternatively, a clear declaration from the European Council on these issues, will enable Parliament to adopt an opinion in line with the desired schedule of the European Council.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I think that we can be satisfied with Mr Barroso's statements on the amendment of the Treaty. Of course, it is now up to us to draft our opinion, and we must do so before 24 March, as an important Council meeting is taking place on this date. Can we reach a majority in favour of a simplified procedure? We shall see. I think that there are still some conditions that need to be met.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first condition that occurs to me is that we need to try to ensure that the mechanism is managed by the Commission as far as possible. I have some good arguments for this. You will surely have noticed that on 6 January, the European financial stabilisation mechanism (EFSM), which is managed by the Commission, issued EUR 5 billion of bonds onto the market over five years. On 25 January, the European Financial Stability Facility, which is intergovernmental, did the same, also for EUR 5 billion and also over five years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The bonds that were managed by the Commission were issued at 2.5% and those that were managed by the intergovernmental system were put on the market at 2.89%. That means that the EFSM, which is managed under the Community method, is issuing bonds at lower interest rates than the intergovernmental system. I wanted to make this point because it is important to show that the Community method has much better outcomes than the intergovernmental system does.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I think that we must also ask ourselves if we can use the amendment of Article 136 in order to strengthen the economic governance package which is currently under discussion. Mrs Wortmann-Kool and other rapporteurs have tabled six proposals. In these six proposals, however, we still need the green light from the Council so that the procedures can be initiated by the Commission. This problem can also be resolved through Article 136. We could say that if Article 136 – that is, the permanent crisis mechanism – is invoked, the Commission will automatically be able to start this procedure, and that the Council will not be able to block this with a reversed qualified majority. Thus, there is a real automatic aspect to the penalties. That is a second observation that we will perhaps have to come back to in our opinion, as I have said to Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, the two rapporteurs for our committee.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to make a third and final comment. Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, as rapporteurs, you must try to obtain statements and assurances from the Council, not on the current package, but on all the things that have been announced in these last few days: the competitiveness pact, the intergovernmental method, the many countries who oppose this, etc. There is a real divide in the Council on this issue for the time being. I think that we must have an assurance from the Council that it will also apply the Community method in this second economic governance package. Why is that? It is because the intergovernmental method is not working. Imagine for a moment that the rules on competition in the European Union were managed by the Council! How many times would fines have been given to businesses which failed to apply the competition rules? A company or a private business would never have been fined because it had failed to apply the rules on competition in the European Union. The same is true of these rules, and that is why I am making a plea for the two rapporteurs to try to get an assurance that the Community method will also be applied in the second economic governance package.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is clear that the European Parliament understands why the Treaty modification is based on the simplified procedure. We are dealing with an emergency situation. However, it is also obvious that the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is not right for the procedure which puts the crisis mechanism into effect to result in the community method coming to an end in future and the European Parliament and the Commission, at least in part, being excluded.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to explain our very critical attitude to the increase in intergovernmentalism. I believe that at the moment, fewer and fewer European citizens understand what decisions are being made in each situation. The Germans have been set against the Greeks and the Greeks have been set against the Germans. The Irish believe that the German banks are being rescued at their expense. This failure to understand the situation has to do with the Council being a black box and with the fact that decisions are only taken at the last minute.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need more transparency in this area. Otherwise, we will lose the trust of the citizens faster than we can possibly imagine. Therefore, you should be prepared, if you want us to submit to the simplified procedure at this point, to reinforce Parliament’s role as the representative of the citizens in the Council and the Commission, as everyone promised before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This Treaty and the case for more democracy in Europe were supported not only by you, Mr Barroso, but also by those in power in the Member States. I would now like to see this being put into practice.</p>
      <p sl="de">We only need to look at what is happening in Greece at the moment. There is a plan to privatise the beaches, so that Greece’s debt can be serviced. This represents an end to the way in which the crisis has so far been dealt with. Focusing completely on a policy of austerity, which has been heavily promoted by Germany, will push these countries with budget deficits closer to the brink of disaster. We must evaluate what is being done. We need to discuss the structure of this crisis policy and the alleged policy of solidarity. How else can we ensure that there is a clear understanding anywhere in Europe of what still needs to be done in this crisis?</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say one more thing at this point. I believe that we should be prepared to show solidarity with other countries in Europe. The funds that we currently have available are not sufficient. A decision was made in Brussels today to provide more liquidity. We will soon have to talk about this again and also about Eurobonds. Mr Verhofstadt has provided the correct justification for this. However, we will also need to discuss what we want our revenue policy to look like in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am sorry that I have overrun. However, we do ultimately need more time for this debate, so that we can reach a conclusion and not simply take a defensive approach.</p>

Although the United Kingdom is not a member of the euro – and I hope it never joins – we have a vested interest in its success. Half of the UK’s trade is with eurozone countries. The City of London is the financial capital of Europe. So Britain wishes the eurozone well and we hope that the proposed stability mechanism will provide support in the short to medium term.</p>
      <p sl="en">My hope is that this Parliament will act responsibly and approve the change proposed by Council. But in the long term, if the euro is to survive and prosper, more radical change is necessary. Mr Barroso, you can have as much supervision and surveillance as you like, as much economic governance as you like, but fundamentally, if countries like Greece and Ireland and Portugal are to remain within the eurozone, they need to become a lot more competitive, as competitive as Germany, and that is where your Commission should concentrate its efforts.</p>

As a result, the Treaty modification will not follow the democratic process laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Instead, it will be decided by means of the fast-track procedure.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have seen how this procedure was used to allow the rescue packages for the banks, amounting to billions of euro, to bypass Parliament.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, perhaps I could start at nought. It began by being a customs union pure and simple, then it became a political union, but without proper democratic consent, then it became a monetary union – well, sort of, because ten Member States have been sensible enough to stay out – but what we now have is a debt union, and it is a debt union which simply is not working.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us look at the interest rate of the German Bund. If monetary union was working, all members of the monetary union, all countries in the eurozone, would be able to borrow money at the same rate – at the same rate as the key indicator, the German Bund – but that is not the case at all. Currently, Portugal pays 4.8% more, Ireland pays 5.9% more, and Greece pays 8.25% more. Exactly as Mr Gualtieri said, it is a crucial moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not expect the Chairman of the PPE Group, or the Chairman of the S&amp;D Group – who was shaking his head as I spoke – to understand the critical importance of this, but I believe that very soon they will have to. Your problem, and it is mostly your problem, would be better solved by intergovernmental cooperation. Economic governance is a trap and moreover, it has no mandate. Nobody ever mentioned, or even seems to consider, the hard-pressed taxpayers of the nation state as you seek to construct this fragile and vain empire.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once again, I would remind you that there are 27 Member States: 11 of them are net contributors and 16 of them are recipients, and there is a San Andreas fault between those who contribute and those who do not. I suspect that most of all, the German taxpayer will not put up with this expensive charade for very much longer.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 1896, William Jennings Bryan, in a great speech about bimetallism, said, ‘You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold’. Now more urgently, I say to you today, and most of all to the President of the Commission, who has the executive power: you shall not crucify the taxpayers of the UK and the rest of Europe on the cross of the single currency.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would first like to talk about the scandal that is the so-called ‘simplified’ procedure – in reality a treacherous one – for amending the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is no real debate and, as usual, no direct consultation with the people. This is not an innocuous subject, however. This is about making the European financial stabilisation fund permanent. What does this fund represent, though, other than the possibility of creating a European debt, to be eventually taken on by the Member States, which are already in too much debt, and which could find themselves obliged to cover this European debt before covering their own debts? In a way, this is the economic policy of Sapeur Camember – the main character of a humorous book in France – the soldier who is ordered to fill in the hole in the barracks yard and who, in order to fill it in, creates another one right next to it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In exchange for Germany’s participation, we will be permitted a pact, termed a competitiveness pact, the details of which, according to a note from the French Government’s Secretariat-General for European Affairs, were not supposed to be known. In fact, they are known only too well. This will be a cure involving real austerity, supervision and an increased standardisation of budgetary policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is about extending convergence, I quote, to all policies which have an impact on competitiveness, even if, in principle, they fall under national competences. In short, this is about transposing to the entire euro area all those German policies of which Mr Sarkozy dreams so much. There is nothing acceptable about this, any more than there is about the alternative of a homogeneous European sovereign debt market plus an increase in the European budget and the creation of a specific tax to fund it. We must do something else.</p>

    <intervention id="2-424-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">First of all, I would like to thank you for your speeches, and I would particularly like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, for their comments concerning the importance of the Community method, as well as their attentiveness to what might become an intergovernmental drift. I can only thank them for this attentiveness.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this specific case, let us be absolutely clear: the Commission has given its support to this revision because we think that it aims to respond to a challenge regarding a competence which was not provided for by the Treaty. The Treaty did not establish a permanent stability mechanism. The Member States thus unanimously decided to create a mechanism and to do so on an intergovernmental basis. This was a unanimous decision by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I make no secret of the fact – and I have said very clearly – that I will be with all those who want to move more quickly on this. An intergovernmental step might represent progress, but we would rather move more quickly in an intergovernmental stride. As we know, however, some of the great steps forward for Europe in the history of European integration have begun with intergovernmental initiatives, such as Schengen or the area of freedom and justice, for example. The question regarding political responsibility was thus the following: do we, or do we not, have to support something which, while not being absolutely in line with our preferences – that is, the Community method – nevertheless involves the strengthening of our collective ability to respond to challenges which were not explicitly provided for in the Treaty? Our answer to this is ‘yes’; I think that we have to be in favour of this. That is why the Commission’s opinion is positive regarding this reform of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I would like to say to you very openly that the Commission prefers the Community approach. Incidentally, this is the debate that we had during the preparation of this decision. Some people wanted – and even proposed – a modification of Article 122, which would abolish a competence that has been in existence since the Treaties of Rome. I personally opposed this. I therefore think we can say that we can now develop this new competence together, even if, strictly speaking, it does not come under the Community method. At the same time, however, we say very clearly in our opinion, and I quote: ‘The Commission will take every initiative, whether legislative or of any other kind, to ensure consistency between the future mechanism and the Union’s economic governance in the euro area in particular, while respecting the competences conferred on the Union and its institutions by the Treaty ’. This is an absolutely clear position, and I would like to share this aim with you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">During the debate, some people talked, for example, about opposition or differences between one Member State and the others, between the United Kingdom and the euro area. Normally, I do not like to make this distinction, but there are some differences, the main one, incidentally, being the fact that the debt of the euro area is much less than that of the United Kingdom. The debt of the United Kingdom is much higher than that of the euro area as a whole. That is why the problem that exists in the euro area – as some of you have already stressed, by the way – is genuinely a problem of relative competitiveness. That is why we are now looking to find a solution for competitiveness and for convergence – and I stress convergence – in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Even if some people do not agree, let us move towards greater convergence in the euro area and in the Union for those who want to move forward, because now it is not just the federalists or the integrationists who want more governance in the European Union. The markets are also asking for such governance, and we need to listen to that. Today, the markets are asking Europe not only to be determined to defend the euro area, but also to provide a clearer system of governance. It is true, furthermore, that the Community approach normally gives more of a guarantee than an approach which is too often left up to the goodwill of the leaders.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">We are now working in this direction on other projects, notably, this project on competitiveness and convergence, but that will be another debate for another day. In any case, I believe that, on this matter, the Commission has adopted the right position: expressing a clear opinion in favour of this limited revision of the Treaty, while asking everyone to be more attentive to the need to avoid creating mechanisms which, as Mr Brok, for example, has said, could create divisions, because it is the Community institutions that can guarantee the Union as a whole, because the Commission takes actions for the euro area as well as for those Member States that are not in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us therefore be attentive to this aspect. Let us not, motivated by the need to respond to urgent challenges, now create issues which could bring up more significant problems for us in the future. Let us guarantee a firmer governance while guaranteeing the union as a whole in the spirit which must, of course, be the spirit of the Union: the spirit of solidarity and responsibility.</p>

On the other hand, when we talk about the current Treaty, we are told that a wider debate about the Treaty is inconceivable and futile in the light of the situation in the Member States and, in particular in the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic.

      <p sl="de">If we listen to what the citizens are saying today, it is clear that they are aware that we need to introduce changes to the Treaty now. They are asking questions like: ‘How are we going to get the markets under control in the near future?’. This is why we need a strong Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we must ask ourselves an even more important question, which is: What good is our European project doing at the end of the day? For decades, it has been responsible for peacekeeping and for bringing war on our continent to an end. This morning, I was host to a group of visitors from a school. For young people, war is, thank goodness, no longer an issue. They cannot imagine what war might be like. In our discussions, we now raise the threat of globalisation and explain that we need Europe to keep the evil of globalisation under control, but this is a negative argument. If we want to win over not only the minds, but also the hearts of the people, we must take a step further on the question of what good the European project is doing. We must talk about the pictures and ask ourselves what Europe is achieving and what its job is.</p>
      <p sl="de">When the powerful countries in the world come together, including America, Japan, Europe, Brazil, India and so on, who will raise their hand and ask whether we are paying enough attention to social issues? China will not do so. We will have to do that ourselves. Who will raise their hand and say ‘We need to think about environmental questions’? The Americans will not do that. We will have to highlight the issue. Who will say ‘We want to maintain peace throughout the world and ensure that conflicts do not turn into wars’? We will have to do this with our historical experience.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look at Tunisia, it is clear that the people there want the same model which we have in Europe. We have a highly attractive way of life. Therefore, when we discuss Treaty issues, when we talk about the way in which our continent functions and the job that we have to do, we must look at the big picture, so that we win not only the minds, but also the hearts of people for our project. Then, we will succeed in gaining acceptance for it at a national level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Weber for taking my question, which I would hope that perhaps President Barroso might also answer, because it is primarily directed at him.</p>
      <p sl="en">I support the intention behind this Treaty change. Like others, I am concerned about the mechanism. But the simplified procedure provides that all national parliaments, all 27 national parliaments, must acquiesce at least in the adoption of this Treaty change.</p>
      <p sl="en">National parliaments are given six months to decide what they may do. We are talking about adopting a decision in March, a Council decision that was made in December. How can that possibly be the case? Surely they have to wait until June to make that decision?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on the one hand, it is important that the Member States are in control of the treaties, which is why the modification must take place at this level. On the other hand, we are faced with the question which is implicit in many of the questions that I have attempted to address. Are we reflecting carefully on this, are we taking enough time and being allowed enough time to discuss everything in detail? Or are people’s expectations so high and the pressure of the global challenges so great that we need to be quicker and to act more quickly? For this reason, I do not regard the issue of time as a problem, but we do need to provide answers. We must focus on that.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next speaker on the list is Mr Martin Schulz, from whom I have received a letter. If there is any misunderstanding over the order on the list, I can explain it after our debate.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-429-000" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is a letter addressed to you personally, not to the Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="de">Treaty modifications are always complex, even simplified ones. What we are discussing here shows that we are in an extremely difficult situation. The term ‘simplified procedure’ conceals the fact that it is possible for this type of procedure to fail. It can fail here and also elsewhere. We have been told that if it fails, we will be in a very difficult position. Therefore, we need to ask ourselves once again what we can do to ensure that it does not fail. It is true that we are being listened to. Whether just the ratification procedure fails or also the euro project as a whole will depend on the determination of the Heads of Government to take coherent and united action. A lot of valid remarks have already been made in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to add three points which are of fundamental importance. Today, a year after the start of this serious crisis, I would like to ask you what the external value of our currency is. The answer to that question is USD 1.35. When the euro was first introduced, the same figure was USD 1.17. Now it has reached USD 1.35. The value of an international currency is based on its external value. Over the last year, the external value of the euro has been highly stable. However, the internal structure of the euro is not at all stable. This is because of the wildly ambiguous attitude and the double standards of the Heads of State or Government.</p>
      <p sl="de">The problem is not that Europe cannot act in a consistent way. After all, the instruments are in place. The problem is that Europe cannot agree on a consistent procedure. When we say that Europe cannot agree, we should also add ‘not those of us here’. It is not the European Parliament or the Commission; it is the governments of the sovereign Member States which have created a strong monetary area that is able to take external action, but which are not prepared to create the self-contained, internal instruments needed to establish a strong economic and social policy and a strong government policy alongside the strong currency. That is the crucial point.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, everything that happens in Europe takes place in the context of the treaties. However, when something happens within the treaties and we do not want to create something arbitrarily outside the bounds of the treaties, because some people are considering doing this, it is clear to the European Parliament that the institution at the heart of this must be the central institution within the framework of the treaties, namely the Commission. The democratic legitimacy of our actions at European level, in direct relation to the European Parliament, is determined by the Commission. This is why what you have explained is right, in the same way as what the rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, have also said.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point is that the risk for Europe lies in the fact that it is strong when it acts in a consistent way as the largest economic area in the world, with 500 million inhabitants, but if it allows itself to break down into 27 individual parts, it becomes irrelevant. Regrettably, this became clear during the events on the other side of the Mediterranean. If Europe does not take a consistent line, then it has no role to play. If it takes a consistent line, then with its social and economic model, it will become the engine of the global economy and an influential partner on the international political stage.</p>
      <p sl="de">The issue that we are discussing in the context of this simplified procedure concerns whether Europe has a future or whether it will break down into individual states and descend into unimportance and irrelevance. That is the point which we are debating.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, whatever our relationship is to the single currency, the euro, I believe it is in the interests of everyone living in the EU that the euro and the euro area develop in a stable way, whether we use it or not, as our economies are interlinked to an enormous extent.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Nevertheless, when President Barroso described the European stability mechanism, he used words such as improved supervision, expansion of economic coordination, coordination of budgetary policies and harmonisation of social policies. Ladies and gentlemen, this opens the way to the creation of fiscal union, and economic history shows us that fiscal union never survives long without the creation of political union. The minor change we are discussing today is therefore a massive change for the individual Member States of the EU. The European Union is being politically transformed for the future. Mr Weber said that ‘European citizens want to see a stronger Europe’. We have known that here the whole time. Let us ask them, because European citizens have, for decades, simply accepted, and not decided, what happens in European institutions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a new stability mechanism is proposed. In the election campaign in Ireland, those parties likely to form the new government are promising a major renegotiation of the existing EU-IMF austerity plan, lessening its severity. But this is mere speculation and it is unjust and anti-democratic that the Irish people are asked to vote for a fog of conjecture.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wanted to ask Mr Barroso, as President of the Commission, not to intervene in the Irish election campaign, but to vindicate the democratic right of the Irish people to factual information and to the truth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Rehn said yesterday that renegotiation of the EU-IMF deal appeared to be possible, but I have four specific questions. Firstly, is renegotiation possible immediately on a new government taking office in Ireland and before the new mechanism of 2013? Secondly, would this mean substantial reductions in the brutal levels of interest charged? Thirdly, would the financial speculators be forced to take their own losses rather than crucifying the Irish people? Fourthly, does he understand that only a renegotiation that reverses cuts and provides substantial public investment in jobs will resolve our crisis in Ireland, while more cuts and austerity will wreck our society?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, well, here we go again. The failed political project that is the euro has led us to amend the Lisbon Treaty twice in its short life. We should remember, of course, that the Lisbon Treaty was bludgeoned through the referendum in Ireland. The Irish people said ‘no’ but they were lied to; they were told that their economy would be protected, but they were misled, and now, as the European Union does when it encounters a problem, it does not take a step back to ask ‘what have we done wrong?’ No, you want further integration and you want the small states to suffer more. You wish to fine them if they get into further difficulties, which will then put them in more difficulties and make them more subject to your European empire.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to say this to Mr Barroso: yes, the UK may have a debt problem, but it is not helped by having to bail out eurozone countries like Ireland when we have had to borrow the money to do that in the first place.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, changing the Treaty is not something we should enter into lightly, especially given the fact that the Lisbon Treaty took considerable work and negotiation. Therefore, this Parliament and the Council must be very restrained in how we now set about amending it. This change is necessary in order to protect weaker eurozone economies. However, the positions of those Member States who are not part of the euro must also be upheld.</p>
      <p sl="en">This Treaty change will not solve the failure of Member States to live up to their agreements under the Stability and Growth Pact. It will not solve the underlying problems of huge public deficits, nor will it make the EU more competitive on a global stage. It is merely a stop-gap measure that should give us more time to get the individual eurozone and our collective houses in order.</p>
      <p sl="en">Each of the EU Member States needs to look at its own public spending and tax policies and devise realistic programmes to reinvigorate our economies. One line of text added into an international agreement, although necessary, will be no substitute for real reform and prudence. Therefore, a real strategy for global competitiveness needs to emerge.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all the participants in the debate and the Members of the European Parliament for their clear support for a communitarian approach, for a strong European Union, and for an appropriate role in the future mechanism which we are discussing today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our opinion was very clear, which is that we fully support the creation of the European stabilisation mechanism and see it as a very important part of the mosaic for a stronger and more economically prosperous Europe. We are working on increased supervision of financial markets, on better economic governance, with our six legislative proposals on the table. We started the first European semester with our annual growth survey, and this should be the last piece of the puzzle.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also think that with this and with our debate today, and what I believe will be a positive decision in March, we are sending very clear signals to all those who are betting against the euro. If you bet against the euro, you will lose your money. That is a very important message to send out.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, the decision on this issue will be absolutely crucial, but I know that for this House, it is also very important that we respect fully the competences of the Union, we respect fully the prerogatives and role of the Union’s institutions. Of course, the Commission will definitely see to it that European law is always respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we stated in our opinion, the Commission also stands ready to use its expertise in handling these mechanisms, because I believe that they should be in full coherence with improved economic governance, especially as regards the coordination and surveillance of economic and financial policies in the Member States, in particular, those of the eurozone.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you have been concerned that we should not create a two-tier Europe. I think that the Commission’s position on this is also very clear: even though the primary responsibility for the euro currency remains with the eurozone Member States, it is very clear that any future cooperation mechanism must be open to others and that all the work we are doing to increase competitiveness and convergence must be for all 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I believe that the process which we are going through, and in which financial markets also played a role in accelerating our integration, in accelerating our cooperation in the field of economic governance, should be very much welcomed, because it is definitely making our Union stronger.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank particularly the two rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, for their close cooperation, for the ideas which have been brought to the table, and for the consultations which the Commission has with the two rapporteurs on an ongoing basis. I believe that their good work will lead to a report which will be approved by this House in time, before the decision of the European Council is taken.</p>
      <p sl="en">My last remark is to Mr Higgins from Ireland. He very correctly pointed to the quote from Commissioner Rehn, stating that the agreement was struck with Ireland – not with the government but with Ireland as a country. Of course, we expect that any future government would respect the deal. Having said that, it is very clear and it is very obvious that the Commission is very sympathetic to the current difficulties that Ireland is going through and will do its utmost to support a swift return to growth in Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European institutions – be it the European Union, the Commission, or the European Central Bank, or indeed the IMF – have contributed a lot to stabilising the situation in Ireland. I am sure that all together, we will do our utmost to bring back growth and prosperity to Ireland as well.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This debate has made it clear that the European Commission is committed to continuing along the road on which it started out with the undemocratic way of gaining approval for the Treaty of Lisbon. It should be remembered that, following the rejection of the so-called European constitution by the citizens of France and the Netherlands, the leaders of the European Union did everything they could to avoid further referenda. Even after the first rejection from Ireland, they exerted every possible pressure in order to ensure that, after some time had passed, a new referendum took place.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Now, some months having passed since the new Treaty entered into force, here they are, once again, trying to change things quickly without any kind of public debate, for fear of the reactions of citizens of the various Member States of the European Union, in particular, those which are suffering the consequences of increasingly neoliberal policies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Now, they wish to make recourse to the so-called ‘simplified procedure’ in order to hide the fact that they are, in fact, changing an important issue which is linked to constitutionalisation, with a view to its transformation into a permanent fund, of the European Financial Stability Fund, with the inadmissible conditions contained in the so-called competitiveness pact and its severe consequences upon social policies: the devaluation of salaries and pensions, and the increase in retirement age.</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-439-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Cecilia Malmström" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Court of Human Rights ruling of 21 January on the case of M.S.S. versus Greece and Belgium clearly showed that the EU urgently needs to establish a common European asylum system and that we need to support Member States in meeting their obligation to provide adequate international protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has always said that in the application of the EU acquis – and the Dublin regulation is an important element of the current EU acquis on asylum – Member States are never discharged of the obligation to ensure the protection of fundamental rights. The European Court of Justice recalled that principle in its judgment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The judgment does not affect the underlying principles of the functioning of the Dublin system: to have a clear system to identify which Member State is responsible, to examine an asylum application, to guarantee effective access to the procedures of determining refugee status, and to prevent abuse of asylum procedures in the form of multiple applications.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the evaluation of the Dublin system made by the Commission has shown that there is room for improvement. Already in 2008, the Commission proposed a revised Dublin regulation to address the identified gaps. It aimed to increase both the standards of protection for the asylum applicants concerned, as well as the level of efficiency of the Dublin system for the benefit of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the European Parliament’s strong support for the Commission proposals and I invite the Council and the European Parliament to work together for a balanced compromise leading to an improved Dublin 2 regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such a compromise must also include an emergency mechanism for suspension of transfers in situations of exceptional and particular pressure on the asylum system as a matter of last resort. It would provide a common, comprehensive solution to cases which today are treated in a discretionary manner in order to build more trust and a genuine support between the Dublin partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has been aware of the deficiencies of the Greek asylum system, which is confronted with exceptional pressure due to high numbers of mixed migration flows on its territory and the lack of a proper functioning national asylum system. We have already taken steps to review them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Greece in November 2009, setting out concerns about various provisions of EU law. Greece itself has committed to reforming its asylum system, based on an action plan submitted to the Commission in August last year setting out immediate and long-term measures. Since then, important legislative developments have taken place in Greece.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, the Commission is engaged in substantial efforts towards assisting Greece, together with the Member States, the UNHCR and EU agencies. This support combines significant financial and practical assistance for the reform of the national asylum system, border and return management, and more efficient use of the EU funds for migration management and also better cooperation with neighbouring countries, in particular, Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finish by recalling that our Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights. Asylum is one of the human rights which the European Union is committed to respecting and promoting. The Commission is firmly committed to working towards a fair, efficient and protection-oriented common European asylum system. That is the best way to jointly uphold human rights as one of the important pillars of the area of freedom, justice and security.</p>

    <intervention id="2-440-000" speaker_id="28229" name="Manfred Weber" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mrs Malmström, asylum policy is a highly topical issue, as we have recently discovered in Lampedusa and in Greece. It is a subject that concerns the people of Europe. We should be proud of what we have achieved in Europe, including our common standards, the proper processing of asylum applications and our way of dealing with children and families. We should be proud of all of this. Europe is an area which offers help and partnership to people suffering persecution all over the world. However, the decisive factor is not what we put on paper in Parliament’s committees, in the Commission and in the Council, but what actually happens on the ground. Belgium and Greece have recently been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for not implementing and not adhering to existing legislation. This makes it clear that the enforcement process is not working.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to ask the Commission to make faster progress, alongside its existing action plans. We need to be able to put in place and implement the important standards more quickly within the European Union. In the specific case of Greece, I would like to point out that we have a border that can be secured from both sides. I am disappointed in the way our partner, Turkey, has behaved in this respect. We have signed a readmission agreement with Turkey, which requires the country to do far less than it would have to if it were a member of the European Union. Therefore, I think we should expect Turkey to make a greater effort in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">No one disputes our sense of solidarity. We want to provide practical help in the form of the European Refugee Fund and Frontex, both in the case of Greece, where aid is already being provided, and in the case of Lampedusa in Italy. European solidarity is not being called into question. It is needed now more than it ever has been.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, as the Court judgment has illustrated, we are all trapped in Dublin II. As a result of the unequal distribution of responsibility, Member States have been in an argument about who is responsible and complaints have been flying back and forth for years now, with the unfortunate refugees trapped in the middle.</p>
      <p sl="el">Recently, 90% of immigrants and asylum seekers in Europe have arrived via Greece. Now, with Algeria, the pressure has shifted to Italy. How long are certain parties going to insist on pretending that this is a Greek, Italian, Maltese or Cypriot problem? Our borders are the European borders. Our development policy, our foreign policy, or rather the lack thereof, are European issues.</p>
      <p sl="el">My country has recently made huge steps towards improving the asylum situation, with solid assistance from the European Commission. However, this is obviously not enough. The new Dublin regulation must put a stop to mass returns to the first Member State. Proper, fundamental solidarity must be established between the Member States. That is what Parliament has called for. The time has come for some members of the Council to stop playing Pontius Pilate and washing their hands.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights makes it clear that Belgium and Greece have contravened Articles 3 and 13 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Thus, both of these countries are guilty of inhuman and degrading treatment of an Afghan asylum seeker as he was transferred from Belgium to Greece. Unfortunately, this case is not at all unique. However, the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights is precedential and therefore important.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As Parliament’s rapporteur for the review of the Dublin II regulation, I welcome this ruling. It demonstrates, with the clarity that is required, that all Member States must stop transferring people to Greece while the situation there continues to be as it is today. It also demonstrates the need for European solidarity. If we are serious about creating a common asylum system by 2012, we need to share the responsibility and help each other.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to ask the Commission whether this ruling changes the Commission’s view of the Dublin system as a cornerstone of the common asylum system and I would like to know whether the Commission has access to the statistics that indicate the grounds on which the Member States base their transfer decisions. It is important that we avoid more cases like this one.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Parliament has a clear view on the Dublin regulation and we are now waiting impatiently to be able to start the negotiations. Our priorities are the issue of custody, the solidarity mechanism, the rights of minors and stronger provisions regarding judicial remedy. I look forward to your response, Mrs Malmström, and to the continuation of our excellent cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the question is: so, what do we do, now that the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has said, ‘You must not send any more asylum seekers back to Greece’? The Minister for Justice in my country, the Netherlands, came up with a proposed solution. He said: ‘We will take very rapid action to help the Greeks monitor their borders more strictly, set up their asylum system, and then we can just send any Dublin claimants back to Greece’. Of course, that is not, ultimately, any solution, at all.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Because, in this House, all the parties, right across the political spectrum, have said that we need to introduce a solidarity clause into the Dublin system. If that does not happen, southerly countries will always have a harder deal than my own country, on the North Sea, which does not see so very many refugee boats landing on its shores.</p>
      <p sl="nl">From the influx of immigrants into Lampedusa, Commissioner, we can see that, even if you are capable of working very hard to monitor your borders, you also have to be prepared for unexpected events. Do you agree with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that the Dublin system is now in tatters and when can we can see some momentum towards changing the Dublin system? Do you agree with us here that what goes around comes around and that the northerly countries are now being forced to show solidarity?</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would also like to hear your opinion on last week’s ruling of the Court in Strasbourg, which states that the number of Rule 39 cases, that is, applications for the suspension of deportation, increased by 4 000% last year, because people can see that Dublin is just not working.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The last thing I would say is that, in the case between Maritime Support Services (MSS) and the Belgian authorities, the final findings were that the Belgian authorities were at fault. They had to pay the greatest financial claim. They were negligent. When can we expect changes to the Dublin system, so that these people are no longer exposed to inhuman conditions?</p>

      <p sl="nl">I think that we should first look for the beam in our own eye. Europe has made a mess of its own asylum system. As long as we continue to do that and as long as we remain unwilling to help Greece get the asylum seekers off its back, once and for all, and to ensure that we all have a uniform procedure for assessing whether or not someone is a genuine political refugee, we will never be in a position to shift the blame onto others.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I agree with you, Mr Madlener, that human traffickers should be arrested and that Turkey really should set up a decent asylum system, a system that recognises political refugees who do not come from the European Union, but from elsewhere.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would say to the Commissioner that it is clear we are dealing with a system which is broken. What is clear is that the European courts and European legislation are in conflict. We are no longer dealing with a situation where a law is being implemented, but rather it is being interpreted in a novel way.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the European Union is best equipped to deal with the challenges of immigration through a nuanced system which is not dictatorial, not through more harmonised European legislation or the moral rulings of the European courts, but instead through solidarity, cooperation and good communication among European neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must be mindful that whatever burden is relieved in one place is not just moved to another. Of course, we have a duty to other EU Member States and to people seeking a safer and a freer life, but the recent Court ruling points at larger problems, which are the relationship between the European courts, European legislators and the Member States and their control of their own borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, I would be interested to know how the Commission is attempting to confront these issues in the long term. Could you please reassure this House that we will not just turn to the creation of more EU legislation, which no doubt at some point in the future will itself be overturned by a European court, but instead tell us how we can effectively support Greece and other Member States that are currently operating under such burdens?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, first of all, a word of thanks and support for Commissioner Malmström. She rightly called on Member States last week to take action again on the whole asylum package. Indeed, it is not an à la carte menu.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The sudden influx of Tunisian refugees is fresh evidence of this. Italy is having the greatest of difficulties in ensuring that proper reception and asylum procedures are followed. If the other Member States continue to just stand by and watch, it will only be a matter of time before the European Court of Human Rights concludes that the transfer of asylum applications to Italy should be suspended, as, in fact, it did in the case of Greece.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is therefore in everybody’s interests that we develop an emergency procedure within the framework of the Dublin system, as indeed the Commission proposed, and that we quickly put in place ​​binding agreements on reception and a high quality asylum procedure.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to hear from the Commissioner whether she thinks that the relevant MEPs could be of further assistance to her, in terms of persuading the Member States to finally take this much-needed action. In any case, she can count on my commitment.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Netherlands is once again having to clean up Greece’s mess! First, Dutch taxpayers had to pay billions of euro to bail out this nearly bankrupt country, and now we are saddled with two thousand asylum seekers from Greece whom we are not allowed to send back.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Netherlands does not want those asylum seekers. The Netherlands has suffered enough, and continues to suffer, from mass immigration and the failed multicultural experiment. The Netherlands wants fewer immigrants who have no prospects and Europe has to start pursuing a much more stringent immigration policy. Otherwise, Europe will end up becoming Eurabia.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, Greece is also the victim of its bad neighbour, Turkey. Greece should therefore build a wall to keep out Turkish emigrants and emigrants which Turkey is allowing to transit its territory. We should punish Turkey, of course, for providing illegal immigrants with a passage to Greece.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, the European asylum legislation should be a great deal more stringent. Let us be honest: 99% of asylum seekers are, in fact, not asylum seekers at all, but economic fortune seekers abusing our asylum laws.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I shall continue the debate with the following hypothesis: we have seen the unrest in the Mediterranean and Arab countries. We know that many citizens of these countries hope to find a better fate in Europe. This is already a fact of life and I fear that the hypothesis I am about to develop will soon become another fact of life.</p>
      <p sl="el">Citizens leave these third countries for Europe. They arrive in Lampedusa – we have seen the problems that have arisen there – or try to reach Greece via Turkey, exploiting the facility not to apply for a visa based on the agreements which many of these third countries have with Turkey. Others go to Malta, some probably go to Portugal and Spain. Then some of them apply for asylum. It goes without saying that here again, Dublin II will be applied. We know that, even though some asylum seekers then appeal on these issues, again there will be convictions, just as we have had to date, by national courts, before we even get to a European Court ruling. So let us not pretend otherwise.</p>
      <p sl="el">Then there is this: some are arrested and will not be entitled to asylum. I am sure you know that, based on the agreement on which the Commission has just announced the end of negotiations, in order for those who enter via Turkey to be returned to Turkey under readmission, we will need to wait two years for the agreement to apply plus three years, which is the transitional period for third country nationals, giving a total of five years. In other words, those arrested during that period, based on the crisis we are facing, will need to wait until 2016 or 2017 for Turkey to take them back.</p>
      <p sl="el">Allow me to say that, with this sort of management, I fear that Europe is not up to the job at the moment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I think that it is always useful to remind ourselves of a number of commitments, and particularly the one made in October 2008, via the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which announced that it was time to take new initiatives to complete the introduction of a common European asylum system, and thus to offer a higher level of protection within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">More than two years after this promise, the Commission’s proposals are on the negotiating table. One cannot help but notice, however, that this European asylum system and the harmonisation process are struggling somewhat to see the light of day.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights is an important turning point, in my opinion. Obviously, it highlights the failures of the Greek asylum system, but it also sends a strong message at a time when Greece is starting to reform its asylum system and, at the same time, to take other types of initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Aside from this particular situation, however, this decision more generally calls into question the European asylum system as a whole, particularly regarding one of its fundamental components – the Dublin regulation – and its main premise, the equivalence of national asylum systems within the Union. This decision shows how, paradoxically, the common European asylum system has created a kind of injustice, both for asylum seekers and for the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Following this decision, clear measures are now needed immediately. Pending an operational asylum system in Greece, the Member States must suspend returning asylum seekers to Greece and use the sovereignty clause of this regulation which allows them to take responsibility for examining an application.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Court of Human Rights’ (ECHR) decision also sends a signal to all parties concerned. I think that this decision should serve as a catalyst in the process of harmonisation and redrafting, in particular, when it comes to the Dublin regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, this is, of course, about the mechanism for suspending transfers that I have just mentioned, which is being proposed by the Commission. The ECHR’s decision sheds new light on this mechanism, on the one hand, and on intra-European solidarity, on the other. The suspension should restart discussions on the need for a suspension mechanism, as I mentioned, under conditions which are clearly specified.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, aside from this mechanism, the suspension must also serve as a lever – or at least, I hope it will – to provide support, during the negotiations, for the other amendments to the regulation that are being proposed by the Commission, as well as those on the guarantees given in this instrument, among others.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the suspension by the ECHR should allow us to start thinking about the inherent vulnerability of the situation that asylum seekers find themselves in. It should also make it necessary to bring in an appeal mechanism to suspend transfer of asylum seekers who are subject to a transfer decision resulting from the application of the Dublin regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, many of the warning lights are red; they are telling us that it is time to reform this regulation and to construct a true common asylum system founded on solidarity and responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mrs Malmström, we are talking today about the judgment passed by the European Court of Human Rights. This is ultimately about Belgium, but it concerns every Member State of the European Union. Germany has also decided no longer to send asylum seekers back to Greece.</p>
      <p sl="de">As one of my fellow Members has mentioned, we must ask ourselves whether we want to build walls around Europe or whether we want to maintain and develop the right to asylum, something which I, as a Liberal, strongly support. However, this also means that we must give every asylum seeker the chance of a properly organised process. We must realise that it is unfair and shows a lack of solidarity if we allow the southern countries to bear the entire burden alone. Because of their geographical position, these countries have been exposed to an increased influx of refugees. In Lampedusa, this is because of current events in Tunisia. However, this is also an ongoing situation which the local asylum authorities cannot cope with.</p>
      <p sl="de">The recent liberalisation with regard to Kosovo also resulted in a huge influx of asylum seekers into Germany just a few weeks ago. We also had the problem that we could not initially process all the applications properly. Therefore, if we really want to retain this right to asylum, we must restructure the system to ensure that it offers greater solidarity in future. Dublin II cannot continue in its current form.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Afghan citizen referred to in the judgment of the Court of Human Rights was not an immigrant, was not abusing the system and was not a victim of human trafficking. Moreover, he was not covered by the Geneva Convention because he was not persecuted. He was an asylum seeker, so he would have had subsidiary protection and international protection. The judgment is therefore important due to the precedent that it sets.</p>
      <p sl="es">How many people could be awaiting judgments having appealed against denied asylum applications? How many people could apply for compensation due to delays in proceedings? What would happen if there were more than a thousand judgments by the Court of Human Rights against Member States? What would happen to Europe’s reputation?</p>
      <p sl="es">Can we continue to consider ourselves to be champions of fundamental rights if we treat asylum seekers who are fleeing wars worse than if they were criminals?</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, asylum seekers can be awaiting proceedings in detention centres – if they are refugees or receiving subsidiary protection – for up to seven months, with no procedural rights. Is this humane?</p>
      <p sl="es">The asylum package has been stalled for too long, and the common asylum system does not exist, Mr Weber. Nor do all the Member States have the same procedures. There is a lack of solidarity, which is the cause of the situation that we are experiencing.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Afghan citizen was compensated for non-material damage, not based on the Dublin regulation, but how much compensation can be applied for due to non-material damage by those fleeing wars who spend years going back and forth between camps? We are tired of talking about abuse and traffickers. Will it not be the case that we want to look the other way and deny the existence of a situation that we seek to deny time and time again? Dublin can indeed be perfected, but a great deal more needs to be done. This is urgent, Commissioner.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, the European Court decision is not so much a condemnation against Belgium or Greece as it is as condemnation against the Dublin regulation, because it was that very Dublin regulation that allowed Belgium to transfer an Afghan person back to Greece. This is not fair. It is not fair that the border countries shoulder the burden single-handedly, because – let us be frank – the border countries are not there to act as police officers or border guards for the rest of the European Union countries.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Therefore, in the wake of the decision handed down by the European Court of Justice, it is now clear that when a European country transfers an asylum seeker back to another European country that is under enormous pressure, it goes against the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Countries like Germany and the United Kingdom have already begun to recognise this and have suspended the transfers. However, what we need is for the Dublin regulation to be amended without delay.</p>

      <p sl="el">Cyprus, a small state with a population of half a million, has a daily influx of immigrants, who cross the Green line from the occupied areas in numbers of 30 to 50 a day, out of a population of half a million.</p>
      <p sl="el">We have no detention centres for asylum seekers. As a result, if their application is rejected, we cannot send them back at the end of the day to the country they came from.

      <p sl="de">For us, this is all about protecting fundamental rights and human rights. We cannot say about people who have fled from their country and sought asylum in Europe, for whatever reason, and about people who have voluntarily climbed into an overcrowded boat and put their lives at risk: ‘We want to send these people back before they have even arrived’. We need sensible asylum processes for these people which function properly. We cannot leave the southern European countries, where these people arrive, to cope with the problem alone. I agree completely with my colleague, Mrs Hirsch, on that point.</p>
      <p sl="de">From another perspective, it is wrong to say that we want all these people to stay outside Europe and we do not want to take them in. Demographic change is taking place in Europe and in future, we will need integration and also asylum seekers who want to stay here. This is not just an issue of humanity, but also of common sense. For this reason, we need to come up with solutions to this problem quickly.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, according to the judgment passed by the European Court of Human Rights, the asylum system in Greece is inhumane. This is because it can take up to five years to come to a final decision. However, the procedures all over Europe take a long time, because lies are being told, papers are being burnt or forged, decisions are ignored and the asylum system is quite simply being exploited and abused. This is particularly true where there is no real reason for asylum and, after a process lasting years, the applicant suddenly claims the right of residence on humanitarian grounds.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the light of the failed EU asylum system, we must finally be honest and admit that the EU cannot accept economic migrants from all over the world, particularly when, at the same time, it is spending billions of euro on development aid and support for democracy in the countries where these people come from.</p>
      <p sl="de">We finally need a clear definition of the right to asylum, which is closely linked to the Geneva Convention, in order to bring an end to economic migration. It must also include an obligation on the part of the asylum seekers to cooperate in the procedure. This will remove the legal basis for deception on humanitarian grounds.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the progressive waiving of visas, on the one hand, and the fresh upsurge in migratory flows, on the other, mean that the asylum package really needs to take priority in the Council. If supported by the Commission, this initiative would have the positive effect of regulating a complex issue and laying down a unitary strategy that enforces the decision we are negotiating today, as well as providing the opportunity to avoid transfers like those we have discussed today.</p>
      <p sl="it">Obviously, we are in favour of protecting human rights, though also marrying this requirement with a rigorous verification of requirements. Commissioner, since the situation has become unsustainable, we now need to begin the search for a positive set of rules and a clear regulatory framework. This is an important step which I am sure, with your help, can be sent for Council assessment within a reasonably short period of time.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I would like to ask the Commissioner how she intends to counter the iconoclastic idea of erecting a wall between Turkey and Greece, even if this can be explained by the very strong pressure faced by this country, and even if, as some fellow Members have said, the conditions are particularly difficult for those who end up in detention centres.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Even though the Member States are free to make their own construction plans – even if this means constructing a wall, even if it is an unrealistic solution – we Europeans are particularly implicated, both cyclically, with what is happening on the island of Lampedusa and the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, and structurally, with the situation of the countries in the South.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The time has therefore come to revisit the Dublin regulation urgently, so that we can take joint responsibility for these situations throughout Europe, showing solidarity and a humanistic approach.

      <p sl="it">However, Europe cannot abandon those border countries that find themselves managing emergency migrations which do not only affect them but also, by extension, the whole of Europe. The border countries alone cannot bear all the responsibilities of the costs and organisation required to deal with asylum applications that often require a great deal of time and long and careful evaluations. These timeframes and careful evaluations must not affect the dignity of the migrants, which must always be protected in any case.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have contributed. This ruling is extremely interesting, but it does not completely undermine the Dublin system as it is today. This more or less works and, independent of the ruling, already obliges Member States to ensure that fundamental rights are respected. Nevertheless, it points out some important issues and that is why we do need to reform the Dublin Convention and we need to improve it.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why the Commission has proposed improvements, and I am very happy to know that you are working on these and that you are also seeing the need to have some sort of emergency mechanism in this. We support you fully in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to accelerate our work to establish a common asylum system. Most people here are agreed with that, and I am very grateful for the work you are doing. The best way to achieve that is to go on with the work, to publish the reports and to encourage the Council to start negotiating.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are too many differences between the Member States today and that is not sustainable. In a common Union, with common values and a common application of international standards and conventions, there cannot be such differences as there are today. People need to be treated in a decent way. We need to ensure protection for the most vulnerable. We need to have efficient systems so that people are not kept in detention for months, and sometimes years. That is very painful for the individual and it is also very costly for society. We need to improve that. Again, I can only encourage you and the Council to keep on working on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Greece, the Commission is doing a lot to help. The Greek Government is working with its action plan. It is a very ambitious plan, but it has been clear from the beginning that this is not going to be solved over a weekend. There are long-standing problems. We are there to support and the fact that all Member States are involved in the Frontex operation, but have also offered different kinds of assistance – economic assistance or technical expertise, interpreters, administrative assistance – shows that there is true European solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to help Greece because Greece is under extreme pressure, and that is a European challenge as well. Of course, Greece has the main responsibility. It has done a lot, but needs to do more. I am not convinced that a fence or a wall is a solution because there are other reforms that are much more important. We are also working with EASO, the new asylum support office in Valletta. And we are working with UNHCR.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lately, Turkey has shown itself to be constructive and cooperative. We have finalised the negotiations on a readmission agreement after eight years. I hope that the Member States will accept that when we have the next Council next week.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the figures that Mrs Wikström asked about, the figures I have for the period 2009 and 2010 show that there were 16 328 requests to take charge or take back migrants addressed by Member States to Greece. Of that number, 12 638 (77%) were accepted. Nevertheless, Member States executed only 2 251 of these transfers, that is a bit less than 14%.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank you again for the support you are giving to the work we are trying to do with the asylum package. The legislative acts are on the table. Let us keep on working together – the Commission, Parliament and the Council – to get this done as soon as possible so that, finally, we have a common European asylum system.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for this very timely debate on a situation that deserves all our attention.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is following the situation very closely and Frontex has sent two experts to the scene. Approximately 5 500 Tunisian migrants are reported to have reached Italian shores in the last couple of days, but the numbers have dropped a little bit in the last 24 hours. Those arriving are mostly men in their thirties, but there are also 34 women and 108 children; 27 facilitators of trafficking were identified. These people arriving on Italian shores are causing exceptional pressure on the reception facilities of Italy, particularly in Lampedusa.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last Saturday, we already started to have contact with the Italian Ministry of the Interior and we have also received a formal request for EU assistance. We are ready to assist both Italy and Tunisia. This is a matter of importance for the whole EU, not just a bilateral issue. Even before the last developments, the Commission, together with Frontex, started to identify what can be done in the short and medium term. The EU common response should be based on the principle of EU solidarity between Member States; and we are ready to assist Italy.</p>
      <p sl="en">But our approach should also be based on solidarity with Tunisia and its democratic transition. This was also expressed by Lady Ashton when she visited the Tunisian authorities in Tunis yesterday, offering them political and financial support.</p>
      <p sl="en">To assist Italy in these circumstances, we have identified a comprehensive series of concrete measures as well as quick financial assistance. Financially, we are ready to mobilise extraordinary assistance, under the European Refugee Fund for 2011, in addition to the funding already earmarked for Italy. This should cover payments for accommodation, infrastructure, material aid, medical care, social assistants, counselling with judicial administrative asylum procedures, legal aid, language assistance, etc.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can also mobilise quite quickly resources from EU funds such as the External Borders Fund and, if necessary, Italy can ask the new European Office for Asylum in Valetta to deploy teams of support to the national authorities dealing with the asylum requests.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the surveillance of external borders, a joint Frontex operation could be set up and I am in contact with Frontex. I know preparations at technical level are being made.</p>
      <p sl="en">As usual, such a joint debate will depend on Member States’ voluntary contributions of equipment. I invite all Member States to show their support. But let me reassure you on one point, referring to the debate we had just a few minutes ago: due to the different nature of sea/land border operations and a request to Member States to participate in a new joint operation, this will not compete with their contribution to the operation that we now have at the Greek land border. This is, of course, also a priority.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to underline that we must pay specific attention to vulnerable categories of persons in need of international protection. Their needs must be taken into account and they must be able to access the special protection that they are entitled to, as provided by national and EU law.</p>
      <p sl="en">With these concrete actions I have now mentioned, we are ready to meet and to engage with representatives of the Italian authorities to agree on details of each of these actions and the next steps.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, a medium-term strategy must also be further developed. In the particular context of migration flows, we need a combination of effective border management and a strategy for supporting democratic and economic transition. In the short term, the Tunisian authorities should efficiently patrol the frontiers of their own country, at sea and along the coasts, to prevent smugglers, human traffickers and criminals who have escaped from prison from taking advantage of the situation. It is also important that Tunisia takes back those who have reached the territory of EU Member States and are not in need of international protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking at a more structured intervention, we should also explore the possibilities of better targeting EU assistance by promoting projects that are able to support income- and job-generating activities in the different regions of Tunisia, and I refer particularly to the southern parts of the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">More broadly, a coherent approach supporting political and economic development in Tunisia needs to include possibilities for these people to come to the EU legally, as well as the exchange of goods, services and know-how.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a wind blowing over the Mediterranean as a result of these popular revolutions. This wind can bring many positive developments to Tunisia, to other countries, and to the EU. The current situation in Lampedusa should not undermine our intention to offer assistance and support to these emerging democracies and the young generation that so passionately and peacefully has been able to achieve fundamental political changes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the humanitarian emergency in Italy and, in particular, on the island of Lampedusa – because this is what it is, a humanitarian emergency – compels us to act urgently.</p>
      <p sl="en">I propose five steps. Firstly, a veritable Marshall Plan for Tunisia and Egypt which would provide tangible help across the board but, at the same time, expect in return the full cooperation of the Tunisian authorities in blocking their coasts so as not to allow further illegal emigration by sea.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we need the urgent deployment of a Frontex RABIT mission – a rapid border intervention team. So, Commissioner, we do not just need two Frontex experts but a Frontex mission that must be sent there now.</p>

Quite frankly, Commissioner, I do not see how you can say that EASO will send its experts when this EU office is still not yet operating, so we will have to do it in another manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, we need to help with the process of repatriation: immediate repatriation of people who do not qualify for asylum protection. They should be sent back to Tunisia where they came from.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we need to bear in mind that in the Treaty, we have Article 80, which clearly states that our immigration policy should be based on the principle of solidarity and on the just sharing of responsibility. I think that it is about time that the Commission implemented this article.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that there is a large majority of Members of this House that welcome the democratic movements in Mediterranean countries as a challenge to European external policy and to its commitment to values, but also that there are many of us who know that these movements are not harmless. They have humanitarian effects and an impact in terms of migratory pressure on neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is therefore the time to be reminded that the Treaty of Lisbon is in force, and Articles 67, 77, 78(3) and 80, as has just been said, state that shared solidarity and responsibility make this challenge a European one. It is not only a shared challenge but a joint one, and therefore one that affects the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is time to say that no country is alone. It is time to say that this is not an issue for Italy in Lampedusa, or for Malta, Greece or Spain. No! It is an issue for the European institutions. It is also the time, however, to say that we are not talking about the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders, which is an operational agency, or about the European Asylum Support Office, but about the level of political decision making. This means pointing out that the necessary resources need to be invested in development cooperation and assisting with the needs of these countries in terms of establishing and consolidating democracy. The necessary resources also need to be invested, however, in assisting EU Member States with the challenge of primary care in response to immigration and with the challenge of managing the joint borders.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is therefore the time to say that the Treaty of Lisbon has a whole programme to implement and that Parliament will be there to support it in tackling the challenge that we have before us.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start my speech with a statement supposedly made by the Italian Foreign Minister yesterday in Damascus, during which he said – listen to this – that Syria ‘is a stable country in which the population’s desire for modernisation has been satisfied’. Meanwhile, a few days ago, Italy’s Interior Minister made another statement in which he shifted his responsibilities to Europe, which has allegedly abandoned Italy ‘as usual’, he added with a hint of mischief.</p>
      <p sl="it">As usual, however, we are witnessing the habit of blaming Europe when it suits, only to ignore it irritably when Brussels disapproves of the agreement on sea repatriations, which violates humanitarian law and lines the pockets of African dictators – some of whom are today being toppled – and continuing even today to lavish billions on the Libya of Mr Gaddafi, or refusing EUR 10 million of aid offered to the Italian Government by the European Fund for Refugees, which Italy decided not to use, possibly because it would have to be spent in keeping with Europe’s transparent rules and not the in-house criteria of the Italian Civil Protection Agency.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, I think that we will achieve nothing by acting like this and by making these declarations. The lesson of recent weeks has really not been learnt. Lampedusa reminds us that history is stronger than certain political games and recourse to declarations that create illusions. It reminds us that not everything can be bought with money, that Europe is not something that can be called upon when it suits, but is a project that must be committed to each day, demanding rights and solidarity but also respecting the commitments undertaken.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, by restricting the title of this debate to support for Italy and other Member States, we are once again making the mistake of focusing only on the problems of the countries bordering on the Mediterranean. What we are lacking is concern for those people who are fleeing across the sea.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we really take our principles concerning the protection of refugees seriously, we must first make sure and, if necessary, check in individual cases what situation these people are in and then guarantee that their human rights will be protected. We must not allow people to be turned away and our borders to be fortified. The help which the EU border agency Frontex can offer in this situation is constantly referred to. It is true that it could be helpful if it would focus its activities on protecting and rescuing refugees. We must not turn away boats full of refugees as we have done in the past. Here in Parliament, we are currently drawing up a new mandate for Frontex and I hope that we will succeed in introducing improvements, including more transparency and specific requirements for the agency to act in accordance with human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, we also need to help Tunisia quickly to structure its economy in such a way that the people there become more confident of having a chance of earning a decent living in their own country. We must make it possible for Tunisia to achieve rapid and positive economic development by means of trade with the EU and subsidies for projects there. This is one of the main requirements of the democratic transformation of Tunisia.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is completely incomprehensible that once again, many Member States of the EU are leaving the countries bordering on the Mediterranean to cope with an unforeseen influx of refugees. The call for voluntary action to help islands such as Lampedusa and Malta has fallen on deaf ears. We must find a binding solution which requires states in the centre and the north of the EU to take in refugees. The infrastructure is in place. All that is lacking is the political will and the sense of solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot, in truth, discuss the problem of Lampedusa without keeping one thing in mind: in Tunisia, under President Ben Ali, there was a law, which has still not been repealed, which made emigration a crime. This means that it is not just an issue for Frontex because, after all, it is necessary to guarantee that these people will not be returned only to end up in a Tunisian prison, and it is necessary to persuade the new government to repeal this law.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, above all, I believe that this reveals a fundamental unreality in our immigration policy, which is dependent on one person. This person is not Mrs Malmström, nor is it Mr Barroso; it is Mr Gaddafi. If Mr Gaddafi falls, as I sincerely hope he does, what will we do about our principal buffer for immigrants from North and sub-Saharan Africa?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Furthermore, this shows us that we have, at the moment, from Morocco to Syria, a 5 000 kilometre line along which the humanitarian risk has increased at every kilometre of the way, and that we have to prepare ourselves in a way which is perhaps without parallel in European history since 1956 in Hungary, for a refugee crisis. This implies an end to codecision with regard to resettlement because we could have refugee camps on Europe’s borders if one of these revolutions goes badly – something which we hope will not happen – and put an end once and for all to the edifice of the policies on asylum in Europe and on shared relocation of asylum seekers within the countries of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to provide an immediate political response to these emergencies. The urgent interventions requested by Italy are: 1) the transformation of Frontex from a coordination agency to an operative structure with its own people and resources; 2) the implementation of the principle of burden sharing; 3) the use of Europol for investigations on possible terrorist infiltrations and criminal organisation of the traffic in human beings; and 4) the allocation of resources to deal with the emergency.</p>
      <p sl="it">In any case, none of this will resolve the structural causes of the revolutions in the Maghreb, which all arise from the lack of genuine political parties, trade unions, associations, a free press and, above all, lack of respect for human rights. In essence, the institutional tools that characterise true democracy and give the people a voice are missing. Without them, there cannot be economic development, jobs, stability and security for all.

      <p sl="nl">Tens of thousands of fortune seekers, some of whom are hardened criminals or even terrorists, have already arrived in Lampedusa and there are hundreds of thousands who are on the verge of following suit. The European border appears to be as leaky as a sieve. Italy is failing to protect our external border and Frontex is being overtaken by events.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would therefore call on the Council and the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, to convene an emergency meeting, in accordance with Article 28(2), at which the Council should take tough measures to call a halt to this immigration wave.

However, Commissioner, you know as well as I do that the real emergency is not the humanitarian one – which is only an after-effect – but the fact that, during this historic uprising across the whole of the Maghreb, Europe has appeared inadequate, which is to say, it has been unable to redevelop a strategy for the Mediterranean, as it has tried to several times and always failed. The Lisbon Process has failed and the Union for the Mediterranean has failed miserably.</p>
      <p sl="it">We do not have a proper view of the real problems at issue here. We need to confront them together, but today the Council is not here. We asked the Council to look at the issue of having a European strategy to deal not so much with the problem of immigration and illegal immigration, but rather the question of democracy and freedom across the whole Mediterranean area.</p>
      <p sl="it">When the Soviet Bloc collapsed, presenting a united front, we all gave practical answers and easily dealt with the problem of the thousands of Poles who arrived on our streets, because we looked at the problem of integrating the whole of the East into Europe. Regarding the Mediterranean, today we have nothing to say. Instead, we must equip ourselves with a strategy, without which we will not be able to provide any answers. We shall appreciate your good intentions and stop there.</p>

Is it acceptable, in your opinion, that Frontex or other operational methods can repatriate Tunisians when the laws of Tunisia still state that people who are repatriated will go to prison?

We have seen these people arrive in Lampedusa only to find no facilities able to receive and identify them. In fact, the Italian Government dismantled the existing reception centre and reduced the facilities there some time ago, under the banner of ‘Zero immigration’, thus preventing Italy from being able to tackle illegal immigration.</p>

Considerable financial investment is needed to solve it within a coordinated policy framework, while complying with international treaties and ensuring that refugees are protected.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a remote island lost in the middle of the Mediterranean by the name of Lampedusa. Back in 2008, this island made the headlines because 40 000 refugees landed there in that year. The problem was later resolved by an agreement – the so-called ‘friendship treaty’ – signed by the Italian and Libyan governments.</p>
      <p sl="it">Now we are facing the same situation again, but it is far more complicated this time, Mrs Malmström. Peace, stability and new governments in Tunisia as well as in Egypt are the driving forces behind a storm that is whipping up the Mediterranean. I am Sicilian and, unlike many Members who have spoken, I visited the former identification and expulsion centre. That centre was useful at the time but, once the friendship treaty was concluded, it no longer had any reason to exist.</p>
      <p sl="it">What can the Commission do, and what can Frontex do? Of course, we would all like to see the rapid intervention mission deployed in practice. We want Frontex to be a flexible, streamlined, well-structured agency with its own financial resources, and Mr Busuttil and I are reviewing its mandate in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current flood of migrants is a serious problem, and it is a European one. What is needed is not complaints, however, but effective cooperation to tackle the current crisis in a constructive and far-sighted manner. We must take action at two levels, and we will need broad shoulders to bear our responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first level concerns the immediate situation. Additional funds must be made available to deal with the crisis; we need at last to prepare a European round table, putting on the agenda the possibility of sharing out the immigrants fairly among the various countries; and, lastly, we have to meet with the provisional Tunisian Government to demand that resources and instruments be put in place to stem the current exodus.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second level is more strictly political in nature. It is absolutely vital to radically review our neighbourhood policies. Action is needed based on a renewed policy of economic, financial and social cooperation, an intelligent immigration policy, and effective support for the economic reforms and the democratic transition process under way in Tunisia.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is only by taking such action that we will be able to tackle and solve the problems now facing Italy and Europe. Commissioner, I am sure you will agree with us all that it really is time now to stop talking and start acting.</p>

      <p sl="es">The voyage of hope could end up becoming a cursed voyage, and it will be on the consciences of all of us who witness these continuous uncontrolled influxes and do not say ‘enough is enough’ with sufficient authority. When it happens, we will throw up our hands in horror, but the following day we will forget about it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Europeans have a duty and a right to know the truth: that the Mediterranean strategy is not working, that the common immigration policy will continue to be a dream until European countries commit to equipping the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) with sufficient resources to be effective.</p>
      <p sl="es">Talking does not cost anything, but we need to act. Do you really believe that Frontex is currently able to guarantee the security of the European borders? I do not believe it is. Let us hope that the people of Egypt, Tunisia and other countries of the Maghreb do not decide en masse to seek a better future in Europe, but rather that they do so in their own countries, because that is what they have fought for, and we must help them.</p>

Developing a suitable Euro-Mediterranean strategy should also be a common goal, but in this case too, we have to admit that the Barcelona Process has, in fact, never taken off.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fact is, Commissioner, that these are uncomfortable subjects. Some Member States, such as Italy, Greece, Malta and so on, quite rightly have to deal with them and have a duty of solidarity, whereas most Member States stand on the sidelines as passive onlookers and confine themselves to just lecturing the others.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is a great deal to do, then, on the legislative front in terms of funds and strengthening of instruments – I am referring to Frontex – but what is needed most of all is political will.

However, I wonder, and I ask you all: what has happened to the money that Europe has been pouring into Tunisia all these years and which it is still pouring into Libya, which – as we know – are democratic regimes? Therefore, it is now wonderful and amazing to cheer this awakening of the Tunisian people, although I wonder how on earth all that money was ever granted.

      <p sl="it">I would like to pick up on what Mr Portas and Mr Tavares said. They pointed out, extraordinarily, that in countries like Tunisia, emigration is viewed as a crime.</p>
      <p sl="it">To begin with, regarding all the people who have landed on Lampedusa – and I would remind Mr Madlener that they are not Libyans but Tunisians, although that is hardly important because Libyans will soon be arriving as well – who will decide whether they are refugees or not, given that a situation of extreme confusion reigns in Tunisia at the moment? Above all, however, how will we feel if we repatriate these people, in the knowledge that they will be thrown into prison as soon as they arrive?</p>

It is not fair – as the coastal states have been saying for a long time – that this problem should only affect the countries that have a Mediterranean sea border with North African countries. That is a fundamental point, and it is also fundamental to remember that Frontex has very limited resources: I have heard that two experts have been sent.

Of course, for Lampedusa, these refugees are a problem, even though a daily ferry links the island to Sicily and there is also an airport through which these people can be taken away. We have to realise that what is being discussed at the moment is not the problem of Frontex or how to stop the boats, but the fact that we are dealing with peoples whom we have urged to fight for democracy and, now that they are doing so, we must be in a position to receive them. Granting more visas is one policy that Italy can pursue to try to help those countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the last huge influx of refugees, similar to what we are now seeing as a result of the Tunisian revolution, was probably in 1989 following the collapse of communism. The EU has learnt nothing from its past experience. It was taken completely by surprise by the stream of refugees. Now, with the arrival of all those people who do not want to roll up their sleeves and rebuild their own country, Italy is being called on not to send back the Tunisian economic migrants. However, that is exactly the problem. As long as these people are not returned to their home country immediately, without repatriation aid, we will constantly be overwhelmed by waves of economic migrants. Tens of thousands of them are already waiting in the neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mass amnesties and generous offers to overlook the fact that the majority of them are merely economic migrants have simply led, in the past, to a new influx of asylum seekers. If we introduce quotas for asylum procedures, instead of sending the migrants back immediately, we are just creating incentives for similar behaviour in the future.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer the Commissioner my heartfelt thanks for this debate, for what she has told us, for having honoured us with her presence, and for the commitments she has made, which show the extent to which mutual understanding between Europe and Italy can help my country deal with this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to take up something she said: ‘There is a wind blowing over the Mediterranean’. It is true, Mr President: it is a wind of freedom and democracy that is having immediate effects which Italy finds it is having to manage. When the wind blows harder, some people put up walls and others build windmills. Let me tell you, Commissioner, that the south of Italy, Puglia, where Mr Baldassarre, Mr Mauro and I come from, has been building windmills for decades; that is to say, it has been developing forms of reception and working hard to guarantee immigrants their dignity and to provide them with a fair and decent reception. We cannot do it all alone, however. It would be wonderful, Commissioner, if these windmills that we have been building for years could also see the mark of an attentive and effective Europe that joins us in building them.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it seems rather ironic that, just as the first signs of freedom and democracy have begun to emerge in Tunisia, a wave of refugees has been unleashed. It seems a little hard to believe that they would actually want to leave this country.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Major changes seem to be taking place throughout the Middle East and it may well be that this is just a precursor of things to come. Therefore, I think that it is a positive thing that the Commission is taking all possible steps to prepare itself. The Commission should now also prove that it can get the situation under control.</p>
      <p sl="nl">All community stops need to be pulled out, we will have to come to Tunisia’s aid, but it seems inevitable to me that, in these particular circumstances, just as we are seeing the first signs of freedom in Tunisia, many of these people will turn out not to be genuine refugees. For that reason, it is just as inevitable that the Commission should aim to send a large number of people back to Tunisia, precisely in order to set an example for the future, given that it is possible that more refugees from Middle Eastern countries will follow.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the exceptional flow of immigrants besetting the Italian coast and, hence, the whole of Europe, must spur us on to developing a common approach at last for managing this phenomenon. In this respect, the ongoing talks between the Italian authorities and the Commission are well on the way to providing a response to the humanitarian crisis that we have been discussing.</p>
      <p sl="it">With all due respect to Mr Crocetta, I have to point out that the problem is not so much the 5 000 people who have arrived so far but the potentially momentous scale of the upheavals and the many thousand more refugees who could arrive on our shores if we send out clear political messages. We need to address this with the utmost urgency. The crisis must be overcome, but then a structural response will be needed.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must enhance the role of Frontex to make it more operational and able to directly manage certain processes of identifying refugees, checking their country of origin and organising repatriations. We must enhance the role of Europol in order to prevent potential terrorists and criminals from slipping in. Above all, we must respond quickly. I think the Commission has reacted well, and I hope the Council, too, will do its part.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to ask you a question, Commissioner, as this afternoon there seems to be a somewhat hysterical atmosphere in the House. I would like to ask you if it is possible to find out whether the 5 000 people who have arrived in Lampedusa are really terrorists. Could we check? It would not be so difficult.</p>
      <p sl="es">It would not be so difficult as we have sufficient security services to find out whether this is true. Five thousand. We are talking about terrorists, but there are thousands arriving in small boats dressed in rags. I would like to ask you this: would it not be easier for you to make a humanitarian visit to Lampedusa and try to evaluate and see the resources in situ to which Mr Rinaldi is referring that have not been used in Italy? That would also be a good trip to make.</p>
      <p sl="es">It would also be good for you to go to Tunisia, as perhaps those who have arrived in Lampedusa have come from inland mining areas where Mr Ben Ali’s corruption has left the inhabitants in poverty. We could help them through regional development. Then perhaps you would see the change and the challenges being experienced in Tunisia, and you would be able to monitor the situation and be their champion in the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Madam President, we are witnessing a new humanitarian tragedy on the European Union’s doorstep. It may be Lampedusa today, but we can expect an even greater influx of immigrants from North African countries elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Even just from Egypt into Israel, there are some 600 immigrants said to be fleeing every month. The authorities are no longer able to control the situation.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We need a rapid and joint response. We must not respond by closing doors and by equating immigrants with criminals. It would be a disgrace if anyone actually thought along those lines in Europe, where the freedom of movement is a fundamental right and a symbol of freedom and equality.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We Member States have to bear joint responsibility and share the burden which has fallen on Italy today. We have to mobilise forces and financial resources because this is about human lives.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Our response to the recent events in Tunisia and Egypt has been patchy and slow. Let us demonstrate our credibility now and let us not succumb to the anti-immigrant rhetoric of extreme right and xenophobic parties.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, very well, democratic developments may be afoot in North Africa, but they are also bringing with them obligations for Europe. The problems of North Africa cannot be resolved in southern Europe. On this point, I stand shoulder to shoulder with my Italian fellow Members.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My question to the Commissioner is: is there any possibility of shortening the procedures, introducing fast-track examination of applications and sending anyone who is not a bona fide refugee back to Tunisia straightaway? Because we are now seeing large groups of young men setting off for southern Italy. There are probably many economic refugees amongst them and we need to separate the genuine refugees from the economic refugees.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, there is, of course, the public relations problem. Many Europeans are under the impression that a horde of Tunisians are heading for southern Italy. That is a public relations problem: not just for Italy, but for the European Union, too. Hence, the key things are: faster procedures and better public relations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mrs Malmström, we were all pleased, as were the citizens of Europe, about the revolution in Egypt and Tunisia and the fact that values such as freedom and democracy were suddenly on the agenda. Images from these countries have dominated the news over the last few days. However, for two or three days, we have also been seeing pictures of the streams of refugees and people in boats on our television screens and in our newspapers. We must act quickly to ensure that we do not miss this historic moment and that it is not only the pictures of refugees which remain in our memories. We must remember what these countries have really achieved.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must explain to the public that although a lot of people are coming here, the majority of them will go back, because they have no right to asylum as we define it. Of course, we have to ask ourselves the question which is frequently posed about economic migrants. One thing is clear. If these young people have no future prospects, they will come back. Perhaps not the same people, but constant streams of new migrants. This is why we need to deal with this problem now.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the Mediterranean is going up in flames. Obviously, immigration will increase. As civilised people, we need to treat all these people like human beings. However, we must not overlook the fact that most immigrants come from Muslim countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">According to the official report, Muslim populations are set to rise by 35%, from 1.6 billion to 2.2 billion, over the next twenty years. Europe today has just 2.7% of the Muslim population. With these influxes and this birth rate, this is expected to rise to 6% in twenty years. So, as you can see, an economic and social reversal in the functioning of Europe, in European culture, is on its way.</p>

If the outcome is the same – the establishment of democratic regimes – then I think we should be very pleased. The downside, of course, is that in the short term at least, we have a refugee and asylum problem, particularly in Italy.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Italy is in the European Union it is a problem for Italy, it is a problem for Europe; the solution has to be Italian, the solution has to be European. We cannot close the door to refugees, but, at the same time, the door cannot be opened to all the refugees and asylum seekers in the world. So the solution really is, I think, in the multi-point plan suggested by my colleague, Mr Busuttil, particularly to ensure that repatriation takes place when it is proper and safe to do so and, of course, also to send back asylum seekers who are not deserving of that status within the European Union. We have to act in solidarity with Italy and we can do so.</p>

Today, we have an issue with Italy and with refugees from Tunisia, but tomorrow it may be from Algeria, Egypt or possibly Libya, from whence thousands have already come to us in the past. The fact that we do not have the Council here is a problem, of course. The Council is not interested in this issue. I am disappointed that the Council is not sitting here today, listening to Parliament’s debate with us. In my opinion, we must work with the Commission to find a solution that will be, on the one hand, legally proper, while, on the other, as my colleague, Mr Kelly, said, we cannot simply accept all refugees coming to Europe from North Africa. This is surely not our objective, and those who do not deserve political asylum must be returned to their country of origin.</p>

      <p sl="el">This problem is not a problem of our partner countries in the South; it is a European problem. We need solidarity.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, if Mr Busuttil had listened to what I said in my introduction, he would have heard that I said almost everything that was in his speech, but I am happy to repeat it. We are ready to use the funds that we have at our disposal to assist the Italian authorities immediately. We are in dialogue with them to identify what kind of help they need. Italy has a lot of experience in dealing with different kinds of disasters but they perhaps need help with humanitarian aid for shelter, food and medicines, and they might also need help with screening, assistance and identification. We will put that help at their disposal and we are talking to them about this at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a European responsibility and that is why we have to come up with European solutions. We have Frontex staff in place, but we are also examining the possibility – and we are ready – of setting up a Frontex operation within a very short time, but, of course, we need to discuss the modalities with Italy and also with the other countries that might possibly contribute. I am happy that Mr Busuttil is the rapporteur for Frontex so that in the future, we will have an even better functioning Frontex with amendments.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we had a Frontex operation in Tunisian waters, we would, of course, need to do this in cooperation with the Tunisian authorities. We are not there yet. We are also encouraging the Tunisian authorities to take back their nationals who are not in need of international protection. We are looking at the law in this respect, as raised by Mr Tavares and others. We hope that the new democratic government will not have such a law, but, of course, it has to be examined on a case by case basis and looked at carefully. We are also willing to support the Tunisian authorities with advice, support for border and police management, and also with training, equipment and funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">EASO is still not operational in Malta, but there is a board functioning and they have said that they can send national teams to Italy to help should they wish. We will also discuss it this next week at the Foreign Affairs Council and at the JHA Council that will meet next week. We are working with UNHCR in order to ask them to help in the identification of those in need of international protection and to help us to make analysis for the future. Frontex is also involved in doing analysis for the whole region.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Tunisia, there is, of course, as most of you have said, a very hopeful situation and we all support the democratic development there. Lady Ashton was there yesterday for discussions with the authorities. We are ready to offer election support to them in carrying out elections. We are discussing different ways to strengthen other kinds of support and to develop and strengthen their democratic development. Economic assistance can be provided. We are discussing different mobility programmes and we also need to increase the possibilities for people to come legally to Europe. There is also discussion about a donor conference.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with Mr Mauro and others who said that of course, we need to look at the whole region. I think many were quite surprised when the Berlin Wall fell. We did not have an action plan immediately up our sleeve. This situation is a little different but, of course, people asking for freedom and democracy is something that we in the European Union should support. We are reviewing the neighbourhood policy plan because events have made it necessary and we are looking at the whole region – in particular Egypt, but also the other countries – in order to maximise the different tools, funds and policies that we have at our disposal and to tailor them much more adequately to the recent developments in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sure we will come back to this debate because the issue is on the agenda and is likely to stay there, but I want to assure you once again that the Commission is following this very closely. We are ready to assist Italy, Tunisia and other countries affected by this.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Italian Government’s appeal to the European Union is one of the prerogatives of membership. As many fellow Members have pointed out, the principles of solidarity and the fair sharing of responsibilities, as laid down in the Treaties, must be applied in practice. The difficult situation that Italy is currently facing comes within Europe’s jurisdiction, as Mrs Malmström suggested. The European institutions’ slowness to react is not in step with the extremely rapid course of events in the countries of North Africa.</p>
      <p sl="it">Italy, and particularly the south of the country, is the first border point of Europe in the Mediterranean and it finds itself dealing with numbers of arrivals that can be imagined but not planned for. What we are experiencing shows how serious it is that we have abandoned the Barcelona Process. The European Union needs to rethink its strategy for the Mediterranean and to make that one of its main priorities again. The short-term response of financial aid and extraordinary intervention measures will help, but it will not be enough. The democratic transition processes spreading through the countries on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean need to be matched with medium- and long-term initiatives to deal with social and economic issues.</p>

      <p sl="it">The debate we are dealing with today is particularly important. In fact, over 4 000 refugees from nearby Tunisia have been recorded landing on the island of Lampedusa in the last four days alone. Thus, a public health crisis is developing on a scale never before recorded. It should also be borne in mind that the local council is tackling this crisis without the appropriate resources and facilities that the situation requires.</p>
      <p sl="it">Italy immediately turned to the European Union to request prompt action. However, while I vehemently support this request for help, I would stress that the commitment by Frontex – the European agency charged with tackling landings in the Mediterranean – is valuable but insufficient to deal with the landings of Tunisian illegal immigrants. During the February mini-session, I expressed my concerns about the deteriorating situations in the countries of North Africa and their resulting repercussions in Europe. I will emphasise it again here in this Chamber that the European Union needs to make a greater commitment to an effective common immigration policy that will enable the EU to manage illegal immigration and, above all, to come to the aid of those countries, such as Italy, that are more directly exposed to the flow of immigrants.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The sudden arrival of thousands of migrants on the small Italian island of Lampedusa is an exceptional event. However, this event brings us face to face with a problem which concerns all Europeans. Right now, it is important that European solidarity should function properly. I agree with you, Commissioner, in your appeal to the Member States to deliver urgent aid to Italy, both in terms of goods and in terms of finance. Very often, in these situations, the countries in which migrants arrive are not their final destinations. Reception centres are frequently outdated, and serious tensions sometimes arise in areas where migrants are received. We have already passed some significant milestones in the fight against illegal immigration and in regulating flows. However, in a Union where internal borders have practically disappeared, Europe must equip itself in the long term with the means to achieve its ambitions. It must create a genuine immigration policy, open a constructive dialogue with countries of origin and strengthen the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) in its missions.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on ‘Towards adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems’ (2010/2239(INI)) (A7-0025/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-508-000" speaker_id="1122" name="Ria Oomen-Ruijten" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, allow me to start this debate by thanking my colleagues for their extremely pleasant and fruitful cooperation. I would also like to extend those thanks to the advisors of the parliamentary secretariats and, of course, our own staff.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It was not easy to manage such a large number of amendments. I still think that we have been successful, however, because we have now come up with something concrete in response to the Green Paper. A secure, sustainable and adequate pension, which is the guarantee that European citizens want. It is not as simple as that, however, as pensions are, and will remain, the responsibility of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, that does not mean that we are not allowed to express our opinions or table any proposals through the open coordination method, which may entail revision.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The sustainability of pension systems is under threat, with an inverted population pyramid being the trend: we now have more older people, senior citizens are living longer and therefore, fewer people are left to finance the pensions. The pay-as-you-go systems of the first pillar are the perfect expression of the solidarity between the generations, and they will continue to remain the most important in the future, too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, on top of the burden on the younger generation, there is undeniably also a pressure on collective budgets and that, in turn, is having repercussions on the Stability Pact, whether we like it or not.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Member States are raising their retirement ages. I am rejecting the proposals for European indexation of pensions to increased life expectancy. I am doing that because of significant variations in life expectancy between Member States and because, even if we could index the two, this would not be socially responsible, in my opinion.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What we have found, though, is that we must all move towards a higher retirement age, and that process must take place at Member State level, in conjunction with our social partners.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is also another side to this coin – and I see, Elisabeth, that I have your attention – and that is that we must ensure that older people remain in work. That, therefore, means that we should focus more efforts on flexible career schemes and flexible retirement schemes and that we must improve and adapt conditions, if older people are to be able to continue working.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Member States that have based their pension systems on the second pillar have been saving, often through joint employer-employee schemes, and, in some cases, in the new Member States, through mixed schemes. The funds have been put into savings funds, pension funds or they appear on companies’ balance sheets. The saving and accrual systems are under less pressure than public finances, but there too, increased life expectancy is posing a problem.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On top of that has come the financial crisis, poor results on bond and equity markets and the low interest rates that are putting guarantees on expected pensions under pressure.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The answer which is being prepared by the Commission is as follows: the application of more stringent solvency requirements is – and I will say it here once again – not the right answer. Good supervision: yes! What we need first, though, before adopting any laws, is an in-depth impact assessment of the effects of solvency.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this connection, I also wish to point to the debate on derivatives. You cannot link derivatives and pension funds, just like that. In a pension fund, derivatives are used to hedge risks. Hence, not for speculation. So even there, Commission, you must look before you leap.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Turning now to the third pillar. It seems to me that we should not harbour unrealistic expectations. You can only use individual saving opportunities if you also have the money. However, what we do want to do is create greater awareness, and you get greater awareness when people are informed about their pensions, so we also need a tracking system.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the European internal market is absent from the third pillar, so we have to do something about that, too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I would like to make two concluding comments. On adequacy: we cannot achieve that at European level, Member States must do that. On transferability: in my opinion, an open labour market can only function with more free commuter traffic which does not put employees who exercise that right at a disadvantage. Though there, too, we need transferability: yes, but with an adaptation period, so we need new contracts and then an impact study.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Green Paper on pensions which we published last summer started a much needed debate on the future of pensions in Europe. It resulted in more than 100 meetings and conferences with stakeholders and we received almost 1 700 responses.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Green Paper outlines the key challenges facing the Union in this area, and asked fourteen questions about how work at EU level could help the Member States in ensuring that pensions are adequate, sustainable and safe, while fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity. The Green Paper takes a holistic approach, because my fellow Commissioners, Rehn and Barnier, and I are convinced that adequate, sustainable and safe pensions call for coordinated, joined-up policies spanning our three areas of responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me briefly restate the Commission’s reasoning for publishing the Green Paper last year. First, we need to overcome the imbalances resulting from the increasing divergence between life expectancy and retirement ages. Second, we need to adjust the European framework to reflect the changes that have come about in national pension systems after a decade of pension reforms. Third, we must draw lessons from the financial and economic crisis. The crisis has highlighted the need to review financial market exposure and the design of our pension systems in order to improve risk mitigation and enhance the funded pension’s capacity for shock absorption. Fourth, we need to fully prepare our pension systems for the acceleration of population ageing.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Member States have already engaged in long-standing cooperation to learn from each other’s experiences and exchange good practice in pension reform. There is a consensus on the need for coordination at EU level and for establishing EU rules on cross-border issues. For the last 10 years, coordination at EU level has underpinned Member States’ efforts to modernise the pension systems, and many Member States have already made good progress in adapting the pension systems to reflect demographic ageing, changes in the labour markets and evolving gender roles. However, most Member States have a long way to go and a few others have not even begun with pension reforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was pleased to read the report, on which I congratulate the rapporteur, which is highly supportive of the holistic approach we have chosen. In several places, it highlights the links between adequacy, sustainability and safety. It also clearly identifies policy areas where the EU can add value. The Commission is currently in the final stages of analysing the results of the consultation, including the final opinion of the European Parliament. Given the urgency of the situation, the Commission has already started the preparations for the White Paper to be presented in the third quarter of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by saying that one of the great successes of Europe’s social model is to ensure that old age is not synonymous with poverty. This is a promise on which we have to continue to deliver and help Member States to take the right decisions to ensure that pension systems are fit for purpose. The last 12 months have seen a lively debate in the field of pension reforms and this year promises to be equally intense. I very much count on Parliament’s support to bring about a real change to create both adequate and sustainable pensions for the future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the fact that we are discussing pensions today in the European Parliament plenary will confirm how important they are to Europe. An ageing population, the impact of the economic and financial crisis and the late entry of young people into the labour market require common solutions. However, pensions remain a national responsibility and the purpose of the subsidiarity principle is to establish the limits of European intervention. Nevertheless, if Member States implement existing EU-level legislation better, we will benefit from a single market which operates more efficiently, thereby encouraging greater worker mobility.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, so that public pension systems are sustainable, we must ensure that people have the opportunity to continue working up until retirement age. The rise in unemployment among Member States is a matter for concern, jeopardising the principle of intergenerational solidarity. Indeed, steps to reform the pension system must go hand in hand with promoting employment policies. Similarly, pension reform must not be synonymous with depriving groups which are already vulnerable of a safe, decent income. States must not shirk their obligation to provide adequate pensions for all citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To avoid such exploitation at national level, we have put forward the idea of defining an adequate pension at European Union level. It is my view that it is not enough to ask Member States to guarantee a level of pensions from the first pillar above the poverty threshold. I certainly understand the argument about the diversity of national conditions and the reluctance of states to allow the European Union to be involved in a matter at the very core of national sovereignty. However, I think that EU bodies must show greater concern for European citizens’ living conditions. Social discontent can trigger unexpected effects. Two recent examples, outside the European Union, illustrate the level of tolerance of a population which has constantly been forced to make sacrifices in the interests of national governments which pay too little attention to their citizens’ needs.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, first of all, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to my fellow Member, Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, for the good cooperation on her part. I am grateful to her for reproducing much of the opinion, if not, in fact, the entire opinion that I wrote for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO).</p>
      <p sl="nl">In particular, I am pleased with the recommendation that a European system be developed which will make it possible for everybody to know how much pension they have built up, regardless of which Member State(s) it was accrued in.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Nevertheless, I do still have some questions, especially about the discrepancy between Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s statement just now and the recommendation that pension policy come under the aegis of European economic governance. We do not know exactly what kind of form that will take, but there is a real chance that it will not be optional. I do not want to give the impression, by voting in favour, that I, for example, will be contributing to the transfer of national powers on this issue to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, I am concerned about the recommendation, which is, indeed, in there, that the retirement age should be raised in the light of life expectancy. I believe that that is definitely not necessary for the Netherlands, and that is why I cannot endorse the recommendation. I would like the rapporteur to comment on this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.</p>
      <p sl="it">The lack of any significant attention to gender issues in the Commission Green Paper on the future of pension systems in Europe gives cause for concern: women are discriminated against in pension calculations because they interrupt their careers more often in order to look after their children, sick relatives and the elderly. To fulfil their family commitments, women are therefore more liable than men to have to accept precarious or part-time work, resulting in an average gender pay gap of 18% in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">That leads to evident discrimination against women, who receive pensions that are clearly lower than men’s. This increases the risk of poverty for older women, especially when the fact that they tend to live longer than men is taken into account. The time women devote to caring for their children or other dependent family members needs to be recognised in the calculation systems as being equivalent to all other kinds of contract when pensions are calculated. The Green Paper offered a consultation …</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, I hope the new White Paper will devote greater attention to the sensitive and worrying issue of the gender gap in the calculation of pension rights in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, first of all, the large number of motions for amendment – there have been nearly 500 of them – is a good indication of the tremendous interest surrounding this topic, and the rapporteur, Ria Oomen-Ruijten deserves nothing but our thanks for turning this immense haystack of motions for amendment into a report which reflects the current opinion of Parliament. I am saying its current opinion, since we are standing at the beginning of the debate, and this is about the Green Paper, which will be followed by a White Paper, and then by additional reports, meaning that we are obviously in a stage of a larger process.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In general, I must say that I agree with the Commission’s approach, which welcomes diversification, that is, pension systems resting on multiple pillars, but, at the same time, I would like to point out that the wording could be a little more precise here. Obviously, when we are speaking of second pillars, we mean second pillars that supplement the first pillars in the light of their weaknesses. This is not the same as a second pillar where something is taken away from the first for the sole reason of operating a system in different ways. The former restores stability, while the latter endangers it.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, we must also realise – and this has perhaps been said already, but I would just like to reinforce it – that the problems of the pension system cannot necessarily be solved by themselves, from the inside; what is more, it is likely that they cannot. More jobs are needed, stronger economic cooperation is needed, and our goal should definitely be that once the Commission has prepared the White Paper, this common thought process should somehow be linked to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and economic governance. It is obvious that, if this will be the case, we will be able to continue this debate more fruitfully.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would first of all like to emphasise the important consensus work that the rapporteur has carried out. Congratulations, Ria! During the negotiation of the compromises, she has showed open-mindedness about the arguments put forward by my group, which led to a large majority vote in favour of the draft report in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. If we see this large a majority in favour tomorrow, it would send a strong signal to the other institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report on the future of pensions in Europe is, up to now, the only European institutional document which goes against the tide of the Commission’s thinking – as represented in particular by its Annual Growth Survey – and the thinking of the Merkel-Sarkozy duo in their document on the competitiveness pact. These documents call very directly for the first pillar to be reconsidered, and also call for an automatic increase in the legal retirement age based on life expectancy. Parliament, in its amended and adopted draft report, is in favour of the following: a fundamental role for the first pillar in relation to pensions, which provides a better guarantee of solidarity, with a complementary role for the other pillars, including bringing a second pillar into general use; giving more attention to increasing the actual age of retirement as well as employment levels, in particular, those of older people, rather than an automatic and fatalistic increase in the legal age; a definition of the criteria for enabling a guaranteed minimal adequate pension to be introduced in the Member States; a strengthened role for social partners in defining and implementing all pension reforms in Europe; and the abolition of disparities between men and women in relation to pensions, which is linked to the discrimination of which Mrs Matera reminded us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With these components, with these advances, as well as others that I could have mentioned, I am satisfied that Parliament can send our Commissioner a clear message, a social and progressive message, and I hope that she will take this into account for the next stage of the White Paper.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, first of all, I want to thank the rapporteur for her good work; she certainly made my life easier. I also want to thank the Commission for starting this discussion, which is certainly very timely.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some people speak of the pensions time bomb and, given some of the figures that I have seen estimating the gap between what we currently put aside for both public and private pension provision and the resources we will need to ensure adequate pension provision for the next forty years, that gap is huge. So, in that context, the phrase ‘pensions time bomb’ is certainly accurate. Well, we all know what we need to do with a time bomb: we need to defuse it. I think this is the start of that process.</p>
      <p sl="de">But the core question is: who is responsible? I think in the report, we are clear that Member States are themselves responsible for making sure that there is adequate pension provision for their citizens. But, we also state that the economies of Member States are interdependent and therefore, a coordination of pension policies using the OMC is certainly useful. However, we do not believe it is possible for the EU to set adequate pension levels or, indeed, to harmonise retirement ages.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nonetheless, we do consider that Member States should define adequacy as the condition required for older people to live a decent life. I am pleased we have highlighted the gender issue and asked Member States to deal with the issue of men and women who take time off to care and that we have paid attention to the issue of mobility and the role of the EU 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I support the inclusion of pension liabilities within the SGP. We know that a fiscal black hole is opening up in the area of pension provision and we just cannot ignore it.</p>

      <p sl="en">We are all aware there are national differences, as well as differences within our own political groups, and to come up with anything that gains a significant level of support is quite something. My group is especially pleased that the report before us recognises the importance of first-pillar pensions, the commitment to an adequate level, the issue of being able to provide a decent life. After all, we spent all of last year, 2010, dealing with questions of poverty. And, of course, this is also, for many people, a fixed income, an essential guarantee. Like others, we also welcome the recognition that we need to tackle decent pension provision here for women.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also recognise the importance of tackling discrimination against older workers and using other measures to help people stay in work. For us, too, the portability of pension rights is a crucial issue. More and more people are not working for one company throughout their working life. Indeed, they are working for several, and not always in the same country. And we need to avoid this fragmentation of pension provision, so there is an essential role for the European Union there.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also pleased to see that this report contains a commitment for second-pillar provision, that it should be available without discrimination on grounds of age, gender and work contract. We would agree as well – and are pleased to see it there – that we need to be adopting more of a life course approach that deals with the different rhythms and patterns of modern working lives, both positive and negative.</p>
      <p sl="en">And again we recognise the importance of solidarity in that first pillar, not least for those whose working lives are involved with more casual labour, short-term contracts and so on. We are concerned at any effort to push third-pillar private pension provision and we agree that it is crucial that people have adequate and clear information.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would also welcome the fact that this report contains – if there is going to be a change in pension provision – adequate time for adaptation for people to reconsider their financial futures.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report recognises the importance of Member States sharing best practice and exchanging information, but also emphasises that pensions remain a Member State competence. It acknowledges that the EU should not legislate on the adequacy of pension levels and retirement ages, but asks – and asks very clearly and very strongly – that Member States regulate in accordance with their own circumstances, taking account of those issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do believe that further work on portability is essential to strengthen the single market. EU citizens working around Europe – and I have met many – should not be left disadvantaged by having their pension pots frozen in different Member States.

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, in this debate, we cannot forget that there is a proposal for a so-called competitiveness pact by means of which the directorate, led by Germany, wishes to launch new attacks on the universal and mutual public social security system, to increase pension age and devalue salaries, attempting to put an end to their indexation to inflation, merely to benefit the financial sector, which is trying to find in these pensions new types of greater speculative gains.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We would like to state our clear opposition to this path towards European integration, built upon a foundation of antisocial policies which, lamentably, this report endorses, by supporting the European Commission Green Paper, by allowing a link to be made between the legal retirement age and life expectancy, by encouraging people to stay in the job market longer, and by not excluding support for private pension systems even when it is already known that their speculative use by funds and private banks can have severe consequences which leave the elderly, and particularly elderly women, in poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have therefore tabled an alternative resolution, which demonstrates that it is possible to improve benefits and pensions without increasing the legal age for retirement, provided that there is more employment with rights, particularly for young people, better salaries, and greater supervision of the financial sector and financial transactions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are against the increase in retirement age and we defend the pensions system integrated in the universal and mutual public social security system, which increases the value of smaller benefits and pensions, respects elderly people and allows them to live with dignity, thereby contributing to the eradication of poverty.

In paragraph 9, the resolution stresses Member States’ competence but calls on them to coordinate their different pension policies. There is double speak here, with EU control overturning principle.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UK National Association of Pension Funds says that this report will make pensions more expensive – by 90% according to actuarial consultants Punter Southall.

Your solution is to push the retirement age up to 67 and to carry out profound reforms of pay-as-you-go pension systems to reduce benefits for insured people. Furthermore, the report is not wrong there, since it calls for a guaranteed minimum level for pensions, which you are forcing us to guarantee to foreigners arriving on our shores who have never contributed.</p>

This is a result of the 463 amendments from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the 211 amendments from the associated Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would have liked to have seen a commitment to continuing the successful occupational pension systems in Germany, Luxembourg, Finland and Austria. Unfortunately, there was a majority decision to recommend new minimum standards and the application of Solvency II to occupational pensions. This will bring the risk of significantly higher costs, which, in Germany alone, could amount to an increase of 40% on the voluntary occupational pension. We must not destroy what has been achieved on the basis of a consensus between unions and management. I was able to contribute to the compromises by proposing that in future, all the effects of the minimum standards and of Solvency II must be evaluated in detail in an in-depth impact assessment. That represents progress towards the continuation of occupational pensions, although it is by no means a guarantee.</p>
      <p sl="de">One positive point is that we do not have a standardised definition of adequate pension levels. In addition, the proposal of a harmonised retirement age for the EU has been rejected. Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy are rightly in favour of the gradual convergence of the pension systems and the retirement age. As birth rates and life expectancy vary in different countries, each national pension system must be adapted to meet demographic changes.</p>
      <p sl="de">The compromises were achieved under serious time pressure. I hope that we will all be able to hold a more detailed debate on the White Paper, which will include the practical experience of businesses.

However, in the meantime, the world is moving and the question of pensions is being mentioned in addition. I obviously want to mention here the reference to a standardised retirement system, at European level, at 67 years of age, which has been created in what was a draft competitiveness pact. We can clearly see that if we start from there in constructing a social Europe, well, we will be constructing it against the people, and that is not what we want.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We also mention the idea that the best means of deciding the question of retirement is to encourage employment and that rather than fixating on the legal retirement age, we must take account of real age.

      <p sl="nl">If we recognise the importance of the first pillar, which makes sense, then we must also admit, at the same time, that the health of our public finances is equally important, since it is sound public finances that underpin the first pillar. Next, you have to recognise the long-term strain that pensions are putting on the government and make that very clear. I think that the Commission and the European Union have a responsibility to make that clear to each Member State, so that everyone can see where the risks and the difficulties lie.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second point is that the European Union plays a particular role in the second pillar, as well. There, you have pointed to the importance of Solvency II. What we are asking for here is that the Commission examine the risks in the longer term and that it makes clear in its rules how those risks should be hedged. I think that there, you have to specifically consider the long-term risk of pension systems in general: not just of one type, but of all pensions systems under the second pillar. So, there is a job that needs doing.</p>

We are being forced to ask questions on an increasingly frequent basis regarding the stability and security of current pension systems, and regarding the extent to which they guarantee fair incomes during retirement. We are coming to the conclusion that reforms of Europe’s pension systems, which fall under the competences of the Member States, are essential. This will be a very long-winded and expensive process, and in order for governments to decide to take such a step, the Council and the European Commission need to guarantee that the costs of these reforms will always be taken into account when applying the excessive deficit procedure. Any other solution may result in a situation where countries abandon reforms for fear of the financial burden.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I should like to refer to two key aspects of these essential reforms. Firstly, in order to guarantee the security of pension systems, we must diversify income sources and create systems based, inter alia, on public funding from capital markets and employee pension schemes. Secondly, we should ensure higher rates of employment in order to guarantee the stability of pension systems. The Member States should endeavour to ensure that the actual age of retirement is the same as the statutory age, and, wherever necessary, consider extending the statutory age of retirement, as a natural consequence of the fact that Europeans are living longer and longer. Extended working lives should, however, be associated with corresponding labour market reforms, including the provision of appropriate training and healthcare for employees.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, it has already been said that the backbone of pension systems in Europe is, and must continue to be, the public system, because it is the only system that guarantees cohesion and, moreover, reduces the risk of poverty in our society.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is nevertheless striking that, in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the greatest levels of equality in terms of income are found in pensions, or that, due to the crisis, private pensions lost 20% of their value in 2008 alone and are currently still far from meeting the required levels of solvency.</p>
      <p sl="es">All of this shows that, at a time of unavoidable reforms, measures to ensure the sustainability of our pension systems must be cross-cutting, taking into account, among other factors, ambitious policies concerning birth rates and balancing work and family life, along with ambitious policies for ensuring that people can enter and remain in employment, or even immigration policies based on integration, which also guarantee the sustainability of our pensions from a demographic point of view.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I find it regrettable that the text does not place limits on the abuse of the concept of grants in businesses, because, as a general rule, they are exempt from any social contributions. In my view, this is essential for a whole new generation of workers, as if more is being required of them in order to have a decent pension, they should also not have to suffer so much in order to access decent employment.</p>

      <p sl="en">This makes it very clear that pensions are, first and foremost, the responsibility of Member States. Thankfully, we have rejected any call for a minimum pension at EU level, as well as for a Solvency II-type regulation to be applied to pensions. The Lisbon Treaty makes it very clear that it is Member States, not the EU, who are responsible for pension provision. But what we can do is share best practice and experience. I am pleased that my amendment calling for the implementation of the Employment Directive 2000 to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of age is also included.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the retirement age, I have always made it clear that we must keep a pensionable age – an age when you are entitled to claim your pension – set at Member State level but, at the same time, scrap the compulsory retirement age, which forces people to stop working even if they want to carry on. I am sorry that this was not in the report.</p>

      <p sl="cs">it is essential to raise the retirement age;</p>

      <p sl="cs">it is not appropriate to coordinate pension systems and their reform at EU level;</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, subsidiarity, a matter for individual Member States, and solidarity, those were the two things that the rapporteur kept emphasising about pension policy. I therefore thought that she would immediately relegate the pro-spending cuts Green Paper to the wastepaper basket. I nearly fell off my chair when the rapporteur actually referred to the Green Paper as a positive thing.</p>
      <p sl="nl">While, on the one hand, the rapporteur keeps going on about subsidiarity, on the other, she has made countless proposals for increasing the EU’s influence. The EU should provide the criteria for the minimum pension. The EU should persuade Member States to raise the retirement age. The EU should encourage competition between European pension funds and further privatisation. Subsidiarity? What subsidiarity?</p>
      <p sl="nl">If all of this were going to lead to more socially responsible pension systems, then, perhaps, you could justify the EU’s influence here. Unfortunately, the Commission and the rapporteur are giving primacy to the internal market and they will only increase the divide between the rich and the poor.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, for the extraordinary work she has carried out in this report. The report recognises that in a time in which European Union citizens are particularly vulnerable, it is essential that the Member States ensure that social protection measures, and pensions in particular, are higher and more reliable, thus guaranteeing peace of mind to an ever ageing population, and ensuring that they remain economically independent.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Here, I would like to underline how important it is that the Member States define the necessary criteria in order to safeguard a decent standard of living for senior citizens. This has to be determined by the specific circumstances pertaining to each country and therefore, the principle of subsidiarity has to be respected.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I welcome, however, the invitation to the Commission to introduce guidelines and to encourage the exchange of best practice. In this way, the decisions taken will be in the interest of those who are going to be directly affected. In many Member States, pension reform is vital if we are to fulfil the objectives mentioned in the Green Paper; that is, having sound, adequate and sustainable pension systems.</p>
      <p sl="mt">The reform can be a difficult one to implement, especially in these difficult times, and therefore, the reform expenditure also needs to be taken into consideration within the context of economic governance.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, along with several Members who spoke before me, I believe it is important that there should be as much European level coordination on the pensions issue as possible. One reason for this is that the crisis has raised the question of macro-economic stability, and it has also raised the question of how we can ensure security and dignity in old age. It is apparent that different kinds of change are taking place in the Member States. Some countries are embarking on the path of reform, and are reinforcing or creating the pillar of private pension funds, while others are attempting to turn back time instead. Whatever the nature of the change may be, however, it is very important to make the sustainability of pensions, stability, and a dignified old age the top priorities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">All changes must be consulted upon with the social partners, and sufficient time must be provided for transitions. The people, the citizens, must be informed about what changes will be implemented and how these will affect them, in order to enable them to make informed decisions in all cases, and all changes must be made in a citizen-friendly manner.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, when Bismarck introduced a state pension in 1889, the average life expectancy was just 45. Today we live longer, but face the challenge of how to achieve reasonable incomes in retirement. Economic, demographic and labour market traditions vary. Individual countries should be responsible for their own policies and reforms. Sustainable state pensions need sustainable public finances, but this Parliament’s report is clear: there cannot be a harmonised EU retirement age or minimum income level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Company schemes and individual savings should be portable from one employer to another, and across countries. Savers deserve transparent information, which is easy to understand and available. Yes, we need safe saving schemes, but rules on capital must be intelligent. Risks for pensions are not the same as insurance companies or banks. The cost of regulation falls on the consumer and, in this case, the old-age pensioner.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In the work that is being done, I would first like to welcome the step forward that is the consultation work that the Commissioner told us that she presided over in the development of this Green Paper, but also the work, based on consultation, open-mindedness and compromise, that was carried out by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten in order to draft this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to emphasise three points that we absolutely must take into account in order to resolve the problem of the solvency of pensions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first point is the inequality faced by women of retirement age, because inequality in employment leads to poverty at retirement age.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point, Commissioner, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, is that I want to make sure that widows’ pensions are saved. We still have a generation of poor women who have not worked during their potential working life and for whom widows’ pensions are the only way of getting a minimum pension.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third point is the entry of the younger generations on to the labour market. They not only have to face the crisis, but they also have to carry the burden of several generations: their children, their parents and their grandparents.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, pensions throughout Europe must provide enough money for people to live on. One important requirement is that people have decent jobs, because low paid jobs result in poverty in old age and inadequate pension provision. When I hear other Members of this House saying that people simply need to take out an additional private pension for their old age, I want to reply that many people can barely survive on what they earn, never mind paying for an additional private pension. This is why the first pillar of the pension system is of particular importance. The pay-as-you-go system based on the solidarity principle must form the foundation of European pensions and it must provide enough for people to live on. We cannot simply say that this is a matter for the Member States. We must send out a clear signal that we need pensions which give people enough money to have a reasonable quality of life.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Mann gave a detailed description of the German occupational pension system. I would like to mention it too, without going into the same level of detail. In my assessment of the Green Paper, I have come to the same conclusion, which is why we worked on the amendments together in committee. Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to ensure that, in everything which we do in future, the distinctive features of each country – the things that really work well and are essential for the survival of the pension systems in the Member States – are not disregarded.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The ageing population trend and increasing labour mobility only serve to exacerbate the imbalances in these pension systems, while the measures being proposed, whether raising the retirement age or increasing contributions, are limited and will be increasingly restricted as well by social resistance to measures of this kind. Ultimately, we will have to acknowledge that the solution is to switch to those pension systems where people build up their own pension fund over the course of their working life.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the European Union has addressed a great many issues related to people with disabilities. Unfortunately, it is this very social group that Member States’ pension systems do not really seem to cover, which is unacceptable. In addition to people who were forced to enter the disability pension system through no fault of their own, there are a great many who entered the system by abusing loopholes. This problem primarily affects the pension systems of Central and Eastern Europe, where there is a very large number of such abusers. Their numbers are so high that they are shaking the foundations of the pension system itself. This situation goes against the EU 2020 strategy. These people are receiving non-personalised services instead of real assistance, while they could hold their own in the labour market and would be capable of working. Current forecasts indicate that the number of dependants in Europe will soon double. Meanwhile, the number of working age people is dropping by one million per year. In summary, this means that there is currently no sustainable pension system, especially not without active people with disabilities. I wholly support the idea of the rapporteur that in the EU, which is home to 50 million people with disabilities, only forty-odd percent of these people are working. Where is the other sixty-odd percent? The bottom line is that they, too, should be working.</p>

      <p sl="el">However, systems must be based on the first pillar, the public, redistributive pillar, as the only basic guarantee of adequate benefits. This pillar should be supplemented, not supported by the second pillar, which should function in tandem, once care has been taken to safeguard not only universal access to it, but also its security, by establishing the relevant governance framework.</p>
      <p sl="el">In addition, linking a later retirement age to life expectancy does not, by any means, result in automatic adjustments. Of course, other parameters have to be factored in, such as location, nature of work, very unhealthy occupations, quality of life and health. Finally, any incentives to remain in work should, as a precondition, include safety valves to overcome any barriers which might prevent young people from accessing the labour market, especially at a time when unemployment has, unfortunately, soared to invisible heights.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the debates being held in certain EU Member States regarding pension systems, and the public emotions accompanying these debates, show how important and, at the same time, how difficult this subject is. It will not be possible to adopt a single pensions model which would apply in all EU Member States. However, at a time of economic crisis and demographic change, reforms of national pension systems are becoming unavoidable. It is already the case today that many countries are experiencing problems due to the growing cost of pensions, and such problems may undermine the principle of intergenerational solidarity. However, we must remember that pensions must be secure and safe, and that they must take into account what we are paid. In this context, I would like greater attention to be paid to the pay difference between women and men, since women’s lower earnings result in reduced pension benefits.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the pensions system is a basic element of the European social model that must be preserved. It is the responsibility of the Member States, but in order to guarantee its survival, we need to take measures, with the highest possible level of agreement with social partners and civil society. These measures need to be focused on setting a European standard that guarantees the solvency of all systems by making them subject to supervision criteria in order to limit the deficit in public finances across the Member States, and by extending the guarantees that are going to be demanded of insurance companies from 2013 to the mutual societies that manage these systems in some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">This standard needs to be set in order to rationalise the debate, because solving this problem means more than setting the retirement age in law. We need to take into account a person’s length of employment and contribution levels, and incorporate factors associated with the desires of retired people. Extending one’s working life must result in an improved pension.</p>
      <p sl="es">This standard also needs to look to the future. The mobility of workers is going to require that transferring passive rights from one country to another will not be a problem. When they move countries, Europeans need to be able to access their employment history in all the Member States where they have made contributions.</p>

Should we not instead be attempting to resolve the really urgent problems? In my view, there are two issues: one is the fact that there is a huge gap between the actual retirement age and the state retirement age. This means that the anti-discrimination measures really need to be put into effect, in the form of action or monitoring by the Commission to improve the situation, because that will make pensions sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="de">The other is that the report clearly calls for action to be taken now on the portability of occupational pensions, which means considering a new directive. This is much more urgent, because workers who move from one company to another lose a lot of money on their pensions, which would give them security in their old age. This is why we need to take steps in this area. With the White Paper, we are just wasting time.</p>

That is a generally recognised fact. The number of pensioners is increasing. This poses a threat to the sustainability of the pensions system. It is essential to adapt the social security and pensions system to today’s challenges. I agree with the Commissioner when he said it would take a great deal of hard work to produce this document. Nevertheless, I believe that we must establish a social fund on an EU-wide scale, equivalent to the Cohesion Fund, with the aim of assisting pensioners in those countries with relatively low revenues. National budgets cannot secure a decent old age. We already have experience of this. Last year, we fought against poverty, and the result is that we have more poor people than before.</p>

      <p sl="en">I realise that it is hard to bring the positions from so many different political and national backgrounds into line, but the votes in committees involved show that the reports have been met with wide support. This sends a clear signal to the Commission on the follow-up to the Green Paper. I expect to publish a summary early next month with Parliament’s opinion included. We will follow this up in the second half of 2011 with the White Paper, which I mentioned in my earlier intervention, accompanied by a suitable impact assessment. This will give all stakeholders the opportunity once again to continue playing a part in the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commissioners’ Group on pensions already discussed last week possible policy options on how to update and improve the European framework on pensions. There was agreement that we should continue with the holistic approach to the pension reforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">As part of this, we need to continue a dialogue with the key stakeholders, both on possible new regulatory initiatives in such fields as portability, occupational pension schemes and insolvency protection, and other softer forms of regulation, such as codes of good practice. We also decided to deal with the gender dimension in depth and also address it more extensively in the White Paper than in the Green Paper.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, I would like to make sure that the Green Paper and the White Paper do not get mixed up with other flying objects in the European sky. The Commission has absolutely nothing in common with approaches that assume that there could be a uniform retirement age in the European Union. Diversity is key in the EU and it also applies to diversity of the demographic reality, and we have to study that more deeply now than before.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also recognise that ongoing reforms carry new risks as they make future pensions far more dependent on long-term developments in the labour market and financial markets.

      <p sl="ro">The most vulnerable pension system in the EU is the public system, based on intergenerational solidarity. However, a pension is an inherited right and governments cannot violate it, whether there is a crisis or not, even if some governments, such as the Romanian Government, feel free to do anything they want regarding the pension amount and the method for calculating it. The demographic situation is not in our favour either. Therefore, the system’s sustainability is an urgent problem. However, public pension systems are not financed by governments, but by those who contribute to them: social partners, employees and employers, regardless of their type. These systems are severely affected by two factors: illegal work and the inability of Europe’s economies to create new jobs offering decent pay and of a reasonable duration. Poorly paid, precarious jobs, on the pretext of making the labour market more flexible, mean that public systems will be permanently in crisis. I find it encouraging that the European Parliament resolution on pension systems emphasises the discrimination against women with regard to the pension amount, even though the age and period of time for making contributions will be virtually the same as those for men. This is a first step towards righting an injustice, which must be followed by subsequent measures.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The European Commission’s Green Paper presents convincing arguments as to why we need to improve current pension systems. However, we must not forget that most of the solutions proposed are socially sensitive.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We must therefore evaluate carefully not only the benefits of these solutions, but also the potential risks, particularly when we are talking about increasing the retirement age or Member States losing influence in pension policy. Although the Commission considers raising the retirement age to be one of the less painful ways of adapting to increasing life expectancy, it does not provide specific proposals on the employment of elderly people in the labour market. With the possibility of delaying retirement, many unemployed people under the pensionable age may land in the poverty trap. Insufficient consideration has also been given to how much people’s health will allow them to work longer. Furthermore, we must take into account the fact that women take lower paid or part-time work more often than men and that due to childbirth and motherhood, and caring for children and disabled family members, they lose insurance guarantees and ultimately receive smaller pensions. I feel that we must also focus more on other means of improving pension systems, such as timing the start of working life, better reconciliation of work and family life, a ‘flexible’ assessment of retirement age, the introduction of minimum standards for pensions, etc.</p>

We must redefine issues concerning the future in relation to the young and the old, in order to be able to ensure the sustainable, secure and appropriate disbursement of pensions. There are major differences between European Member States in terms of their pension systems. While Western European countries are struggling with the problems of increasing current and future costs, new Member States are attempting to set up diversified systems. While, in 2008, there were four employees to support every pensioner, in 2020, there will be five. The reasons for this include the fact that, due to their longer, more comprehensive training, European youths enter the labour market at a later age, and that the employment relationships of employees do not last until the statutory retirement age.</p>

For the future reform of pension systems, it will be essential to link the first and second pillars, which are already partially overlapping in the various Member States, and these must also be closely linked to the third pillar. We must also endeavour to eliminate illegal employment, which has a similarly crucial role in the preservation of our pension systems.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The ageing population trend facing Europe in recent years is bringing about major changes in the field of medicine and consumption habits, as well as to the population structure and social security system. In these circumstances, ensuring pension systems’ viability in the future is closely linked to how long EU citizens are effectively active on the labour market. I feel it is beneficial that the EU 2020 strategy supports an active, focused labour market policy, which will help increase the employment rate of older workers, women, members of minority groups and the long-term unemployed. By achieving this objective, I believe that Europe will see an increase in the number of people in work and, by extension, economic growth, which will have a positive impact on the viability of pension systems at EU level.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We all know that there is no such thing as an ideal model for pension systems. Every country has developed its own solutions and has plans for future reforms which are adapted accordingly. In spite of the significant differences between the individual systems, I believe that the European Union should indicate the direction to be followed by all Member States when making changes. It was emphasised many times in committee that the financial and economic crisis of recent years has highlighted the urgent need to carry out reforms of the pension systems. The principles of solidarity and subsidiarity oblige us to strengthen cooperation between the Member States in this area. Sharing our experiences will enable us to avoid wasting time on duplication, which has already led to disaster in one country, and exchanging information on best practices will make it possible to develop the best strategies effectively.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let us not forget that the reforms must not be limited merely to raising contributions and extending the period during which contributions are made. Budgetary stability, the cross-border coordination of pensions, the development of minimum guarantees and equal rights for women and men are only some of the issues which should be the subject of deliberations in every Member State. A sustainable system based on mutually dependent and complementary pillars should be developed throughout Europe, incorporating public, employee and private pensions, as well as capital and non-capital pensions. I believe that this solution will guarantee the creation of stable and fair pension systems which will, at the same time, remain flexible enough to adapt to the social and economic changes we are experiencing.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Due to their ageing populations, nearly all countries in the world are facing the question of how to finance pension systems based mainly on flexible funding in the future. I welcome Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s excellent report, which opens up the possibility of a solution, while respecting subsidiarity. I would like to mention a solution which has been promoted for many years by the Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People’s Party (KDU-ČSL) in the Czech Republic. Children who are in gainful employment should have the option to redirect part of their mandatory contributions to the flexible system to their parents’ pension account, and partially offset the costs expended on their care in childhood through this contribution to a higher pension for their parents. This individualised inter-generational solidarity would, on the one hand, be fairer for today’s pensioners, who have done a decent job of raising the new generation, while, on the other, it would surely help towards rehabilitating social attitudes to large families. It should pay to have children, rather than just being a cost. This is the key to a permanent solution both to the consequences and to the main cause of our pension problem.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ten years of work on a Green Paper erroneously entitled ‘Towards adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems’ has resulted in nothing more than a random collection of nonsensical assertions. I do not know how it is in other countries, but in the Czech Republic, for example, the projected birth rates drawn up by experts 10 years ago differ so dramatically from the current state of affairs that the assertions of the Green Paper for the 2040-2060 period are, in my opinion, nonsensical. If the experts are unable to predict the development of the birth rate even over five to seven years, how can their forecast for a period of more than 30 years have any value? The entire Green Paper is based on the erroneous assumption that, as long as I impose a legal obligation on the taxpayer to invest a portion of the resources assigned to the pension system into a fund not guaranteed by the state, he will get a higher pension that he would from the first pillar alone. A responsible constitutional court would necessarily describe such a law as unconstitutional. Even in countries where the second pillar has been introduced in the past, it apparently failed to produce the expected results. For example, in Chile in the 1970s, after the overthrow of Pinochet, private funds not guaranteed by the state became mandatory for citizens outside the army and the police. Why was this? Why is the current conservative government in Hungary also dismantling the ineffective second pillar of pension provision? These are the main reasons why the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left cannot vote for Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s report. We cannot support the planned crime of the century!</p>

      <p sl="en">The EU and Member States face one of their biggest challenges with regard to ensuring adequate and sustainable pension systems in Europe. Given that a large percentage of citizens are highly dependent on their pension schemes for their livelihood, I would like to emphasise the importance of the state-financed pension schemes based on the principle of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">In multifaceted situations with various traditions and types of pension scheme, and given that the main responsibility for pension reform rests within the remit of Member States, it is impossible to apply the principle of one-size-fits-all. The EU can, however, add value by providing coordination between the various pension schemes and sharing best practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any review of pension systems should be carried out in a transparent way, protecting consumers’ needs and informing citizens of their rights with regard to the various pension schemes and the risks involved, especially those related to cross-border mobility. Pension systems should be able to withstand any potential budgetary and demographic pressures on Member States without putting undue pressure on ordinary citizens.</p>

I see it as our duty to prevent older citizens in particular, who have helped to build up our current levels of prosperity during their working lives, from ending up in a vulnerable situation in their old age. At the same time, the report takes proper account of the subsidiarity principle. The Commission should make a clearer call for equality between men and women. Women more often have atypical employment contracts than men. Their pensions are often smaller and, therefore, they are at greater risk of suffering poverty in old age. Appropriate and secure pension systems represent long-term intergenerational contracts. Therefore, I would like to encourage the Commission to use the Green Paper to launch initiatives which generate greater public awareness of the solidarity between the generations on the subject of pension provision.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that the EU needs to create an open unitary pension system which will take into account demographic trends and the issue of mobility. Let me give the example of my own country. In Romania, the annual expenditure on pensions is the largest category of budgetary expenditure. The state social insurance budget has recorded an annual deficit ever since 2006, reaching EUR 1.5 billion in 2009. According to the World Bank’s estimates, in 2050, the deficit produced by pensions expenditure would have reached approximately 12% of GDP under the old system. This is why, by adopting Act no 263/2010, Romania has introduced a series of major reforms which will ensure the sustainability of the public pension system in the medium and long term. These reforms include: - discouraging early retirement and retirement through disability on unjustified medical grounds; - increasing the number of people contributing to the public unitary pension system; - gradually raising the normal retirement age for men and women, to 65 for men by 2015, and to 63 for women by 2030.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I was glad to learn that the report on the Commission’s Green Paper on adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems would be added to today’s agenda. The issue of future pensions, how safe they are, and what income they will provide is currently one of the most important problems facing society. Although the Member States are responsible for deciding on the shape to be taken by pension systems, and, in principle, the European Union is not authorised to take action in this area, certain legislative solutions relating to pension systems should be worked out at EU level. Parliament’s demand that the Commission develop guidelines for the governments of the Member States is of great significance for the economic security of pensioners, since the guidelines would set minimum levels for pensions and criteria for calculating pension benefits, which would mean that women’s pension benefits would no longer fall short of men’s. Women are condemned to lower pensions than men through no fault of their own, due to being paid different amounts for the same work or to the need to interrupt their career to care for children, which results in lower contributions over their entire working life. In the face of threats to the stability of pension systems, the Commission should therefore not forget to ensure that legal solutions are introduced which guarantee the equal treatment of women and men throughout the EU as a whole as far as the level of future pensions is concerned.</p>

      <p sl="it">On reaching the horrific figure of 23 million unemployed, Europe in 2011 has beaten every negative record of the decade in the field of employment policies, thus officially branding them a failure. The crisis is more than sufficient grounds for adopting a text in which the appeal to apply the principle of subsidiarity to the area of pensions shows that the Eurocrats have become more reasonable again in revising a European social model that has certainly failed. After a decade of being sidelined, the governments are stepping in and becoming the main players in the rebuilding of social Europe. That is not enough, however: only a brave decision in favour of grassroots democracy, based on employment reforms that make work more attractive and on payslip federalism that takes account of the different costs of living in each region of Europe, against which both wages and pensions would be readjusted, would constitute a real change of direction towards renewal. Lowering the cost of labour by reducing taxes, and giving our small enterprises the chance to carry on working and investing in the region, are essential moves to ensure equalisation of contributions for the older generations and a future of certainty and quality of life for the new ones.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, now that we have arrived at this point, at this time and at the end of this long process, I think that we know what it is that unites us, every man and woman in this room: it is the protection of patients’ health. It is our duty to protect the 500 million citizens who live in Europe and who do not know if the medicines they are using are real or falsified. We have to give them the guarantee that the medicines they are using are going to help save their lives, and not contribute to their early death. I think that this problem is far too serious for us to allow it to continue unresolved any longer.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why I have referred several times to these falsified medicines as ‘silent killers’ because that is effectively what they are, because if people who have problems … We know how falsification networks have changed: a few years ago everybody would be talking about Viagra, but today it is impossible not to talk about drugs that combat, or attempt to combat, diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and cholesterol.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, as I said, these are ‘silent killers’ because, if they are not combating these diseases, they are not helping people.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This commitment that we are discussing here today is one which brings together some of the changes obtained throughout this process. To begin with, we started in the market and ended up in health (and I heartily welcome this move to health); to begin with, we started with physical space, and included the Internet, as we could not leave out the main gateway for falsified medicines in Europe; to begin with, we had merely a monitoring system, and we went on to add sanctions and penalties to this. If we consider that falsification is a crime, we had to add sanctions and penalties.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is also another important element: this is not confined merely to Europe. We also ensure that third countries, where the situation of falsification is even more serious, are considered within our proposal presented here today.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We know that, in spite of only having random monitoring, since 2005, there has been a 400% increase in the seizure of falsified medicines. We know that this trade represents profits of EUR 45 billion per year for certain criminal networks, but a total disaster for citizens’ health.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why I wish to make it very clear that the counterfeiting of medicines is not just any counterfeiting, because it is a form of counterfeiting which completely undermines confidence in our health systems. As falsification is an organised crime, as I have already mentioned, I believe that we have to combat it with this legislation, with our commitment, and with our concerted efforts. Therefore, we present a monitoring system which extends all the way from the manufacturer to the patient. This has been a battle for Parliament, and something which I am very pleased is now assured.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This procedure has passed through two Commissioners and four presidencies. We began with the Commissioner for Industry, as I mentioned, and we end now with the Commissioner for Health. It has been a long process and therefore, I would like to end with some words of very special thanks for the rapporteurs from other groups who have followed this procedure with great commitment and dedication, from the beginning to the end: Mrs Grossetête, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mr Krahmer, Mr Tremopoulos, Mrs Yannakoudakis and Mrs Rosbach. Without them, this would not have been such an interesting and, at the same time, productive, debate. I know that at times, we have adopted differing stances, but I also know that we have had a common objective, that of protecting patients’ health. As I cannot thank all those who have been involved, I would like to offer my symbolic gratitude to all those who worked on this directive by naming Mrs Pantazidou, who gave me immense support throughout the whole procedure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address Parliament on this important issue of falsified medicines. The proposal before us today for an amending directive on falsified medicines will, subject to Parliament’s approval, take us into new territory. A successful conclusion of this file will mark the first time that the European Union has tackled, with legislation, the specific threat of falsified pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p sl="en">This text is going to make our regulatory system fit for the future; making a major contribution to protecting patients from the many dangers of fake medicines. As Members will know, falsified medicines are different from counterfeit products. Falsified medicines are about public health.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was very pleased that an early agreement on the substance of the proposal was reached between the colegislators just before Christmas. Let me thank all those who worked so hard to make this agreement possible, especially the rapporteur of the lead committee, Ms Matias, as well as the rapporteurs of the committees giving opinions, Ms Sartori and Ms Bastos. I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission stands fully behind the substance of this well-balanced agreement, which introduces rigid and effective measures whilst being risk proportionate and flexible. This is crucial, as not all medicines are the same: the likeliness of falsification varies, as does the risk of public health.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to some of the specific issues, I would like to highlight the following. On safety features: we saw the risk that Member States might, in future, take divergent approaches on the packaging. This would have led to different levels of protection in the European Union. It would have led to a fragmentation of the European Union market for medicines. I am sure Members will share my satisfaction that we have paved the way towards a European safety feature to identify and thus authenticate a medicine. The Commission has always supported a European approach in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">On active pharmaceutical ingredients: the agreed text strengthens inspections and international cooperation in this field. The Commission and the network of European agencies will work more closely with international partners. Only through such cooperation can we achieve a truly effective system of inspection and enforcement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The legislation, once adopted, will increase the transparency of actors involved in the distribution of medicines. Finally, Parliament insisted on rules concerning online sales of medicines. I consider that Parliament found a strong, pragmatic solution by focusing on issues of transparency. The argument acknowledges that the rules for pharmacies in the EU vary but, in future, it will be easier for patients throughout the EU to distinguish legal operators from illegal online pharmacies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Sadly, over the last few years, we have witnessed an increase in the falsification of medicines here in Europe. According to European Union data, currently 1.5 million boxes of falsified medicines are sold every year via the legal supply chain. This is a criminal activity which represents a serious threat to European patients and industry. The purpose of this directive is to block the introduction of falsified medicines into the supply chain, and thereby protect public health.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to highlight the following key points in the opinion that I drafted: the introduction of a definition of falsified medicine, which clearly places the emphasis on consumer protection, the application of safety provisions to those medicines which are subject to medical prescription, the accountability of all participants in the supply chain and, finally, the application by Member States of effective sanctions to deter this criminal activity.</p>

      <p sl="it">Although the compromise text is a decided improvement over the provisions of the 2001 directive, it does not touch on certain issues that I think are fundamental, which I would like to mention here. Manufacturers of active substances based in third countries should be subject to inspections by the Member State to which those substances are destined, to be mediated by the competent authorities of the third country in question.</p>
      <p sl="it">Medicinal products should be clearly traceable as regards the manufacturer and the country of origin of the various active substances whenever this information is not specified in the new formulation. The issue of Internet sales remains unresolved.</p>

I would also like to congratulate the Council and the Commission, since we have finally reached agreement on this extremely important directive on combating organised crime linked to falsified medicines. The numbers are too high: 34 million falsified medicinal products seized in the European Union in 2008, a massive increase of 380%. Over 50% of medicines sold over the Internet are falsified, representing a real menace to all our fellow citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The directive represents a step forward. I see it as just a step, because unfortunately, we have not gone far enough. We should have moved faster. However, it is a step forward, with stricter inspections for the manufacturers of active ingredients constituting a particularly valuable feature. We are seeking to improve safety and that means we need to identify the responsibilities of each player in the supply chain: manufacturers, wholesalers, parallel importers, brokers and distributors. In the interests of safety, we also need to ensure that every box of prescription medicine is traceable. I would have liked the proposal to go further on this front.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to guaranteeing authenticity by having a unique code for each package, the safety requirements also include rules on tamper-proof packaging for boxes that are handled by parallel importers. We have had lengthy discussions on this matter. It is an important point because we are currently dealing with a real scourge that has ramifications for public health. Pharmacists also need access to trustworthy supplies of quality products. I agree with you, Commissioner, when you say that we need to remain vigilant as we put all of these safety requirements into practice. Yet I do not think our work ends there. We will need to monitor carefully how this directive is implemented.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we can all imagine the nightmare. Someone we know is ill and in a desperate situation. They are given medicines, but the medicines have no effect, because they have been falsified.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are grateful to the Commission for producing this proposal. It is true that we have been discussing it for some time. We began our debates in the previous parliamentary term and I would like to thank Mr Adamou, who is no longer a Member of this Parliament, for the preliminary work that he did on behalf of Mrs Matias.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that we have reached a good compromise, as Mrs Grossetête has said. Yes, we could have gone further. We are all impatient and we all want greater safety, but this is a good compromise. What have we achieved? We have made patient safety the central feature of the legislation. The safety measures that we have put in place will ensure that products are traceable throughout the entire distribution chain. Medicines can be traced from the manufacturer to the pharmacist. They will have an identifier which makes it immediately obvious if they are falsified or duplicated or if there are any irregularities, which can then be followed up. We have deliberately done this in such a way that the costs of the system remain at a reasonable level for everyone involved and that the system is not excessive. However, we are also not compromising on patient safety.</p>
      <p sl="de">This traceability is accompanied by the fact that the packaging must be undamaged, so that a patient who is given a pack can see that it has not been opened because it has an intact seal. In addition, there will be no more packs of medicines which are divided in two, as frequently used to be the case. All of this will improve safety levels and increase patients’ confidence.</p>
      <p sl="de">What else have we achieved? We have implemented an early warning system. This is excellent because it is the same system which has been in place for decades for foods and which we take for granted. There is an early warning system throughout the European Union for contaminated food. It is hard to believe that we have not had the same thing for medicines. If a falsified medicine is discovered, it is now possible to send out an early warning. The Member States must identify the patients who are affected, inform everyone involved and make sure that the risk involved in a medicine which is in circulation is made public. We take this for granted in the case of cars and food, but it has not been available so far for something as essential as medicines.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as the Internet is concerned, anyone who accesses an illegal website must be able to recognise that it is illegal. This is why we must certify legal websites which, in future, will have a link to the website of the national approval body. They will be able to display a logo which will be developed by the European Commission. Everyone who buys medicines on the Internet can do so independently. They can tell whether they are dealing with a safe, legal website or an illegal one.</p>
      <p sl="de">All of this is a milestone, a quantum leap forward in patient safety. If we adopt this legislation tomorrow, we can be proud of what we have done and we should also make our achievements clear to the general public.</p>

It also involved a great deal of teamwork and I would like to thank everyone involved for this. We have produced some very good results.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we must not lose sight of the fact that we can never achieve complete safety by means of regulations. This is true in every area, not just in the case of medicines. We have rightly concentrated on the essential issues, on the distinctions between different types of packaging and on traceability in the distribution chain. By differentiating between prescription and over-the-counter medicines, we are taking the right approach, because we must remember that every piece of legislation and every attempt to make products safer costs money. Therefore, it is reasonable not to include every pack of aspirins or every over-the-counter medicine automatically right from the start. Instead, the Commission or the agency must be given the task of monitoring the market and investigating developments.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that we can be proud of what we have achieved. We have produced a piece of legislation that brings real benefits. Most patients will probably not be aware that they are the result of EU law and, therefore, we must make this very clear.</p>

      <p sl="en">The directive presses all the right buttons and goes some way towards addressing the problem. Could we have gone further? The answer is yes. Should we have gone further? Here I must say no. We have laid down tighter controls on prescription medicine as a first step. We have addressed the Internet pharmacy issue. We have looked at the safety features. Yes, we could have gone further on the traceability, taking it up to the patient, but this is a battle that we would have lost and it would have delayed the directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">As they say, Rome was not built in a day. I look forward to building on the foundations of this directive.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, unfortunately, we are seeing more and more falsified medicinal products on the market in our Member States. That is why this proposal is so important. Patients in the EU need to know how they can avoid falsified medicinal products. They are also entitled to see that we, as legislators, are fighting to combat these products. It is important that we adopt clear definitions. All too often, we adopt legislation that is imprecise and unclear. This must not happen in such an important case as this. Medicinal products must be checked before they come onto the market and not only after patients have, in fact, been acting as guinea pigs for several years. We must satisfy ourselves that medicinal products are only imported if safety and the possibility of verification are given top priority. Falsification of medicinal products harms both the patients and the pharmaceutical companies in the Member States. I therefore hope that we can agree on a more stringent line than that proposed by the Commission, and I would like to thank Mrs Matias for her sterling work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Matias. My thanks go also to Mrs Grossetête, the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), and Mrs Roth-Behrendt. The two of them have done excellent groundwork on this directive during the last parliamentary term.</p>
      <p sl="de">The falsification of medicines is a growing problem. The number of cases identified amounted to 7.5 million in 2009, which is many more than in previous years. These are only those cases that have come to light. There is a large number of unreported incidents, which is why we can only assume that the problem is a major one.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is very irritating if lifestyle medicines are found to contain no active ingredients. However, if essential medicines used to treat cancer, for example, contain no active ingredients, the wrong ingredients or the wrong dosage, this can put patients’ lives at risk. This is why action was urgently needed. We have taken a reasonable approach. The subject of data protection is a highly sensitive one and we have found the right balance. We are acting on the basis of the risks involved and focusing initially on prescription medicines. There is an opt-out procedure available, if there is reason to assume that there is no risk. There is also an opt-in process for over-the-counter medicines, if there is reason to assume that they have been falsified.</p>

I believe that this is a very important scheme for the health of consumers, although up until now, they have probably not even been aware that their health has been at risk. Fortunately, at least we have finally got round to tackling all the risks now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">People’s health should not be trifled with. Indeed, I believe that, with this scheme, we are taking an important step towards making packaging safe and towards clarifying the situation. I am also very pleased that, at Parliament’s insistence, the sale of medicines via the Internet has been included in the directive, because that was a thorn in everybody’s side. If you view this situation as gambling with the health of consumers, then Internet sales are tantamount to Russian roulette. You have a 50 to 90% chance of encountering a counterfeit medicine, and then – bang! I am very pleased that this scheme has addressed that issue.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I do think, however, that some further modifications are needed, because we do not yet have cast-iron guarantees of safety. I suppose that is up to each individual Member State. Moreover, there is also the issue of the logo, of whether it will be entirely tamper-proof on the Internet, so we really have to keep an eye on this aspect.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me first congratulate Marisa and my colleagues for reaching an agreement with the Council on such a complex dossier.</p>
      <p sl="en">The text now on the table reinforces the security of our legal chain of supply for medicinal products, but let me emphasise that only 1% of falsified medicines reach our patients via this legal chain. The other 99% comes from illegal channels and the black market.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this regard, I very much welcome the additional provisions focusing on the Internet put forward by the European Parliament. But in order to address this major risk for patients’ safety, we must also reinforce EU actions in the field of justice, police and customs cooperation. The Commission should go further in this field and we insist on this to combat falsified medicines properly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the specific provisions of the agreement to be voted on tomorrow, and most particularly the new safety features to be implemented, I would like to ask the Commission to clearly monitor the impact of this directive. In its initial report, the Committee on the Environment stated that the measures put in place should respond to three guiding principles: proportionality, cost-effectiveness and independence.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for an excellent piece of work. We all know that the pharmaceutical industry is very big business. It is said to be the third largest in the world, after drugs and weapons. It therefore offers rich pickings, and some people will always try to grab these by illegal means. We will never be able to prevent the production of fake medicines. Our task is to minimise the risk that they will get on to the European market and that they will reach our citizens. We know that when someone sells a counterfeit watch, that is an infringement of intellectual property protection, but when a counterfeit medicine is sold, it is a direct health risk.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is this fact which has led us and is leading us to support this report. We know we cannot solve everything, and we know there is a problem, for example, over the fact that packaging is often produced separately from medicines, and that counterfeit medicines in genuine packaging are in circulation around the world. However, this is a step in the right direction and an attempt at the maximum possible protection.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although the Commission’s proposed changes to the directive on medicinal products for human use are designed to help prevent the entry of falsified medicinal products, we would have expected more concrete results, particularly through the introduction of compulsory inspections of production sites in which active substances are manufactured in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">That option was rejected on the grounds that such checks would be too costly. The fact is that European companies have to meet extremely high quality standards, whereas companies manufacturing in other parts of the world do not.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are voting in favour, however, since measures are being introduced to make sure that imported pharmaceutical products are safer, including traceability, a ban on repackaging, compliance with EU safety standards, the partial regulation of Internet sales, and the possibility of extending similar measures to over-the-counter medicinal products as well.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, according to the World Health Organisation, around 10% of the global pharmaceutical market is accounted for by counterfeit medicinal products. It is hard to estimate the exact scale of the problem in the individual Member States of the European Union, but in Poland in 2009 alone, for example, customs officers confiscated over 100 000 falsified products.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Apart from falsified medicines, the problems which patients face include a lack of reliable information on the contents of packaging, and also the issue of repackaging, during which the contents may change. It is also very important for patients to be able to obtain reliable information on the Internet. Unfortunately, as well as much information which is genuine, there is a lot of information on the Internet which is false. Against this background, it is important to introduce a system for monitoring and checking medicines, which will provide patients with reliable information. We are aware, however, that even the best regulations will not bring about the anticipated effect if they include no provisions for appropriate penalties for entities which put counterfeit medicines into circulation. Today’s debate is therefore extremely important, as is the introduction of regulations which not only prevent the distribution of counterfeit medicines and put in place a monitoring system, but which, above all, impose penalties on the manufacturers of fakes. Numbers of counterfeit medicinal products will only be reduced and their use made safer if measures of this kind are taken.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am pleased that we have succeeded in extending the legal basis for this directive from the original single market remit to cover public health too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have a requirement: we have fought to ensure that online sales form an integral part of this directive so as to be able to create checks and controls that reflect our findings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is also one point on which we will need to be vigilant. We know that falsified medicinal products make up 1% to 3% of the market in developed countries, between 10% and 30% in Asia and Latin America, and up to 70% in some African countries. Some studies suggest that trafficking falsified medicines can be 25 times more profitable than drug trafficking.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also the shadow rapporteurs who have done an excellent job. Initially, we had a very heated discussion on this subject. However, the MEDI-FAKE action in December 2008 may have had an impact in this area. During the course of two months, 34 million falsified tablets were seized on the European Union’s external borders. This was a warning which prompted us to speed up our work. We have now produced results that we can be really satisfied with. We have guaranteed the traceability of medicines. Every pharmacist can identify using a scanner whether a product is falsified or genuine.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to make one request. It is true that websites are now being monitored and that they have a logo, although this can also be forged, but in the case of sales over the Internet, we need to do some public relations work to explain the risks of Internet purchases to the citizens of Europe. I am very pleased that parallel trade has been retained. It has a worse reputation than it actually deserves and its position has been guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make one final point. We should perhaps consider, for the safety of citizens and to improve understanding, whether it would be a good idea to deal with the problem of widely differing pack sizes in different countries in order to introduce a standardised solution.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, for two years, we have been discussing the alarming growth in counterfeit medicines on our market, including lifesaving medicines. The result is a good directive which tightens up controls both on distributors and retailers, introducing mandatory protective measures and checks against infringement. Producers will also assess risks in respect of processing aids, all of which has been happening for years in the Czech Republic, for example. It is therefore excellent that this will apply throughout the EU.</p>
      <p sl="cs">There is also a need for the system not to be restricted just to prescription medicines. If we wish to avoid losing our fight against counterfeits, Member States must achieve a greater level of integration in the area of health, unite in banning websites offering counterfeits and introduce inspections at third country producers, as is the case already with imported foods. After all, in China alone, there are 500 factories for counterfeit medicines. We simply have to step on the gas if we want to enhance safety on the European market.</p>

What is particularly serious is the fact that the number of falsifications of life-saving medicines is increasing. These are medicines for the treatment of cancer, heart disease and infections, in other words, situations where someone really is in need of an effective medicine.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We are now taking a major step forward with regard to medicinal products within the EU, but the problem extends beyond the EU’s borders. According to the WHO’s expert group, many countries in Africa, parts of Asia and Latin America have areas where more than 30% of the medicines on sale may be falsified.

We do not all have perfect proposals, but more important than knowing whether a proposal is perfect is knowing that we have an instrument in our hands which will allow us not to have to put off the protection of our patients’ health any longer. We are also bound not to delay its adaptation; we are bound not to delay putting it into action; and we can only do this if we work together.</p>

This commitment contains guaranteed safeguards to ensure that we can follow the procedure, assess it and have systematic access to information which will allow us to verify whether or not it is being put into practice as it should be, and whether it is necessary to make some changes.</p>

There is no such thing as a perfect proposal, no such thing as a perfect action; there will always be flaws, but I think we have a strong and robust commitment which will allow us to fight for and defend patients’ health.

      <p sl="pl">Falsified medicinal products and the illegal trade in medicines are worldwide problems, both for highly developed countries and developing countries, and the problem is becoming increasingly widespread, posing a threat to patients’ safety and lives. One of the reasons for this is that falsified medicinal products and drugs sold in places not authorised to sell them do not meet the quality requirements set for medicinal products, and contain prohibited substances whose use may have unknown consequences. I agree that the problem requires effective and strengthened international coordination and cooperation in order to guarantee an effective strategy for combating falsified medicines. I fully support the proposal that measures should be taken with the aim of minimising the problem of trade in falsified medicinal products, and also of trade in medicines sold in places not authorised to sell them and other falsified products fulfilling the criteria for medicinal products. Attention should be paid to the need to regulate mail-order and Internet sales of medicinal products.</p>
      <p sl="pl">According to information from the World Health Organisation, falsified medicines account for around 50% of products offered on the Internet. I believe that it is essential to plan and implement measures aimed at making information available on falsified medicinal products and medicines from illegal sources, and to run public education campaigns regarding the threats associated with purchasing medicinal products in places not authorised to sell them. I also believe that it would be a reasonable idea to put in place safeguards making it possible to identify medicinal products and to verify their authenticity and traceability.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Falsified medicinal products are a global problem, and should be examined in a global context. The reasons behind the problem include the high price of medicines and a lack of awareness among patients, but to a large extent, they are also of a legal nature. This situation is exploited by criminal groups throughout the world. I would therefore like to acknowledge the joint measures taken by the EU institutions and the almost unanimous position adopted by all the political groups on the drafting of a compromise legislative act on this matter. I wish to quote a statement by the former Secretary-General of Interpol, Ronald Noble, comparing the number of victims of terrorism and counterfeit medicines: over a period of 45 years, terrorists killed 65 000 people, whereas counterfeit medicines claimed 200 000 victims in China alone.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that monitoring, control measures, tightening up standards and establishing a mutual recognition system, all of which are emphasised, are good solutions from which to begin. As Vice-Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would also like to highlight the role played by information campaigns aimed at patients, and also the imposition of obligations on pharmaceutical companies in this area.

      <p sl="fr">Falsified medicinal products make up 50% of medicines sold over the Internet and 1% to 3% of medicines sold by dispensing pharmacists. These falsified products are evolving: they now include life-saving medicines as well as lifestyle medicines. We have a duty to protect the health of our fellow citizens who choose to order medicines online in order to save time or money, unaware of the risks that they are running. What is more, these falsified medicines are entering the formal supply chain and finding their way into dispensing chemists’ stocks, where they could prove deadly to any one of us. Every year, 200 000 people lose their lives after ingesting falsified medicinal products. This is more than just a worrying trend: we need to fight this scourge with all the means at our disposal. For this reason, I welcome the forthcoming adoption of the directive, which will introduce a unique track and trace code to prove that medicinal products are authentic, together with a standard logo to identify trustworthy websites selling pharmaceutical products.

      <p sl="et">The pharmaceutical industry is one of the three most lucrative industries. It is certainly one of the main reasons why counterfeit pharmaceuticals are spreading on to the market. Last year, customs confiscated 384% more counterfeit pharmaceuticals than were confiscated five years ago. In combating this phenomenon, it is very important to accept unified security measures within the European Union, including repackaging. Patients need to have complete confidence that any medication they are taking is indeed what they think it is and that the active ingredient in the prescription corresponds to what is in the medication. From the perspective of national health, it is of the utmost importance that the medication should be effective, high quality and safe. False information campaigns by third-party pharmaceutical companies that have procured a licence to sell from competent institutions must be prohibited. This prohibition should also be extended to information and advertising distributed to medical staff.</p>

The directive being examined by Parliament must therefore be supported wholeheartedly, since it introduces procedures and obligations that I hope can lead to concrete and effective results. In particular, I would like to underline the importance of certain obligations placed on a range of actors involved in the supply chain, from distributors to wholesalers, and, above all, the introduction of ‘safety features’ on prescription medicinal products with the aim of assuring consumers of the integrity of the manufacturing and supply chain. Stricter rules on inspections, on the traceability of the substances contained in medicinal products, as well as on online sales, are further measures that I think will curb the trade in falsified medicinal products. It should be noted, however, that the compromise text establishes that there will be regular inspections at production sites in third countries, but that they will be carried out by the authorities of the third country in question. It would have been better if they were to be performed by the authorities of the countries to which the medicinal products are destined, because the main threat of falsification comes precisely from third countries.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The compromise also strikes a balance between protecting patients’ health and the costs which the new regulations will incur for pharmaceutical manufacturers. It is of paramount importance for us to adopt an approach based on the risk of the relevant medicines being falsified. This is why I believe that restricting the new devices to medicines issued on prescription is a welcome measure. It would be inappropriate for pharmaceutical manufacturers who are not targets for falsification to bear the high cost of the security devices.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, the inclusion of online pharmacies marks significant progress for the safety of patients who tend to purchase medicines via the Internet. We cannot allow counterfeiters to benefit from a legal vacuum, thereby endangering patients’ health. Establishing guarantees indicating that a website is selling genuine medicines will assist greatly all those patients who use this purchase method.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is Question Time (B7-0009/2011).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The following questions are addressed to the Commission.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-597-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="John Dalli" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Allow me to address each of the four component questions in turn.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first question was: can the Commission explain why a decision was not taken in 1998 to ban the marketing of pharmaceuticals containing benfluorex? The answer: benfluorex was discussed in 1998 in the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, now called the Committee for Medical Products for Human Use, of the European Medicines Agency, and subsequently in the Pharmacovigilance Working Party.</p>
      <p sl="en">The committee considered that benfluorex should not be included in the scope of an ongoing evaluation procedure at European level, concerning certain anorectic agents due to a different mode of action. However, it was agreed that the committee’s pharmacovigilance working party would investigate if there was a safety issue with this compound. In March 1999, the pharmacovigilance working party concluded that there were no major benefit-risk concerns for medicinal products containing benfluorex. Further discussion in the working party did not lead to changes in this conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second question: should the Commission not have been alerted and not first by the bans imposed by the authorities in Spain and Italy? The answer: Italy and Spain did not revoke the marketing authorisation for benfluorex. In fact, the first time that a Member State effectively took measures to revoke the national marketing authorisation for Mediator was in 2009, when France suspended its national marketing authorisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Spain, it was the marketing authorisation holder, Servier, that withdrew the marketing authorisation in 2003. Similarly, it was Servier itself that did not request the renewal of the marketing authorisation in 2003 in Italy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The product remained authorised in France, Portugal, Luxembourg and Greece. Benfluorex was discussed within the pharmacovigilance working party, acting in its role as a forum for Member States to exchange pharmacovigilance data among themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to clarify that monitoring of pharmacovigilance data and the subsequent decision making on national authorisations for medicinal products is the primary responsibility of Member States. Commission intervention in these cases is exceptional and limited to concrete situations foreseen in the legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission can launch a Europe-wide evaluation by the European Medicines Agency in two cases: firstly, when Member States adopt divergent national decisions concerning a marketing authorisation and, secondly, before any decision is reached on the granting, variation, suspension or revocation of a marketing authorisation that appears necessary, in particular, when taking account of pharmacovigilance information in cases where it considers that the interests of the Community are involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this case, no action was triggered at EU level in the light of the conclusions of the pharmacovigilance working party and the fact that no divergent decisions were taken at the time by the Member States in response to the discussions in the working party.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third question was: why did the Commission not act until as late as June 2010 when it finally took a clear decision on the marketing of that molecule? The answer: it was only in 2009 that a Member State, namely France, suspended the marketing authorisation of Mediator. Under the new provisions in place since 2004, this automatically triggered a review of the product’s benefit-risk balance, which led to the adoption of a Commission decision requiring all Member States to revoke any national authorisations for benfluorex containing medicinal products.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, it is important to stress that the new pharmacovigilance legislation adopted on 15 December 2010 introduced additional provisions to ensure signal detection by the European Medicines Agency of safety issues for nationally-authorised products and creates new procedures at EU level to assess safety signals for such products, leading to harmonised actions by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fourth and last question was: will the Commission ask the European Medicines Agency to conduct a full retrospective investigation into the ways in which this drug was used over 20 years? The answer: to date, the Commission has not asked the European Medicines Agency to conduct a full retrospective investigation into the ways in which this medicinal product was used over 20 years. The figures and the documentation referred to in the French report clearly indicate that by far the highest use of this medicinal product was in France.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">I would just like to make it clear how I will deal with the supplementary questions this evening. I will take all the supplementaries together – remember that you have 30 seconds for the supplementary – and then I will ask the Commissioners to answer all the supplementaries en masse.</p>

    <intervention id="2-599-000" speaker_id="96948" name="Gilles Pargneaux" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would like to raise one more point in the light of the comments made and the responses given by Commissioner Dalli, whom I would like to thank for the clarifications provided. As you pointed out, Commissioner, in 2003 and 2005, it was Servier which asked for the product to be withdrawn from sale in these two countries. You also said that in 1998 and 1999, the working party chose neither to authorise nor propose the withdrawal of this product. Yet we know that the medicinal product was withdrawn in the United States in 1997.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, surely it is clear – and here is the nub of the matter – that in a market as large as the European Union, which encompasses 500 million European citizens, we need more vigilance? In particular, we need additional alerts that will trigger Europe-wide action, with clear competences for the European Commission and the European Medicines Agency. In this way, we will be able to avoid a repeat of the situations that have occurred in some Member States, such as the French case that was cited.</p>

    <intervention id="2-600-000" speaker_id="29579" name="Marc Tarabella" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, let us extend the terms of this debate, because the Mediator product is simply the visible tip of the iceberg and raises a range of other questions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For example, how is it that a medicinal product that is considered to be potentially harmful, even fatal, and that has been withdrawn from the market in some Member States, can continue to circulate freely within the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Should we not give serious thought to the role and the effectiveness of the European Medicines Agency, if its findings are not binding for Member States?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-601-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="John Dalli" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">In effect, the procedures that were in force at the time of the historic events that I recounted in my answer were as I stated: there was a clear separation between Member States and the European authority – a separation that is still, in fact, in force and jealously guarded by Member States. In effect, that is why, over time, we feel that we should be strengthening our pharmacovigilance processes and procedures.</p>
      <p sl="en">I must say that, in 2004, a step forward was taken on revising the pharmacovigilance procedures and processes that we already have, and also in the last pharmacovigilance agreement. We now have a lot of ‘stoppers’ and it is now also possible for other action to be taken at European level, too, to ensure that anything that is withdrawn from any market is notified and action can be taken upon it. This was not the case before.</p>
      <p sl="en">So this is the situation today. I have instructed my services to conduct a stress test now, including on the new pharmacovigilance processes and procedures put in place after our last agreement. They are taking Médiator as a case study to see whether something like Médiator could still happen with the latest pharmacovigilance processes. We will make sure that if we do find any vacuums, bottlenecks or spaces where action will not be taken in these cases, we will come back to you and try to correct the situation.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 19 by Ivo Belet (H-000027/11)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Sale of iPad subscriptions by Apple</p>
      <p sl="unknown">iPad producer Apple is demanding that newspaper and magazine publishers offer their readers their products (casual sales as well as subscriptions) exclusively via Apple’s iTunes online store, so that it retains control of the sale conditions. This means that iPad users can no longer order any newspaper or magazine for iPad via the website of the publishers concerned.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does the Commission regard this action as compatible with EU law and such principles as interoperability and an open Internet?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Could this be a case of abuse of a dominant position and therefore infringement of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What action will the Commission be taking in this connection?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-603-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Apple announced today that it will offer digital subscriptions to newspapers and magazines on iPad devices exclusively through applications (Apps) sold via its online store. Publishers will still be able to offer online subscriptions through their websites, or by other means, but they will no longer be able to process the subscription via an App on an iPhone using Apple as an intermediary.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whether Apple’s behaviour constitutes a violation of the EU competition rules depends on a range of factual, legal and economic elements. It requires, inter alia, that Apple holds a dominant position in the relevant market. The boundaries of such relevant markets are not clear, as the sector is still relatively new and evolving and as there are also several comparable platforms and devices that provide similar functionalities, some of which are supported by online application stores as the consumer demand for electronic and/or print magazines is unclear and evolving.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once the market has been properly identified, the question of dominance would have to be assessed. Dominance has been defined by the European Court of Justice as a position of economic strength enjoyed by an undertaking which enables it to hinder the maintenance of effective competition on the relevant market by allowing it to behave to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors and customers and ultimately, of consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission notes, in particular, that alternative application platforms exist and several companies have recently launched, or are expecting to launch in the near future, a number of devices similar in terms of functionality to the iPad. The Commission is following the developments regarding Apple’s commercial policies and is in close contact with the national competition authorities.</p>

    <intervention id="2-604-000" speaker_id="28257" name="Ivo Belet" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, this afternoon, Apple indeed announced that it wants to offer a new model to its subscribers, but it is clear that it wants to take advantage of its market position, no matter whether it is in the dominant market position or not, in order to get its hands on customer information which is at the disposal of publishers. In the long term, this could be particularly detrimental to publishers in Europe, as well as to media pluralism.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would therefore like to ask you whether you are prepared to act, regardless of whether or not this is a case of dominant position, and when you are going to take the initiative, if at all. In other words, could you explain what timescale you have in mind for this? Is the Commission taking the initiative going to be a question of weeks or a question of months?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your answer but, in my opinion, you failed to mention an issue of fundamental importance, namely, whether we are capable of imagining at all what portion of the European market could be dominated by Apple’s new product. You responded in a rather general fashion, by stating that the matter was only being examined at present. However, I think that we should know whether there is, in fact, a real threat that Apple will become dominant on the European market.</p>

      <p sl="en">It remains to be seen whether Apple will become dominant in the market, because the market is evolving. We need to assess what the market is and what a dominant position means in this market. As far as market scale goes, at this stage, this is small, and it is premature to speak about any action by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">If there are lots of competitive proposals and an Apple approach does not constitute a dominant position, then there is no need for the Commission to take action. As I said, the Commission is monitoring the situation according to the rules of EU competition law, and if there is a need for steps to be taken, they will be taken independently when the moment is right, when we conclude that action needs to be taken. So rest assured that action will be taken, if necessary.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 20 by Laima Liucija Andrikiene (H-000053/11)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Protection of investments in the context of EU-Russia negotiations on the new partnership and cooperation agreement</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does the Commission raise issues relating to investment protection, especially in the energy sector, in its negotiations with the Russian Federation on the new partnership and cooperation agreement? Drawing on a number of cases when European energy companies were forced out of the Russian market without the possibility to seek impartial and fair local judicial protection, does the Commission intend to include an investor-to-state dispute settlement mechanism in the new partnership agreement or additional economic agreements with the Russian Federation?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What is the position of the Commission with regard to the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT)? Is the Commission still hopeful that the Russian Government might again sign the ECT and eventually ratify it? Or will similar provisions relating to the protection of investments in the energy sector be included in the new partnership agreement?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, with a total stock of EUR 92 billion of foreign investment at the end of 2008, the European Union is by far the largest foreign investor in the Russian Federation.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the energy sector, it is the EU’s firm intention to ensure that the key principles enshrined in the Energy Charter Treaty will also be part of the ongoing negotiations between the European Union and the Russian Federation on the new treaty. The relevant provisions should include investment protection for the energy sector and, in particular, a strong dispute settlement mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">This approach would be without prejudice to the EU general assessment that the Energy Charter Treaty continues to be a valuable multilateral instrument to govern international energy relations. Its unique feature is that it sets legally binding rules on investment protection transit and that it contains provisions on dispute resolution in the energy sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union considers that Russia’s renewed engagement in the Energy Charter process, as expressed in the last EU-Russia Summit, is very important and it will follow a constructive and open approach in that regard. In this context, the EU welcomes the Russian interest in a legally binding energy framework, following its recent proposal for a draft convention on ensuring international energy security. The modernisation of the Energy Charter process would be the appropriate context for multilateral negotiations on this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">I have an additional question. In the European Parliament, we are currently working on the future European investment policy. When it comes to Russia, we often hear about the expansion of Russian companies in the European market, especially in the energy sector, but, at the same time, European investors face enormous difficulties when they want to invest in Russia, especially in sectors that Russia deems as strategic, such as the energy sector. So how is the Commission going to ensure that the principle of reciprocity in the investment relationship is upheld in the new partnership agreement?</p>

      <p sl="en">In a week’s time, we have a meeting with the Russian Government, and investment policy issues will certainly be discussed, because there are arguments on both sides. Russia also argues that some of its investments are not much appreciated in the European Union, so there are ongoing negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, I can clearly say that in the last year, relations on quite difficult issues have started to improve: there has been more openness on the Russian side to discuss issues in depth and in detail. I believe, nevertheless, that relations should build on the agreement, and that the new agreements I have mentioned that will follow the PCA should have very strong investment protection clauses. That is the only way we can really avoid having situations where one side accuses the other side of not playing by the rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current political dynamic is giving rise to much hope that we can conclude this agreement, and include relatively strong provisions in it. It is very clear that in the last year, there have been some fundamental positive shifts in our relations.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 21 by Anne E. Jensen (H-000058/11)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: EU support for the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the 2011 budget, considerable amounts have been allocated to the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) (EUR 65 000 000 in commitment appropriations and EUR 47 608 950 in payment appropriations).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Recent reports have shown significant failings within the fund; and because of corruption and bribery problems involving the fund, some Member States have halted payments to it.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How will the Commission ensure that the funds allocated to the GFATM are not used for bribery and corruption?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">What has the Commission done to ensure that the GFATM still complies with the rules on eligibility for EU funds?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Has the Commission considered halting funding to the GFATM?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-612-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">This is a very pertinent question on an issue which the Commission takes very seriously and is therefore following closely and with great concern. The Commission is a very strong supporter of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Fund has been very successful and it is my full intention to work with the Fund to solve the issues as soon as possible in order for the Commission to continue to be one of the biggest contributors to the Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to underline that the problems identified did not arise from the Fund itself, but in individual countries from the people contracted to implement the programmes. These are countries where very careful attention always has to be paid to avoid such problems. It is public knowledge that the Office of the Inspector General of the Global Fund has been conducting enquiries in respect of the use of USD 4.8 billion in 33 countries. These enquiries have taken place either on a systematic basis or in response to information received on the potential misappropriation of funds. Its inquiry is now complete; in line with common practice, the OIG has issued a report and published it on the website of the Global Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">This practice has proven effective and transparent in implementing the Global Fund’s stated policy of zero tolerance of corruption. For our part, the Commission has commissioned an independent five-pillar audit of the Global Fund, as required under European Union financial regulations for all organisations benefiting from EU financial support. The audit report delivered in November 2010 expressed the auditors’ overall conclusion that the Global Fund’s internal control environment respects the principles of division of responsibilities and of management control of country and regional financial reporting. So standard mechanisms and controls are in place to ensure that funds received from donors are properly handled.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the auditors made several suggestions to improve the management of funds in addition to existing risk management strategy. Following this report, my services are currently discussing the needed modifications designed to improve and speed up the Global Fund reform agenda approved on 4 January. We are also undertaking a second audit mission, including country visits, to follow up on the institutional assessment. Through a letter dated 27 January 2011 and a teleconference on 2 February, I have already contacted the Executive Director of the Global Fund, Mr Kazatchkine, to express the urgent need for additional reforms to further strengthen the Fund’s ground management processes and operations.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, during the Board meeting called on 2 February, the Secretariat of the Global Fund proposed an external review to be carried out by the Global Fund oversight mechanism. This was welcomed by Board members. So in reply to your question as to whether the Commission has considered halting EU funding to the Global Fund, I would inform you that the Commission has notified the Global Fund Executive Director and the Board members that the EU contributions are being put on hold. In parallel, I consider that the European Union, and the Commission in particular, must maintain its overall commitment to the Global Fund objectives, reform process and strategy of alignment to country and health systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this respect, the Commission is identifying clear criteria to apply before further contributions to the Global Fund can be resumed. These measures for ensuring prevention and detection of fraud have no implication in the delivery of vital treatment to the patient but, at the same time, understand that we need to have in place new, strengthened control mechanisms very fast, because as time passes, indefinitely holding on to payments is not the best option. We need additional strengthened control mechanisms at country level which will decrease the risk of misappropriation of the funds and can then resume payment. The Commission will, as I said, remain a keen supporter of the Fund because the Fund has achieved fantastic results, but there has been fraud and we need to deal with that fraud appropriately.</p>

My question to the Commissioner, in specific terms, is what sort of timetable does he envisage with regard to the freezing of contributions to the Fund? How quickly does he expect to be able to find a solution to the problems? According to the Fund, some of those responsible for the misappropriation have been arrested. Action has been taken. I would like to know how long he expects it to be before the money can start to flow again.</p>

According to published statistics, the European Union earmarked funds of EUR 972.5 million for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria between 2002 and 2010. This accounted for approximately 50% of the Fund’s total resources.</p>
      <p sl="el">My question is this: apart from what you have told us about the problems you have identified, has the Commission drafted an evaluation report or carried out an investigation into whether all this money was channelled to its intended target?</p>

      <p sl="en">There are two sides to this issue. On the one hand, I recognise that the Fund is doing fantastic work, reaching those most in need. There is no question about that.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, on the other hand, they are public funds. Public funds are taxpayers’ money and one misappropriation or one fraud case could destroy the work of hundreds of thousands of people. So we need to find a solution very rapidly. My objective is to have the additional measures in place by the summer so that we can resume payments in the autumn. I believe that is doable.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have identified the areas where we need this: at national level. The Central Office is being well audited, and when we transfer money, everything is in order, but when it comes down to implementation in a given country, there are too many risk elements. If you saw which countries were involved and the size of the specific budgetary envelopes for them, you would realise that the sums involved would be too huge to suspend payments, and we need the reforms to work very rapidly.</p>
      <p sl="en">If it is discovered next year that there are misappropriations, you would be the first to tell me that I knew about the cases and asking why I did not take action. Then I would say that I was thinking only of sick people. That would not be a sufficient answer.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we sort this issue out in half a year, by the summer, then we will not have made any substantial impact on the functioning of the Fund, but we will have lent greater credibility both to the fund and to the way EU taxpayers’ money is spent.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 22 by Jim Higgins (H-000013/11)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: The CE mark</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Could the Commission outline what progress has been made on strengthening the CE mark in order to promote European exports in markets like South America and Asia, as this was one of the commitments that Commissioner Tajani made upon being appointed to office?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-618-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, Mr Higgins, the CE mark is the visible part of a mechanism that is crucially important for the smooth operation of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="it">The adoption of the new legislative framework in 2008 strengthened the mark’s reliability in three ways in particular. Firstly, it strengthened control of the CE product certification system; secondly, it introduced market surveillance by national authorities, which must check the manufacturers’ declarations of conformity and the certificates issued by independent organisations that authorise the use of CE marks on products; and, thirdly, it requires the Member States to strengthen customs checks so that only products conforming to the legislation are allowed to circulate in European and world markets.</p>
      <p sl="it">By providing instruments designed to protect the CE mark, which were lacking until recently, the effective implementation of the new legislative framework strengthens the mark’s credibility and therefore enhances the reputation of products bearing the mark in the European and, consequently, the international markets. Moreover, enhanced controls on imported products will ensure that there is less abuse of the CE mark in the world market. In addition, following the explicit request made by Parliament, the Commission has successfully launched an information campaign about the mark, aimed both at economic operators, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, and at consumers.</p>
      <p sl="it">The aim of the campaign is to give interested parties, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, a better understanding of what the mark means and how the mechanism underlying it works, so that they can implement the rules on marking properly and defend themselves better in court in cases of counterfeiting or dangerous products. That will make European products more competitive.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our agreements and talks with third countries, including Mercosur and Latin America, particularly Argentina, are designed to promote the regulatory and technical model underlying the CE mark. During my contacts with that part of the world, I intend to clarify these points and, of course, to push for the solutions that we have agreed to implement. I will be in Latin America in the spring, and this subject will also be on the agenda of the meetings I will have with government representatives in the countries I am to visit: Brazil, Argentina and Chile.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, I reaffirm my commitment to work closely with you to ensure that the mechanism underlying the CE mark operates properly and that the Member States comply with the obligations aimed at making our products more competitive. I will, of course, keep you regularly informed about developments in this field, and let me remind you that the Commission will re-examine the situation and submit a report to Parliament in 2013, as required by Regulation (EC) No 765/2008.</p>

      <p sl="en">I want to thank the Commissioner for his reply. I think the concept is very good. It is consumer-focused, it is about reputation, and the reliability of goods produced within the EU. But I cannot find any information from Eurostat, for example, as to how much this symbol is worth to European business, or what percentage of Europeans actually know what the CE does.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I believe that we should be exploiting it more. In April 2010 at the Hanover Fair, there was a major campaign to promote the CE mark, but we are not exploiting it enough. It needs a far more concerted effort, as the potential is absolutely huge.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, since you mentioned the European Union’s competitiveness and because I welcome the efforts you are making to develop a European Union industrial policy, I would like to ask you the following: what percentage of products available in the European market carry the CE mark and what percentage of products available in the European internal market are manufactured in China?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-621-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, I am grateful that a number of problems have been highlighted which are also the focus of our attention, because the honest truth is that products imported legally or illegally from outside the European Union are often counterfeit. Unfortunately, however, neither the Commission nor the Union’s institutions have customs agencies or police forces to check imports, so we have to trust the checks carried out by the various Member States when products bearing this mark enter the EU and are placed on the market.</p>
      <p sl="it">Later, I will explain the details in order to answer Mr Higgins’s supplementary question, but I must make it clear that we have launched an information campaign designed not only to promote the CE mark, but also to ensure that the products are more guaranteed, by checking for counterfeit goods.</p>
      <p sl="it">The suggestion of visiting the port of Rotterdam, which is where most toys arrive, is an idea that I have been nursing. I will probably go there myself in order to signal the fact that the Commission is focusing on checking products from outside the European Union that are coming in through one of its major ports.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree with the point that use of the CE mark needs to be encouraged. We are in the early stages, and I believe we should continue down this path. That is the purpose of the information campaign, which is also the result of a request made by Parliament. We achieved a lot when I was still a Member of the European Parliament by insisting on the need for the EU to have a mark that would primarily guarantee compliance with EU regulations. In fact, we should not forget that the CE mark is not a European quality mark, but it just means that certain EU rules have been complied with – a kind of self-certification, therefore, or third-party certification.</p>
      <p sl="it">Some Members of this House hope that the CE mark will be followed by a quality mark and, in fact, Parliament pressed me on this at the hearing a year ago, when I put forward my candidacy for the Commission. I am certainly not against the idea, but I think we first need to encourage and increase the use of the CE mark by means of the information campaign within the EU. Even more needs to be done, and in the next stage, we need to think about further new initiatives. First of all, however, we must ensure that the CE mark becomes common practice for all EU companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which probably require more information.</p>
      <p sl="it">I assure you that I am committed to ever better information. I am delighted that there are debates and questions like these – and I thank Mr Higgins for them – because they spur on the debate through the work of the European Parliament and of its individual Members and the work of both the Commissioner and the representative offices of the Commission and Parliament in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is vital to inform the individual Member States and business organisations of the importance of using this instrument, just as it is crucial – and I have already emphasised this in my speech – to put pressure on the Member States to maintain strict vigilance, both at the borders and within the market, in order to stamp out, or at least to try to curtail, the problem of counterfeiting and the unlawful use of the CE mark, for the sake of protecting our products and ensuring compliance with EU laws, which, above all, defend the interests of consumers.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 23 by Georgios Papanikolaou (H-000015/11)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Uneven environment for growth and development in Member States</p>
      <p sl="unknown">One of the key priorities of the ‘Europe 2020’ strategy is to support entrepreneurship through policies aimed at promoting growth and improving the business climate, in particular, for SMEs. Nevertheless, among Member States there is a very uneven business environment since, in many of them, setting up a new business involves a lot of red tape and high costs: this discourages entrepreneurship. Moreover, the economic crisis has exacerbated the problem and is creating a map of the EU characterised by disparities as regards entrepreneurship and thus growth.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does the Commission consider that the objective of business growth set out in the ‘Europe 2020’ strategy is realistic and can be achieved within the next decade in all Member States, given the existence of these disparities?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Will it recommend that Member States adopt specific policies and a common framework for addressing the problems which deter entrepreneurship?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Question 24 by Brian Crowley (H-000042/11)</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Entrepreneurship in countries implementing austerity measures</p>

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-623-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, I will try to be succinct, as I was when I was a Member of the European Parliament. We are dealing with issues of great interest, above all, the Commission’s willingness to support entrepreneurship and to improve the context in which businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), operate, while supporting them in gaining access to third-country markets. I regard these three topics as a priority.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why the Small Business Act for Europe, adopted by the Commission in 2008, is to be revised in the coming days. The principles and provisions of the Small Business Act are perfectly consistent with the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy, and they are sure to be implemented at national level because all interested parties support them. In other words, everyone – Member States and business organisations alike – will be involved in monitoring the results obtained.</p>
      <p sl="it">We intend to ensure that the principles warmly supported in the Small Business Act, which are designed to promote entrepreneurship and eradicate the practice of always ‘thinking small’ when drawing up policies, will be implemented at both Union and national levels.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have already introduced a test for SMEs which is designed to take into greater account the procedure used in assessing the impact of the various policies and obligations that constrain SMEs. The revised Small Business Act will include measures to harmonise the use of this test and improve the quality of the assessments. In addition, all Member States will be encouraged to take the same approach in the procedures making up the national decision-making process.</p>
      <p sl="it">As we are aware of the need to cut red tape and eliminate disparities between countries, we will indicate specific measures – such as setting up one-stop shops and the use of e-government – to try to speed up processes in this area. The Commission is also organising the exchange of best practices among national civil servants on specific topics.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to stimulate entrepreneurship among young people and encourage cross-border commercial cooperation in Europe, again at Parliament’s instigation, we have set up an Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs, the results of which have been positive. It is our intention, therefore, to try to give the project a legal basis, transforming it from a pilot action into a permanent programme.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have also planned actions specifically targeting women entrepreneurs: we have a network now comprising 250 female ambassadors from 22 European countries. I hope this network can grow even stronger. Lastly, we are working to create mentoring programmes for women entrepreneurs in at least 12 EU countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards assistance to SMEs for exports and investments outside the Union, we launched a huge public consultation exercise at the beginning of last year on our intention to strengthen support measures. The results of the exercise will enable us to adjust the proposed guidelines aimed at strengthening SME support services while, at the same time, ensuring efficient use of public funds.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have already gained plenty of experience in terms of helping SMEs become international. I am referring to projects that have enjoyed considerable success, such as the China Intellectual Property Rights SME Helpdesk, the EU-Japan Centre for Industrial Cooperation, the Enterprise Europe network, and training programmes. In addition, based on the results of a study funded by Parliament, we are preparing a communication on strengthening support for SMEs in third-country markets.</p>
      <p sl="it">With regard to emerging economies such as China, I can confirm that in the framework of the Small Business Act, the Commission has used the funds allocated by Parliament for the preparatory work, which has enabled us to set up SME assistance and support centres in China and India. I myself was in Beijing last November at the opening of the Centre for European Union SMEs in China.</p>
      <p sl="it">I can also tell you that tomorrow, the Commission is appointing a new Special Envoy for SMEs, Daniel Calleja Crespo, Deputy Director General for Enterprise and Industry, who will be responsible for closely monitoring the implementation of the Small Business Act and acting as a contact point for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission document currently being adopted invites all the Member States and local authorities to appoint an Envoy for SMEs to supervise the implementation of the Small Business Act within the regions of the European Union. I am pleased to tell you that I have already received positive replies from a number of Member States and several EU regions.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, thank you very much for what you said, Commissioner; this is all very ambitious. However, to go back a bit, the Competitiveness Council called on the Member States in December 2008 to reduce company start-up times to a maximum of three days and, of course, the Commission promised to monitor that development.</p>
      <p sl="el">Three years later, and in the midst of an economic crisis, we see that it takes 15 days to incorporate a company in Greece, 11 days in Austria, 8 days in Finland and, in Belgium, just a day and a half. In other words, there are huge discrepancies.</p>
      <p sl="el">My question is this: as we all agree that entrepreneurship is a prerequisite to growth, how can the Commission move from simply urging to putting serious pressure on governments, so that we can harmonise the procedures?</p>

      <p sl="en">First of all, with regard to the China helpdesk. Whilst a wonderful idea, SMEs find it very difficult to get access for the sectors that they are specifically involved in. It seems to be more suited to larger-scale enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the one-stop shop idea, which is already in use internally within the EU, could be put to better use in the BRIC countries – that is Brazil, Russia, India and China – to increase the amount of exports and outward investment that European companies can make.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly and finally, the model that has worked best so far has been the EU-Japan relationship. That has worked best for trade and investment in both areas. Perhaps that should be the standard to be followed.</p>

      <p sl="en">I suppose my question is a slightly difficult one, in that it relates to countries that are implementing severe austerity measures like my own, Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the bottom line: SMEs need access to credit and they are not getting that for a number of reasons, perhaps because banks are looking for more collateral than they can provide, or sometimes, SMEs just do not want to risk borrowing in the current climate when there is no growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">My question is, in that context, could the Commission endorse other measures such as loan-guarantee schemes or, indeed, an extension of the EU microfinance facility?</p>

    <intervention id="2-627-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, honourable Members, I am really delighted that the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises is at the heart of parliamentary debate for the second day in a row. Yesterday evening, we looked at the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) as well as how to help small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-enterprises to access EU financing in the context of the forthcoming Eighth Framework Programme. We also noted what we have already done and what we are currently doing for this category of enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="it">As I said in my speech – and as I also stated yesterday evening – I think that supporting small and medium-sized enterprises is a priority for a number of reasons. First of all, we cannot but consider small and medium-sized enterprises as an essential tool for recovering from the current crisis. Through the Europe 2020 document, we put the real economy back at the heart of economic policy. Small and medium-sized enterprises are the lifeblood of our real economy and, above all, moving forward, I think that SMEs can also play a crucial social role because they are the ones that will create new jobs in the European Union, even while big industrial corporations are undergoing restructuring.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore need to create the conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises to be competitive. Competitiveness is another word for innovation, and to be innovative, we need to help SMEs to access credit. Thanks to the support of the European Parliament, we have adopted the directive on late payments by public authorities and in business-to-business transactions, which falls under the Small Business Act. This is a fantastic result and I hope that the Member States implement this directive, which is now binding for the whole European Union, within 24 months from last October and perhaps even before the final deadline. This will inject around EUR 180 billion of liquidity into the market, to the benefit of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is not all. I have also created the SME Finance Forum, as noted in Parliament’s report on policies for SMEs and the CIP. This is a new creation of the Commission, where we will examine the difficulties involved in accessing credit and formulate solutions to these problems. It is not by chance that we have convinced the London Stock Exchange to take part in this initiative for the first time. This is a strong signal from Great Britain too, which is tantamount to powerful support for small and medium-sized enterprises from the world of finance. Therefore, the financial economy is working to support and serve the real economy, which I think is an important sign. I will take steps to continue supporting the work of the SME Finance Forum in terms of access to credit and will also identify all available initiatives, including cross-border venture capital and the attempt to ease the ‘bottlenecks’ between the European Investment Bank and domestic credit institutions, which are the ones that grant the financing in the end.</p>
      <p sl="it">What should we do to make it easier to access EU financing? We are currently working on the forthcoming Eighth Framework Programme and a number of victories have been won for SMEs. I will repeat what I said yesterday evening because I do not know if the honourable Members here this evening were also here yesterday: regarding the Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), I have cut back registration taxes to 60% for SMEs and 90% for micro-enterprises. I also made sure that the rules for the implementation of the REACH Regulation were translated into all the languages of the European Union. SMEs are therefore seeing signs of real support from this direction as well. It is our intention to do the same for micro-enterprises in the construction sector, too.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have held quite a number of meetings on microcredit as well. I also examined the issue carefully during a meeting held two weeks ago in Brussels with the representative of the Italian Government’s new microcredit organisation, which looks like a well-run example. I hope to be able to spread knowledge of the best practices of the various Member States in this sector, so that they can be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="it">In terms of the disparities in the time needed for authorisation, this is a real problem. There is no doubt that we must exert pressure on the Member States to cut red tape. Much is made of European bureaucracy – which certainly has its own burdens – but sometimes bureaucracy in the Member States runs it pretty close. In any case, I think that it is in the interest of citizens to streamline procedures. When we say that we should ‘think small’, we need to make sure that the Member States also apply this test, just as the Commission has begun to. The presentation of the review of the Small Business Act in the various European capital cities will also provide a chance to urge the Member States to reduce the time required to issue authorisations for the creation of SMEs.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 30 by Vilija Blinkeviciute (H-000019/11)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Commission’s equal opportunities strategy</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 17 December 2010, the Commission launched a new equal opportunities strategy for the period to 2014, in which it set new targets for the number of women in senior and middle management positions and for the recruitment of women to administrator (AD) posts in the Commission’s directorates-general, departments and services.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The new equal opportunities strategy will thus seek to guarantee equal opportunities for men and women working at the Commission, but does not extend to the EU’s other institutions and agencies. Will the Commission’s equal opportunities strategy affect women working in other EU institutions? Does the Commission see a need to draw up a common strategy on equal opportunities, in order to guarantee equal opportunities for men and women working in other European agencies and institutions as well? Gender equality and equal opportunities are fundamental EU principles and should therefore apply universally, without exception, to all EU workers.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-629-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maroš Šefčovič" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I am very happy to have received this question, because I have good news to report. Since 1 January, there have, for the first time, actually been more women than men working for the Commission. We are very proud of this result, but we know that this is not the end of it. We still need to continue with our policy of also improving the figures for our female colleagues in managerial positions and non-managerial posts (AD) in the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">We therefore adopted this strategy from 2010 to 2014, until the end of this Commission’s mandate. We really would like to achieve a result where women would represent 25% of senior management positions, 30% of middle management and 43% of AD non-management posts. We have already achieved quite a lot over the last 15 years with the tremendous increase of women in managerial positions. We would, of course, like to continue with this same effort. The method we are going to use would be that retirements would be replaced with women, who would represent 30% of recruitment among senior management and 50% among middle managers and ADs. So that means that when these managers retire, 30% or 50% of them should be replaced by women.</p>
      <p sl="en">In answer to your question, I checked the situation in other institutions and I must say that you are doing quite well in Parliament. The figures are very impressive. It is not quite the same in the case of the Council, though to be honest, we have slightly different results. But I think that the best method to progress further would be if we continued with our policy of exchanging best practice, and in exchanging experience about the implementation of our policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that our heads of administration, our secretaries-general, are discussing this issue on a regular basis also, and I believe that this exchange of good practice will lead to the appropriate results in all EU institutions.</p>

How much time do you think the European Commission would need for the percentage of women in management positions to reach not 25%, not 42%, but 50%? How long do you think that would take? You said that you will only have achieved this by the end of your mandate.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Nevertheless, you did not answer my question very clearly. As a Commissioner, what is your view of the European Union institutions’ equal opportunities strategy?

      <p sl="en">Thank you very much for your supplementary questions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with you that the figures you mentioned might not seem as ambitious as you would like them to be in the future, but the truth is that since we started with equal opportunity policies within the Commission in 1995, we have managed to increase the presence of women in top positions fivefold. This means that now there are five times as many women in these positions than before. Of course, we have to look at the baseline. I agree with you that it was very low. We also have to compare in what kind of environment in Europe we are operating.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is also part of the response to the second question, namely, that policies for creating these conditions for women, not only in the EU institutions but also in the Member States, must still be improved. First, we need to create suitable conditions for women so that they can actually work in these high positions, which means adequate childcare, adequate working facilities, flexitime and other conditions which actually allow women to be in these high positions. Of course, these conditions are being created gradually. I think we have achieved quite high standards in the European institutions and you can see the various levels at which these conditions have been secured among the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, my colleague, Vice-President Reding, is now proposing a strategy which will be called gender balance in business leadership. So far, this is a staff working document, which will be discussed with business leaders in two months’ time, and then the public consultations will start. What are the lessons to be learned in this process? Should we go through an obligatory quota system? Should we go for the system we have in the Commission, where we are trying to create a conducive environment and managerial incentives for those DGs which can actually fulfil the goals established for women? I think that after that, we will see appropriate results.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for inviting me to speak on Albania this evening. Although on the European mainland, Albania was isolated for a large part of the 20th century. However, Albania is now open and accessible. It has become a country with a European perspective.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, Albania is in political crisis. The developments in Tirana on Friday, 21 January 2011, were tragic. The increasingly bitter political stalemate has resulted in four needless deaths. The tone in Tirana needs to change. The dangerous downward spiral must end. The political crisis must be resolved. This is the shared responsibility of the political leaders in Albania.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is what the citizens of Albania expect, and they are right. Democratically elected representatives must act as such: represent the people and find democratic compromise.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the solution to the crisis lies in domestic hands, we as outsiders must do all we can to help facilitate such a solution. The External Action Service managing director, Miroslav Lajčák, visited Tirana twice to meet the President, the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition, and I am happy he has joined me today.</p>
      <p sl="en">His messages on behalf of the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Cathy Ashton, and myself were clear: first, stop the violence and investigate the events of 21 January correctly. These investigations should be conducted by the judicial authorities without political interference.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, stop the verbal abuse and the implicit and explicit undermining of State institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, get the political dialogue back on track: acknowledge that you have a shared responsibility to secure a more positive future for Albania. In the near future, this means jointly ensuring the conduct of free, fair and transparent local elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourth, begin the important task of implementing the 12 priorities outlined in the 2010 Commission opinion. The government and opposition must do it together.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reactions of the political leaders and the general public to Miroslav Lajčák’s visit were encouraging and positive respectively. There is some momentum which can, and should, be used to turn the crisis into opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The two Albanian leaders welcome the attention given to them, but they are stuck in their own internal impasse, and European Union goodwill and assistance cannot replace dialogue between the leaders.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can help to bridge the gap through our active engagement. However, we cannot do so before both sides signal a genuine willingness to put the European future of Albania above party politics and personal mistrust.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no place for cherry-picking. Albania must meet all the Copenhagen criteria, including interactive political dialogue and a functioning Parliament – or nothing.</p>
      <p sl="en">The following is on the table for Albania: an EU perspective in line with the Council conclusions and based on the Copenhagen criteria; a clear identification in the 2010 Commission opinion of the 12 priorities whose effective implementation would enable Albania to begin accession negotiations with the European Union. These 12 priorities include, among others, improving the functioning of democratic institutions and the political dialogue, the rule of law and reform of the judiciary, the fight against organised crime and the protection of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">These 12 priorities and the Copenhagen criteria are not just an exercise for politicians. Rather, they bring clear, measurable benefits for citizens. Albania’s politicians urgently need to put the interests of Albania’s citizens first.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us turn these priorities into a European framework to address the current political challenges in Albania. For this reason, I sent a letter to Prime Minister Berisha one week before the January demonstrations, in which I set out a road map based on these 12 priorities, to help Albania emerge from the current impasse. We all witnessed the tragic events that ensued.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not too late. If we receive irreversible signals that there is a mutual willingness to use this European framework to gradually overcome the political stalemate and the recent crisis, then we will respond positively.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament also has a vital role to play. You as politicians can send a clear message to politicians. A clear united message from this House and the whole European Union with the readiness to engage would make all in Albania reflect upon the best course of action.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me use this opportunity to call on the Prime Minister of Albania, Mr Berisha, to create a truly inclusive political environment in Albania. Other political forces and civil society organisations would benefit from European integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also call on the leader of the Socialist Party, Mr Rama, to ensure that his party is a truly constructive opposition – one which enjoys the benefits but also the responsibilities of this inclusive political environment we wish to see in Albania.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Füle, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank you very much for your clear statement. I believe that it has been well received. I think that developments in the fields of democracy and the rule of law are essential requirements for the start of Albania’s accession process to the EU. This includes functioning democratic institutions which are used properly. The parliament is the place where democratic debates should take place. This is why the citizens have elected the members of the parliament. This forum cannot be replaced by events on the streets and particularly not in the way in which Mr Rama attempted to do on 21 January.</p>
      <p sl="de">I call on the socialist party to take full part in the parliamentary process and to come up with political alternatives in parliament. It is time to bring an end to the doubts about the election result. The socialist party should take responsibility for its role as parliamentary opposition. It should make use of the opportunity to produce specific proposals for the future, including in the parliamentary investigation committee. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) have produced recommendations for improving the basic conditions of elections. It is also important for the socialists to be involved in this area too. I have heard that Mr Rama agreed, while he was here in Strasbourg, to take part in the local elections on 8 May. I welcome his decision. I hope that his assurance does not involve any conditions or loopholes. Mr Rama is obviously listening to the good advice given to him by his socialist colleagues and also in the meetings with other groups.</p>
      <p sl="de">I can assure him that many people in our group are playing an active role on our behalf in Albania and support the inclusive approach referred to by Mr Füle. This has enabled us to make a joint contribution to ensuring a positive future for Albania.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we could certainly call the political situation in Albania today a stalemate. Sometimes calmer, at other times violent, this crisis has no end.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last year, this Parliament adopted a resolution calling on all domestic political players to find a negotiated political solution to the crisis and to build a minimum national consensus. This resolution was ignored by the political forces, and by the government especially. Likewise, the recommendations of the Commission and of the Council are being disregarded at this moment in time.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is inadmissible that exercising the right to rally and to protest in a country plagued by corruption be described as a coup d’état.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is inadmissible that the credibility of the State institutions – the Presidency, Public Attorney and others – be undermined by statements by the Head of Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is inadmissible that those who shoot civilian demonstrators be called heroes of the nation and promised an amnesty.</p>
      <p sl="en">New local elections will take place soon. In the present circumstances, they will be a political test for all political stakeholders. We ask Commissioner Füle and managing director Lajčák to do their best in order to assure international assistance and international monitoring of these elections in such a way as to make sure that they will be free and fair, or at least that we could assess their freedom and their fairness.</p>
      <p sl="en">We support the Commission approach, and that of Commissioner Füle in particular. We support the action by Mr Lajčák. We have to ask all political forces to bring this crisis to an end, because the alternative is the isolation of Albania and the jeopardising of its European perspectives.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I had a very interesting day today when it comes to Albania. I have spoken to the representatives of the two main political parties there. I asked both of them to share ideas on how to move the country forward and how to break the political stalemate to focus on problems affecting all citizens: fighting organised crime, ending corruption, creating employment and opportunities for the young generation.</p>
      <p sl="de">None of them was able to come up with an answer. The blame game seemed more important. It occurs to me that the political establishment in Albania is more concerned with itself than with its people. I do not have to tell you how difficult it is for us to convince our constituents to join us when we are making the case for EU enlargement. Despite resistance, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would like to see the Western Balkans become part of the territory of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We believe that the EU is a community of values which has left behind a divided past, choosing a united future. We must call on the Albanian authorities to do the same and not be suffocated by the shadows of the past, but to step into the light of the future. And let them not forget that it is their responsibility, first and foremost, to provide for the wellbeing of citizens and not to deny them a European future, because it is crystal clear that the political crisis hampers any and all progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">New elections will take place in May and the preparations are under way. They should be supported by all political parties. I welcome the suggestion that the EU should play an active role in ensuring that they are both free and fair. But democracy is a long process and it is certainly more than just ‘one man, one vote’. It requires democratic institutions, the rule of law and its strength is determined by respect for minorities. Democracy is not ‘winner takes all’.</p>
      <p sl="de">EU accession is a long journey which requires hard work and shared commitment, and the reforms Albania has made are best served by collaboration and continuing commitment to the EU process.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the crisis in Albania is nothing new. The crisis did not begin in January with the violence against the demonstrators, nor did it begin in 2009, when the Socialist Party boycotted parliament after the elections and when the hunger strike began.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This crisis is a crisis of political culture. Boycotts, hunger strikes, demonstrations, they are normal methods of doing business in Albanian politics. So are corruption, manipulation of the media and political appointments. All of that is a world away from the kind of politics we would like to see in a country which is on the road to accession.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I so, so hope that the citizens of Albania eventually get a responsible government and a responsible parliament, with politicians who will put the welfare of their citizens above their own prestige and interests. Both sides need to start to move in order to reach that stage. The government has a particular responsibility. Governments have a monopoly on violence and governments have an additional responsibility to stand above party politics, in order to do what is right for the people.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We should be able to expect this government to do everything possible to prevent the January events from happening again. We should also be able to expect it to cooperate fully with the launch of an independent inquiry into what happened in January, to clamp down on corruption within its own ranks, and to provide room for parliamentary debate. The opposition also has a responsibility. It, too, must do everything to prevent a repeat of the January violence, by cooperating fully with proper and fair elections in May and by participating in parliamentary debate, preferably on content, for once, such as the sky-high levels of unemployment in Albania.</p>
      <p sl="nl">How do you get both parties that far, though? I had every hope in November when Commissioner Füle put the ball in Albania’s court and said: no more progress until you resolve this. When that happens, we will be able to grant Albania candidate status. Unfortunately, that did not bring about any change. I am now hoping that Mr Lajčák will succeed where others have failed: that is, in bringing both parties to the table and achieving a breakthrough. I am hopeful, but I am not very confident that this will be possible without us wielding a big stick.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I think that we should hold the prospect of a sanction over them. It must be clear that failure in this negotiation effort will not be without consequences. The sanction must hit the political leaders, however, and not the citizens. That means that we must by no means tamper with Albania’s visa waiver, which is a suggestion I have heard in the corridors. We would really be harming the citizens if we did that. I would really like an assurance from the Commissioner that visa liberalisation will not be abused in this political process.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One idea we could start considering, however, is withdrawing the control of IPA funds from Albania and putting it back in the hands of the EU. That would allow all major investments in the country to go through, but the government would more or less be placed under guardianship. That seems to me to be a sanction that would hit the politicians, but not the people. I sincerely hope that all this will be unnecessary, because both sides will be willing to compromise, and that Mr Lajčák will succeed, in the interests of the Albanian people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, if Albania is to make progress towards its eventual goal of EU accession, its political leaders need to engage in a more constructive, democratic and mature way. Last month’s violence was a reminder of the inherent instability of Albanian politics.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also wonder whether the Council and Commission have considered revisiting last year’s decision to grant Albanians visa-free travel to the EU in the light of the bloodshed, which may, of course, generate more economic emigration to the Schengen area if foreign direct investment dries up.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such a step would certainly underline the fact that Albania continues to fall well short of the EU’s expectations. Organised crime and corruption still flourish and the judiciary is too often manipulated by politicians. Prime Minister Berisha even interfered with the arrest, ordered by the Prosecutor-General, of guardsmen who had shot protestors, claiming that a coup d’état was imminent. Democratic institutions are weak and press freedom is scarce.</p>
      <p sl="en">The decision by Edi Rama’s Socialist Party to boycott the parliament on the basis of alleged electoral fraud has compounded Albania’s instability. There is no way Albania can even begin to enact the reforms necessary to regain the EU’s confidence in the current political environment of instability. This instability may also now cause NATO to reconsider its own enlargement policy, Albania having joined the alliance less than two years ago. NATO leaders must now question whether Albanian membership was granted too soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">Aside from my own concerns about Albania’s political instability and how it will impact on the country’s EU aspirations, I am also sceptical about Albania’s strategic priorities. Albania is a full member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, an increasingly powerful and influential lobby in the UN promoting the interests of its members and voting as a bloc on human rights and foreign policy matters. OIC members include Albania and Turkey, both of whom are signatories to the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights, which cites sharia as the basis for human rights in Muslim countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Albania, like Turkey, must now decide between embracing western values, or whether to give primacy to those of sharia law which the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg has deemed incompatible with European values, though so far, in my view, Albania’s membership of the OIC, in fairness, seems only nominal. Albania is, after all, a secular country in practice. It seems to have been designed by the Albanian leadership that they join the OIC in order to attract Middle Eastern money, rather than based on any strong religious convictions, but, of course, this could all change in the future.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, I had hoped that, eighteen months after the last parliamentary elections in Albania, the political impasse would have been resolved. I had hoped, following the recommendations made and the resolution adopted by the European Parliament, that what we were saying would be borne in mind. I was convinced that Albania’s hopes of European integration would act as a strong incentive – as that is what the Albanian people want – to resolve not only the political problem, but also the economic, social and democratic problems. Unfortunately, the impasse persists. As to who bears the lion’s share of responsibility, I believe that it is not our job here to judge the Albanian people.</p>
      <p sl="el">Unfortunately, however, things have got worse. Once again, I would like to express my sorrow for the victims of the demonstration on 21 January. We are opposed to the escalation of violence; we call for repression to stop, for human and democratic rights to be respected, and for those responsible to be punished.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I will not conceal the fact that I am concerned about the imminent local elections in May. We simply must do whatever we can to ensure that all the necessary safeguards are in place for them to proceed smoothly. We must persuade all the political forces to participate in this election procedure and these elections must be held on the basis of international rules for proper, democratic elections.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe that our help, help from the European Parliament and the European Union in general – and I agree here with Mr Füle – must be supplementary, must be auxiliary and, obviously, must not be coloured by party affiliations and political friendships (if you will pardon the expression). It will not be for us to provide the solution to Albanian society and to the Albanian problem. This must be dealt with by the Albanian people, by the political forces in Albania. I do not agree with the thoughts voiced about threats to take measures, when most of the measures we have heard about are measures against the Albanian people. I do not think that this will bring about any particular result.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe that we can exert the greatest possible pressure through the EU institutions, within the framework of relations with a country which is knocking at the door of the European Union, by stressing that, unfortunately, all these procedures are delaying its accession prospects. We must point out that the impasse will only be resolved by a responsible stand on the part of the political leaders, with a readiness for political dialogue and not, as we have heard, with a ‘winner takes all’ attitude and similar practices and conduct.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe that, if the political leaders in Albania insist on this sort of practice and this sort of approach, the impasse and the crisis will get worse, making it impossible for the country to address serious problems in addition to the political problem: problems that will arise – if they have not already arisen – from the economic crisis which has hit the neighbouring countries of Italy and Greece, given that money sent from these countries is, to a degree, helping the economic situation in Albania. Consequently, a solution to the political impasse, political responsibility and political dialogue are what will help the political leaders find a rapid solution to the problems facing Albania.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I visited Albania as a journalist on several occasions in the 1990s. Each time, I was impressed by the talented young people I met there. Surely, a country with young people like that must have a future. Last summer, my faith in Albania’s European prospects was renewed during a summer school in southern Vlorë County.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This morning, I exchanged emails with a couple of Albanian academics about this evening’s debate. They are both in their thirties and they have both decided to stay in Albania: they could earn much more abroad, but they are staying. They want to be of service to their own people and to their church. However, what can they do about the political impasse in their home country? In both cases, their message is clear, and it is a cry for help: ‘Europe, do not leave our political leaders to their own devices. Because, if you do, they will destroy our nation’s future. Europe, force both parties, the socialists and the democrats, to negotiate until they reach a solution’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, I will be the first one to admit that this is easier said than done, but theirs was a cry for help, nonetheless. However, I am confident that you will want to do your best to fulfil the hope that many upstanding Albanian citizens have placed in Europe and in you, as the Commissioner responsible. I wish you a great deal of strength and success in this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To conclude, there is another, equally important Albanian issue which I would like to raise. An informant in Tirana has alerted me to the danger that, this spring, a large number of Albanian girls and women are going to travel to Western Europe and end up in prostitution rings. Do you share this concern, Commissioner, and what resources does the European Union have at its disposal to take preventive action against the trafficking of women and the grooming of girls for prostitution in Albania?</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the political life of Albania has been at an impasse since the parliamentary elections in 2009. The parliament cannot exercise its supervisory role over the government, and parliamentary institutions are, unfortunately, not operating effectively. The fact that the socialists are accusing the government of electoral fraud and corruption, demanding its resignation and early elections before those due in 2013, as well as the fact that Prime Minister Berisha is unwilling to resign and is accusing the opposition of attempting to come into power by force, indicate that negotiations with the European Union are doomed to fail very quickly.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The European Union considers it vital for candidate countries to step up their efforts in the fight against corruption and organised crime. This is not only important for the EU, but is also beneficial for the society of the countries concerned, not to mention that it can contribute to the improvement of the image of the candidate countries. For this reason, the settlement of the current situation will definitely require the restoration of democratic institutions.</p>

      <p sl="en">We should not allow this political crisis and tensions to go any further. What we need now is to send a common message that we want to have Albania as a candidate country, but political leaders on both sides must show the will to solve political problems in full respect for the rule of law, the constitution and on the foundation of democratic institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have tried for too long to help find a solution to the situation without any tangible results.

I would also like to thank Mr Lajčák for the dedication that he has shown over recent months. He is used to addressing and resolving tricky problems. I wish both of them the best of luck. This debate has resulted in a united front and in joint support for the efforts of both men to find a solution for Albania.</p>
      <p sl="de">I admit that I was sceptical when this debate started. Nothing could be worse for the development of Albania than accusations being made by one side in this House against the other that are similar to those being made by the two major political groups, the government and the opposition, in Albania. I am very pleased that we have been able to agree on a joint approach, at least until now. I hope that this remains the case. Both sides, both political groups – the government and the opposition – must commit to finding a way out of this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">I agree with Mr Belder. Not long after the fall of the Hoxha regime, I went to Albania. I was very struck by the mood there and by the enthusiasm of the young people. However, I am very disappointed when I look at what has come out of this and what has not. I must say that the political class in Albania is not able to satisfy the wishes and the ideas of the people.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, we still have our political affinities and our personal friendship. However, it is crucial for us now to tell both sides that they must sit down together and attempt to ensure that the local elections at least are transparent and open. We must also call on both sides to be prepared to implement the requirements drawn up by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) for these elections, either by means of legislation or practical action, so that there will be genuinely fair and transparent elections in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also believe that Parliament should send as many election observers as possible, despite the fact that these are local elections, because the elections could represent the beginning of a new political climate in Albania. This is what Albania urgently needs.</p>
      <p sl="de">I agree with everyone who has said that if nothing changes in Albania, it will find itself in an isolated position. However, we do not want Albania to be isolated. We want it to start out on the road towards Europe.</p>

Their history is different, and their cultural traditions are different, and some of these differences have survived in the national character, the way in which it has developed, to this day, and this affects the way they perceive political processes and develop them.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Therefore, if we are going to instrumentalise the problem under discussion, we will need to show creativity, flexibility and imagination. For example, I believe that we should contact not just the leaders of the two main political parties which are at loggerheads, but also the unofficial leaders of Albanian society.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Some correct things have been said here about sharia and the Islamic Conference, but we must bear in mind that the Albanians are tolerant towards all three main religions in their country, including the Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic churches. All three of these communities have influential leaders, as do NGOs and youth. We should also be addressing these leaders in our attempts to reconcile the two political parties.</p>

I am also pleased that the debate today has not descended into squabbles between the political groups which are in conflict with one another in Albania. It would have been very regrettable for Parliament if this had happened and I hope that we do not reach this point.</p>
      <p sl="de">The institutional crisis in Albania is really also a crisis in the political culture. It is all about verbal violence that has turned into violence on the streets and resulted in four deaths. I agree with those who say that this needs to be investigated. It is important to find out who is really to blame. However, this process of verbal violence becoming actual violence on the streets is something that could put Albania’s accession to the European Union at risk.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Mr Füle has already explained, this is all about making it clear to the political opponents in Albania that their job is to act in the interests of the Albanian people. The route towards the European Union means finding a solution for this political crisis, sitting down at the same table and putting an end to the constant blame game, in which one group always blames the other and fails to recognise that it, too, can make a contribution to changing things. That is what is needed. The constant accusations about who started the situation and who is to blame have no place in a European state. I hope that the opposing parties will learn from this and realise that this situation cannot go on.</p>
      <p sl="de">If Mr Rama and his party really take part in the local elections, as he has indicated to some of us today that he will, and appoint members of the election commission, I welcome this and I hope it is a first step towards ensuring that these local elections can take place in an open and transparent form and that the results will be accepted afterwards.</p>
      <p sl="de">The parliament fully supported the liberalisation process which has already been mentioned. My request to Mr Füle is as follows: I hope that the Commission does not consider abandoning visa liberalisation for the citizens of Albania as a possible sanction against the two opposing parties. I hope that will not be the case. My other question concerns the opportunities for applying more pressure if the two parties do not come to an agreement. One option is, as Mrs Cornelissen has already said, taking responsibility for managing the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) funds away from the government and returning it to the Commission. The other possibility would be to freeze the IPA funds. However, this would cause suffering among the population, which cannot be our intention. What are your plans in the event that no solution can be reached?</p>
      <p sl="de">One last point: in the Marty report to the Council of Europe, the accusation was made that the Albanian secret service was involved or supported organ trafficking. Do you know whether the Albanian secret service and the Albanian justice system are prepared to cooperate?</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, since the 2009 general elections, there has been political tension in Albania arising from the close result of the vote, which the losing political forces have described as electoral manipulation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Albanian socialists, led by Edi Rama, accuse Prime Minister Sali Berisha not only of electoral fraud, but also of being responsible for extensive corruption and the deteriorating living conditions of the people. At a protest rally organised by the opposition in the Albania capital, Tirana, on 21 January, there were more than 20 000 demonstrators demanding the resignation of the government of Sali Berisha. However, police intervention involving water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets resulted in four deaths and more than 150 injuries. The brutality of the police intervention, as well as the fact that Sali Berisha gave all members of the security forces participating in suppressing the demonstration an extraordinary reward amounting to one month’s pay, is clear evidence of the fact that the Albanian premier is buying the favour of the security forces and trying to win their support and to set them against the Albanian people.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In decent, civilised countries, government is usually decided by the citizens, the voters, and not by bribed security forces or the police. If Mr Berisha has forgotten this elementary principle of democratic government, then in my opinion, he has no business being the leader of a democratic state. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think any of us would like to see in Europe the promotion of governments which build their power on electoral fraud and corrupt policemen, and which are represented by little dictators who do not know how to hand over power to others in the proper way in a country. We must therefore be more vigorous in defending democracy in Albania.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Füle, Mr Lajčák, ladies and gentlemen, the issue that we are discussing did not begin on 21 January. Therefore, we need to ask ourselves and I am also asking you: Why did the Commission and the other international bodies not put out the fire when the flames first appeared in mid 2009? The 2009 elections were the best that have so far taken place in Albania and they were based on election legislation which, amazingly, was adopted following a consensus between the socialists and democrats. Reaching a consensus is something entirely new in Albania. I believe that this is important. All the socialist election boards, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the election observers and we ourselves believed that the elections were managed correctly.</p>
      <p sl="de">The government which was subsequently formed was also something new for Albania. Two parties which cannot stand each other sat down and worked together. The democratic party, on the one hand, and the smaller social democratic party, on the other. Two opposing groups have come together to help Albania to make progress. It has joined NATO and it has a visa regime, but unfortunately, it has not yet been granted candidate status.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, just at the moment when the government was formed, the opposition decided that the elections had not been properly conducted and called for the ballot boxes to be opened. What sort of government opens ballot boxes? Not the sort that we have in my country or in yours. We have to go before the constitutional court or the election commission. Protests like the ones which we have seen, the hunger strikes, and the refusal to cooperate in Parliament to pass important legislation, are all simply unacceptable. It is important that we make this clear and that we face the facts. It is not always possible to bring everything onto the same level.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to find out what the most important and the most difficult issues are. The accusations that have been made both recently and right from the beginning concerned the issue of opening the ballot boxes. This is not possible, because the constitution does not allow it. How can negotiations take place about this if it is not allowed? Now the situation has escalated and four people have been killed.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is good that you have attempted today to present a road map. However, it may be exaggerating slightly to describe it in that way. I would very much like Mr Lajčák and you, Mr Füle, to use this road map to draw up a route towards a better future for the people of the country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the statement by the Commissioner. I would also like to emphasise the contribution made by Mr Lajčák in trying to identify solutions for overcoming the dramatic situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt were certainly opposed by the local dictators who finally had to leave their country – but without major violence and executions like those in Tirana as witnessed by the media. As for Prime Minister Berisha’s allegations that the demonstrations were nothing more than a coup d’état led by the Opposition, the President of Albania, the Prosecutor General and the head of the secret services – all appointed under Mr Berisha’s leadership – are these people all now Socialists or is something wrong with Mr Berisha?</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like here to quote Thomas Countryman, a Deputy Assistant Secretary at the US Department of State, who publicly rejected the hypothesis that what happened on 24 January was a coup d’état. We need to be committed and as effective as the United States and NATO right now in trying to push, assist and help the two Albanian sides reach a negotiated solution, but I also call on all my colleagues who are giving Mr Berisha their unconditional support to stop their one-sided approach. It is important to put pressure on both sides so that the two blocs finally reach a solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Up until now, only one side has shown some readiness to implement both the European Parliament resolution and the 12 proposals you mentioned before, Commissioner. I call on the Commission to be strong and committed towards an agreement based on the European Parliament resolution and the 12 conditions you mentioned before, bearing in mind that without complete agreement from both sides, Albania’s European integration process might be completely frozen.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for the road map he has set out for Albania this evening, which I endorse wholeheartedly. I am totally convinced that this country has a European future and should therefore be a candidate for accession.</p>
      <p sl="it">The bloodshed of 21 January dragged Tirana backwards by several years. It felt like we were watching the same scenes of protest and violence seen in the 1990s. I am therefore very concerned about the recent events and the short-term future of the country.</p>
      <p sl="it">During our last visit there in November 2010, in our capacity as the Delegation for South-East Europe and, on 3 and 4 May 2010, as the Stabilisation and Association Parliamentary Committee, together with other colleagues, I witnessed Albania’s difficulties with my own eyes. We did not manage to bring the negotiations to a close with a final resolution for an agreement. Is it possible that we failed to address the country’s true problems? Aside from mere political alchemy, was the true social cancer of unemployment even mentioned? We need to recover our sense of responsibility, which is what we are crying out for.</p>
      <p sl="it">On this issue, in searching for at least some convergence on basic rules from both the majority and the opposition, it is necessary to guarantee, in all possible ways, that the next round of elections is hallmarked by the highest possible level of transparency and democracy. Mayor Edi Rama will stand in elections for the district of Tirana, so we will shortly have the chance to check and assess the political situation and standard of democracy, as naturally, we shall be present there.</p>
      <p sl="it">Irrespective of the progress made by Albania in this period, Europe must never stop searching for dialogue and collaboration. I should like to thank the Commissioner for the work he has carried out and will continue to carry out, because our presence in Albania is important.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I have been following events in Albania with a great deal of concern. The tragic incidents during the demonstration held against corruption, with people killed in clashes with the security forces, must be expressly condemned.</p>
      <p sl="el">The continuing political crisis harbours very serious dangers to the stability of the country. Everyone bears their share of responsibility. However, the elected government should listen to the message being sent by the people, that the country needs sound governance. The creation of rule of law, by stamping out corruption, should be one of the Albanian government’s priorities. The people are entitled to demonstrate within the limits of the law when they feel that the government is acting against their interests.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Union must do whatever it can to help ensure that calm and caution prevail. We must all be involved in this process.</p>
      <p sl="el">I call on my fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) not to overlook the government’s serious responsibilities and blame the opposition alone for the political crisis. At this stage, I think that political dialogue should be resumed and that a solution should be found using the procedures laid down in the constitution and by law.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, when I look at what is happening in Albania, it saddens me greatly because I recall my country’s own history in the beginning of the eighties, thirty years ago that is, when Malta was facing a similar situation: deep division, tension, political rivalry, threats and even violence. It was a suffocating atmosphere that did not make me proud of my homeland. In the same way, I believe that Albanian citizens are equally saddened by their country’s current plight, and are far from proud of what is going on.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Today, I am deeply proud of my country, because we have created a stable, democratic system, and above all, we are now part of the European family. The political environment has changed drastically. My wish for Albania is the achievement of its aim of having a stable country that is part of the European family. However, it is clear that if the two main parties in the country persist in their stubbornness then this aim will never be achieved. It is a pity, but it is a reality.</p>
      <p sl="mt">The European Union is doing what it can; the Visa requirement for Albanians has now been removed. Nonetheless, Albania must also play its part, and for this to happen, then all the parties concerned, including the government and the opposition, have to adopt a different policy, one that embraces politics based on dialogue, on maturity and on responsibility towards the Albanian people; politics that do not seek to divide, but to unite.</p>
      <p sl="mt">It is not up to us to tell the Albanians and Albania what to do. We are here to tell them that the decision on whether Albania is to find its place within the European family is in their hands.</p>

Through the commitment of Commissioner Füle and others, the EU has shown that Albania does not have to face its problems alone. This is a major problem that is damaging the country’s credibility as one that is serious about drawing closer to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is not a question of who is right and who is wrong, but of the need to put the political dialogue back into the domain of the political institutions. We should not give our backing to any side as being right or wrong, and we must be extremely clear that the election in May must be a signal as to the direction Albania is going to take – towards the EU or towards continued isolation.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I share the concern expressed by my fellow Members that the situation in Albania is worrying and may have a negative impact not just on Albania itself, but the future prospects of countries throughout the entire Balkan region. At the end of last year, the European Union expressed its confidence that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina were making and could make progress initiating important reforms, and liberalised the visa regime for their citizens. However, the political unrest that began scarcely a few months later and resulted in several deaths suggests that Albania has failed this test.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This eruption of violence in Albania calls for a rethink of long-term prospects for the region’s integration, because European Union policy is concentrated on regional stability and such an approach is right. There should therefore be solidarity between the countries of the Balkan region and it should be in their common interest to maintain and promote greater regional integration and political stability.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the tense situation which developed in Albania at the end of January highlights how important it is to maintain certain boundaries in political debate. The extreme escalation of the disputes between the government and opposition has resulted in the loss of human life. I need to stress that in a democratic state, these conflicts should not go beyond parliament’s walls. The street is no place for them. The assault by organised opposition groups against the government’s building in an attempt to take power by force is a serious matter, while the ploy used by some authorities to hide those who are guilty is unacceptable. This is why I am calling on the leaders of the Albanian opposition to return to the discussion process in parliament. The elections held in 2009 were fair and it is the political parties’ duty to respect the will of the people. Compromising state institutions is not the answer for expressing one’s convictions or discontent.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to make the following observation: it is most surprising that, while growth indicators for Albania are constantly rising, with growth exceeding 2% in 2010, in the midst of global economic instability, and expected to reach 3% in 2011, social tension is, nonetheless, getting worse rather than better.</p>
      <p sl="el">Obviously, Commissioner, growth has not instilled a feeling of prosperity in the Albanian people. On the contrary, it is equally obvious that disappointment – and with it the fear of a new wave of immigration to neighbouring countries – is increasing. We experienced this very acutely in Greece in the 1990s.</p>
      <p sl="el">At this difficult juncture, therefore, Europe has a duty, in addition to giving Albania political advice, to pass on practices and examples, so that growth benefits all sections of society.</p>

Political parties play the role of warring sides and are pulling the country into a downward spiral. The explanation is that both left and right believe that political parties should rule exclusively, as the Communist Party once did.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once a polarisation of this kind has begun, it is very difficult to transform the situation into one that resembles the democratic norm, because in this context, exclusive power is completely rational, which is tragic. Is there a way out? Yes: catharsis. But only a major crisis or a grand historic compromise can bring this about.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank you for this lovely debate and, before I share with you my concluding remarks, let me address the two questions which were put during the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first one, put forward by Mr Belder, I will answer in written form, taking into account our primary focus in today’s discussion. But there was another question: whether we are considering sanctions. No we are not. Why is this? Because in issues of enlargement, conditionality works very fairly, as is clearly the case here. If you fulfil the conditions, you are allowed to proceed with accession and eventually join the European Union. If you do not fulfil the conditions and requirements, the process is slowed down and eventually stopped. Unfortunately, this is the ultimate price that is being paid not only by the politicians but also by the citizens of that respective country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The High Representative and I will continue to strive to facilitate dialogue between Albania’s majority and opposition. We have a clear idea of how to do this. We also need your support to make sure that the leaders of the main opposition party and the prime minister of Albania understand our message.</p>
      <p sl="en">This could lead the country out of the political crisis and could allow positive steps towards its integration into Europe. The European Union made a commitment to all the Western Balkan countries that they would enter the European Union. We stand by our commitment and will step up our efforts, provided the countries fulfil the criteria. Albania urgently needs to implement the 12 key priorities of the opinion.</p>
      <p sl="en">These include addressing the fundamental principles of democracy, such as the proper functioning of Parliament, separation of powers, the conduct of elections and respect for the rule of law. All of this will only be possible once the current political situation has taken a fundamental positive turn with the resumption of a full and constructive political dialogue in Parliament, respect for all State institutions and the realisation that the citizens of Albania have aspirations that require attention. The leaders of Albania must act now for the benefit of their people.</p>

      <p sl="el">The crisis under way in Albania, which is jeopardising geopolitical stability in the Balkans, is causing acute concern and alarm. The political standoff between the government and the opposition is calling Albania’s European prospects into question and President Sali Berisha has no intention of stepping down. Although few parallels can be drawn between Albania and recent developments in North Africa, what they do have in common are poverty, unemployment, a corrupt, clientelist regime and a lack of democracy. Although the crisis in Albania has been temporarily averted, we need to work closely with Albania in order to smooth out the political situation. The Commission should explain how it intends to safeguard the rights of Greeks and other minorities in Albania, through the smooth, democratic operation of the system, and to strengthen Frontex on the Greek-Albanian border, given the danger of an influx of immigrants into Greece due to the political unrest. Also, the Commission should take serious account of the fact that Albanian nationals no longer require a visa to travel to Turkey, which makes it easier to breach the southern borders of Europe from there, starting with Greece as the first port of call, followed by the rest of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me stress that EU law protects the confidentiality of electronic communications. It prohibits listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communications without the consent of the users concerned. Apart from the legally authorised recording of certain communications in the course of lawful business practice such as commercial transactions, further interception practice, such as wiretapping, is subject to specific conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The conditions for exceptional interception practice must be provided by legislation and be necessary, appropriate and proportionate within a democratic society to safeguard public objectives, such as public security or combating criminal offences.</p>
      <p sl="en">The general principles of EU law must also be respected. For the Commission, Bulgarian legislation seems to comply with these requirements. The Law on Special Investigative Means and the Law on Electronic Communications already provide appropriate mechanisms for legal authorisation, oversight, handling and access to personal data, and thus ensure respect of fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issue at stake here concerns the enforcement of legal obligations. It is the responsibility of the Bulgarian authorities to ensure that legal and procedural guarantees enshrined in the Bulgarian legislation on Special Investigative Means are respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission highlights the necessity for Member States to respect fundamental rights and procedural guarantees in compliance with the rule of law when implementing EU law. The Commission understands that the Bulgarian authorities took the necessary steps to check the legality of the deployment of Special Investigative Means and to establish whether the information published in the press resulted from abusive use of Special Investigative Means.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, while not having received any related complaints on the interception of electronic communications in Bulgaria, will continue to monitor the current situation with a view to ensuring compliance with EU law.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very surprised by this debate, which was not even raised in the competent committee, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, before it came here.</p>
      <p sl="en">The measure which is being attacked in this debate is a legitimate legal instrument which can be used in the fight against crime. If anything, it is proof that Bulgaria is serious in taking up the great challenge of fighting corruption and organised crime, which is something we have long asked it to do. The measures foreseen in the law can be exercised in a legitimate manner and we expect them to be exercised in a legitimate manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">The law foresees that phone tapping can only be requested by public prosecutors or by law enforcement agencies, such as the police and the national security agency, if they suspect that the person in question is involved in criminal activity and after there is authorisation by a judge.</p>
      <p sl="en">The law on the use of special intelligence lays down a purpose limitation, stipulating that these measures can only be used for the purpose of fighting organised crime or for protecting national security. The information collected must be kept confidential and must only be used for the purposes outlined in the law. There is also established parliamentary scrutiny of this legal system. So it is clear that there are safeguards, especially safeguards on the privacy of citizens and respect of data protection, and there is no question, as I see it, of it being in breach of the law. Therefore, attacking this instrument at this point would be tantamount to an irresponsible attack against the effort of a Member State to try to fight organised crime and corruption.</p>
      <p sl="en">This attack damages Bulgaria greatly, as this fight is of utmost importance for this country in the light of its cooperation and verification mechanism and also of its prospective entry into the Schengen area. The only plausible explanation for this debate therefore seems to be that it is politically motivated.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am very happy that Bulgaria is now a Member State, but I am very disappointed at some of the measures taken by the present Bulgarian Government. Yes, we fully support the fight against corruption. This is a very important fight, and we fully support what the Commission has said that there must be laws in Bulgaria concerning videotaping and interception.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commissioner was very careful. He said it seems to comply with European standards and he said very clearly that the measures must be proportionate. Is it proportionate when, all of a sudden, in a timeframe of three years, interception grows from 6 000 in 2008 to 16 000 in 2010? Is it proportionate and fair that only 2% of the videotaping is going to the courts and is used for 1% of convictions?</p>
      <p sl="en">Is it proportionate and fair that the proceedings are filtered by the Ministry of the Interior? Why is everything not given to the judicial authorities? Why is it filtered by the Ministry of the Interior? What does the Ministry of the Interior do with what is coming in? I would like to ask the Commission to look into its monitoring process regarding what is happening to the rest of the data.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are also reports in the Parliament in Sofia and in the media in Bulgaria that there are serious doubts that the Ministry of the Interior can protect the information. We have already seen leakage of the information.</p>
      <p sl="en">You mentioned Schengen and, yes, we want the Schengen border extended. It now includes Bulgaria and Romania, but when we see what is happening here, you cannot be surprised that some in Europe are critical about this enlargement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would ask the Commissioner to do his job, as he did, and ask the Bulgarian Government to stop this kind of wrong implementation and wrong law enforcement tending towards a very restrictive practice concerning these interceptions. Be fair, be open, be transparent and stop violations of this kind of the spirit of European laws.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for your very careful statement. Those in this Parliament who know me and know the 12 years I have spent here will know that I intervene in such debates with a great reticence. But over a year ago, as a Vice-President of this Parliament, I was asked to visit Bulgaria to speak about the Stockholm Programme for Justice.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is clear that our programme for justice has moved from an emphasis on security to an emphasis on justice, and all of us in our Member States have to get that balance right. I remember from my visit to Bulgaria the great interest of Bulgarian judges in what we are doing and want to pursue at Union level. But I was surprised last week to receive a visitor in my office in Brussels who spoke about people in Bulgaria receiving visits from the secret service in their homes at night. This is something that is totally alien to me and I find it very difficult to understand and to stand here saying this.</p>
      <p sl="de">That said, it seems to me, as Mr Swoboda has already said, that the current legislation that exists on phone tapping – let us call it what it is – appears to be correct. Where there was formerly scrutiny by an independent body, there is now scrutiny by a parliamentary body. Has that led to a lessening of the regard for rights? There does seem to be an increase in the numbers and an increase in the numbers seems to indicate, and I underline ‘seems’, that there is an easier or a quicker granting by judges of this possibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">Part of the reason I want to speak is a linked matter which relates to the citizen’s initiative. It appears that people feel that they are being pressurised to withdraw signatures. We have to implement the European Citizens’ Initiative over the course of the next year. I would ask the Commission to watch this space very carefully.</p>

The Bulgarian premier has even announced that the highest representatives of the State are also constantly bugged by the secret service. Apparently, this is for the fight against corruption and organised crime. Well, it does not often happen that a Head of Government admits that he has such great faith in his closest colleagues that he has to have them bugged so that they do not surrender to the temptation of corruption or collaborating with organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In any case, there is a peculiar situation in this area in Bulgaria, and I think it would be good to assist our Bulgarian friends in sorting matters out regarding the application of the relevant legislation.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, in Bulgaria, we have a saying for what we are witnessing in the current debate: ‘the thief who cries ‘thief!’’. When the tripartite coalition was in power, the services were infiltrated by the mafia, with the toxic results that we now see.</p>
      <p sl="bg">When the coalition was in power, I myself was beaten by the police during an opposition protest. Afterwards, these wolves in sheep’s clothing, who now present themselves to you as fighters against a police state, amended the law by virtue of which the case against my assailants has been pending in the court for three years now. During your rule, socialists and royalists, the police attacked peaceful demonstrators, but now you are stirring up a fuss about infringements of civil liberties.</p>
      <p sl="bg">When you were in power, the journalist Ognyan Stefanov was beaten to death, and now you complain of censorship. While you were in power, kidnappings were a daily occurrence. The mafia was all-powerful, while citizens had no rights. The courts were bought and sold. When you were in power, wheeler-dealing and selling off national assets became models of rule.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Now you are up to your old tricks again, trying to stop Bulgaria joining Schengen in the hope that you can blame the sins of your criminal rule on others. However, it will not work, because the voters are not blind. They swept you from power, threw you on to the political scrapheap, and no iniquity that you may dream up will change this fact.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, every debate in the European Parliament reflects the interests of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Today’s debate, however, can serve as a good example of how the European scene can become a tool for selfish, national political interests. Every time the European agenda is subverted by a national agenda, this cannot be interpreted as a position of national responsibility but as being in conflict with the values for which Bulgarian citizens voted their representatives into the European Parliament. Would they recognise themselves in this debate? I doubt it.</p>
      <p sl="bg">My fellow MEPs are undoubtedly right when they say that the Bulgarian public must know what is going on in its own country and whether its constitutional rights are being observed. However, there is a limit beyond which democratic institutions are ignored to protect the interest of dubious interest groups whose purpose is clear: to discredit Bulgaria on its road to Europe and to discredit the government of GERB in its attempts to put an end to shady practices that have been allowed to build up for many years. I would like to draw your attention to some of the things my fellow Members have expressed.</p>
      <p sl="bg">First of all, the assertion that the number of cases of eavesdropping has doubled. The official figures are completely different. They are publicly available to anyone who cares about the truth. However, I would like to ask a question. Since when has this information been transparent? There is only one answer: thanks to the GERB government, which regards transparency and free access by citizens to State information as a fundamental principle.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Secondly, the assertion that closing the bureau set up to control eavesdropping devices in Bulgaria has put an end to legal control over their use is completely unfounded. I would like to remind you that this bureau never has worked properly, particularly as the original idea for it came from the executive authorities. You do not need reminding that Bulgaria is a parliamentary republic, and the special sub-committee for parliamentary control and monitoring of the procedures for authorising, applying and using eavesdropping devices was set up within the very framework of respect for democratic institutions and the constitution.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I would also like to remind you that all political parties are represented on the sub-committee and represented according to the principle of parity. Furthermore, the ruling party is not entitled to chair the committee. All of this shows that the Bulgarian legislator has incorporated absolute guarantees for carrying out such lawful activities, and these are backed up by reliable controls. Changing the status quo is difficult; building something positive is even more so. Most difficult, however, is when some of our country’s representatives come to the most democratic institution of Europe to embroil themselves in internal polemics whose aims are far removed from those we uphold here every day.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is always uncomfortable when any Member State has its internal situation scrutinised. I want to say, in the same spirit that Mrs Wallis indicated, that my own government in the United Kingdom was investigated for its operation of rendition – taking people to be tortured allegedly. This, of course, was very uncomfortable for me and for my government in the United Kingdom, but I took part actively in that investigation because it was necessary to do it in a European-wide way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why? And why are we here today discussing the internal interception arrangements of the Bulgarian Government? Not because of Bulgaria, but because we are a community of values. As a community of values, the issue is that raised by the Commissioner – I quote, ‘that interception must be used exceptionally’. While not a great lawyer like Mrs Wallis, I am a lawyer, and I know that you must only use interception exceptionally. It is one of those things which, if used in an unnecessary, inappropriate or disproportionate way, instead of becoming an aid to the attack on organised crime, which is very important in Bulgaria and elsewhere in the European Union, becomes a weapon of the state.</p>
      <p sl="en">It does not matter which political party is originating this debate, to move from discussing an attack on organised crime to using an instrument of the State disproportionately is a very serious matter for the European Union and it is not exclusive today to Bulgaria. Tomorrow, it may be another Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">I genuinely looked into all the sources and figures, and I would ask colleagues across the parties in this House: is there anyone who is saying that an inappropriate or disproportionate use of interception was or was not used? If you want to dispute the figures used by Mr Swoboda, is anyone disputing that a disproportionate use of interception has happened? I have looked at many sources before speaking today, because we have to speak carefully about such issues. I have not seen anyone on any side of the debate saying disproportionate use has not happened.</p>
      <p sl="en">For that reason, the Commission must investigate this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as an Italian citizen, I am certainly not against wiretapping when it is used legally. In Italy, it is very useful for combating the Mafia and recently, it has been used to incriminate President Berlusconi for the alleged crimes of bribery and underage prostitution.</p>
      <p sl="it">The case of the Bulgarian Government appears to be completely different, since it seems that it was using wiretapping to criminalise the opposition, causing widespread fear in complex societal organisations and attempting to link the opposition to common criminals –which allows it to act with no respect for human rights and to install a police state. Situations like this can only lead to further social violence.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Piebalgs, I have followed this debate and the debate on Albania very closely. What a difference! In that debate, efforts were made to maintain a polite, friendly tone across party boundaries. Here, insinuations have been made which are completely unproven. There, the aim was to bring the two major parties together. Here, the objective of one of them is to drive a wedge between the two parties. There, the desire was for the two parties to come together and work together for the welfare of the people. Here, it is unfortunately all about one part of Parliament prejudging the situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why are you doing this? Why have I not heard you state a single fact? You have just used phrases such as ‘It seems to be the case … ’ or ‘We have been informed by certain sources … ’ or ‘We have heard that … ’. If that is how you see the situation, why do you not go to the relevant committees in Parliament? Why do you not go to the Subcommittee on Security and Defence? Why do you not ask the Commission questions? Instead, you are pushing for a public debate because you want it to take place for political reasons. We are opposed to this. We do not understand why this debate is taking place at the expense of the Bulgarian Government and the Bulgarian people. If there is something which needs to be discussed, I invite you to do so in the relevant committees.</p>
      <p sl="de">It goes without saying for us that there must be the rule of law, a functioning justice system and appropriate parliamentary controls, in particular, in the case of sensitive issues like this instrument, all of which are the responsibility of a parliament which has been put in place by this government, which consists of representatives of all the parliamentary parties.

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, today’s debate is not just about widespread eavesdropping in Bulgaria. It is about the alarming tendencies towards the suspension of citizens’ rights in Europe</p>
      <p sl="bg">Internal political problems are the responsibility of the competent authorities in Bulgaria, who have to refer the issues to themselves to resolve them. At European level, there are no flaws in harmonisation with European legislation and, you are right, Commissioner; the problems lie in the implementation. For that reason, we asked you what you would do to ensure there is no abuse of European law. Therefore, my answer to you too, Mr Strasser, is that we have referred it to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The Bulgarian scandal has put the Charter, the Stockholm Programme, Directive 9546 and numerous documents on data protection in jeopardy, because in Bulgaria, recorded conversations of doctors are made public without legal justification and with no opportunity for a legal defence.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The drastic increase in eavesdropping devices is in inverse proportion to their judicial effectiveness. Doubts remain that the information from them will be collected and used for political purposes, which is particularly dangerous comes the elections in a year’s time. Commissioner, we urge the Commission to issue an initiative for the establishment of independent bodies to control eavesdropping devices in Member States.</p>
      <p sl="bg">These devices are very important in fighting corruption and criminality, and that is why we are appealing to you to ensure that they are lawfully used in the context of the mechanism for verification and cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, the escalation in the use of special eavesdropping devices in Bulgaria is a fact, which is why the public is so excited and concerned.</p>
      <p sl="bg">It was the Bulgarian parliamentary control body that came up with the critical findings. I ask the Commission to familiarise itself with these findings. There are other important issues. Will the Commission send a signal to those who are unaware of the fine line between security and freedom? Will the Commission convict the people who use the tools of the state for party political and even personal interests? Moreover, how categorically will the Commission exhort a national parliament – not necessarily the Bulgarian parliament – to resolve the issue of legislative gaps and to reinstate any independent control bodies it has closed down?</p>
      <p sl="bg">It has become clear that clandestinely gathered information has been shared not only within the confines of the special services, but with political figures in the hierarchy of the security services; that field operatives filter information, which is not their job by law; that eavesdropping devices are frequently used on spurious technical grounds and probably for no good reason.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Unfortunately, the Bulgarian special services, embroiled as they are in the fight against crime, have developed a basic reflex of watching almost anything that breathes and moves. It is not surprising that respected magistrates – not politicians, note – claim that either the system is flawed or there is a deliberate policy of regression. Flawed ought to be repaired, and that is what we are fighting for now. However, when it comes to deliberate steps backward, I think we should all oppose it and proclaim that the core of the European political philosophy is human rights, freedoms and the sanctity of human life.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The Stockholm Programme has not been consigned to the museum. It demands that we turn Europe into an area of freedom, security and justice, and we must not allow individuals, parties or governments to take any Member State back to a dark age of repression, injustice and uncertainty.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, what we heard from the Commission confirms the fact that Bulgarian legislation regarding the use of eavesdropping devices conforms with European law. We cannot be different because each Member State is obliged to guarantee its citizens fundamental rights and to observe the legal procedures, which is what Bulgaria does.</p>
      <p sl="bg">So what is it that has provoked the debate in this House today? The answer is simple. An election campaign is under way in Bulgaria and the Bulgarian opposition has brought the fight to the European Parliament, obviously irrespective of whether it discredits Bulgaria or not and for the sole purpose of extracting political dividends which, I assure you, is doubtful in the extreme.</p>
      <p sl="bg">It must be hard for the European institutions to convince themselves of the good intentions of representatives of the former tripartite coalition in Bulgaria, during whose rule there were plenty of examples of corruption, an unwillingness to fight crime and lack of confidence on the part of the European Union. The fellow Members who initiated this debate have clearly lost the patience to wait for the Commission’s answers, and wanted the debate to be held prior to the interim report on Bulgaria’s progress under the Mechanism for Verification and Cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I would like to make a little joke here. My fellow Members are obviously guided by high-minded patriotic ideas of doing as much damage to the Bulgarian Government as possible. It is a disgrace that in this empty, half-empty, or practically empty hall, we Bulgarians are at each other’s throats. Instead of working together in the interests of our citizens, we are dealing with hearsay, manipulations and a war of political mud-slinging.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Bulgaria’s present government is under attack from the old status quo, the remnants of the communist regime in the structures of power and those who illegally enriched themselves during the period of transition. The aim of this united front is not just to destabilise Bulgaria and to halt GERB’s efforts for a fairer society, but to discredit our country in the eyes of our European partners. I repeat: what is happening here this evening is pitiful and disgraceful.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This clearly smacks of the envy of those circles, both political and economic, with the government’s success in its uncompromising war against criminality and corruption, and with its honest and open way of conducting policy. In recent days, fellow Members of the Bulgarian opposition have presented the situation in Bulgaria in the darkest possible terms. They talk of fear, a police state, repressions, hunger, poverty, regression, as we just heard and so forth. Bulgaria’s reputation is being tarnished for the sake of short-term political gains. The very opposite is true.</p>
      <p sl="bg">There are no contract killings or kidnappings, organised crime has been dealt a severe blow and the channels of corruption which benefited the circles of the old status quo, not just economically but also politically, have been cut off. The country is stable at the macro-economic level, and offers some of the best conditions for investment in Europe. The government is stable, the Bulgarian parliament enjoys a stable majority, it governs openly and is a respected and worthy European partner.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Commissioner, this debate ought to have been held about another Member State as well, namely, Romania. In Romania in 2011, we have the situation where eavesdropping on private discussions is carried out without any legal remit, even though the constitution, national laws and EU legislation impose a total ban on any kind of intrusion of a person’s privacy without having sound justification and explicit authorisation from a judge. Discussions are being recorded illegally between journalists, politicians, as well as internal discussions during opposition parties’ meetings or private meetings in courtrooms. The fundamental right to the protection of privacy is being systematically and repeatedly violated. Illegal phone tapping has become prosecutors’ investigation method of choice. The secret services permanently monitor the telephone conversations of the current government’s political opponents. This is a very serious situation and I call on the European Commission to intervene urgently to uphold the rule of law and democracy in both Member States.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to repeat the European Commission’s assessment that the present government of Bulgaria is showing a real ambition to crack down on organised crime. Hardly anybody will deny that for the first time, our country has made real progress on this. That is what the Bulgarian electorate voted for in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The results have been achieved thanks to the decisive actions of the law enforcement agencies, which mustered all legal crime detection methods. It is only natural for the number of operations – and hence the number of people investigated – to increase, resulting in greater effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, let us not be naïve. Organised crime has plenty of resources to hand, acquired over years of impunity and inaction, to cause an unprecedented response. They have activated the machinery of undermining the ruling coalition to discredit it in the very area in which it is strongest.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The campaign was kicked off by publishing carefully selected and manipulated wire-tap recordings disseminated on flash drives by persons unknown. The media and politicians are falling over each other to comment on the horrors going on in Bulgaria, on the threat to citizens, on how much fundamental conventions and declarations have been undermined.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Those who initiated this hysteria, those who acquired and illegally spread this discrediting information, are now rubbing their hands with glee. They probably did not even imagine how easily the bait would be taken, to the extent that even the 4x4 in which the flash drives were being transported was stolen.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Some of the politicians present here have managed to spread this hysteria to the European Parliament, presenting it as the Bulgarian eavesdropping scandal. No such scandal exists in Bulgaria. All there is is a well-organised offensive to discredit the country’s ruling coalition and its most prominent figures. Discredited politicians from the opposition parties jumped on this bandwagon, hoping to reap dividends in the coming election campaign.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, I would like to turn to Commissioner Piebalgs, because a great deal of propaganda has been coming from Bulgaria’s ruling party today. The Parliamentary Commission, headed by the ruling party’s coalition partner, the nationalists of Ataka, presented the Bulgarian parliament with a report saying that the government is filtering information acquired from wiretaps before passing it on to the courts.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The report states that the government does not protect confidential personal information, which is published in the media. The report also says – and, I repeat, the report was prepared by the Bulgarian parliament – that fundamental rights of people living in Bulgaria, who are likewise European citizens, are being broken. This is an infringement of a number of European directives. It is an infringement of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I also believe that the only option left open to the Commission is to compare Bulgarian law and its implementation with what the requirements are for all European citizens. This is not a question of propaganda or a party political campaign. It is a question of clear facts and we believe that the Commission, as the guardian of the treaties, will familiarise itself with them and issue its opinion.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, as I am among the last to take the floor in this debate, I would like to summarise by saying a few words. Today’s debate is not to do with special eavesdropping devices in Bulgaria, nor is it a debate for or against a particular minister. It is a debate on the principles and values of Europe, which is why it is only natural that it should be held in this House. That is because it is a matter of freedom, of human rights, of democratic laws, which is not and cannot be purely a domestic debate.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The debate on human rights is the philosophy of a unified Europe, the purpose that inspired the new democracies after the fall of the Berlin Wall. If they lose their faith that Europe is based on principles, many of their citizens will decide that the road to Europe, which has been so long and hard, was a futile exercise.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Today’s debate is about the truth. The truth cannot be right-wing or left-wing. There can be no half-truths. There is always one truth, and we urge the institutions responsible in Bulgaria to name it as soon as possible. Because, deliberately or not, the more they delay their answer, the more they feed into the iniquitous soil of rumour and, in that way, are only serving those who claim to be fighting it.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Today’s debate is also one about the responsibility – not of past or future governments, but of the present one. What distinguishes democratic governments is the fact that they are always responsible to their electorates, regardless of whether they supported or opposed them. Equating the opposition with organised crime is the device of a different form of governance which has nothing to do with democracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I wanted to respond to Mr Strasser.</p>
      <p sl="bg">First of all, Mr Strasser, I would like to say that I cannot agree that there is no information on how eavesdropping devices have been used.</p>
      <p sl="bg">According to information from the Supreme Court of Cassation, in 2010, 15 946 wiretapping warrants were issued, while only 1 918 were used in court, which is 12% of the total. As you can see, the remaining wiretaps were clearly used for other purposes. 16 000 eavesdropping devices means that before 2010, between 5% and 10% of Bulgarian citizens were wiretapped, directly or indirectly.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I would like to ask you, Mr Strasser, is that what you did in Austria? Would you agree to your interior ministry and prosecutor’s office behaving this way in Austria? Moreover, do you not believe that this debate is a debate on the principle of what the state of freedom and democracy is in a Member State of the European Union?

      <p sl="bg">Today, we are discussing eavesdropping devices, but the Citizens’ Initiative has also been watched by the State Agency for National Security and people have been forced to withdraw their signatures. People taking part in peaceful demonstrations on economic issues have afterwards been summoned to the police and questioned. Show arrests have been carried out with deliberate heavy-handedness.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The declaration of the ruling political party claims that the opposition, both on the right and the left, have a hand in organised crime and the enemies of GERB are the enemies of the state, while the political and criminal oppositions today are the same thing. That is the style used by Mussolini and it concerns me greatly.</p>

      <p sl="lt">There is a certain charter in the European Union called the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Bulgaria, Lithuania, which I myself represent today, and the other European Union Member States must all comply with it.

Commissioner, I therefore feel that the representative of the Commission really should follow this case very closely, because the tension felt in this Chamber today is still excessive.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that there will be debates when it comes to fundamental and inalienable European values such as security and human rights, and when the fine line between them is widened. Paradoxical though it may appear, the different positions expressed this evening did have one thing in common, and that is concern.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The European Commission asked the Bulgarian authorities to provide information so it could check whether eavesdropping devices are being used lawfully. We liberal and socialist MEPs wanted a debate because of our concern with legality. We expressed our opinions to reassure the people who sent us here that we are on the alert for any infringements of their rights. In their statements, my fellow Members from the European People’s Party have shown concern at poor practices and confidence that they will be improved.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this has been a rather heated debate, but I would like to emphasise three points which I believe are fundamental.</p>
      <p sl="en">The accession process to the EU – and my country went through this – is not an easy one, but when a country is accepted into the EU, we really believe that this Member State has the ability to be the guarantor of fundamental human rights and also of the implementation of EU law.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this particular sector, we have specific legislation. This is the directive concerning the processing of personal data and protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, the Commission has a very long and, I would say, a very respectable, track record on following EU legislation being implemented in Member States. I reported to you where we start now and I believe that you should have full trust that the Commission will act if EU law is breached. If it is not breached, it will not act.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the Commission is monitoring the situation and, if there is the need, the Commission will act, but I think we should not go beyond the structures that are in Community law and the Commission will definitely stay within Community law.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Eva Joly, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the World Bank’s energy strategy for developing countries (O-000020/2011 - B70012/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-704-000" speaker_id="96734" name="Franziska Keller" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, today, 1.5 billion people are currently without access to electricity, but access to energy is a prerequisite for the eradication of the poverty that these people live in. The right to energy implies that energy supplies achieve universal and reliable access: equitable access that bridges the gap between urban and rural areas and is also affordable. It is also crucial for a country to develop a sustainable and secure energy supply, and the most reliable and secure one is a decentralised use of renewables.</p>
      <p sl="en">But energy does not only need to be secure and reliable; its production also needs to take into account other issues such as climate change, deforestation, environmental degradation, human health, and the poverty it causes. These problems cannot be tackled by fossil fuels. Fossil fuels have a disastrous impact on health, environment and climate. At the same time, the climate crisis is doing more damage to those living in extreme poverty. Fossil fuels create pollution that endangers both human health and a healthy environment, and they are expensive and their prices increase the more we run out of oil and gas. Fossil fuels create centralised, hierarchic and inflexible energy distribution.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to focus on renewables. We have to assist developing countries to leapfrog our destructive fossil fuel path. Only renewables can bring a solution to these problems. Renewable energy uses resources that will never run out and that many developing countries have in abundance: sun and wind mainly. They can be employed locally on a very small and inexpensive scale, which is also, in a very literal sense, empowering people. Decentralised power supplies are in the hands of the people. They are democratic. Nevertheless, the World Bank continues to push fossils in its energy strategy. Recent increases in lending for renewable and energy sufficiency remain tiny and cannot cover up the obvious preferences.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fossil fuel investments are also taking place through financial intermediaries which the World Bank does not sufficiently monitor. There is an under-reporting of fossil fuels. The bank continues to make significant investment in coal-fired power plants, locking developing countries into coal-based energy for decades to come. This is not what an energy revolution looks like.</p>
      <p sl="en">The World Bank’s energy policy suffers from a lack of transparency. This problem should be addressed through the definition of clear requirements that financial intermediaries must meet in order to be eligible for multilateral financing. 40% of World Bank loans to the private sector are transferred through those financial intermediaries and a large part of those loans goes to the energy sector, in particular, extractives. However, unlike direct bank project investments, there is no information publicly available on these individual sub-project investments, making it very difficult to track what ultimately happens to financial intermediaries’ funding.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we look at what sort of energy is counted as low carbon, we can find large hydropower plants in the strategy. Such large hydroplants destroy vast amounts of nature and drive people from their homes. This is not sustainable and this is not in the interests of the people and of society. Also, carbon capture and storage do not make coal power low carbon. The CO2 is still there and nobody can predict what will happen to it underground. None of us can say for sure that it will stay there, calmly for the next millennia. This is fortune telling and not research, and certainly not policy making.</p>
      <p sl="en">The same goes for nuclear energy. Uranium mining produces huge amounts of CO2 and nobody knows what to do with the waste we are producing. This is not low carbon and this is not sustainable. This is why the Green/EFA Group will vote against the resolution unless the low carbon wording is replaced.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we also see some good points in the resolution: for example, the focus on off-grid renewables for rural areas and small-scale local production, as well as the concern about the dominance of export orientation, large-scale plants and bio fuels.</p>
      <p sl="en">A last word: we also very much focus on the call for enhanced technology transfer. In particular, technology transfer will not need much if intellectual property rights are left intact. The overriding goal should be to treat intellectual property rights in a manner that allows access to technology at affordable prices. This is what we promised at the climate negotiations, and we should stick to our promise.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I can only congratulate Ms Keller for what she has said and her analysis. The question though is this. We have known about these problems for two decades now. Ms Keller, since you have dealt with the issue in more depth than most of us, is there any particular point that makes you optimistic that what we are about to decide upon could actually bring some progress, or that the World Bank is now finally heading in the right direction?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, indeed, we have been discussing these issues for more than two decades, and I really hope that the World Bank will learn from these discussions since everybody agrees that the future lies with renewables.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have seen a slight change in this strategy. For instance, it has moved a bit more towards renewables, but this is a little step and not enough by far. There is still too much dominance of fossils and, when it comes to renewables, too much focus on hydropower plants – and they are not renewable, they are not sustainable, not for anybody.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I hope that this Parliament can make a strong statement on where we want the European energy policy and the policy that we promote for energy in the world to go. I hope for your support to remove the wording on low carbon and go for proper, sustainable, renewable energy.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-707-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I feel I also made a very strong statement. Firstly, I would emphasise that the World Bank energy strategy is very welcome because the World Bank plays a very particular role in the world, particularly in dealing with development issues. It is not an understatement to say that they are leaders of public opinion and approaches to development strategies. My point is that we should address this issue with all seriousness.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we should not forget a couple of elements that are very crucial when we are estimating our answer to the strategy. There are still a substantial number of households today that have no access to any type of energy. It is true that, although we have been discussing the issue for 20 years, substantial investment in the energy sector or energy service provision have not been delivered to hundreds of millions of people, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. So I believe that we need to understand the scale of the challenge.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point that we need to take into account is growth. Each of the countries that are on the path of development have an immense growth in demand. We should respond to growth in demand with supply. There is an additional fundamental challenge because of the scale of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third point – and here I fully agree with Ms Keller – is sustainability and anticipation. Whatever the energy sector does should be considered in the light of the consequences that it has on climate change. We know that the energy sector which exists today is the biggest cause of greenhouse gases. Additionally, we should also look at the price of fossil fuel, because we should not forget that the challenge of fossil fuel prices is still ahead of us. I hope that we will face this later rather than sooner, but it is definitely part of anticipation of the strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for the orientation, I would expect Parliament to take account of the Green Paper on EU development policy, where we make access to renewable energy in developing countries one of the central pillars of the new EU development policy. If we do not take this pioneering step, we cannot easily expect to convince the World Bank and others that we should be focusing investment on renewable energy. I believe that we are capable of managing the scale of investment in renewable energy. We just need to have courage. It is true that it requires a lot of financial means today, but any energy strategy would require quite a lot of investment. So, if I see anticipation of the prices, I would always argue that renewable energy is definitely the one that should be at the heart of any energy policy in any part of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our knowledge of renewable technologies today gives a good guarantee that we really could make a change in these countries. I also believe that there is a lot of untapped potential. I know that hydropower, for example, is a rather challenging source of energy from all points of view but, provided environmental sustainability analysis is being done, I believe that most countries also have a fantastic untapped potential in hydropower, which gives additional arguments that the scale – the Inga Dam, for example – is huge.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the beginning, we need to lead by example. If the EU is able and you discuss a report on the EU development policy’s Green Paper, Parliament should strongly support driving EU development policy in this direction. We will have a better argument for convincing the World Bank to actually follow this drive and be more focused on investments in the coal-fired power station. The Bank has now established six criteria as general guidelines for future coal investment. The World Bank, under the leadership of Bob Zoellick, is extremely active in the debate, so it would seem that the World Bank is an asset and not something that we should be afraid of. It is our ally but we really need to provide European leadership on this issue and in the energy sector for the developing world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to address the issue of the EIB, because it was in the question. The Cotonou Agreement is the legislative basis for EIB activity for an amount of EUR 3.1 billion to ACP countries. A major instrument in this framework is the ACP Investment Facility. The facility finances infrastructure and climate friendly energy projects. As far as the energy sector is concerned, no projects exist in the area of fossil fuels. The general policy is very clear – to fund climate friendly energy projects based on wind, hydraulic or solar energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the context of the mid-term review of the EIB External Mandate – covering pre-accession, neighbourhood and partner countries, Asia, Latin America and South Africa – a proposal has been put forward by the Commission to activate an additional EUR 2 billion mandate for 2011-2013 to support EIB financing operations in the field of climate change mitigation and adaptation across all regions. The proposal stresses that the EIB’s own rules and procedures shall include the necessary provisions to ensure that only projects that are economically, financially, environmentally and socially sustainable are supported under the mandate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the EU has already taken some steps in the right direction, but we could really take more steps to provide real leadership for the world, not least by addressing the World Bank’s energy strategy.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, it is a very pressing and important matter that is being addressed in this Chamber, namely, that of the phasing out of loans for fossil fuel projects. I believe that we should have the courage to say exactly what Commissioner Piebalgs said, namely, that the World Bank has a very deliberate energy strategy. We can even talk about incentives in this regard, and that is obviously a positive thing. Of course, it is not just a question of phasing out, but also, as has been said, of phasing in.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Being rather persistent, I want to repeat that there are opportunities here for the EU to make specific investments to help people in developing countries, in Africa, Asia and Latin America. I believe the Commissioner has heard me speak on a previous occasion about the wood stoves currently found in huts and ordinary houses that are poisoning people. Two million people are dying prematurely on account of the gases that are found in ordinary homes.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In this regard, like the United States and a number of European countries, we could invest in simple solar-powered stoves that at least eliminate 95% of the gases. Then they would no longer need to use manure, which we know that they need for cultivating crops, and they would no longer need to use black coal for heating. Nor would they need to chop down forests that absolutely should not be chopped down.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like, once again, to emphasise that there are opportunities to do something tangible. Often, when we talk about alternative energy sources, we talk ostentatiously about wind energy and solar energy, and of course we should do that. However, there is a lack of tangible results, despite the fact that the opportunities are there. Do not allow the EU to get left behind on these matters, but let the EU be involved in developing concrete ways of replacing this fossil fuel that we no longer want in either the industrialised nations or the developing countries.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, first, I should like to thank Mrs Keller for her exceptional work on this report. Indeed, everyone who worked on this report saw just how unviable the World Bank strategy is on several counts. As Mrs Keller said, it finances unviable, large-scale projects, such as hydroelectric and numerous other projects.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is a fact that financing for renewable energy sources has risen by 300%. At the same time, however, financing for fossil fuel projects has risen by 430%.</p>
      <p sl="el">The World Bank – and, to my mind, this is a scandal – has failed to take account of the environmental impact of the projects which it finances. At the same time, it is still discussing, even today, the possibility of starting financing for programmes for palm oil plantations. It has no respect for the principle of free, prior and informed consent by locals to projects being financed, nor has it integrated (and it should integrate) a full cycle analysis of the projects it finances.</p>
      <p sl="el">I truly hope that this report, in its final version after the vote, will send a strong message about the environmental reforms which the World Bank needs to implement internally.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, under the terms of its mandate, the World Bank is required to contribute to eradicating poverty in developing countries. All projects financed by the World Bank must have this aim. Even when financing a business project to invest in basic social services – health, education, access to water – this requirement must be met. If the World Bank makes combating poverty a priority, we can be satisfied that it is fulfilling the remit that we laid down.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The oral question that we are debating expresses grave reservations about funding petrol or coal-related projects. I would like to make a number of comments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, the terms of reference for a World Bank-financed project must include the evaluation criteria to be applied from the outset. It must be clear what is to be evaluated and, consequently, the evaluation criteria need to be integrated throughout the project’s lifetime.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, political dialogue between the World Bank and its partner must consider political and economic governance, both in the country concerned and in relation to the lender.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, where it is possible to promote renewable energies and the costs are justifiable, we need to favour this form of energy generation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fourthly, and here I need to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for having already addressed one of my concerns in his answer to Mrs Keller, the European Investment Bank already takes all these factors into account.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I can but hope that the World Bank will follow the example of others who have already adopted these priorities, not least the European Investment Bank. Given that the 27 Member States of the European Union are also members of the World Bank, we cannot claim to be without any influence on its policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that it would be well worth discussing combining forces within the World Bank with a view to resolving the issues raised by Mrs Keller. I would like to congratulate Mrs Keller on her excellent work.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, before I go on, I would also like to praise the work which has been done by my fellow Member, and say that I fully support the issues that have been mentioned here.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am going to do something now that I have not done before, but which I think is worthwhile. We have a series of documents which holds a set of assumptions, all of them rarely discussed. It is as if they were assumptions unworthy of discussion. We have the oral question, and we have a resolution which tells us various things, including that the conventional rural electrification programmes financed by the World Bank have failed globally in their task of reaching the poorest in rural areas.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We are also finding that there will be a possible, putative, change in the World Bank’s energy strategy in mid-2011, but we also know that it is in the energy sectors that we can combat poverty in a very specific way, and help to lift people out of poverty. We therefore appeal to the World Bank to adopt a development approach that can maximise benefits to the poor while, at the same time, allowing us to combat climate change.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have also already said that the loans intended for fossil fuels continue to play a predominant role in the overall energy portfolio of the World Bank, and that we must abandon this predominance. We also have the promise that this predominance will no longer be a predominance by 2015, and that there will be a gradual reduction in the financing of these projects based on fossil fuels.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have, finally, a set of statements, specifically regarding the need for the World Bank to give priority to access to local energy on a small scale. There are many, many others, taking climate change into account.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Having said that, I would like to edit what has been said, and to which I subscribe. I will edit all of the statements that we have made, and leave just two, final, questions, because it is not worthwhile continuing with mere statements of intent.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The first question is: why can we not draw from all this such a basic conclusion as this? Why do we continue to allow those who pay the piper to call the tune? Why does the World Bank continue to hold responsibility for the world energy strategy? When are we going to make the decision that the world energy strategy should be the object of worldwide coordination anchored in the United Nations?</p>
      <p sl="pt">The second question that I will leave with you – I apologise for going slightly over time – is: when are we going to stop imposing a development model upon others, whether this be first or second generation, that is, whether first or second hand, upon the rest of the world, as if it were a development model that should be applied to everyone?</p>
      <p sl="pt">There are limits to arrogance. We must be more democratic.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in the 1970s and the early 1980s, the blindness of the World Bank to environmental issues was a major topic for discussion. The same speeches were made then as are being made here today, together with certain promises by the World Bank. Moves were made to reform the World Bank, but decades have passed since then. For a wide variety of reasons, I recently made a visit to a number of countries which are generally referred to as developing countries. The situation was unacceptable. What has happened to all the projects? Where are the solar plants in the tropics? Where are the sustainable forests in the Amazon or in Vietnam? Where are the solar panels and wind turbines in Kenya?</p>
      <p sl="de">There is absolutely nothing there. The only thing that has happened is that the European system of self-government has been copied exactly. The people there are governing themselves and they have played into the hands of a few large interested parties, but they have not made any progress. Then we are surprised when citizens of the developing countries say despairingly: ‘I do not want to live in the Caribbean any more. I want to move to the USA and get into the EU via Martinique’. We are surprised when the people in the Maghreb countries all want to move here. The hypocrisy of this debate is totally unbelievable. We have to understand that millions of people have been radicalised. They have simply said ‘We have had enough!’.</p>
      <p sl="de">Everyone who has seen the European Parliament motion for a resolution will have to admit that it could not have been that. We should have spoken out much more loudly. We should have called on the World Bank much more clearly to take the necessary action. Why do we have all these committees – the Committee on Development, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and so on – if all they can produce is a scrappy little piece of paper that, in part, contains the conclusions of the debate which took place in the late 1970s? The whole thing is embarrassing.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we need convince no one of the importance of energy for developing countries. I have seen the surprise on people’s faces many times when they learn how much electricity costs in Africa. It is probably also true that we need convince no one that the World Bank plays a far from insignificant role when it comes to energy matters in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My political group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), tabled a number of amendments to be voted on separately to the resolution we are discussing. It seems to us that some parts of the resolution are too critical of the World Bank. I do not believe, for example, that we can draw the World Bank’s attention to the fact that it regards some types of energy as clean when they should be regarded as environmentally wrong or undesirable. Nuclear energy, for example, is widely used in the EU’s Member States, and an increasing number of European countries which are dependent on coal or gas are suffering to a certain extent since they are having to limit their emissions, which gives rise to costs which are distributed very unequally between the individual Member States. We must therefore exercise caution when telling external bodies which types of energy should be developed. I do agree, however, with the idea that it is worth giving particular support to local projects covering small areas, that it is worth supporting low emission projects and that it is worth supporting ideas relating to diversified sources of energy and avoiding energy dependency.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We would like the World Bank to invest in renewable energy and increased energy efficiency, but we must always bear in mind the fundamental goal, or, in other words, how access to energy is supposed to help people break out of poverty. We want to kill several birds with one stone – to create the conditions for development, limit emissions and take into account social and environmental aspects in new energy projects. These are ambitious tasks, and I hope the World Bank is not afraid of them. At the same time, I know that Commissioner Piebalgs places a great deal of emphasis on the development of energy projects in developing countries, and I can confirm that this is discussed in the Green Paper and that the European Parliament should support this strategy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, there are currently 1.4 billion people in the world without access to electricity, 85% of whom live in rural areas. The Millennium Development Goals to eradicate poverty by 2015 will not be achieved due to the lack of significant progress on providing access to energy. Achieving this goal by 2015 means that 395 million people will have access to electricity and 1 billion people will gain access to hygienic facilities for preparing food. All these measures will require an annual investment of roughly USD 40 billion in the 2010-2015 period, which amounts to 0.6% of global GDP.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Universal access to electricity is one of the most important goals set by the governments in developing countries. Among the barriers identified as preventing electrification are the high cost of supplying electricity in rural areas and to houses in peri-urban areas, the lack of tax or financial incentives, insufficient capacity for developing and implementing electrification projects, along with the limited ability to generate electricity.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Rural areas are a special case when it comes to energy requirements. In rural areas, not only does the required energy need to be provided, but the actual process of generating it as well, which also creates jobs and supports economic and social development.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On 11 February 2011, a World Bank report showed that local energy production from renewable sources at a low production cost is a more viable economic solution in the long term. This may play a key role in increasing India’s energy security so that energy imports and the influence of oil price fluctuations can be reduced. The World Bank could therefore act as a partner to the developing countries. I believe that the World Bank should support the projects concerned with boosting energy efficiency and local energy production from renewable sources, as well as extensive projects involving electrification and establishing interconnections between different countries.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for raising in a timely manner what truly is a very relevant issue. Energy poverty remains a huge problem, and related issues are preventing those living in the world’s poorest regions from improving their quality of life, from having the opportunity to earn a living and generally contribute towards increasing growth and productivity. This is one of the fundamental factors impeding general social and economic development and preventing these regions from being lifted out of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="lt">As the rapporteur mentioned, the statistics are disturbing – around 1.5 billion people do not have any access to electricity, and more than 2.5 billion people are still using traditional fuel obtained from biomass. According to World Health Organisation data, across the world, two million people die prematurely from respiratory diseases each year due to the use of this fuel.</p>
      <p sl="lt">So far, the World Bank’s previous energy strategy has not produced tangible results. Furthermore, support for the use of fossil fuel still remains greater than for renewable or clean sources of energy. Hitherto, significant investment has been provided for coal-fired power plants, and this continues to make these poor countries dependent on fossil fuel, which heavily pollutes the environment.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The agreement adopted by the G20 leaders to reduce support and funding for fossil fuel projects, which should not receive any funding at all from 2015, is a positive and welcome stimulus. The new strategy must also thoroughly assess the issue of funding supervision and control, so that this assistance is used for those energy projects that may bring long-term benefits and genuinely contribute to the development of these regions and improving the quality of people’s lives.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Piebalgs in particular. As a former Commissioner for energy, he naturally knows all about our strategy. I believe that there is a lot to be done in the field of development cooperation, particularly with regard to technical aid. Europe must not only make payments to the World Bank; it must also take action. Europe and the European institutions must play a stronger role in the World Bank and it will be a major challenge to ensure that family businesses can be supported with development aid, that small and medium-sized energy generation enterprises can be promoted, because a lot of small businesses together can achieve economies of scale and produce a corresponding return on investment.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of the most important issues is, of course, the storage of energy. This will play a central role in development cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I suppose one could say that those of us who are still here at this hour of the night are probably powered by some form of renewable energy, perhaps solar power or maybe even divine power in the form of a halo above our heads.</p>
      <p sl="en">Either way, the discussion has been very varied, and not surprisingly, because this is always a contentious issue. But I think the Commissioner got the balance right, probably better than most of us, in terms of where we are going and what needs to be done in the future. I think a few points need to be made more precise. Whether countries are in the developing world or the developed world, if they have resources of fossil fuel – coal – or nuclear energy, they are going to utilise them. The question is: do we finance them or do we not? Obviously in Europe, in terms of Cancún, Kyoto, etc. we want to push the renewable agenda, and that is absolutely correct. But I think in doing that, Mr Martin is probably right in one sense that we need to speak with a louder voice and push the World Bank into promoting and financing more renewable energy projects than they are perhaps doing right now.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is very important to our debate, even if it is late at night, because I think the World Bank’s energy strategy is an opportunity. It is a genuine opportunity to respond to energy challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we also look at what the International Energy Agency is saying about energy poverty, about renewable energy, it is certainly a huge challenge, but the World Bank, together with our leadership, could make the necessary change. If we go back a couple of years in our Union’s history, our renewable energy target seemed impossible to meet, even if it was a rather humble target of 18%, if I recall correctly. Now it seems that we are well on track.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sometimes, however, you need to take your courage in both hands and anticipate the real challenges. The World Bank makes the whole process very open. There will be the World Bank energy week in Washington. We could also submit our contributions to the World Bank, which is very open to new ideas. If we are courageous, that will give even more courage to the World Bank. So it is important that we go with open hearts and put these very ambitious ideas to the World Bank. Otherwise, many people could attempt to evade this challenge.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is definitely a question of where to start. I would say it is still access to energy that we should be looking at, because access to energy also means sustainable and efficient energy. The recent trends in the countries we are working with show huge urbanisation, so in a way, it has changed the pattern of the whole energy riddle. It means not only decentralised generation, but also agglomeration areas, so energy efficiency, strange as it sounds, should also be part of the strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most importantly, we should beef up. We have energy facilities: EUR 200 million. You cannot do too much on energy with EUR 200 million. We need to envisage long-term funding, because I believe Europe’s trademark should be renewable energy. With this, and the capacities of the World Bank, we really could do something that matters, not only for energy supply, but also in terms of taking substantial steps to combat climate change.</p>
