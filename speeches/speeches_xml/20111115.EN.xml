      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the Council request for the application of urgent procedure for the draft Council decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Declaration on the granting of fishing opportunities in EU waters to fishing vessels flying the flag of the Bolivian Republic of Venezuela in the exclusive economic zone off the coast of French Guiana (C7-0121/2011 – 08202/2011 – 2010(0392)NLE).</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council made an urgent request for Parliament to express its opinion – and I repeat, only its opinion – on the dossier to which I have been designated rapporteur, during the meeting of the Committee on Fisheries of November 2011. As rapporteur, and on behalf of the entire Committee on Fisheries, I oppose the Council’s urgent request and believe that it is necessary to explain the reasons for this decision.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Council’s proposal concerns access to the exclusive economic zone off the coast of French Guiana for fishing vessels flying Venezuelan flags. The proposal is similar to an international agreement according to which, by virtue of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has the right to express itself in the capacity of colegislator within the context of ordinary legislative procedure and should not express only its opinion.</p>
      <p sl="it">The substance of the proposal does not present any difficulties and, upon its approval, although signed by the Council, will produce within the context of international law obligations for the parties that are similar to those of a fisheries agreement in due form.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, the main point of our decision lies elsewhere. The European Commission passed on this proposal to Parliament on the basis of specific legal grounds – that is, Articles 43 and 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union – and Parliament fully accepted it, in view of the content and spirit of this proposal which grants it, amongst other things, a power of approval. It was at this point that the Council, in its subsequent reference to Parliament, amended the legal grounds, setting aside Articles 43 and 218 and opting for Article 43(3), and Article 218(6), thereby reducing Parliament’s power to that of simply expressing an opinion.</p>
      <p sl="it">The coordinators of our Committee on Fisheries have rejected this amendment by the Council and have submitted this issue for examination, prior to taking on any definitive position, to the Committee on Legal Affairs. The latter has confirmed the validity of the legal grounds adopted initially by the European Commission and, in particular, has warned our Committee on Fisheries of the unfavourable precedent that could be set by putting this combination of Article 43(3), and Article 218(6), of the Treaty into force.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the Council’s insistence to obtain an opinion and not an approval in the shortest time possible, Ms Fraga Estévez, Chair of the Committee on Fisheries, in a letter to President Buzek, reiterated the positions of both the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Legal Affairs, and suggested that, in order to resolve the controversy, President Buzek should send a proposal containing the original legal grounds to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="it">On 26 October 2011, President Buzek sent a letter to this effect to the President of the Council, and has still not received a reply. Therefore, it seems appropriate to wait for the Council’s response, and it is of utmost importance to reiterate that we are not prepared to abandon Parliament’s fundamental rights which we have a duty to defend.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Frédéric Daerden, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion (2011/2052 (INI)) (Α7-0370/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-013-000" speaker_id="97125" name="Frédéric Daerden" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking all those who have worked together constructively in drafting this report: Members of this House, organisations representing different groups, and other colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In 2010, 116 million people were at risk of poverty, more than 20% of our fellow citizens; 8% of Europeans were experiencing severe material deprivation; and these numbers must be greater today with the crises that we are currently going through.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, the 2020 strategy adopted here set itself the objective of reducing the number of poor to 20 million and this platform aims to provide a tool in combating this problem, which, in itself, is a violation of basic human rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The whole thrust of this report, in addition to outlining how it is to operate, is primarily to give the European Union and the Member States a road map with recommendations for policies which can be implemented to achieve this objective. The fact that it has been adopted by this Parliament takes on a particular significance in current political and economic circumstances. It is essential for people to see that the Union is not only concerned about Member States’ debts, but also about their economic and social circumstances and that there are still institutions and MEPs who are promoting a sense of solidarity between the Member States and their citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report also contains a statement relating to current circumstances and the food aid programme for the most deprived which we would like to see maintained at 500 million in both the short and the long term. Yesterday, the Council of agriculture ministers reached an agreement to do this, at least in the short term. That is good. At last, we have a positive signal on this matter. That was the least we could expect, but what concerns me is the reluctance, and even the threats made by certain Member States against the Union’s social policies before we got to that point. The long-term problem has not even been resolved yet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to raise some more basic points covered in this report. Firstly, certain categories of people who are more vulnerable to the risk of poverty, such as children, women, the elderly, the disabled, migrants and the Roma, need individual treatment and therefore each group is covered separately in the report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Next, a variety of factors can lead to poverty. They, too, are subject to specific recommendations. That is the case, for example, of the lack of decent and accessible housing, of decent jobs, of high-quality, accessible and non-discriminatory social services, of education systems that reduce the early school leaving rate and professional training that is tailored to the jobs market. It is also the case, quite simply, of financial resources to meet basic needs and, consequently, a minimum income in Europe within a Community legislative framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to implement such policies at European level, we are, of course, calling for the Commission to mobilise European funds to finance poverty-eradication initiatives, especially the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It should be palpably obvious that, at European and national levels, we cannot carry out public policy without adequate funding. We must have investment in social affairs if we are to eradicate poverty and stimulate the growth that will create jobs and set us on a virtuous circle.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would just like to emphasise one point: austerity measures within the framework of European economic governance cannot be allowed to endanger employment or social protection. Just keeping an eye on inflation rates, deficits and debts is not enough. Member States must also be accountable for trends in poverty and Parliament must receive regular reports on this. The report therefore stresses the need within the platform for regular monitoring of progress made by Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All these recommendations were broadly the subject of discussions at the first convention of the European platform against poverty and social exclusion in Kraków and were quite favourably received by the actors on the ground in the fight against poverty. It is crucial for them to be involved, as the report recommends.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would therefore call on my fellow Members to lend massive support to this report, as was the case in the Committee, so that Parliament is finally able to send a positive signal to its citizens at a time when they are feeling under pressure.</p>

    <intervention id="2-014-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Andor" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Frédéric Daerden, and the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs, for the comprehensive report on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion. The report is very timely in the current context of a severe economic and financial downturn across the European Union and the consequent impact this has on vulnerable groups in societies.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, let me recall that the first annual convention of the European platform against poverty and social exclusion, jointly organised by the Commission and the Polish Presidency, took place in Kraków. This convention brought together over 400 participants from 38 European countries, including Ministers and State Secretaries, other policy makers, civil society representatives, journalists, people experiencing poverty and independent experts. I was very pleased that Members of the European Parliament, including Mr Daerden himself, today’s rapporteur, attended the convention. I represented the Commission there, and I think the first meeting of this convention was successful, useful and forward-looking.</p>
      <p sl="en">The convention took stock of the implementation of the poverty platform and it discussed how the different policy areas – employment, education, health, just to mention a few – could contribute to tackling poverty and social exclusion. This multidimensional approach, which was welcomed by all participants, should be further strengthened in the future in line with the European Platform; employment, education, and health, together with housing, are the key parameters in the European framework of Roma integration strategies, which is a major anti-poverty effort that requires European-level coordination but also support.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Daerden, in your report, you underlined the multidimensional aspects of poverty, ranging from extreme poverty and homelessness to in-work poverty, but also the gender and age dimensions, and the specific questions of people with disabilities and ethnic minorities. The European platform against poverty and social exclusion alone will not be able to solve all the issues raised in the report, but it provides, in my view, a good framework for actions, and each and every one should accept their share of responsibility in tackling the rising problem of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Among the actions to be implemented and solutions, you mentioned that there is a need for a better monitoring system allowing rapid and accurate analysis. I agree with you. We have already started to develop such a system with the involvement of Eurostat and the indicators subgroup of the Social Protection Committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">You also called for regular and critical monitoring of the Member States’ poverty-reduction targets. This is indeed very important. The current national targets will not allow the EU headline target to be met. Pressure is also needed from Parliament to ensure a higher level of ambition across the Member States which, at a later stage, can be translated into higher national targets. While the economic crisis is placing a huge pressure on national social protection systems, it cannot be an alibi for non-action. More fairness in fiscal consolidation can be applied and must be pursued.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with you on tackling child poverty urgently and giving all children the possibility of fulfilling their potential, regardless of their social background. In 2012, therefore, I intend to propose common principles on child poverty covering support for families, access to essential services and participation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fundamentally, more and better employment is the most effective route out of poverty. However, the current economic situation is not conducive to employment growth and many groups, especially young people, have difficulties in entering, or staying in, the labour market. Against this background, the Commission will soon launch the Youth Opportunities Initiative.</p>
      <p sl="en">Beyond conventional employment policy, the social economy offers opportunities. The Commission adopted Communications on a Social Business Initiative and on Corporate Social Responsibility on 25 October 2011, and I am sure we can do more in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to promote the implementation of the three pillars of active inclusion: namely, active labour market policies, minimum income and access to services. The Commission will present in 2012 an assessment of the implementation of active inclusion strategies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, regarding the budget issues which Mr Daerden raised in the report, the Commission’s proposal envisages allocating at least 20% of the future European Social Fund to promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. We have proposed increasing the budget for the ESF by at least 7.5%, which represents a minimum of EUR 84 billion, or 25%, of cohesion policy over the seven years from 2014 to 2020. If adopted, this would imply a very significant increase, both in absolute and relative terms, in the support aimed at the most vulnerable groups in society.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thank you for your attention.</p>

    <intervention id="2-015-000" speaker_id="96880" name="Andrea Cozzolino" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets">
      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, policies to tackle new and old forms of poverty, which, unfortunately, are on the rise in today’s Europe and in the Europe of the crisis of recent times, along with one-sided austerity policies, above all, on the part of the Member States, require new financial commitments and new resources not only with regard to the European budget, including within the framework of financial prospects, but also with regard to European policies – as just mentioned – from the European Social Fund to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), as well as to the budgets of individual Member States. Above all, as regards individual states, we should utilise the European Semester to monitor year after year, in practical terms, the policies they dedicate to this fundamental challenge.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to give credibility to the objective to reduce poverty and social exclusion for around 20 million European citizens, it is necessary to have coherence between the enormous resources that Europe and the States should make available and the concrete policies that we can put into practice. It is calculated that around EUR 2 billion are needed between now and 2020 in order to realise the objectives that we are proposing. The challenge that we as the Committee on Budgets are identifying and focusing on is this: coherence between the financial resources that we make available and the policies that we put into practice.</p>

    <intervention id="2-016-000" speaker_id="96653" name="Katarína Neveďalová" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education">
      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would like to draw attention to the importance of education in the fight against poverty, and also to the key role of volunteering and active citizenship as instruments of cohesion and in the fight against economic, social and environmental differences, as they encourage citizens to connect with public life via sport, culture, the arts, and social and political activities,</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Youth on the Move initiative, for example, is an important tool in the fight against poverty, helping to promote mobility for all pupils, interns and students, and to promote the recognition of professional skills acquired both formally and informally. Either way, this is an enormous challenge and an enormous problem for society, and it was exacerbated by the global crisis.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would therefore like to call on Member States to create the most effective strategies possible to combat poverty and social exclusion, and to ensure high-quality education and vocational training that is accessible to all, and to carry out more concrete investments in national reform plans. Measures aimed at cultural and linguistic integration into the host country are particularly important for overcoming social exclusion. Despite overall cost-cutting in Europe, we must not forget solidarity or the target of a reduction in the number of people living in poverty of 20 million by 2020.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, this report is the result of close collaboration with civil society associations, such as the International Movement ATD Fourth World.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty was first introduced, Joseph Wresinski said: ‘Wherever men and women are condemned to live in poverty, human rights are violated. To come together to ensure that these rights be respected is our solemn duty’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank the rapporteur for having included the issue of respect for human rights in his report. I would like to make an oral amendment to the plenary vote in order to clarify this concern in the next multiannual programme of the Fundamental Rights Agency. This proposal is in line with the opinion adopted by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, for whose opinion I am rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, poverty is the cause of the great inequalities on our planet.</p>
      <p sl="es">We cannot accept a system in the 21st century that continues to exacerbate differences between people because of their place of birth, gender, or their country’s development prospects.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is vital to create a new social, employment and economic framework that will ensure the basic needs of our population.</p>
      <p sl="es">Around 80 million people live below the poverty line, of whom more than half are women and 20 million are children.</p>
      <p sl="es">The platform that is the subject of this report could help to achieve greater social justice in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">It calls for priority to be placed on education and youth policies as a key element around which to build a fairer and more just society; for an overhaul of the insecure employment contracts that have proliferated in many Member States, undermining protection of the weakest groups in society; for the recognition of the rights of women living in rural areas, whose work is not valued and who are excluded from the basic rights enjoyed by all workers; and for an improvement in national home care programmes for the elderly.</p>
      <p sl="es">The austerity measures that are so badly needed at this time of crisis must not be incompatible with maintaining basic social services.</p>
      <p sl="es">Some 116 million people are threatened by poverty in the European Union, and 42 million live in conditions of severe material deprivation. We must ensure these people’s social protection and create a more prosperous environment that will help to reduce these figures.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, I would like to say how pleased I am with the Council’s decision, following several months of stalled negotiations, to release food aid for the poorest members of society. It is essential to maintain this economic support in the new 2014-2020 funding cycle, with an annual maximum amount of EUR 500 million.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Andor, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, for his communication and project on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion. I would also particularly like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Daerden, who has produced a wonderful report that I hope will be read and, above all, put to use by the European Union institutions and Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">We agree with Mr Daerden on the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of this serious problem. We agree on the diagnosis because it is clear that we have a serious problem. It is not just that millions of people are affected by poverty or the risk of poverty in Europe, but also the fact that we as Europeans and the entire European project are threatened by this situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">If the dignity of a policy, country or region can be measured by the dignity with which we treat the weakest among us, then it is clear we have a serious problem in Europe, and it is clear that the European Union project still has some unresolved matters to address.</p>
      <p sl="es">The problem we are up against is not a natural disaster and neither is it unavoidable. We are not facing a biblical curse. We are facing a problem that has its roots in bad policies and is not the responsibility of its victims, as is sometimes said.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have had poor social policies, which make it impossible to deal with the effects, and, above all, poor policies implemented by those who stop us from tackling the causes of poverty. We have also had bad economic policies, stupid economic policies that destroy jobs, economic activity, wealth creation and high-quality employment.</p>
      <p sl="es">The prognosis is fairly bad too. We are not coping well with the crisis, and this is generating even more poverty because we have had three years of the wrong policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">As regards treatment, we should follow Mr Daerden’s recommendations. There are important programmes in the areas of education, culture, social services and employment, but, above all, Commissioner, Article 9 of the Treaty on European Union must be complied with! We need a social impact study of all EU policies so that we can see and measure their impact in the fight against poverty. We need basic, EU-wide social regulations on social services and minimum income.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, this is, of course, a very important subject, particularly so during this current economic crisis. We must be aware that those who are at risk of social exclusion and poverty have to be protected. I know that it is difficult at the moment for Member States to set priorities, but I hope that when they do, they bear in mind those who are homeless and at risk of poverty and social exclusion in many different ways, whether they are older people, disabled people, young people, children or families.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to congratulate the European platform against poverty and social exclusion on the work they have been doing to highlight the problem. While combating poverty is, of course, mainly the role of Member States, the platform helps to coordinate policy for exchange of best practice. We must also build on the lessons of last year’s European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion and boost the involvement of civil society, in particular, NGOs and people living in poverty themselves, whether at European, national, regional or local level.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission can also play a coordinating role. I am not calling for new legislation at EU level. I do not think that is the right way forward. My group, in particular, do not want to see EU legislation on minimum income or on social services of general interest. I am sorry that these have been included in the report, and I have asked for separate votes on these. Having said that, I am a passionate supporter of minimum income schemes brought in by Member States at Member State level.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also need national statistics on poverty to be improved. Another key area is to make sure that current anti-discrimination legislation is properly implemented and that the horizontal directive on access to goods and services is unblocked in Council.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Mr Daerden, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, may I thank Mr Daerden for the true spirit of cooperation that has marked the work of the committee.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First, a small preliminary point. I would like to remind this House that if we want to combat poverty, there is no use trying the employability approach. In other words, nowadays, work is no longer a true protection against poverty. There are millions of poor people in work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to highlight three particular points which I think are vital if we want to make progress with realistic objectives in the fight against poverty within the EU 2020 strategy. Firstly, the call for a legislative proposal on schemes for a minimum income equal to 60% of the average income in each Member State, in accordance with the resolution adopted by our Parliament one year ago. I think that, as the crisis has worsened, we have become aware that such a measure is essential for our poorest citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the call for a framework directive targeted at guaranteeing the quality of, and especially accessibility to, all social services of general interest, particularly in health, education, public transport, energy and water.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, we are re-drafting a call to Member States to adopt at the earliest opportunity the proposal for a wide-ranging, anti-discrimination proposal. I welcome these latter two points which seem to me of utmost importance. We are calling for the implementation of a genuine European strategy to help the homeless. The Commission and the Member States can no longer turn a deaf ear to the issue of poor housing in Europe. A genuine solution must be found to these problems today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also delighted that we have reached a final agreement on negotiations over food aid, but we should not forget that we must now start thinking about the period after 2013, or more generally about earmarking substantial sums from the cohesion policy budget for the fight against poverty and social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to encourage the participation, thanks to this report, of all civil society in the introduction of the platform, because we can only speak for the poor if we do so with them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I shall not be voting for this motion and neither will my group. Why? Because the time for naive and hopeless words has passed, and this is the time to take some action. The root cause of poverty is unemployment. If you want to work, it is our job to provide you with the economic conditions for growth: pure and simple. Tinkering around the edges will not help. It will not help to make sweeping statements about Member States’ welfare systems; it will not help to encroach on Member States’ subsidiarity with regard to minimum wage; it will not help to call for an extension of social protection rights to non-EU citizens; and it will not help for the European Commission to take on the role of dishing out country-specific action plans. Since when did micro-management by Brussels ever help anyone or anything?</p>
      <p sl="en">Nobody denies that poverty is a real and pressing problem, but poverty is not to do with human rights – it is to do with lack of opportunity and lack of incentive to work productively. It is time that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and this plenary got down to their real work: that is, helping Member States grow their economies and reduce their appalling increasing rates of unemployment, particularly for our young people. This motion not only interferes with matters that should be tackled at national level – and they are being tackled in many Member States – but it puts forward proposals which would actually make nations poorer and less able to deal with the problem. I urge people to think again and vote against.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, neoliberal policies and so-called austerity programmes are exacerbating poverty and social exclusion: more than 116 million people are currently at risk of poverty and more than 42 million are surviving under conditions of great material deprivation and extreme poverty. This is nothing short of scandalous in a European Union where big business and the financial sector continue to make large profits.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore condemn so-called austerity policies and programmes, and insist on the need to change profoundly EU economic, financial and social policy, which is the root of current poverty; in particular, the Stability and Growth Pact, the Euro Plus Pact, financial deregulation, and the liberalisation and privatisation of essential public services.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As argued in the draft amendments that we have tabled, we demand the rejection of such pacts and call for their replacement with a social progress and development pact that prioritises jobs with rights, social inclusion, poverty eradication and the promotion of fundamental human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is important that the Commission and the Council stop pressurising the Member States to privatise and liberalise public property, public goods and services, and social protection systems. There can be no effective European strategy for combating poverty without a decisive commitment to support for production, for creating jobs with rights, for promoting universal public services, and for a fair share of income and wealth, not least through minimum incomes, pensions and wages equivalent to at least 60% of each Member State’s median income.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore call for the proposals that we tabled during this plenary sitting to be adopted.</p>

      <p sl="en">How do those countries most in need manage that? Only last month, this House voted to raise the take from Member States by 5%.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, there is one aspect of the whole issue of poverty and social exclusion which has not yet been addressed in this debate, and that is the fact that the Member States of the European Union are importing poverty and social exclusion on a large scale.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Every year, we have hundreds of thousands of immigrants, if not more, arriving from outside the European Union. Right from the outset, a lot of these people go straight into the social security system of the Member State where they have settled. People with no job prospects, people without a chance of integration, people who are, from the start, significantly disadvantaged in terms of their language skills.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I think it is very important that Member States change course and pursue a policy of dissuasion towards potential immigrants who come to Europe and who have no prospect of finding work or becoming integrated. This large-scale importation of poverty should be stopped as soon as possible, because the absorption capacity of the Member States has been more than exceeded.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The report we are debating now rightly highlights the problem of many immigrants from outside the EU ending up in poverty. However, in order to address this problem, it is important that we pursue a restrictive immigration policy and, also, that we find other ways to invest in the countries of origin of these immigrants, so that we can stop wasting money and use it to create jobs there.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Daerden, and Commissioner Andor for this initiative which introduces a European platform against poverty and social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the current crisis, our political actions must be more transparent and there must be greater mobilisation, as we cannot leave it up to associations and NGOs to tackle this problem by themselves. We must mobilise our forces and there is no doubt that we shall have to be more effective. That is what we expect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first point that I would like to make today – and I am very pleased to be able to do so – is that the food aid programme for the most deprived persons puts us in a good position for the 2012 and 2013 campaigns. Rest assured, Commissioner, we shall be fully mobilised over the stability of this programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point that I would like to press is that we must do all we can to combat the problem of young people leaving education with no qualifications. If we allow them to leave education with no qualifications, we will certainly stop them from integrating into society and allow them to sink into poverty. In my view, social integration is both a matter of integrating people into the labour market and of training.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to point out that the European Social Fund is crucial in this respect. As rapporteur for this very European Social Fund, I shall do my utmost to help it play its role in combating poverty. Our European strategy for eradicating poverty must mobilise national action plans and solidarity, one of Europe’s fundamental values.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Daerden, for his excellent work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, you fought and managed to get the objective of combating poverty included in the Europe 2020 strategy. Our current fear is that, with austerity plans, this essential objective may be overlooked.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The conclusion of the agreement on the European food aid programme has left a nasty taste in my mouth as I fear that France and Germany have signed up to abandoning it definitively after 2014. That is not the thrust of the Europe 2020 strategy. We have a sovereign debt crisis and yet nothing should make us deviate from this strategy, as it is our road map, the one that we set for ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the fight against poverty, we must, in the platform that you have introduced, work on more precise indicators, as we still lack the ability to intervene in a targeted fashion with quantified objectives. This would allow us to benefit from intervention from the European Social Fund, in particular, targeted precisely at real trends in poverty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then we would like the issue of minimum income to be raised clearly. We are calling for a consultation by the European Commission on a legal proposal of this nature. That, Commissioner, is your responsibility. We are also calling for the issue of accessibility to social services of general interest to be maintained.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we are calling for the horizontal Anti-discrimination Directive to see the light of day. This is also crucial if this platform for combating poverty and social exclusion is to be a success.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, I want to thank the rapporteur for his report, and indeed the Commissioner for his initiative. This report deals with the reality of life for many citizens, and indeed this is the response from Parliament and it provides a coordinated road map for Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the core aspects of this report is that we have equal rights and equal social protection for all workers. I fully support the initiatives on strengthening the social economy and the idea of a sensible minimum income, and also the implementation of the Anti-discrimination Directive. But I also agree with the sentiments of the rapporteur this morning when he says that dealing with debt and implementing austerity measures should not hit those who are already at risk of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the last few weeks, EU citizens will have listened to Angela Merkel, and others, when she says that Europe is perhaps facing the toughest crisis since the Second World War. She may be right, and her solution to this particular problem is to call for closer political ties and tighter budget rules. In purely economic terms, this may indeed be a possible solution and it might help to balance the books, but the reality for the 80 million people in the EU who are at risk of poverty is that balancing the books on its own is a totally inadequate response. It is no longer sufficient to say we will repair the workings of the current system, plug the holes and carry on as before. If our leaders want the support of their citizens for a new Europe – and they will need that support – they need to implement much of what is in this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for this extremely comprehensive report, which I think should be compulsory reading for every Finance Minister. As my colleague, Ms Harkin, has just been saying, what we are seeing at the moment is a disconnect between macro-economic policy and the effect that it actually has on people’s lives on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to respond to one or two points made by other colleagues this morning – it is a pity they are not still here. The bailouts are not charity. They are about solidarity, and they come with interest rates attached. The ESF itself is about solidarity, and that is why many of us in this House would like to see an increase in the monies going to other countries to help them combat poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the root causes of poverty, I for one do not believe that it is about a lack of opportunity. In some Member States where, for example, every job vacancy is being pursued by at least five unemployed people – before you even begin to look at skills mismatches and geographical mismatches – I think it is a little bit difficult to say that we are going to cut the benefits of people who have not found a job when those jobs are not there.</p>
      <p sl="en">Investment in social protection, as this report makes very clear, makes sound economic sense. It is an economic stabiliser; it helps recovery; it reduces future costs where we have to pick up the pieces of people whose health has deteriorated and whose educational opportunities have been lost; and it keeps the local economy moving.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I also want to see a reduction in the gap between rich and poor. That is what the ‘Occupy’ movement is about – the power of the 1% as against the other 99% – and that is why issues about a living wage and adequate income are essential in this debate.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, poverty and social exclusion must not be underestimated in the current period. I am not sure whether a platform such as the one proposed will help. I nonetheless believe that we should view the economic outlook, if at all possible, in terms of increasing poverty and greater social exclusion. This is unquestionably the result of reduced competitiveness through rigid employment legislation, high taxes on employment and an over generous social system, which de-motivates employers from offering jobs and de-motivates workers from seeking jobs. Policy must create space for people to be able to grow richer on the basis of their own abilities and their own decisions. This requires liberalisation of employment law so that, for example, women can work flexible hours for employers, or work part-time, or so that young people can find a job more easily, as their employers will not be taking too big a risk in the event that either the young person or the employer finds later that the employment relationship is unsuitable or not to their liking. The state must present a robust requalification system for people who have not had a good education, while at the same time ensuring that parents see to it that their children go to school. This applies particularly to the poorest people and to those who really need to get an education. In this context, we need to hold a very serious debate on the so-called minimum wage. Most of you here are perhaps in favour of raising the minimum wage threshold, but you can be sure that any form of codification of a high minimum wage level will mean that the most socially vulnerable and least educated people will lose the opportunity to work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, particularly now, in a period of crisis, it is becoming clear what kind of European Union we really want. Do we want a union where the glue that binds us together is our conviction that people in the Member States of the European Union should not be forced to live in poverty? Do we believe that we have a joint responsibility for combating poverty and social exclusion? Or are we choosing a union like the one just outlined by the Members from the far-right group in Parliament?</p>
      <p sl="de">Sometimes, I think that the attitude of the Member States and, in particular, of some of their governments is bringing us dangerously close to the vision of the European Union that has just been formulated by those on the extreme right-wing. This means not doing anything jointly or putting in place any joint instruments or indicators. Wherever possible, the wording is vague. This is made very, very clear in many of the points in the report. I believe that we need to take a much stronger approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to bring an immediate end to the sell-off of public assets and of social security systems. We need minimum social and environmental standards. This winter, we must not allow people to be thrown out on the street, or deported, or ultimately even to freeze to death, because of rising energy prices. We have a joint responsibility in this respect, in other words, the responsibility of the European Union. We must stand up for this and not for the nationalist claptrap that we have heard from those on the right.</p>

      <p sl="it">Within this framework, we have assembled to discuss plans to support Roma communities and to provide accommodation for immigrants. We should think about helping those social categories that truly find themselves in difficulty and providing both financial and political support to the family, which is the institution on which our society is founded. We should help those small and medium-sized enterprises that have been throttled by the crisis, because SMEs are the true antidote to poverty and the true source of wealth in our countries. We should give precedence to our better forces, and not tax them to guarantee immigrants a minimum wage that Europe wants to drop.</p>
      <p sl="it">Enough natter about the Roma and on immigrants – we now need to give precedence to the truly excluded.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it is with great pleasure that I welcome today’s vote on the report on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion. I hope that a common legal basis will contribute to better coordination and increase the effectiveness of actions aimed at fighting poverty and helping the most needy. Especially in the difficult times of a crisis, which most affect the poorest people, who are often without savings or greater prospects, we must focus our attention on those who are most vulnerable. Governments of countries in search of budget savings tend to reduce spending on social assistance, which exacerbates further the situation facing these people.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In Frédéric Daerden’s report, the proposal to create a basket of basic goods and services that would be available to everyone is particularly relevant. This solution would ensure a necessary minimum for each person and allow for a decent existence. At the same time, such a project must be accompanied by measures aimed at creating jobs, even for the low-skilled, and appropriate policies for social housing.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The goals that we have set in the Europe 2020 strategy are ambitious, but feasible. If the theory and what we put on paper are followed by action taken by the governments of our Member States in collaboration with civil society organisations, we will be able to reduce the number of people remaining on the margins of society.</p>

These are three points that I consider to be of crucial importance, three points that guarantee that, if they become law, they will give hope to Europe.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the financial and economic crisis of 2008 has led to a slowdown in economic growth in Europe, with serious consequences for the living standards of the European population. One of the most serious signs of the decline in living standards is the sharp growth in poverty. Even though I applaud the effort made by the European institutions in the comprehensive fight against poverty and social exclusion, I would like to point out that all of the proposed measures must be funded from somewhere. Economic growth has practically ground to a halt in the Union, and obtaining the money to cover government debt on the financial markets is increasingly hard for Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The only way to obtain funds for the payment of social benefits, unemployment benefits, assistance with food or social housing is therefore to attempt another form of redistribution within the current possibilities afforded by local, regional and state budgets. From this standpoint, I also consider the EU’s proposed 2012 budget, which increases the resources for combating poverty by a mere 3.3% compared to last year, to be inadequate, and it also squanders European money on senseless activities such as the House of European History or Parliament’s regular monthly shuttle between Strasbourg and Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, hundreds of millions of people in the EU are threatened by poverty and social exclusion and one-fifth of them are not able to meet their basic needs. They do not have enough money for food, housing and clothing. The European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion in 2010 raised awareness of the situation of the people affected and gave rise to a number of initiatives, including the creation of decent and dignified jobs, the introduction of minimum wage levels, access to affordable health care, campaigns in socially vulnerable regions and integration projects for immigrants. The Member States are primarily responsible for generating a sense of solidarity with the weakest members of our society. However, at a European level, it is all about financing and coordination. The European platform is part of the Europe 2020 strategy and is also one of seven flagship initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="de">The austerity measures taken during the economic crisis, which are necessary to safeguard our future, must not put jobs and social protection at risk. We must go on making efforts to promote basic education, training and integration into the labour market. We are all responsible for ensuring that the poor do not lose out. Therefore, we must continue to take concrete action to put into practice our fundamental values of solidarity and justice, even in difficult times.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of the request contained in Mr Daerden’s excellent report that urges the Commission to adopt a legislative provision on minimum income.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is very important that the whole of Europe equips itself with an instrument to defend the weakest people and to grant them a decent life and, at times when people lose their jobs or when the search for work is fruitless, it is important that these people have an instrument that guarantees them the possibility to live decently.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is why I believe it is very important to consider a phenomenon which is affecting Europe for the first time – that of the working poor. Historically, the poor were people without work, whereas today, we are faced with a new occurrence: there are people who work – amongst them many women – who are unable to break out from beneath the poverty line with the money they earn at work.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to address this phenomenon, it is of extreme importance to make the robust gifts of vocational training available. Only through knowledge and through learning new skills is it possible to overcome the phenomenon.</p>

      <p sl="it">However, it should also be a moment of truth for Europe with regard to growing social exclusion, and the need to denounce and resolve it. It is enough to read the Caritas reports and speak to volunteers committed to tackling urban poverty to understand the extent of the phenomenon which now affects even those who never thought they would find themselves in a soup kitchen or a hostel.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is enough to look around. A few weeks ago in Paris, in Place de la Bastille, I saw a homeless couple sleeping rough, with a new-born baby between them. There were others in Rue St-Antoine – so we are talking about a wealthy part of Paris – another couple on the ground, on cardboard boxes, with two children under the covers as well. I stopped to look at the reactions of passers-by and, over the course of 15 minutes, no one even stopped to look. The indifference of a large portion of our citizens is another face of this emergency. Last year, I spent a night in Rome with Emmaus volunteers. I learnt a lot, but I also discovered that they were scandalously alone.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We must, more than ever before, meet the commitments undertaken by the European Union in 2010 on the occasion of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion and on the occasion of the creation of a European platform against poverty and social exclusion if we are to have a European framework for social and territorial cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must preserve and optimise European funds, especially the food aid programme which has been maintained for the time being, improve social protection, and support local and national initiatives to develop services for caring for children, the elderly and dependents.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Poverty is a scourge that must be combated horizontally and the time has come for us to take action to lift the most deprived out of their poverty. We must, as political leaders, at European level and at national and local levels, take essential measures to assure them, without discrimination, access to housing, health care, justice and education, as well as a first job with a minimum wage, perhaps indexed to the poverty line in each of the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, poverty is not only a social, but also a human rights issue, a violation of human dignity. Frequently, it results in stigmatisation and discrimination. The criminalisation of the poor can be observed in several countries. The far-right speaks of Gipsy criminality and homeless criminality, and social experts standing up for the poorest can, as seen in Hungary, even end up in the dock if they act according to the ethical code of their profession. When examining national strategies for the reduction of poverty, the Commission must also monitor whether public policies serve that goal, whether the tax system and the system of family benefits reduces social disparities and contributes to the mitigation of child poverty, whether the school system equalises the handicaps children bring with them from home and prevents the passing on of poverty between generations, whether social transfers ensure the right to economic, political, cultural and social participation, and whether universal services are accessible.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Poverty is truly a very serious problem, and effective and rapid action is required to halt the increase of this phenomenon, which is currently affecting more than 80 million Europeans.

I therefore turn to the Commissioner and call for a decision to be adopted as soon as possible on a minimum income for the whole European Union. I also warmly welcome the idea raised in the report that Member States should set adequate minimum pensions so that people who have worked all their lives are not trapped in poverty in old age.

We all need to realise that the social fabric is unravelling and the risk of social disruption in the Union is increasing. The objectives of macro-economic stability may be necessary and painful efforts to achieve fiscal adjustment may be imposed; however, the pledge which all of us made within the framework of the EU 2020 strategy to combat poverty and increase quality employment cannot, and must not, be undermined.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I would like to point out that Mr Daerden is correct in anticipating multidimensional consequences when it comes to poverty. I would like to add one comment to this. Social exclusion has far-reaching implications for the future of democracy, and I believe that we should take this fact into account as well. As regards the report, I have two comments. In 2008, we knew of 80 million people living in poverty, while today we are already talking about 100 million, of whom 20 million are children. It is obvious that the fight against child poverty must take priority, because here the human resources of the future are at stake. What about the others, however? It is also evident that extreme poverty in Europe is unbearable and indeed verges on the violation of human rights. I believe that this, too, should be reflected in our priorities. The other comment I would briefly like to make concerns the monitoring of poverty. After all, even now, we are working with three-year-old data and do not really have information on how the crisis has affected poverty trends. It has probably exacerbated extreme poverty, too. In this respect, I would like to point out that it is not enough to monitor relative poverty only, as there are vast differences between individual countries, and if we were to derive the concept of minimum income from this, we could create major pitfalls.</p>

      <p sl="de">In the employment policy guidelines and the Europe 2020 strategy, we have set ourselves the goal of reducing the number of people at risk of poverty by 20 million. In my opinion, a key factor in this respect is employment, in the form of good jobs. A total of 8% of European employees are classified as working poor and 22% of the people at risk of poverty in Europe have a job. That is a quarter of the population. For this reason, we must begin by introducing fairer labour and social standards and minimum wages.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, in 2010, it was not only the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, but also the year of the euro crisis, and this crisis has become a poverty trap for the entire EU. The approach that has been taken, which involves turning the euro area into a transfer union, will soon lead to the net contributors being dragged in.</p>
      <p sl="de">Alongside the requirements of the Maastricht criteria, some Member States are taking responsibility for the debts of others. Unfortunately, this means that we will have to tighten our belts even further with regard to social spending, and not only in Greece and in the crisis countries in southern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the EU obviously did not envisage this happening when it put together one rescue package after another. There are also hardly any concrete measures to be found in the declarations of intent. Families with several children and single parents in particular are often completely neglected by these policies and the poverty of the parents then has an impact on the future prospects of the children. We must finally recognise that bringing up children and caring for other family members are valuable services for society and deserve payment in return.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to ease the tax burden by introducing family tax splitting, which means that the larger the number of people in a household, the lower the tax rate. In addition, we must make it easier for parents to return to work and establish lower levels of non-wage labour costs which will encourage employers to hire people who have children.</p>
      <p sl="de">Impressive speeches and a year for combating poverty will not solve the real problems. On the contrary, we must take genuine action to eradicate poverty and ensure that the wealthy countries, middle-class families and older people are not dragged down into this maelstrom.</p>

We do not have the time to go into an analysis of the reasons and solutions. I would like to highlight three points. The first is adherence to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is very important and is rightly included in the report. The second point – and before I come to it, I would like to state that the implementation of European Union strategy is important and should be strictly adhered to – is the Europe 2020 strategy. I consider both of these important in this respect. The third point, because there is another issue that severely impacts people with disabilities, is the matter of accessibility. Without physical and communicational accessibility, there can be no solution for these people. This is a very important question in the European Union, and should be resolved as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The growth in poverty in recent years is not just the result of the economic or financial crisis, but arises, above all, from inadequately implemented and feeble policies for reducing and eliminating poverty.

In Poland, around 4 million individuals benefit from this programme. There are 20 000 volunteers and 7 000 organisations working for this programme and for the people who need it. Today, we have heard many beautiful words and declarations while, at the same time, the European Commission and the Council have decided to liquidate the programme.</p>

In the European Union today, we discard millions of tonnes of food, and billions of euro are thrown away as waste food sent for recycling waste.

The European Union must recognise vulnerable categories as one of its priorities, implementing the European platform against poverty and social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="it">I emphasise the need to support the European food distribution scheme to the most deprived people in the EU, in particular, for women who are often the first victims of food poverty. Of fundamental importance is the call to Member States to guarantee adequate support to single-parent families that are at high risk of poverty; this should be not simply economic aid but also social aid through improving access to different facilities, for example, child care institutions. I hope that the European institutions, along with the Member States, will combine their efforts.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I agree with everyone who spoke in the discussion in the spirit of reinforcing our efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion in Europe, at EU level, and also in the Member States. I agree with what was emphasised in the discussion: that the centrality of employment policies – the availability and the quality of jobs – is highly important, and therefore employment policies have to play a stronger role.</p>
      <p sl="en">Wherever possible, job creation has to be front-loaded and cannot just wait until economic growth and recovery creates jobs again at some point. In programme countries, but also in countries where there is greater room for manoeuvre for the government through targeted interventions and initiatives, I believe it is possible to create jobs and reverse the negative trends.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a great role – and this is what we also stressed at the European Platform meeting in Kraków – for social innovation. Perhaps more could have been said about this in today’s discussion. However, we believe that this is going to be an effective tool for finding and disseminating new and effective solutions to poverty. In particular, for example, the situation of minorities and other marginalised and disadvantaged groups, or new areas like digital inclusion, should be explored in this way. That is why it is also very important that, in addition to the ESF and other well-known financial instruments, there will be a new EU-level facility for supporting social innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">More solidarity is needed in the EU but also within the Member States. I believe that, although we are in quite a late and very dangerous phase of the financial crisis, this is now being increasingly recognised. In certain Member States, there are new directions concerning, for example, the role of taxation in fiscal consolidation or the new negotiations on a minimum wage in Germany, which I very strongly welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">This connects with the call which I heard from many participants in the debate about further legislative proposals in this area. I believe legislative proposals should not be ruled out, but they only make sense if they have a chance of being passed and implemented. So we have to continue to look at what is really causing the problem here, and how this should be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that if we look into the question of how we have arrived at this point, with a huge number and an increasing proportion of badly paid jobs, we should pay attention to a trend which is a polarisation of the wage structure in Europe, particularly as a consequence of the large-scale loss of industrial jobs in the recent past, which was aggravated by the financial and economic crisis. That resulted in the disappearance of many medium-paid jobs, the so-called ‘hollowing out’ effect in the labour market. That, I believe, requires primarily a stronger employment dimension to industrial policies, which is why we have to reinforce industrial policies at EU level and make a stronger connection between job creation and the sustainability of jobs and industrial policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with those who stressed or hinted that, if macro-economic policies are half-baked, social policies have a very difficult starting point. This is why it is very important that there is better coherence between all these policies, which is what we would like to achieve in the next European Semester.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I will mention one issue which many Members of the House spoke about: food aid for the deprived. The Commission was, from the very outset, determined to address the legal problem and begin discussions in Council in order to secure the provision of similar quantities of foodstuffs for the next two years. On 3 October, I presented an amended proposal for the pending regulation extending the legal basis to the relevant chapter of the Treaty, i.e. social cohesion. I am extremely happy that the Member States reached a compromise yesterday in the Council. The Commission services will now make the necessary changes in order to ensure the continuation of this scheme.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The European platform against poverty and social exclusion is one of the flagships of the EU 2020 strategy. Combating poverty is quite rightly moving to the fore as a major priority and challenge for the EU: it is our ambition to lift 20 million people out of poverty by 2020. In the past 10 years, the poverty level in the EU has increased or, in the best-case scenario, remained constant. In most countries, the lowest level of benefits and the last safety net has decreased to below the subsistence minimum or minimum wage. We cannot and should not tolerate this: families cannot make ends meet and they live in poverty. I hope that the European platform against poverty and social exclusion will provide an effective platform in our common fight against poverty in the EU. Finally, I would like to turn to the European food programme for the most deprived. Yesterday, a political agreement was reached for the years 2012 and 2013. I think this sends an important signal: after all, the programme is indispensable for around 18 million Europeans whom it supports every year. However, we should certainly not leave it at that: we should also seek to secure proper funding for the post-2013 period so the programme can continue.</p>

      <p sl="cs">On 15 November, the European Parliament debated the report on the European platform for the fight against poverty and social exclusion. It is a sad fact that the EU, as one of the richest areas of the world, has more than 80 million citizens at risk of poverty, of whom 20 million are children and more than 6 million belong to the active population. Such a state of affairs is incompatible with the European values and solidarity enshrined in the Treaties. The financial crisis of 2008 has aggravated this phenomenon, as well as increasing the pressure on the most vulnerable sectors of the population. Although the fight against poverty and social exclusion is exclusively within the jurisdiction of Member States, the EU can play an important role in terms of raising awareness of this problem, improving coordination and financing activities in Member States aimed at tackling poverty and social exclusion. This many-sided problem requires an integrated response, including the joint efforts of all levels of public administration, from European to local authority level. I personally believe that local authorities can implement the most effective tools, as they are closest to these groups, and these tools must be supplemented by systemic measures in social systems at the level of every Member State, with the aim of reducing poverty and social exclusion.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that the Commission’s lack of concern regarding the social implications of the recovery programmes implemented in the European Union is clear. The conservative right has different priorities to the 116 million people who face the risk of poverty and to the 42 million who live in conditions of severe poverty and cannot afford the necessities for a decent life. It is disgusting that the banking sector is much more important to Europe’s decision makers than the fact that more than a quarter of the EU’s population is faced with the scourge of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Poverty and its consequences, which include long-term unemployment affecting one in three unemployed, homelessness, a lack of access to medical care, dropping out of school and social exclusion of the elderly and people with disabilities, are factors which destroy social cohesion between generations and professional groups. I am worried that the platform proposed by the Commission does not take into account the need to combat the increased vulnerability of women, especially of single mothers and elderly women.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the Commission to become more involved in supporting European citizens in the fight against poverty and social exclusion.

      <p sl="sk">The economic crisis is having a profound impact throughout the EU, and the number of people at risk of poverty – which stood at 80 million even before the crisis – continues to rise. I would also like to make some comments on the report that are related to the crisis. The acute ‘anti-crisis’ measures are pushing the Europe 2020 strategy measures completely into the background. These include, specifically, inclusive growth, targets related to reducing poverty and social exclusion, and policies for boosting investment in the social area.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would also like to call on the Commission to carry out a study of the social impacts of the approved anti-crisis measures. I would be very interested to hear the Commission’s estimates of the social impacts resulting from the policy of cost-cutting, the package of measures on economic governance or the Euro Plus pact. I am quite sure that these are the wrong measures at this time, precisely because they ignore the issues of poverty and social exclusion. The Commission should therefore establish an independent monitoring mechanism to verify these concerns in the field.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to end with a small, specific comment on the text regarding the platform. The text talks about ‘social experimentation’.

Crisis management must not therefore overshadow but strengthen anti-poverty measures, since they are indispensable for ensuring the sustainable and inclusive growth enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy. In this light, I would like to welcome this report on this important flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy and the fact that it dedicates a whole section to the inclusion of Roma, who are way over-represented among the poorest. Equally important and mutually reinforcing with the Europe 2020 national reform programmes are the national Roma inclusion strategies, which are to be submitted to the Commission by the end of this year, and I truly hope that despite any political upheaval or budgetary hardship in some of the Member States, the Commission will thoroughly evaluate the professional substantiation, complexity and financial feasibility of the national strategies, and that it will also present specific recommendations for their revision.</p>

The European Union faces a serious challenge, because responsibility for the fight against the many forms of social exclusion primarily rests with the Member States which, struggling with economic problems, introduce savings, and these often primarily affect the most vulnerable people. Therefore, all action taken by the European Commission and Parliament to support the Member States in combating poverty and social exclusion is important. Neither can we allow money from the European Social Fund to be used inefficiently. Millions of euro must not be spent on training which does not help the unemployed to return to work or gain the new qualifications they need.

Although the European Union is one of the wealthiest regions in the world, as a result of the economic crisis, poverty and the number of people living on the poverty line has increased significantly. Young people in the European Union are in the most difficult economic situation, and unemployment among them is the highest. In order to avoid falling below the poverty line, they are forced to choose the status of the ‘eternal student’ or live with their parents for longer. Women, whose rate of employment is 13% lower than that of men, and who earn considerably less than men, are also in a complicated situation. As a result, the income of female pensioners is lower, and their risk of falling into poverty is higher.

At this time of financial difficulty especially, it is important that the EU does not forget about those most in need in our society. Poverty is an issue that must be combated through cooperation between Member States and the EU. At Member State level, nations should consider a wide range of areas, including particular emphasis on education and health, in order to reduce both current and future poverty. Job creation and training should be considered to help those currently struggling below the poverty line. Further investment in education at all levels should be incorporated to prepare future generations to stay out of poverty. Likewise, health, sanitation and other concerns related to individuals’ wellbeing must be addressed. The EU as a whole needs to address poverty through ambitious leadership, such as setting the 2020 target of liberating 20 million people from poverty.

Many EU citizens are suffering from or at risk of acute poverty and the crisis is making this regrettable situation worse. In Austria alone, 12% of the population is at risk of poverty and half of these people are obviously poor. In the majority of Member States which do not have a well developed welfare state, the position is much more extreme. We are responsible for offering these people escape routes. Therefore, we must put in place concrete measures to combat poverty. It is essential for us to strengthen the welfare state and to ensure that high-quality public services are available to everyone. It is not enough to fight against the consequences of poverty. Most importantly, we must identify concrete strategies for preventing poverty. The report recognises the special needs of the groups which are most at risk. It acknowledges that the emphasis of measures to combat child poverty must lie with prevention and, therefore, it makes an important contribution to long-term, sustainable action which will help us to achieve one of the central objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy; in other words, reducing the number of people at risk of poverty by 20 million by 2020.</p>

Unemployment among young people has shot through the roof in the EU following the economic crisis; it is now over 20% and is reaching critical levels in all the Member States. Allow me to add some figures from my country, from Greece. In a recent survey, 60% of Greeks stated that they live in fear of waking up poor one day, while 50% believe that anyone may ‘be made’ poor by a random event, such as illness or dismissal late in life. The so-called ‘EUR 700 generation’ is the subject of research for contemporary sociologists and economists. Everyone wonders how they manage. As stated in the report, the number of impoverished workers at European level has increased significantly, with 8% of workers living in severe deprivation and 22% of workers at risk of poverty. These numbers should worry us, especially as the Arab Spring was set off by dissatisfaction among young people and their disappointment in their leaders, who failed to offer them a future.

      <p sl="hu">Poverty in Europe, which threatens about eight per cent of the population, highlights the fact that additional efforts are required in order to achieve one of the most important objectives of European integration, that is, increasing the standard of living of European citizens and maintaining it at a high level. At the same time, when looking for the geographic region of Europe where the phenomenon of poverty is most prevalent, our attentions are easily turned to the new Member States and the region of Central and Eastern Europe. For this reason, I believe that one of the greatest challenges confronting the EU is regional cohesion and the reduction of the developmental disparities that exist between the regions of Europe. The European values enshrined in the Treaties include solidarity, which clearly implies the maintenance and further reinforcement of cohesion policy. In addition to having a beneficial effect on the economies of the Member States, support to economically less developed regions also approximates the standards of living of citizens in various regions of Europe and thereby contributes to the building of a common Europe and the strengthening of a European identity. Implementation of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, including the reduction of poverty, also requires the strengthening of national economies and the acceleration of their economic growth. The European Union, too, can make a contribution to this, for example, through cohesion policy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to encourage projects and initiatives which are aimed at increasing life expectancy in developing countries, covering the lack of medical care in underdeveloped countries and implementing measures intended to raise the whole world’s awareness of parasitic diseases, not to mention projects aimed at granting immediate assistance to deprived families in the EU, not only assistance which may take the form of food, but also access to drinking water, clothing, housing, sanitary facilities, education and information.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is our job to do our utmost to eradicate poverty, reduce infant mortality and increase life expectancy. The European platform against poverty and social exclusion is an excellent tool for us to achieve these objectives.</p>

      <p sl="de">Despite the fact that the European Union is one of the wealthiest regions in the world, it is a cause for great concern that more than 80 million people within the EU are, at the very least, at risk of poverty. The fact that 20 million of them are children is particularly alarming. In 2010, we had the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. This theme was chosen to highlight once again the EU objective of combating poverty and to promote this issue more effectively. We will only be able to make real progress in this area if there is a determination to take a joint approach, involving measures at all levels that support and complement one another.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I thank the rapporteur for the accurate preparation of the report and for reminding us of the challenges associated with the situation of the poorest. Mr Daerden has rightly stressed the importance of the fight against poverty – poverty among Europeans is one of the main threats to social order in the 21st century. The statistics do not instil optimism. In countries commonly thought of as highly developed, millions of people suffer because of poverty. The scale of the problem is huge, so it is important to promote all initiatives which encourage action on this issue, at both national and EU level. People who are extremely poor often do not know their rights, and are therefore also unable to utilise the help available. Their situation is often the result of a course of events beyond their control, so measures to improve their situation should be undertaken largely by the state. I know the Commission’s initiative which designated the year 2010 as European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion certainly helped to intensify action to improve integration within European society. It is up to us to continue to work for the inclusion of all those who are excluded from society.</p>

The specific topic for Question Time is the future of the cohesion policy and of the CAP.

The rules are that each Member has one minute to put his or her question and 30 seconds to put a supplementary. The Commission has two minutes to reply if only one Commissioner is to be responsible for answering. If more than one Commissioner is to reply, each Commissioner has one minute speaking time.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Because of the difficulty of trying to establish a fair speaking list based on the fact that you simultaneously raise your hands – and it is perfectly reasonable you should do that – we will try and be as accurate as possible in reflecting those who were in the Chamber from the beginning. At 11 o’clock, I will let you know who is likely to be called. Last time, and the time before, we got through about 20 questions and there were about 50, or at least 40, of you in the Chamber, so it is only fair that those of you who are not going to be called should be told at about 11 o’clock; otherwise, it is going to waste your time.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ms Herranz García, I am going to reply to both of your questions. The removal of the sugar quota is subject to legislative proposals that are already awaiting discussion by the Council and Parliament. The Council and Parliament will then be able, in codecision, to comment on the Commission’s position. A decision on the issue of planting rights for vineyards was already taken during the reform of the wine sector by the Council. This matter is also subject to a regulation by the Council, which has already decided to remove planting rights. Next year, however, the Commission is due to present a progress report on the implementation of the wine sector reform. It will be presented to Parliament and the Council. This will provide a further occasion for Parliament and the Council to provide comment if they wish to make any adjustments. In any case, I am happy for this matter to be discussed.</p>

Parliament will now be able to decide along with the Council. I do not know whether it had a majority or not, but in 2008, it was the Council that ended up deciding to remove planting rights. So, the Council, with legislative powers, will, of course, be able to revisit the matter. I am personally happy for this issue to be discussed and if we can create a link between certain winegrowing areas, wine quality and planting rights, I am prepared for this matter to be debated again.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there is broad agreement both in Parliament and in the Commission on the future importance of cohesion policy for all the regions in Europe. I would like to ask Mr Hahn how the Commission intends to ensure that genuine flexibility within the regions can be guaranteed, given the differences between the regions and their different levels of growth, if everything is being controlled with great precision under the terms of the regulations and there is hardly any scope to accommodate the specific features of each region.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Krehl, firstly, the objective of future cohesion policy is to follow the Europe 2020 strategy very closely and establish close links with it in order to support and promote the goals of the strategy, in part, by making targeted investments in the regions. Against this background, we have suggested that it is important to set priorities and decide on the main areas of emphasis, which must be chosen by the regions themselves. However, given that concentrated funding is needed in particular in the better developed regions, we have also proposed that there should be a minimum allocation in certain areas. For example, in the area of energy efficiency and energy saving, we believe that in the better developed regions, at least 20% of the available budget from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) should be employed for this purpose. A further 60% should be used to promote small and medium-sized businesses and innovation. However, these are frameworks within which the regions can take a flexible approach. In the case of the subsidy arrangements of the better developed regions in particular, the structures in place in the regions already meet the requirements in many areas. Therefore, I believe that this will not cause any problems for the majority of regions.</p>

My question for Mr Hahn is as follows: on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I welcome the fact that you have put in place percentages for a low carbon economy, but what is happening with regard to climate mainstreaming?</p>
      <p sl="de">My question for Mr Andor is: you have had the courage to impose percentages on the Member States with regard to the ESF. We in the Group of the Greens very much welcome this.

      <p sl="en">I believe that, in a way, Europe 2020 and the MFF are very closely connected. In a way, their credibility also depends on each other. If we just speak about the need for more social exclusion projects and fighting poverty in Europe without really supporting it, and without really working very closely in an alliance with the Member States and other stakeholders to implement it, I believe we would have a credibility problem and a lack of efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even so, we have a very difficult task ahead, and this is just the minimum of EU funds which we believe is absolutely necessary to devote to such causes. Every Member State has a to-do list in this area.

Secondly, we will be endeavouring to ensure that these principles are a central theme running through the partnership contracts and that the local and regional authorities incorporate these considerations, including the effects on climate change, into their evaluation of the projects which are to be or already have been submitted.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission’s proposals to green pillar one are leading to a great deal of uncertainty amongst the farming communities. In the case of England, farmers have embraced agri-environment schemes, with over 68% of England’s utilisable agricultural area covered by schemes such as the Entry Level Stewardship Scheme.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of these five-year agreements are coming to an end and farmers are looking to make decisions on whether to renew their agreements for a further five years. Farmers fear that there might be some overlap between the proposals to green pillar one and the requirements of the stewardship schemes. Will the Commission confirm that if there is an overlap, and the legal baseline or goalposts are indeed changed as a result of greening pillar one, those farmers who are participating in stewardship schemes would be able to leave these schemes once greening comes into force without penalty or recourse to pay back monies?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr Karim, there will not be any overlap as the greening of the aid for pillar one, which the Commission is now proposing, does not affect the agri-environmental measures in any way as they are funded within the rural development fund through contractual agreements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The rural development programme will therefore go forward and current agreements will be funded until the end of the budgetary period, at the end of 2013. Then, from 2014 onward, within the new rural development programme, Member States will still be able to apply agri-environmental measures as the budget for this programme remains unchanged.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we are proposing with the greening of the aid for pillar one is a global European approach with three simple measures which do not affect the rural development programme as it stands, namely, agri-environmental measures which are specific to a particular region.

Any such reduction in direct subsidies will wipe out the Greek agricultural sector.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr Chountis, what has been proposed for certain Member States is a reduction, but in no instance does it exceed 6% compared with the current period.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This reduction was proposed in order to be able to fund the increase in direct payments in Member States where the average direct payment per hectare is well below the European average. In the case of Greece, I do not remember the exact figure, but direct payments per hectare exceed EUR 350 on average, and can even reach EUR 400, while in Member States such as the Baltic countries, direct payments per hectare are currently under EUR 150. In Latvia, they are even under EUR 100.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are proposing a rebalancing, one that, as far as I can see, is acceptable insofar as the reduction is under 6%, as I was saying, compared with current figures, and, furthermore, the reduction will not take place overnight.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is proposing a transition period so that the reduction will take place progressively from now until 2018. Solidarity is a principle of the European Union, as is fairness, and it is on this basis that we have proposed this rebalancing.

      <p sl="en">Commissioner, we do not feel that you answered our question. There are many people in Britain who have land in environmental schemes. It may occupy 1% of their farmland. What they want to know is whether this 1% will count towards the 7% of greening that you intend to bring in, or will the 7% of greening be additional to the 1% they have already put in? As these schemes last for five years, many of them have to renew this year and they need to know. If it is going to be additional, they will simply not go into these contracts.</p>

      <p sl="fr">What we proposed for the ‘greening’ has no effect on the agreements for environmental measures currently enjoyed by farmers within the rural development programme. The 7% is not the 7% of greening, but rather one of the 7% measures targeted at the ecological infrastructure at the level of the farm, or rather surface areas and small plots of land which are kept under vegetation that is not used as part of agricultural production. However, if a British farmer uses the rural development programme to plant trees, for example, or to maintain hedges around plots of land, these areas will come under this 7% and thus the farmer will still be able to benefit from this specific aid in the rural development programme for which he or she has an agreement. However, I was saying that there is no link because these greening measures are not contractual, nor are they multiannual. They are annual and the commitment by a farmer within an agreement for agri-environmental measures will remain in force until the end of 2013. After 2013, if a Member State decides to continue these measures, the farmer will still be able to benefit. However, once the farmer, with the aid of this agri-environmental programme, has, for example, created plantations, maintained areas, plots of land and even grassy verges, these areas will count towards this 7%. He will not need to do any more as these areas will count towards this 7%.</p>

      <p sl="en">On the issue of cropping, this is madness and surely you can see that. One of our NFU members in Britain has said that forcing farmers to grow three different crops of certain percentages is Stalinist! It is, and how is it going to help the environment?</p>

      <p sl="fr">You asked two questions. One was about capping and the other was about the 7% of ecological infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the case of the 7% for ecological infrastructure, I should like to make myself clear. This does not mean withdrawing 7% of arable land and taking crop production out of it. It means that on a farm, it is also possible to maintain small plots, grassy verges, canal banks, roadside verges, treed areas, which are not necessarily productive and which, at present, are not entitled to subsidy. From 2014, we are proposing not only for these areas to be entitled but we are even encouraging farmers to maintain them, because alongside productive arable land, all these areas, these small plots, have an important role to play in biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as the capping of direct aid goes, this will not prevent the farmer from choosing what he wants to produce. This capping means that while, from 2014 onwards, we can justify direct payment to farmers as basic income support, from a certain sum in the case of very large companies, we can no longer justify limitless amounts of public money being given as basic income support. That is why we proposed to cap this support at EUR 300 000 and to take into account employment on the farm. Thus, a large farm which has a labour force will also, in addition to the EUR 300 000, be able to take into account labour costs and include them in the direct support. However, large-scale farms will still be able to benefit from other kinds of measure within the common agricultural policy to invest, modernise and innovate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Direct payments are not the only forms of support that a farm can call on within the common agricultural policy. We need greater transparency, greater clarity and greater effectiveness when it comes to spending public money. That is why we have proposed limiting direct payments, but the door remains open for other kinds of project capable of increasing the competitiveness of a large-scale farm.</p>

      <p sl="en">Commissioner Cioloş, I come from Northern Ireland. The single farm payment there is largely based on a hybrid model – a mixture of flat rate and historic. What assessment have you made of the impact of the transition for those Member States who have this historic reference period for the single farm payment? What timing do you envisage for this within Member States and will there be flexibility within the Member States? It is important in all of this that we do not allow farmers to go out of production.</p>
      <p sl="en">On a completely different note, in Northern Ireland, we have, like many other countries in Europe, particular problems with social exclusion, high unemployment among young people, etc. That has been dealt with in some measure by PEACE funding within my region. Can you assure me of the broad support of the College for future PEACE funding within the region as a tool to tackle social exclusion and unemployment, as well as ESF funding?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ms Dodds, as regards the system, the historic reference period and the new payments system we are proposing, the historic reference period presupposes that for some years, a farm has been receiving an annual payment based on the levels of subsidy it was receiving fifteen years ago. In the hybrid model, as you were saying, part of the subsidies is based on a historic reference period and another part on a rebalancing that takes place at regional level. This hybrid system is therefore much closer to what the Commission is currently proposing, namely, a flat-rate payment at regional level, or, in other words, similar support to farms operating under the same agro-economic and climatic production conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to achieve this, Member States already have the flexibility to define, in terms of their chosen criteria, namely agronomic, economic, administrative, and pedoclimatic criteria, homogenous regions within which they will carry out a rebalancing of payments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, it is possible for this rebalancing to be carried out until the end of 2019, in other words, in 2019 for payment made in 2020, and consequently in the future budgeting period. Thus, it will not be brought in abruptly and Member States will have flexibility in defining regions and their size on the basis of criteria of their choice.</p>

I would like to ask the Commission how it hopes to deal with improving the capacity of Member States to absorb the funds – I believe a large proportion may not be used in the current financial period – and particularly with helping local administrations put in good projects and to ensure their projects are utilised.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, we have the macro-conditionality which is supposed to come in, which says that payments are to stop if countries do not fulfil the Stability Pact. So you have two questions in one: one concerns utilisation and the other actually stopping the funds.</p>

      <p sl="de">Our goal and also our job, which is part of the way we see ourselves as regional politicians, must be to help, for example, weak administrative bodies and bureaucratic organisations which are in need of development to increase their capacity and improve their ability. This will enable them to implement suitable projects which can then be subsidised and ultimately will allow us to guarantee the absorption rate.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of macro-economic conditionality, it is important to remember that this is a last-ditch measure. If the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact are not met, there are requirements concerning the measures which Member States have to take. Generally, and this is what has happened in the past, the countries respond accordingly. Their efforts are not always successful, but the intention is there and they make an attempt, so this would not justify the application of macro-economic conditionality. This must be used when a country persistently refuses to apply the measures proposed by the Commission and accepted by the Council to improve the economic situation. There must be the option of a last resort which can be used in this case. However, I am assuming that in future, this will continue to be possible in principle, but that in practice, it will hopefully never be applied.</p>

However, 2011 is the reference year for those farmers who are entitled to apply for these aids precisely to avoid any speculation in 2012 or 2013, and for farmers, who were not then farmers, registering with certain areas with the sole aim of claiming entitlements to subsidies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Over that period, we shall provide the opportunity for young farmers who set up in 2012 and 2013 to be included and we shall also give Member States the opportunity to take into account specific circumstances as was the case in the 2003 reform.</p>

Different scientific studies demonstrate that trees are more capable of reducing CO2 levels than meadows and pastures.</p>
      <p sl="it">Considering the dispositions of direct payments, which anticipate that 7% of farmed land should be set aside for ecological purposes, what, Commissioner, will happen in the case of an olive farm that already comprises within it dry-stone walls and rows of trees, and that includes centuries-old trees of important value to both the landscape and the economy?</p>
      <p sl="it">Do you not think that such farms are already sufficiently sustainable from an environmental point of view, and that the application of the required 7% indicated above would instead risk causing harm to economic sustainability and the environment, with farmers forced to cut down part of their olive grove?</p>

      <p sl="fr">The proposal, put like this, recognises the role of tree plantations in the environment as the crop rotation measure is not proposed. However, the measure that involves keeping 7% of the farm for ecological focus areas can easily be applied to tree plantations, because zones and areas between rows of trees or forest borders can easily be kept under grass. This is a system that works well in fruit tree production, for example, which is part of the technology and which also has a positive impact thanks to keeping certain strips of land under grass.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, if there are areas of land in an olive plantation which, after every two or three rows, are kept under grass, this can benefit production and, in any case, will not harm it. Farmers do not need to cut down trees and, furthermore, the 7% can be met. Therefore, 7% over a plantation, where a strip after every third or fourth row remains under grass, will be sufficient. This will be the only greening measure planned for a farm of this nature as tree plantation is recognised in itself as having a positive effect in reducing CO2.</p>

      <p sl="en">This is for Commissioner Cioloş. Scottish tenant farmers are deeply concerned about the proposals to change from the historic-based payment system to the area-based payment system when they have to make the claim for entitlement in 2014. This is a similar question to Mr Kelly’s. You have introduced the reference year of 2011 to make sure that it is genuine tenant farmers who will be able to claim the entitlements, but there is still a great worry that many will lose their short-term tenancies before that date and it will be the landowner who makes the claim and not the tenants.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr Lyon, when it comes to entitlement to aid, to financial support under the common agricultural policy, the principle is very clear: the beneficiary of the support is the person who works the land. That can be the owner if it is he who works the land, or else it can be the tenant. Therefore, if a farmer can clearly demonstrate with documentation that he works the land, he will be entitled to the aid. In any event, for the first pillar, in other words, direct payments, it is clearly the farmer who is the beneficiary of the support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is precisely why we decided to use 2011 as the reference year, that is, before the legislative proposals are announced, in order to avoid any speculation in circumstances where a landowner who lets land to farmers finds out that the conditions for entitlement to support have been reviewed, and takes the land away from the tenants and registers himself as a farmer. That is why the reference year is prior to the presentation of the legislative proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Member States will also have mechanisms to enable them to check these documents and ensure that the person requesting financial support is, in fact, the farmer and not the owner.</p>

      <p sl="en">That still does not clarify the point, because unless you are only going to give the new aid to exactly the same people who claimed it in 2011 – if that is what you are suggesting – then it begs the question of what happens to all the new entrants who clearly did not have a claim in 2011. I am not clear how you seek to make sure, firstly, that tenants are protected, and secondly, how new entrants or farmers who do not have a single farm payment can make claims for the new entitlements in 2014. There is a contradiction there.</p>

      <p sl="fr">That means that only those farmers who are in the database in 2011 will be able to request financial support, but they will be able to request support on the basis of the agricultural area they register in 2014 as there may be changes between 2011 and 2014.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We already provide Member States with the opportunity of including areas that were not originally registered for support; there may therefore be farmers who increase their areas between 2011 and 2014. That is why 2014 is the reference year for areas and 2011 is the reference year for farmers. This should prevent any new ‘speculator’ farmers from appearing in the meantime. However, between 2011 and 2014, the Member States will still be able to include new farmers, but only on the basis of clear supporting evidence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With these two references, 2011 for farmers and 2014 for areas, we can be sure that there will not be any speculation by farmers and that, at the same time, the actual area in 2014 will be taken into account.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The worst problem in the Baltic Sea is eutrophication, and the biggest source of the eutrophicating nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus, is agriculture – agriculture in EU countries. An excess of nutrients results in huge rafts of toxic algae on the surface of the sea and dead zones devoid of oxygen at the bottom. The zone devoid of oxygen at the bottom of the Baltic Sea is the largest among all the world’s maritime areas. I would like to ask if the Commission will now take absolutely seriously its responsibility to rescue the Baltic as part of agricultural development.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As far as the Baltic Sea is concerned, I think that it is a bit of an exaggeration to say that agriculture alone is responsible. There is also industrial activity. However, agriculture is perhaps the only sector where European financial support is already conditional, through environmental cross-compliance, on certain requirements, including measures governing the use of chemical substances. That is therefore already laid down in legislation. The greening measures that we are now proposing are also going to help to improve the situation because diversification of crops on the same plot prevents single-crop farming, for example, and also prevents extensive use of chemical products in agricultural production technologies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In terms of the bureaucracy you mentioned for these greening measures, I can reassure you that we have carried out an analysis to enable us to propose the measures that are the simplest to apply and the least bureaucratic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The three measures that we have proposed for this aspect of greening, in other words, maintenance of permanent pasture, crop diversification and an ecological focus area in each farm covering 7%, can be applied right across the European Union. Farmers will not need any additional documents because they can confirm compliance with these measures when submitting their request for financial support, nor will there be any need for additional monitoring other than the normal farm checks carried out to verify entitlement for financial support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In that regard, too, we have opted for the measures that have the greatest global impact across Europe, if all farmers apply them, with the least bureaucracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Maybe my question was translated wrongly. I did not say agriculture is the only source of eutrophicating substances in the Baltic Sea. I said it is the biggest one. It is a sad fact that agriculture in the Baltic Sea catchment area is by far the biggest source of phosphorous and nitrogen in the Baltic Sea. These cause eutrophication, which is the biggest environmental problem in the Baltic Sea. It is, of course, a fact that there are also other sources, but these other sources, like waste water from cities and industry, have been cleaned up a lot, and agriculture lags far behind these measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I repeat my question: will the Commission take it seriously that agriculture is the biggest source of eutrophicating substances in the Baltic Sea? Without new measures in agriculture, there is no hope of improving the very bad current ecological situation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ms Hassi, this is a typical situation where we can apply the agri-environmental measures of the rural development programme; measures that enable the Member States to deal with a specific issue in a region by encouraging farmers to use farming practices that are adapted to that specific situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this case, the Baltic countries or the countries bordering the Baltic Sea can themselves encourage farmers to use farming practices that require fewer chemicals, thereby putting the emphasis on the specific situation of the soil there. As I said, the greening measures that we are proposing now are linked to direct payments across the European Union and involve simple measures that can be applied everywhere. Crop rotation, for example, or crop diversification, which we have proposed, would also enable farmers to reduce the amount of chemicals used and, consequently, the amount of discharge. However, the Member States with Baltic coasts can deal with this matter specifically through the agri-environmental measures laid down in the rural development programme.</p>

      <p sl="fr">However, once we reach a certain amount, we cannot justify giving large holdings more than EUR 300 000, EUR 400 000, EUR 500 000 or even EUR 1 million in basic income support, because it is a capital payment. In addition to this direct support, which will be restricted, these holdings can improve their performance by using other financial instruments under the common agricultural policy, such as aid for investment in modernisation to make them more efficient. Indeed, we made this proposal precisely also to respond to Parliament’s demand for financial support that is more transparent, clearer and better targeted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any event, the funds raised under this ceiling remain within the Member State concerned, so a Member State that has large holdings is not affected from a budgetary point of view because the money stays in the Member State. It is added to the rural development programme under which the Member State can finance large companies, small companies, agri-environmental measures, investment, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is thus just a question of using Community funds with greater transparency, greater flexibility and greater efficacy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I do not believe that large farms will be discriminated against by this measure because it applies to all large farms, be they in Eastern Europe or Western Europe. One cannot say that a large farm will be discriminated against in comparison to a small or medium-sized farm because the role of this direct aid is precisely to support farmers’ incomes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For a large farm, over and above EUR 300 000, if it has jobs, then they will count. For instance, if a farm provides 20 jobs, the cost of maintaining those jobs will be added to the EUR 300 000. We are therefore supporting jobs in the countryside. If a farm is operating purely to obtain subsidies, and if it splits to obtain even more, then I think that there is an economic problem with that farm, which has goals other than economic success. If the goal is to seek subsidies, then there is a problem. However, if a farm wants to be economically successful under the common agricultural policy, it can be supported, as I said, through other types of measures aimed specifically at improving economic performance, reducing production costs, promoting products on the market, etc. The common agricultural policy is not just about subsidies; it also comprises other measures that will enable farms, including large farms, to adapt better to the current economic situation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Parliament and the Council also have a withdrawal option, which is a good thing. However, I believe that the situation has got rather out of hand and that these acts are being used in the case of questions which we in Parliament should be deciding on together with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">One example is the common strategic framework, Articles 10 and 11 of the general regulation, which lays down goals for subsidies from the Cohesion Fund, important challenges in the territorial area and actions to be taken centrally. My question is: why have you chosen the delegated act in the case of such an important document, for example, and not the ordinary legislative procedure? In this context, perhaps you can make some general remarks about the problems of delegated acts.</p>

We must look at the substance of the proposals and the concepts that we are able to develop and draw up. I am very confident about this. It is the first attempt to bring the different funds together under one roof, with joint administration of the financing. We need to consider what sort of proposals we can submit, probably in January, and then think about how we should continue. I am assuming that this question, at least in terms of its content, will be dealt with by the relevant parliamentary committee.</p>

You have said that it will probably not be used at all, or at least only in an emergency or a similar situation.

      <p sl="de">There is no safeguard to prevent this from happening. However, I would like to emphasise once again that this is a last resort, which is used when all the preceding measures have had no effect. I am assuming and I am confident, on the basis of the experiences we have had up until now, that the countries affected will respond accordingly to the proposals and requirements of the Commission and also of the Council and will make an effort to improve the situation. That is precisely the foundation that we need to ensure that we do not have to use this measure. Of course, it is also important to respect the relevant national regulations. The proposal clearly states that when this instrument is used, it must be applied proportionally and in accordance with the local conditions. For example, the money from the Structural Fund has different levels of importance in different countries. We also need to take this into account when using this instrument.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to repeat that I have every confidence that this is an instrument of last resort. We need to look at this against the background of the fact that we have an opportunity as part of the ‘six-pack’ within the euro area which does not apply to the other non-euro countries and that we were required on the basis of fairness and balance to propose and to create an instrument which, in theory, would ultimately include all 27 countries.</p>

As part of the annual clearance of accounts procedure, the Commission has called for the return of agricultural funding of EUR 214 million which has been used in contravention of the rules by the Member States. The main area where a problem needed to be resolved was, interestingly enough, a direct payment of EUR 125.8 million which included Greece with EUR 10 million, Italy with EUR 79 million and also Sweden. Therefore, I have to ask: have these countries already paid back the subsidies and, if so, is there an appropriate timeframe for processing the cases?</p>

In certain situations, where the amounts are very high and the Member State concerned cannot pay it all back in one go, we can propose, if necessary, payment by instalments over a certain period of time. That is currently the case with Greece, for example. However, the situation is always monitored very rigorously.

      <p sl="fr">For Member States where there is a problem with the quality of the database, in the initial years, we apply penalties that are proportional to the errors observed in the on-the-spot audit. If, by the end of the second or third year, we see that the errors have not been resolved, we ask the Member States to implement recovery plans, and if they do not implement them, we then block their funds. We have had situations where funds have been blocked. For each Member State, we have these very strict monitoring instruments. We can even go so far as to withdraw the accreditation of a payment agency that does not have correct databases or does not have the capacity to carry out checks. In any event, as soon as we see that the errors on the ground exceed a certain minimum threshold, we take the following measures: firstly, we apply penalties, then secondly, we request an action plan and, finally, as a third measure, we block payments.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Cioloş, Mr Hahn, it is very good that we have the opportunity today to discuss issues with both of you. Therefore, I would like to ask a question about the multifund approach which is being introduced in the new financial period and which allows joint projects to be established using the Structural Funds and the rural development fund. How do you think the application process and the organisation will work? What do you plan to do to keep red tape to a minimum and to introduce monitoring procedures? With regard to the previous question, is cross-compliance relevant in this respect?</p>

      <p sl="de">Ms Jeggle, this multifund concept specifically allows for joint use of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) within one operational programme. There is no plan to establish operational programmes which also make use of the rural development fund. The multifund concept relates particularly to the two funds that I have mentioned, the ERDF and the ESF.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, what we are intending, and this is in the spirit of the joint strategic framework, is to ensure better coordination between the programmes and to establish uniform goals relating to what we ultimately plan to achieve with these programmes. One of the results should also be an improvement for end users in terms of bureaucracy and processing which will make it clear which funding is being used for each purpose. We also want to avoid overlaps between the programmes and guarantee the additional element. However, as I have said, multifund, in the strictest sense of the word, refers to the ERDF and the ESF, which will be used within one operational programme.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As regards the coordination of the rural development instrument and the other Structural Funds with the partnership contracts between the Commission and the Member States and regions, this will, at the strategic planning phase for use of this fund, allow the regions to ensure that the various programmes complement one another with a view to resolving the problems concerned. In this case, the Member States and the regions will have to draw up a set of indicators to show how they will achieve certain objectives that have been laid down in the Europe 2020 strategy by using the various funds in the different sectors of the economy. That will therefore enable us, at the strategic planning phase, to use this coordination and organise clear discussions between the Commission’s services and the various services of the respective Member States. In that regard, coordination with the partnership contracts will be better from 2014.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Cross-compliance is enshrined in legislation that already exists at European level: environmental legislation that covers not only the agricultural sector but also the industrial sector and other sectors of the economy. When it comes to agriculture, it was decided that entitlement to these subsidies should be conditional upon compliance with existing legislation. In this respect, however, we have also tried, through the legislative proposals that you and the Council are currently examining, to simplify and clarify the cross-compliance measures that apply to farmers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These measures were previously included in different directives and regulations, but now we have grouped them together and clarified what is required of farmers and what the authorities must check. We have also reduced the number of measures by doing away with the measures that were not relevant or important from an environmental or economic point of view but had a higher administrative cost.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The simplification document, which I have already sent to members of Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture, contains all of the details on the simplification of cross-compliance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Thank you very much for your first response. My additional question relates to the continuation of the Interreg programme. How important is it to you and how important should it be to us that there is cross-border activity in the programmes? In this context, I would like to refer to the situation regarding a strategy for the Danube region. What opportunities will you make available for programmes and what emphasis will you give this strategy?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-141-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Johannes Hahn" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="de">Firstly, I would like to say that cross-border cooperation is very important to us. It has proved to be extremely useful, productive and forward-looking. More and more regions are identifying a need for cross-border, transregional cooperation. That is the reason why, in our statement of estimates, we have proposed an increase of around 30% in this area. I know that this corresponds with Parliament’s view and I hope that the Member States see things in the same way. This has not always been the case in the past, but in the interim, we have completed many successful projects which the individual Member States have ultimately benefited from. The strategy for the Danube region, like all macro-regional strategies, is characterised by the fact that existing regional and national structural programmes should be used for projects which are implemented in the context of a macro-regional strategy, for example, in the Danube region. This is why it is a good thing that we have started these strategies in the current period.</p>
      <p sl="de">It will be the job of the individual stakeholders in the relevant Member States to ensure in future that certain parts of the programmes are assigned to projects which can be implemented within the framework of the strategy for the Danube region, so that we have a clear picture at the end of the planning process of how many of the Member States are actually prepared to provide funding for macro-regional strategies of this kind. For example, in the strategy for the Baltic region, we are currently in a situation where almost all the financing comes from the cross-border programmes. In the long term, that is obviously not enough to ensure the lasting success of programmes of this kind. Therefore, we need to include the relevant operational programmes.</p>

That is why, when defining active farmers, first and foremost, we exclude farmers who receive direct support amounting to less than EUR 5 000 per year, precisely so that we do not affect very small farms. However, in the definition proposed in the draft regulation, the Member States will be able to include farmers with a small agricultural income and other non-agricultural income, too. They are covered twice. The small farms that are more affected – because we have set this threshold of EUR 5 000 – in other words, precisely those that receive more than EUR 5 000, will be affected by a reduction in financial support and by the way in which we have defined active farming, which fully encompasses the farmers that are more affected.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would like to say that I voted for this report because a dwindling working population and ageing workforce will mark the demographic trends in the EU in the coming years. In light of this, the lack of effective measures for maintaining quality of life and social integration may have an adverse impact on social security systems. In the EU, pension fund costs account, on average, for 43% of the gross expenditure on social welfare services. The potential offered by the elderly must be utilised. At the same time, I think that strategies are needed to encourage the birth rate and migration. These issues must be addressed using a coordinated approach involving all European, national and regional authorities. Romania has more pensioners than employees, which means that its pension system will be at risk in the future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I voted to adopt the report on demographic change in light of the future cohesion policy because aspects such as depopulation, an ageing population or labour migration pose real challenges for Member States, with a noticeable impact on Europe’s regions in particular. Regional policy is a key instrument for tackling demographic change. This is precisely why we need to ensure that this aspect will be included as a horizontal objective in the future cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The vote I gave today was in support of the hardest hit regions being given the resources and technical assistance they need to be able to access the Structural Funds. They will guarantee not only access to vital public services, but also create new sources of jobs, especially by supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. One of the EU-level solutions for reducing the adverse impact of demographic change is to promote the exchange of good practices between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I have called on the European Commission to come up with concrete solutions for ensuring that the Erasmus programme for local and regional elected representatives continues. I think that this programme must be continued in a form suited to the relevant needs and real circumstances.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, Europe has the oldest population and, at the same time, the lowest population growth in the world, and the waves of migration from third countries are still growing. If we treat these population changes as an opportunity, and jointly mould them in an appropriate way, they will not become a time bomb for the EU. Unlike strategies, Member States, regions and cities can make use of resources from the Structural Funds. In the 2007-2013 period, a mere 9% of the potential funding was absorbed. Regional policy is, in the meantime, the main tool that can be used to address demographic changes. I would like to call on the regions to make greater use of the possibilities the EU provides, and to work on adequate projects for supporting old people, children and families, and work for young people. In the area of immigration, I would like to emphasise that it is vital for the EU to distinguish in its policies between migrants who move Europe ahead and those who migrate to the EU merely with a vision of an easier life. The submitted report offers many appropriate solutions, and I have therefore voted for its adoption.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, we are all aware that demographic change is presenting us with a wide range of challenges. In rural areas in particular, it is important for us to put in place concrete measures which will allow us to make good use of the opportunities that will undoubtedly accompany this change. This is all about making rural areas as attractive as possible. First and foremost, this means providing sufficient jobs for younger people in order to counteract the trend for migration away from these areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, public bodies must adjust to the needs of an ageing population. Our rural regions must remain a home for the people who live there. Therefore, cohesion policy must make a significant contribution in this area in future. Nevertheless, it will be important, in future, to weigh up the requirements that we are able to meet against those that we simply cannot fulfil.</p>

      <p sl="ga">In this regard, I recall that my colleague, Danuta Hübner, when she was a Commissioner, pointed out that one-third of regions would decline in population by 2020 and a half will have a decline by 2030. This poses huge problems for us, particularly in relation to structural and cohesion policy. Particularly worrying is the impact which an ageing population will have. It will put huge pressure on finances in terms of health care and infrastructure, etc. We have got to meet that challenge, and the sooner we face up to it and put measures in place and utilise cohesion funding for it, the better it will be.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the elemental cause of our discontents is easily stated: there is too much debt. Too much personal debt, too much corporate debt and too much public debt. Even I am not going to claim that this is wholly a crisis of the eurozone. It was also a crisis in Latvia, a crisis in Hungary and indeed a crisis in my own country, and the underlying cause is easily diagnosed: interest rates were kept too low for too long and this mistake was made equally by the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and, indeed, the FED and the Bank of Japan.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is happening now is that there is a correction. The malinvestments of the decade of easy credit should be being rectified so that growth can begin again on a more sober and realistic basis, but here in Europe – and indeed in the United Kingdom – politicians and central bankers are furiously working the bellows in trying to re-inflate the bubble. It is not going to work; it is like trying to postpone a hangover by remaining drunk. You may defer the reckoning, but it will be all the worse when it comes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the challenge stemming from the current demographic changes within the EU is one of the biggest we will face over the coming years. We must strive to develop policies which not only make the public aware of the benefits and opportunities inherent in demographic changes, but also enable older workers to fully access work and housing markets. I therefore welcome some elements of this report which recognise the unique benefits to the current demographics. In the UK, we have recently abolished the default retirement age, acknowledging, amongst other things, the benefits of an older workforce.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there are a number of recommendations within this report which I cannot support, most particularly those recommendations which call for a common EU strategy on migration and the diversion of Structural Funds away from building economic capacity and towards special multi-generational housing projects and undefined ‘communal events’ to integrate immigrants into their local communities.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I voted in favour of the regulation today. Credit default swaps can provide greater liquidity in our economy and, in certain cases, can also help to protect and safeguard us against loss. The problem is – as the financial crisis has shown very clearly – that they also contain problematic elements that have entailed a significant systemic risk for our economy, because speculation kicked off a negative spiral. What has been absolutely crucial today is the fact that we have taken a decision that can remedy the problem. We are injecting a degree of responsibility into credit default swaps by ensuring that there is an ownership element, such that buyers and sellers must have a certain relationship to the instrument that they are trading with. I think this is a very positive development and I have therefore voted in favour of the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I abstained on this report as it does not go anywhere near tackling the dictatorship of the markets that exists in our society. The extent of that dictatorship has been seen very clearly in the past week, which has been reminiscent of Europe’s colonial era. The same arguments have been used to impose technocratic governance on Italy and Greece, with the argument that the people are not capable of governing for themselves, with the same result that the basic democratic right of people to elect their government comes second to the needs of the market, second to the needs of the bankers, second to the profits of the elite in our society.</p>
      <p sl="en">These technocrats who have been appointed are not neutral between the 1% and the 99%. Until the weekend, Mr Mario Monti served as an adviser to Goldman Sachs. Mr Papademos has spelt out how the interests of the bankers must be protected in writing down Greek debt. Their mandate comes not from the people of Italy or Greece or the rest of Europe, but comes from the markets. It is a mandate to continue the savagery of people’s living standards in the interests of the elite. Above all, what is needed again is a European-wide fight back, the need for a European-wide struggle against austerity and against the rule of these elites. What is needed is a European-wide strike.</p>

      <p sl="de">I think that the rules that apply to real life should also apply to the stock exchange. Therefore, I am very pleased that the regulation which we have adopted today will impose stringent restrictions on short selling throughout Europe. In particular, it has become clear in the past that highly speculative trading in sovereign bonds puts our financial system at risk. You cannot sell what you do not own and you cannot insure what you do not own. Therefore, it is particularly important that we have adopted standardised rules for the whole of Europe to counteract this type of trading.</p>

In Italy as in Greece, elected premiers have been toppled in favour of Eurocrats – respectively, a former Vice-President of the European Central Bank and a former European Commissioner. They head what are called ‘national governments’, but the governments have been put together for the sole purpose of implementing a programme that would be rejected at a general election.</p>
      <p sl="en">They are called technocrats, but it is precisely their policies that created the problem in the first place. They presided over the debt; they decided to keep the euro going at the expense of the prosperity of the constituent nations; they – Mr Papademos in particular – were responsible for admitting countries that did not meet the debt criteria at the outset. Now we see the true face of the European project. Apparatchiks in Brussels deal directly with apparatchiks in Athens and Rome. The people are cut out altogether and their elected representatives are sidelined. The lamps are going out all over Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, short selling and credit default swaps are two of the principal methods of investing in, or hedging against, a fall in prices or a default of a bond. Restrictions on the trading of sovereign debt, in particular, when the underlying asset is not owned or borrowed by the investor, can be very controversial. We must ensure that while we bring about some protection from aggressive short selling in the markets, this must not be done at the risk of liquidity. Any blanket ban on credit default swaps could have serious consequences on the ability of Member States to raise revenue through issuing bonds. Despite this report being brought closer into line with the position of my group, I still have a number of reservations, and these have come out in the detail and the general direction of the proposals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as a shadow rapporteur on this report, I had a number of concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all was the lack of focus on the causes of the crisis. One of the things we are ignoring in this place is the role that governments themselves played in creating the crisis. Look at the US Government and the Community Reinvestment Act which encouraged banks to lend to uncreditworthy customers, and at the levels of debt that governments incurred – and then they blamed the markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, I also share some of the concerns about the CDS and uncovered sovereign CDS. However, my concerns over this report were that we actually missed the target. Of course we should be tackling the issue of CDS when a bank does a swap and suddenly bad debt is re-rated as good debt because the CDS has been issued by an institution that itself has a good credit rating.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the most important thing that we have missed is that those organisations, those institutions that issue CDS, should make sure that they have sufficient capital to meet their obligations when a default occurs. This has not occurred and we have missed the elephant in the room.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Fruit and wine production is very important in the European Union. I am very grateful to Ms Nedelcheva for succeeding in simplifying the regulations for statistics on permanent crops. On the one hand, we all know that statistics are necessary. However, on the other hand, they do not always please those people affected, in this case farmers, because they are associated with a large amount of red tape. It is particularly important to me that smallholdings are excluded from the regulations on statistics and that the administrative effort involved is kept to a minimum for all the businesses affected. Our stated goal is to make agricultural policy simpler and more transparent. Regulations which do not make sense and are no longer up-to-date must be abolished.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report represents another small step forwards, but we will, of course, have to continue evaluating our own rules and regulations constantly to ensure that they meet the requirement for a reduction in bureaucracy.</p>

Although the details in this report largely concern vines which – I have to accept – are not very prevalent in my Member State, although they are a growing part of our agricultural scene, it is still important that all Members of this House pay attention to the detail of these technical reports so that we do not have motions and reports going through that we are not clear about and of which we do not fully understand the implications.

I would also like to add to the comments on Ms McClarkin’s report concerning the implementation of the Professional Qualifications Directive. I think that the report which we have adopted today takes Mr Tannock’s concerns into consideration, because we believe it is important to allow for more mobility within the European internal market, in other words, more mobility for the professionals who want it. This is because we will only be able to create a common economic and monetary area in Europe in the long term when professional qualifications are generally recognised and when the holders of the qualifications can genuinely move about freely within Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the European Commission now needs to make a series of proposals which, first of all, ensure that automatic recognition continues and, secondly, enable the Internal Market Information system, which the Member States use to recognise professional qualifications, to be easily accessed.

For example, Romanian physiotherapists are receiving the right to practise in France more quickly following SOLVIT’s intervention. The Association of German Engineers reported recently that more than 36 000 posts have not been filled due to the lack of professionals. A European area open to workers from every Member State is part of the solution to this problem.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I have spoken before in this Parliament on the case of my constituent, 70-year-old David Gray, who was killed when a locum German doctor unlawfully administered 10 times the recommended dose of a pain-killing drug. On behalf of his sons, Stuart and Rory Gray, I do so again today, to say that their father would still be alive if the mandatory blacklist system the European Parliament calls for today had been in place back in 2008. I am also incensed that Germany failed to extradite the doctor involved, despite the fact that an e-mail dated 16 March 2009 to the Cambridge Constabulary clearly shows that the European arrest warrant was received before the doctor, Daniel Ubani, was finally judged to be incompetent in Germany. His case should, under the existing law, have been heard in British courts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, MEPs have called for a change to the law to clarify beyond doubt that language checks for foreign doctors are perfectly permissible, as well as requiring an alert system to ensure that doctors under disciplinary questioning in one EU country cannot escape penalty in every country. But I say, with the greatest respect to my German colleagues, that changing the law only works if every EU country respects the law that is passed.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Today’s proposals go further, particularly in trying to get qualifications mutually recognised right across the European Union but, as speakers have pointed out, there are difficulties, particularly regarding qualifications where the person with the qualification is dealing with the public and services, such as medical services, teaching, etc. Language proficiency is very important and certainly there is no room for error here, particularly in the diagnosis of patients, as has been pointed out.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would also request speaking time on this item. I would like to congratulate my colleague on her report on the Professional Qualifications Directive; this has been a very high profile issue recently in the UK. The report is particularly encouraging with its emphasis on the reduction of the number of regulated professions and its encouragement of online application procedures.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report will encourage the free movement of a growing number of highly skilled workers across the EU. Within the report, there is a specific mention of the health care sector. The protection of consumer and patient safety, as we have heard, is a vital objective in the context of the revision of this directive. Thus, I am delighted to see that special attention has been paid to the special status of health care professionals.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has been much debate on the issue of language barriers. I believe that they are not necessary in all fields of work, but again we must have a decree of flexibility and, for professions where they are vital, we need to acknowledge that and make sure that we carry that through.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would also like to welcome Parliament’s vote today in favour of the report by Emma McClarkin on mutual recognition of professional qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular, there has been great concern in Scotland about the competence of European doctors working for the National Health Service. Since the introduction of the 48-hour working week and the handing over to NHS 24 of all out-of-hours care, almost one in ten health care professionals in the UK have now trained outside the UK. While these doctors provide a vital service, patients must, of course, have peace of mind about their competence.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report takes an important step towards ensuring that a cross-border alert system will stop the so-called ‘dodgy’ doctors from moving from one country to another to continue practising when they have been accused or suspended in their own country for a question of malpractice. That will reassure patients that their doctors are qualified and not facing charges of misconduct in the countries they came from.</p>
      <p sl="en">The relationship between patient and doctor is important to recognise and respect. In this regard, use of language is vital, and that is why I am pleased that this report has identified the language issue as an area that does need further work. Patients must feel comfortable with their doctor and health professional and understand the advice and treatment plan, wherever their doctor comes from.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do hope Parliament can trust the Commission to look into this report with the necessary attention to ensure the best quality of treatment across Europe, through changes of legislation where necessary.</p>

I believe that the report takes the right steps to protect and encourage professional workers seeking to work in another Member State.

      <p sl="it">Protected and informed consumers, who are made more aware and are therefore in a position to take full advantage of the instruments and resources at their disposal, as well as to make full use of their rights, should be the final aim of the EU’s new strategy on consumer policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">This strategy should therefore be established as an approach with ample breathing space, and it should be all-encompassing, so that it can move freely from the sector of financial services to that of food, from the safeguarding of minors to advertising, and, therefore, be in a position to make an important contribution to Europe’s social and environmental objectives.</p>

There is no limit to the good things that we offer citizens here: free movement, a social market economy, progress, a high level of competitiveness, full employment, high environmental quality, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="da">Unfortunately – and rather strangely – there is not a single word about how we want to achieve all of these good things for our citizens. Nowhere is it explained how we are to achieve all of these objectives. Looking around the EU’s territory, all I can say is that it is probably not going very well! Rarely has the EU’s competitiveness been worse than it is today. Rarely has employment been lower than it is today, and rarely has free movement operated as poorly as it is doing today. Nevertheless, one fine statement after another is adopted here in this House that bears absolutely no relation to the reality that citizens outside this House live in. Perhaps we will get the two ends to meet sometime in the future.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the EU needs a strategic approach to consumer policy, for it to be closely coordinated with other EU policies. Consumers’ dissatisfaction with the functioning of many services, above all, banking and financial services, and with the quality and safety of some products, which results from a lack of awareness of the rights of consumers and the obligations of suppliers, must produce a reaction in the form of a political and legal response from the EU to this issue.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, the priority of consumer policy should continue to be the protection of consumers – especially children – from hazardous products. A high level of consumer product safety must therefore be effectively guaranteed in the EU by the relevant market surveillance authorities and agencies in the area of the food, chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries and in agriculture, since these areas have a direct impact on the health of EU citizens on a daily basis through their products.</p>

Encouragingly, the report draws from statistics from the Consumer Scoreboard and has taken the recently published top 20 main citizens’ and business concerns regarding the single market into full account. The report calls for the Commission to integrate initiatives across all its responsible services, which will ensure proper implementation and enforcement of existing legislation.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I will always support the right of consumers to accurate information on the products or services they wish to buy. It is possible to make responsible decisions on the basis of such information. The law must clearly guarantee every consumer the right to turn to the courts in the event of disappointment or damage.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As an MEP, I have worked for many years with consumer groups, helping them to defend this right. At the same time, I am rather dismayed at the huge growth in the consumer agenda that the Commission has come forward with. We should not underestimate people’s common sense when deciding how to spend the money they have earned. We must not take this responsibility away from them. The relationship between the buyer and the seller is a relationship of trust. If this relationship is distorted, the trust and responsibility of both parties disappears.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Internet came into being exactly 20 years ago. On this network today, the most popular pieces of information circulate ever-increasingly, widely available for anyone interested in them. Online gambling services represent a concrete modality by means of which a very important industry in Europe – the third largest in Italy, generating EUR 75 billion – is nourished on a daily basis.</p>
      <p sl="it">The principle of subsidiarity between Member States applies here. Evidently, there is certainly a need to combat any instances relating to the illegal use of these activities. Illegal online gambling – that is, unauthorised online gambling – must be punished as a transnational offence and, in such cases, Member States should also cooperate with each other. Organised crime and money laundering are the negative aspects of this industry, and one should also recall the extent to which addiction can especially harm vulnerable individuals; in order to tackle addiction, an interdisciplinary approach supported by appropriately equipped health authorities should be adopted. However, it is an important system which, economically, should be aided and supported within a normative framework, in which the presence of the European Union can be advantageous.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I voted in favour of the report today, but I did not vote in favour of paragraph 20 or what is stated in paragraph 20. I understand the purpose behind what is stated there, but I think it is rather poorly worded. I think it is important that there should be a demonstrable intention to break the rules. If we have different rules in 27 Member States, there is no point shutting down one business if a mistake is made. We need to give them the opportunity to remedy the situation before we shut down their business in other Member States as well.</p>
      <p sl="da">There is one issue to which I would just like to draw attention. In principle, online gambling has made gambling more accessible, and that has resulted in more gambling addicts. I would strongly urge the Commission to ensure that gambling operators also pay for the treatment of addicts. It is currently often left to religious organisations and others to take care of addicts. In other words, the gambling operators must be involved in paying for the damage that they cause. It could be a very small proportion of their turnover – we are probably talking per mille – but I do not think that the job of clearing up after online gambling should be the responsibility of the Member States alone.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the topic for discussion is the Commission’s communication on online gambling. The development of gambling and its horizontal growth across various social sectors certainly begins to cause concern with regard to the negative implications entailed, such as the involvement of minors and vulnerable adults in a high-risk activity, particularly in the case of children – and this risk is not simply of a financial nature, but is, first and foremost, a moral one.</p>
      <p sl="it">My recent written inquiry regarding video games was concerned with gambling games in which minors could take part, and asked what initiatives should be undertaken to provide a remedy for the anomaly.</p>
      <p sl="it">The current concerns of the Commission and the resolution for which we have voted clearly put forward the need for a proposal on a directive which defines the minimum applicable standards across the whole of Europe. These standards should be binding for all authorised operators who offer online gambling services, and should grant Member States the power to supplement and improve upon them by formulating their own standards. For this reason, we hope that the Commission puts forward a definitive proposal on this subject as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last five years, gambling has spread over the whole of Europe. In Italy, according to the state monopolies, online gambling increased by 153% from 2008 to 2009, and by 29% from 2009 to 2010. These worrying figures provide evidence of the widespread impact of this phenomenon. We must consider this issue seriously.</p>
      <p sl="it">Although online gambling falls within the jurisdiction of the Member States, common actions must be established across Europe to protect vulnerable consumers and to tackle illegal gambling. The report on the initiative opens the door to actions which I hope will soon be initiated and I agree that there is a need to implement preventative measures with a view to reducing addictive behaviour. The trials taking place in some countries could set the measure for ‘best practice’ to be replicated all over Europe, with the aim of monitoring the phenomenon and promoting responsible gambling.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, online gambling is a continually growing market whose turnover has exceeded EUR 10 billion. Currently, responsibility for keeping the gambling market in check lies with individual Member States, but the more delicate question at stake here concerns the proliferation via the Internet of an unregulated black market of considerable dimensions, whose principal protagonists are located in Asia.</p>
      <p sl="it">The idea that the principle of subsidiarity should be respected at the level of individual Member States remains pivotal, but in order to be able to combat external dangers it is advisable to guarantee coordination across the EU. These dangers relate to protecting not only consumers, but also revenues on the part of Member States which rely upon tax generated by so-called legal gambling.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another significant point is linked to the difficulty of accurately detecting the identity and age of gamblers on the Internet. The Commission and the Member States must intervene without delay in order to protect European consumers from bogus operators and from the risk of addiction.</p>

I voted in favour of it, but I wish to say that the rapporteur changed the report fundamentally, although he himself did vote in favour of it. This, I think, was somewhat surprising.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As the report states, the purpose of the Commission’s Green Paper is not at all to reduce regulation and open up the online gambling market. The Green Paper has mainly initiated a public dialogue between the various actors, thus providing a welcome alternative to the decisions of the Court of Justice. In the report, it quite rightly states that gambling policy in Europe needs to be clarified. We must also do all we can to take action against illegal betting.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Moreover, the report’s major message, that there should be strong support for national decision making, is absolutely vital. Gambling is something quite different from ordinary economic activity. Given this, there are good arguments for organising gambling games so that they are covered by national legislation.

What is of most concern when one considers online gambling is the increasing ease of access to online gambling sources via the Internet, interactive TV and apps for smartphones. Gambling seems to be everywhere. You cannot escape advertising for betting in newspapers and television, at sporting occasions, and it now seems that there is very much a cultural acceptance of this as a fun thing to do. Sadly, while some people may get enjoyment, there are, for many, the miseries that online gambling brings.</p>
      <p sl="en">In September 2008, a report by the Gambling Commission in the United Kingdom showed that between 10% and 14% of young people are at risk of developing gambling problems, while between 5% and 7% were said to be problem gamblers.

      <p sl="en">You also have the possibility – indeed the probability – of illegal online gambling which is used to launder money, etc. So there is definitely a need for tighter regulation for a number of reasons: firstly, so that those who are providing the activity, particularly sports bodies, can get something back in return; secondly, as has been pointed out, to deal with addiction, rather than leave it to Member States on their own; and thirdly, of course, to control it so that it is legal and not illegal.

This Green Paper is very welcome and important, but the Commission must now go further and take action. The European Parliament’s demands that we are voting on today are very clear. First and foremost, the Commission is, and must act as, the Guardian of the Treaties. The Commission must take action against Member States that do not have a coherent gaming policy and that exclude trustworthy, lawful providers from other countries. Secondly, we need European rules for responsible gaming.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Gambling addition is a major problem in Europe, but sometimes it almost seems as if the finance ministers’ dependency on gaming revenue is even greater. We must therefore ensure that the EU guarantees a good level of protection for all consumers who gamble across borders. The Member States may not like it, but consumers will.

I have abstained from voting on the resolution of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development because it is incomplete and not effective enough.</p>
      <p sl="it">The use of neonicotinoid pesticides to treat maize seeds in agriculture has led to the destruction of millions of bees. In Italy, we have experienced losses of between 30% and 70% of hives, causing serious damage to beekeepers, bees and the environment. In the two years that Italy has prohibited the use of these pesticides, two important results have come about: the bee population has recovered, and it has been demonstrated that maize production has not diminished without the use of pesticides.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today’s resolution has been a missed opportunity to call for the banishment across Europe of neonicotinoid pesticides.

In other countries of the European Union these declines have been much more dramatic. These data show that the population of this most useful of insects is dying at an alarming rate.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I welcome the vote in favour of this report on the day we are debating the subject of the common agricultural policy. I voted for it because it is vital to create a common insurance system for protecting beekeepers during crises. This professional group is on the wane, especially due to the shortage of young workers. The only Member States where such a situation is not being seen are Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I must emphasise the importance of point 30: the impact of pesticides on larvae needs to be assessed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. At the moment, the authorisation procedure does not take into account all their effects on bees. The EU reference laboratory for bee health was created to study and prevent the effects of substances of this nature. Its coordination with the national authorities also ensures information is provided in real time about the occurrence of particular diseases.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is currently committed to defining the contents of the new common agricultural policy. I believe that the beekeeping sector is an integral part of our agriculture. Indeed, 84% of plant species and 76% of food production in Europe are dependent on pollination by bees. In order to preserve the health of bees, it is important to put specific and effective interventions into practice, not only on a national level but also across Europe, in such a way as to guarantee an appropriate harmonisation of surveillance systems.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another problem is linked to the inappropriate and excessive use of pesticides which can have negative consequences and cause excessive bee mortality, and which are tolerated in different ways by the Member States, so as to distort competition on the internal market. In support and defence of our quality produce, I am in favour of the request for obligatory indication on the label of source and country of origin. Our fight has always been concerned with informing and protecting the consumer.</p>
      <p sl="it">The risks derived from the use of GMO crops in agriculture should also be taken into serious consideration. Recently, the European Court has intervened, acknowledging that beekeepers have the right to be compensated for their losses.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was among those who signed the alternative resolution on the health of honeybees, because the report put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) completely rejected the recommendations indicated in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) opinion, for which I was a shadow rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="it">The plague inflicted upon bees is a problem which is becoming more and more serious, and there is plenty of scientific confirmation to show the damage caused by pesticides and monocultures. In order to understand this, we only have to think of areas of the world, for instance certain valleys in China, where pollination is now carried out by hand precisely as a result of uninhibited overuse of particular types of pesticides over time.</p>
      <p sl="it">Yet, the report approved today by the European Parliament has not taken a stance on this topic. We lack a critical objective on the toxicity of pesticides, specifically, the prohibition of systematic neurotoxins; we lack indications for the beekeeping sector relating to contamination of honey produce by GMO crops; we lack a critique on monoculture; and we lack the idea that large-scale changes are required in agriculture, including crop rotation, to reduce the use of pesticides, with a view to reversing the sharp decline in the production of pollinators.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as we are all aware, the honeybee population has seen a stark decline these past few years, which subsequently could have a devastating effect on Europe’s ability to produce crops that require pollination. A number of factors have been attributed to this decline, and Welsh beekeepers – although they themselves are increasing in number – are concerned about their bee population’s long-term survival. Indeed, such is the revival of beekeeping in the UK that even the London Stock Exchange now boasts beehives on its London City roof.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Tabajdi report offers a balanced view of reasons for honeybee mortality and rightly calls for more research funding to be made available from the FP8 programme to focus on bee disease prevention and to find possible solutions. I hope researchers look globally for case studies and do not begin from a prejudiced viewpoint with respect to certain pesticides and genetic technologies. Independent research needs to be just that: independent and without bias.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, whilst it is true that in general, the bee population is declining, it is also equally true that their importance within agriculture is undervalued by many. Without bees, many crops would fail and in Northern Ireland, we are particularly privileged to have a very good product in the Armagh Bramley apple. These orchards are, of course, especially reliant on bees for pollination, and on a recent visit to some orchard owners, they expressed grave concern over the bee population.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree that funding should be made available to research the disease and monitor bee populations across Europe. However, I would plea for a balanced view of the decline of the bee population; we must not use agriculture as a scapegoat for this, but actually investigate ways of improving the bee population and the disease and parasites that affect it.</p>

I was, in fact, the person who drew up the Environment Committee’s opinion and was not able to vote for it because it was hijacked by non-scientifically-validated concerns about pesticides, which were knee-jerk and disproportionate. I regret that this also found its way into an alternative resolution, which I am pleased was rejected by this plenary.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we move into a world containing our seven billionth citizen, it is more and more important that we make sure that agricultural production and productivity move forward. I welcome the Commission’s extra resource to Member States. I very much welcome the setting up of the reference laboratory in France. I would recommend all Members visit or at least have a look at the work that they are doing. We need to do far more to develop veterinary medicines to tackle the effect of the Varroa virus and parasites, and we need to stick with our programme on plant protection, where we have regulation which is coming into force.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I think it is very important that we now have clear rules in this area. We were in need of simpler rules, for both the national and the local authorities, with regard to State aid. One thing that has created legal uncertainty is the very vague definition of services of economic interest and services of no economic interest. I therefore think it is good that we will now hopefully have a clearer definition in this area. It is also good that we will increase the thresholds for exemption from the requirement of notification to a level, and in those areas, where it will have no detrimental effect on trade. That will actually make it easier for the national or regional authorities to comply with the rules that we lay down.</p>

In particular, I believe that there is widespread agreement on the urgency to draw up de minimis measures for services of general interest which do not substantially affect commerce between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">Having said this, I have some reservations on the approach chosen by the Commission. In fact, I believe that the excessive quantity of texts, between communications, decision and regulation, runs the risk of confusing the normative framework and of making it appear confused and difficult to understand rather than contributing to a genuine and functional updating of existing rules as required.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I voted in favour of this report, but I am nevertheless taking the floor because I believe that the whole issue should be seen in a wider context. Once again in this area, we politicians, who are democratically elected, are being pulled around the circus ring by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. We find that the Court has once again issued a ruling, most recently in the Altmark case, that means that we – as a reaction to what the Court in Luxembourg has said – ought to amend the rules. It ought to be the case in a democracy that it is the politicians that sit at the head of the table, not the officials. I think that we should have a debate on how, in principle, we can restructure the system so that, to a greater extent, it is we elected representatives that make the rules, instead of us simply rushing around afterwards to follow the rules laid down by the judges in Luxembourg – with good intentions, I am sure, but without being democratically elected. In other words, I think that this matter raises a question of principle with regard to how the rules – particularly those in the area of health – come into being.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in my opinion, the report on the reform of EU State aid rules on services of general economic interest is of concern as it extends the definition of social services of general interest, which could be to the detriment of competition across the whole of the EU single market. The value-creating potential of the private sector will not be fully realised as long as the public sector still has unfair competitive advantages applied to it. The privileges enjoyed by the public sector therefore have a negative impact on the EU’s economic strength as a whole, and should be terminated immediately. Failure to come to this conclusion is why I have voted against this report.</p>

Far more work needs to be done in this area. My constituents in the South West of England believe that there is an unfair application of State aid rules and this is a major factor in undermining their confidence in, and support for, the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">This failure of confidence in the functioning of the single market then permeates through to discontent with the European Union as a whole. I do not believe that my constituents are particularly unique in this, so I do believe that this is an area that should have far more attention from this Parliament in order to increase confidence in the work that this Parliament does. I regret that this report does not go far enough, and I look forward to more action on this area in the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, to a certain extent, this report concerns the issue of the internal market having an impact on our doorsteps. Many mayors, people in positions of authority and office holders underestimate the importance of the effect of the internal market right outside our front doors. For this reason, this report is a step in the right direction. On the one hand, we are calling for a distinction to be made between economic and non-economic services of general interest. This sounds hugely complex, but ultimately it involves very concrete measures when it is a question of allowing specific bus routes or specific social housing construction to be subsidised by local politicians on a small scale. However, the general principles of the internal market must, of course, play a role in this respect. It goes without saying that efficiency takes priority over local responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I am very pleased and very grateful that it has been possible to rule out Article 14 as the basis for the regulations on issues concerning State aid. The European Parliament has made its position clear, partly as a result of our efforts on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. This will have a very positive impact on the further stages of the discussion.</p>

I voted for the measures ensuring not only access to high-quality education and vocational training, but also for stepping up the efforts to reduce the school dropout rate. Member States must take action as a priority to combat dropping out of school, but the rate of 10% envisaged in the EU 2020 strategy is not ambitious enough to be able to guarantee a solution to this problem. At a time when the youth unemployment rate is so high in Europe, combating the problem of dropping out of school and preventing it are key issues.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this report comes at a time when poverty is returning on a mass scale to haunt Europe. There are 116 million people in the EU at risk of poverty. Youth unemployment rates now stand at over 40% in Greece and Spain, in Ireland it stands at over 29%, and because of the driving down of wages and conditions, even those with a job are not immune from the risk of poverty, with 22% of those still at risk of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact that this report was passed by a large majority brings to mind the quote from Shakespeare, ‘words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart’. This is precisely the same Parliament that has voted in favour of the likes of economic governance, in support of savage austerity dressed up as so-called fiscal consolidation: the same policies of savage attacks on people’s living standards, savage attacks on public services that have resulted in more people being at risk of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we are serious about tackling poverty, it means putting an end to austerity, it means tackling the power of the 1% in society – the speculators, the banks, the big corporations like the energy companies that will profit this winter while thousands die of fuel poverty.

What sort of report is this? A communist manifesto? Poverty is not simply a result of an uneven distribution of wealth, but of unequal access to opportunities. Calling poverty a reflection of the fact that wealth has not been properly distributed simply makes people passive participants; it turns people into objects that merely receive benefits on the basis of a fair distribution as determined by politicians.</p>
      <p sl="da">When I read this report, I could not help but think of the American Declaration of Independence, where Jefferson describes ‘unalienable rights’ as being ‘life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’. That is how politicians set people free, namely, by saying that it is people’s own responsibility to create their fortune – to establish their own ‘pursuit of happiness’ – not by saying that it is politicians’ responsibility to distribute whatever resources may be available evenly. This is a disgraceful report. It could have been written during the Soviet era.</p>

In Romania, as all over the world for that matter, mining settlements offer jobs. Towns like Roşia Montană have a mono-industry economy in mining. Reopening these mines offers a chance for local inhabitants to have a better living. Social welfare systems must offer security against the risks and provide effective support to those in trouble.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, the vote on the report on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion was not by a show of hands. Firstly, I would like to say that the reason why I am voting against it is because the principle of subsidiarity has not been complied with. I am surprised that we actually want the EU to introduce minimum wages. It is stated in paragraph 95 that this is to be done in full compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. This sentence alone actually renders paragraph 95 redundant. We cannot introduce minimum wages via the EU without violating the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="da">In Denmark, we have a model in which the social partners reach an agreement on the setting of wages by negotiation. That is the Nordic model in which the social partners negotiate wage levels themselves. The workers are very much in agreement with this and they are united in this agreement. They therefore adopt this principle. Another key paragraph in this report concerns the food distribution scheme. The fact that the EU could previously help to feed the poor by using the intervention stocks was great; it was good that butter mountains and milk lakes were at least, to a certain extent, used for something useful. However, the scheme should be abolished because it is out of date. We no longer have these surplus stocks.</p>

This does not mean, however, that action intended to improve legal protection should not be taken, particularly if it is in the interests of EU citizens. The convention has insufficiently regulated a number of issues, including the nature and extent of carriers’ liability and minimum requirements on insurance. So the current Protocol lays on carriers greater obligations towards passengers, specifies the liability for damages caused by accidents and also in the case of terrorist attacks, as well as the claims and the insurance procedures associated with such events.

      <p sl="pl">Despite the fact that a horizontal agreement has existed between the European Union and Jordan since 2008, the European Union wants to establish a Euro-Mediterranean aviation area between the EU and Jordan. This is because the EU-Jordan Euro-Mediterranean aviation agreement will facilitate the work of carriers from all Member States, and Jordan will become a country where aviation law will be adapted to EU requirements. Jordanian legislation on questions such as safety and air traffic management will be aligned with EU legislation. I think it is worth developing commercial relations with as large a partner as Jordan undoubtedly is. The agreement is also an element of the development of the EU’s neighbourhood policy. It is my expectation that, thanks to this agreement and the opening of this market, there will be an increase in passenger numbers and in revenues. I endorsed the report.</p>

Since Articles 10 and 11 of the Athens Protocol concern questions relating to jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments, the relevant legal basis as far as those articles are concerned is Article 81(1) TFEU on judicial cooperation in civil matters.

      <p sl="sk">The convention itself dates back to 1974 with the safety of passenger ships and passenger rights lying at its heart. It was, however, considered insufficient, and there is therefore a need to incorporate changes into it relating, above all, to carriers’ liability, compulsory insurance, a limit for liability for death and personal injury, or for loss of or damage to luggage and vehicles. The Protocol, which was adopted on 1 November 2002, amended the Athens Convention in a way that it also satisfied these key elements.</p>

Currently, air services between the countries of the EU and Jordan are governed by bilateral agreements, which is no longer possible under the Treaty of Lisbon.

Above all, EU air carriers will enjoy uniform standards and a favourable and liberal environment to provide competitive services in open markets.

      <p sl="pt">This report concerns the air services operated between the European Union and Jordan. There has been a horizontal air services agreement with Jordan since 2008, which has enabled the harmonisation of these bilateral agreements with European Union law. However, the Commission recently negotiated a comprehensive agreement that is much more ambitious and replaces all the bilateral agreements by creating a Euro-Mediterranean aviation area between the European Union and Jordan. The agreement establishes uniform conditions for the air carriers of the 27 Member States, from which they all benefit regardless of nationality. In this context, the European Union’s air carriers will be able to provide their services from any point in the European Union and Jordan, whereas, to date, provision of these services has been conditional on, for example, the existence of bilateral agreements between each Member State and Jordan. As this is an agreement with objectives that are positive overall, such as gradual market opening in terms of capacity and access to routes on a reciprocal basis, and non-discrimination and a level playing field for economic operators based on the principles laid down in the EU Treaties, I voted for this report.</p>

      <p sl="it">The importance of this air space in the European contingency is a challenge that also opens up greater services for the community. It is therefore necessary to conduct a careful analysis of aviation services between the European Union and Jordan which allows us to note that the aviation market in question, characterised by bilateral agreements between individual Member States and Jordan, does not therefore guarantee free movement within the area described above. This agreement aims to reach a very ambitious global agreement to replace the 27 bilateral agreements with a Euro-Mediterranean airspace between the EU and Jordan, which would allow any European air carrier to provide services between any point in the EU and Jordan. Considering that this initiative could open up the aviation market gradually and on a reciprocal basis, while also guaranteeing equal and unprejudiced economic conditions to operators, I am happy to express my vote in favour of this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This agreement, which is intended to replace the bilateral agreements between the various Member States and Jordan, is emerging as a key element of the European neighbourhood policy because it advocates increased closeness between the EU and Jordan. Indeed, it is important to keep in mind that the European Union is currently Jordan’s second biggest trade partner, so it is committed to the process of affirming and consolidating democracy in this area. The Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan offers a suitable regulatory framework for enabling airlines to increase the number of air links between the two territories, whilst operating with great freedom. Essentially, what is being sought is greater market opening through the introduction of more equitable rules and of non-discrimination for economic operators, on the one hand, and the harmonisation of legislation relating to safety, security and air traffic management, on the other. It is estimated that, in the first year of application of the agreement, there will be 54 000 extra passengers with an overall economic benefit of EUR 30 million. I voted in favour for these reasons.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. Air services between the European Union and Jordan presently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and Jordan. These bilateral agreements were brought into line with EU law by the conclusion of a horizontal aviation agreement with Jordan in 2008. The Commission recently negotiated a comprehensive agreement that is much more ambitious in its scope and replaces all the bilateral agreements by creating a Euro-Mediterranean aviation area between the EU and Jordan. The agreement establishes uniform standards for air carriers in all 27 Member States and allows them to benefit regardless of their national affiliation. Accordingly, EU-based air carriers will be able to operate services between any location in the EU and Jordan, something that was, until now, conditional upon, among other things, the existence of a bilateral agreement between the Member State concerned and Jordan. The agreement’s objectives are gradual market opening in terms of access to routes and capacity on a reciprocal basis; non-discrimination and a level playing field for economic operators, based on the principles laid down in the EU Treaties; and alignment of Jordan aviation legislation with EU legislation on issues such as safety, security and air traffic management.</p>

EU air carriers will therefore be able to provide their services between any point in the EU and Jordan, whereas hitherto, the provision of these services was dictated by the bilateral agreements made between a given Member State and Jordan. Consequently, it will now be possible to open the market in terms of routes gradually and on a reciprocal basis, ensuring equal and unbiased economic conditions for operators founded on the principles of the EU Treaties.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The agreement governing cooperation with Georgia in the field of air transport has as its purpose the establishment of an EU/Georgia common aviation area. Existing agreements between individual Member States and Georgia have not always conformed to practices accepted in the Union and, in addition, have often not brought tangible benefits to aviation undertakings, and this is something which always affects the frequency of connections. The Common Aviation Area Agreement is a good example of cooperation within the framework of neighbourhood policy. In view of the fact that negotiations are in progress on an association agreement with Georgia, the Common Aviation Area Agreement enables Georgia to enhance yet further its credibility in the European market.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcome this agreement between the EU and Georgia on the creation of a common aviation area because it is important not just for transport but also in the sense that it establishes a stronger basis for cooperation in the neighbourhood policy. It should be noted that, for carriers of both parties, this agreement will open up markets and create uniform, non-discriminatory operating conditions, while eliminating existing barriers. Thus, aviation undertakings in Europe and Georgia will be able to provide air services on a level playing field without any restrictions. I believe that this agreement will not only open up new opportunities and strengthen the position of carriers, but will also facilitate full use of airport infrastructure because, according to initial estimates, there should be a significant increase in the amount of passengers and cargo.</p>

      <p sl="it">In particular, the resolution mentions the inclusion of a reference to Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union (membership) and acknowledges the European identity of the country. Given the impasse in which Europe now finds itself and the general discontent over many countries joining in the latest enlargements of 2004 and 2007, hinting at further enlargement – even in the long term – seems like a bad idea to me at this moment in time.

Competitiveness and employment can be boosted through the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. I would like to say at the same time that suspension of tariffs leads to loss of revenue from the EU’s own resources, which the European Parliament, contrary to this, is trying to increase through proposals for various taxes on financial transactions and the like.</p>

It has come up again in the vote on extending the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). Continuing nuclear research is fine, but the research budget should not be committed entirely to nuclear energy. There is a need to diversify, especially since, with the cost of the ITER programme having increased exponentially since its launch in 2006, rising from EUR 6 to 16 billion, I think that the project should continue with the means available. While research into both nuclear fusion and fission is a good thing (although it should be diversified), I very much regret the increase in appropriations (a further EUR 700 000 in 2012) as well as the anticipated financial tinkering, which would result in earmarking part of the European research budget just to fund ITER, not to mention the fact that budgetary cuts are planned in the field of research, which will only exacerbate the imbalance between research expenditure on nuclear energy and that devoted to developing renewable energy.

Indeed, disparities between national insolvency laws create difficulties for companies with cross-border activities which might hamper the successful restructuring of insolvent companies. In this document, the European Parliament sets out its recommendations on areas of insolvency law which may be harmonised at EU level and which could help in drawing up legislative initiatives on this issue in future. Parliament thus proposes harmonising certain aspects of the initiation of insolvency proceedings, as well as procedures for the submission of claims, and puts forward recommendations on the harmonisation of aspects of avoidance actions, requirements for the qualification and work of liquidators and the establishment of restructuring plans. The European Parliament has also proposed the creation of an EU registry for insolvency cases which would contain every cross-border insolvency case opened and to which it would be compulsory for courts to transmit data.</p>

      <p sl="cs">In my opinion, when revising the regulation on insolvency proceedings, the Commission ought to focus on certain important aspects, such as widening the scope of the regulation to include those procedures in which the management remains in control of the company, as this would afford the debtor in possession a number of mechanisms to restructure his business. The centre of main interests (COMI) is the most important concept, in my opinion, since the Insolvency Regulation’s principal jurisdictional role – that of determining which court is competent to open the main proceedings and which will be the applicable law – depends on the definition of the COMI. This concept is not defined, however, and this gives rise to uncertainty. In my opinion, the definition of an establishment should include services, and not just human means and goods. Finally, the duty of communication and cooperation enshrined in the regulation should not only affect liquidators but also courts.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Insolvency proceedings are very different among the 27 Member States of the Union. Regulation at EU level therefore aims to prevent parties from being encouraged to transfer their assets or to relocate judicial proceedings from one Member State to another to benefit from the most advantageous jurisdiction. In recent years, the phenomenon of groups of companies has increased. This is likely to result in the commencement of several separate proceedings in different jurisdictions with respect to each of the insolvent group members, with the risk that the group may be broken into its constituent parts rather than reorganised. Future regulation should therefore relate to groups of companies and stipulate that proceedings should be opened in the Member State where the operational headquarters of the group are located. The interests of workers should not be forgotten, which is why it is necessary to increase the priority of employees’ claims relative to other creditors’ claims.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The current financial and economic crisis is obliging society in general to reflect on all administrative and legal procedures involving economic activity. One of the problems affecting modern societies is companies being in business: when growing, these generate wealth and create jobs; when in recession, they throw millions of workers into unemployment, with social consequences of which we are all aware. One of the causes of unemployment is companies going out of business, often through insolvency. Currently, every Member State has its own legislation on this subject, so it is crucial to harmonise insolvency procedures at EU level in the spirit governing the workings of the single market. The recommendations of this report, drafted by Mr Lehne, which will serve as guidelines for the Commission, come under four headings: harmonisation, wherever possible; revision – and improvement, where possible – of the Insolvency Regulation; improved cooperation from liquidators and in general; and creation of an EU insolvency register.

Even if the creation of a body of substantive insolvency law at EU level is not possible, there are certain areas of insolvency law where harmonisation is achievable. Insolvency law should be a tool for rescuing companies at Union level, to the benefit of the debtor, the creditors and the employees whenever possible.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also believe that a legal framework should be established that better suits cases of companies which are temporarily insolvent. In each specific case, the reasons for the insolvency of a business must be investigated, and it must be ascertained whether the business’s financial difficulties are merely transient or whether the business is completely insolvent. The interlinking of national insolvency registers, leading to the creation of a generally accessible and comprehensive EU database of insolvency proceedings, would allow creditors, shareholders, employees and courts to determine whether insolvency proceedings have been opened in another Member State and to ascertain the deadlines and details for the presentation of claims. Such steps would promote cost-effective administration and increase transparency, while respecting data protection.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I fully endorse the initiative to revise the Insolvency Regulation of 29 May 2000. Since it came into force, many changes have taken place, 15 new Member States have joined the Union and the phenomenon of groups of companies has increased enormously. Looked at today, the measures proposed in the regulation of 11 years ago already seem anachronistic. Particular attention should be given to the need to formulate a clear definition of the centre of main interests, or COMI, of a debtor to enable the correct establishment of jurisdiction for insolvency proceedings. Incorrect interpretation of the concept of the COMI is a source of misunderstandings when filing for the bankruptcy of foreign companies. The location of the COMI determines the competence of a court to open insolvency proceedings. The basic factor which determines location is identification of the place where the debtor’s business operations are conducted and if this is ascertainable by third parties. Difficulties may arise here, when a foreign court, in publishing a bankruptcy decision relating to a company from another country, considers that that company has its COMI in another Member State because real control of the company is exercised there. The attempt to resolve this dilemma made by the European Court of Justice in its judgment of 2 May 2006 in the case of Eurofood IFSC Limited unfortunately did not completely solve the problem, which confirms the need for a clearer definition.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to emphasise the need to interpret the regulation in accordance with Directive 2008/94/EC on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer. The Member States should not undermine the rights of employees in the insolvency procedure. I support the proposal to introduce a ranking of creditors in which priority would be given to employees, with a guarantee of at least the minimum standards of protection irrespective of the different national legal definitions.</p>

According to the Insolvency Regulation, the lodging, verification and admission of claims are determined by the law of the state where proceedings are opened, which will also apply to claims that are accepted as insolvency claims. I support the view that such harmonisation of claims would increase the legal certainty for creditors.

The Insolvency Regulation only applies to single companies and there is no legislation at EU level on the insolvency of groups of companies, despite groups being a very common form of business model in economic life. This omission has important negative consequences. It is important to be aware of the great variety of different group structures and relationships between companies belonging to the same group and, therefore, of the fact that the same solution cannot be applied to all kinds of groups, at least given the current state of insolvency laws in the Union. Ideally, the insolvency of groups of companies should be managed by a single court applying its own insolvency law.

It not only helps to sustain business and production capacities, but encourages change, and the speedy redistribution of resources also plays a particularly important role in the area of credit and investment. I therefore believe that the insolvency framework must function as a tool within a European crisis management framework. Consequently, insolvency requirements and the conditions under which insolvency proceedings may be opened should be harmonised at EU level, as should certain aspects of avoidance actions and other requirements.

Last but not least, coordination needs to be improved between the relevant authorities at every level, and exchanges of good practices must be encouraged. I take this opportunity to call on Member States to take into account the different levels of development of the regions where the allocation and distribution of the EU Structural Funds are concerned, as well as the definition of impact indicators.</p>

A slowdown in the population growth rate impacts negatively on the economy and increases the risk of dependence. These trends are more pronounced in regions where the exodus of young people to attractive urban centres is more marked. The EU must find ways to manage these developments in a sustainable manner, notably through cohesion policy.

Demographic change is therefore considered the major trend of the 21st century, and it will drastically change the political, social, societal and economic situation in Europe. This report, for which I voted, identifies the following priorities: better adapting the Structural Funds to the challenges of demographic change; preventing depopulation and the social exclusion of the elderly; combating unemployment amongst women and young people; and making use of the knowledge and experience of older people. In order for Europe to achieve an adequate response to demographic change, it is important, firstly, that it be possible to determine these changes in adequate statistical terms, and, secondly, that there be better coordination between the responsible entities at all levels and an exchange of best practices.</p>

Not all EU regions have realised that demographic change can bring risks, but they now have to understand that each region and each urban area needs its own strategy. In principle, this is the Member States’ responsibility, but the regions themselves must be proactive and, at the same time, they need guidance and prospects for the future. Demographic change, especially population ageing, has a clear impact on the provision of social infrastructure, such as pension systems, nursing care and health care, with regional authorities having to meet changing demand from various population groups. Moreover, the impact of demographic change varies substantially from region to region, depending on whether it is rapid or slow and whether the region concerned is a region of net immigration or of shrinking population and therefore requires a different adjustment strategy, and must be tackled in a coordinated way by all European, national and regional authorities. Attention should be drawn to the fact that in regions of shrinking population, particularly rural regions, quality of life is defined differently from the way it is in regions with a growing population, and therefore different support strategies are needed.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I firmly believe that the Structural Funds must be better adapted to the challenges of demographic change. The Commission should consider this change a key priority for European development. At the same time, Member States and regions should take more account of this topic than previously, and consider it a horizontal priority in their operational programmes. In the distribution of resources from the Structural Funds at regional level, account should be taken of demographic indicators. We are confronting significant challenges with infrastructure, not only in rural areas, but also in the cities. We must prevent an exodus of citizens and the social exclusion of old people, and we must also make changes to town planning. The Structural Funds can play a supporting role here. Towns and villages must be attractive to citizens, and this includes infrastructure that is of benefit to children and families, as well as good public transport over short distances. In view of the fact that demographic changes mainly affect old people, children and families, it is necessary for resources from the European Regional Development Fund to be directed to supporting loans at favourable interest rates that can help with the construction of flats that are suitable for old people or with supporting multigenerational housing. It is essential to have comprehensive health care, sufficient nursing staff and payment-free, all-day child care, which can be supported by cohesion policy.</p>

The increase in life expectancy and the ageing of the population present two of today’s great challenges in the field of demographic change and have an impact on the political, social and economic circumstances of every country. To this end, structural policy should take up these challenges, concentrating on the needs of the elderly, children and families, on the necessity to employ skilled labour, focusing on increasing the inclusion of women in the labour market as well as on the use of Structural Funds to adapt to different regional scenarios. Furthermore, I believe that it is very important to strengthen aid to regions characterised by depopulation and by population ageing in order to guarantee that these regions are in a position to benefit from Structural Funds. To this effect, it could be useful to promote the importance of entrepreneurship and innovation, of social infrastructures and integrated urban development. I hope that all Member States will be able to adopt their own support strategies which are nevertheless coordinated by the various relevant authorities. In order to distribute Structural Funds, it is certainly necessary to bear in mind the different levels of development between regions.</p>

Apart from the ageing of the population and lower birth rates at global level, demographic change in a number of regions of the European Union is bringing new challenges that should be considered objectively in future EU cohesion policy. In certain regions, there is depopulation; in others, considerable influxes of people. I therefore consider it absolutely essential to set out and implement an adequate infrastructure policy, adapted to the needs of each area. The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund play a key role here. As such, there is a need to develop specific policies for the rural areas suffering depopulation, on the one hand, and specific policies for the urban areas receiving significant influxes of population, on the other.

If higher life expectancy is a positive aspect of these changes, the same could not be said for others, in particular, for those that concern young people and women. With regard to these categories of the population, elements that have been shown to be inadequate include work policies that have put a strain both on training (including at university and post university), in favour of a more pronounced trend towards entering the world of work, and on accompanying policies concerning remaining in work, with a view to greater fulfilment of family needs. To this end, among the initiatives to be reinforced by more profitable use of Structural Funds, one could, on the one hand, include the provision of services in support of guidance and of satisfying the demand for work with job offers, whereby these services are adequate, operational and easily accessible to those who require them. On the other hand, one could intervene by strengthening policies in support of the family (including greater diffusion of public or private nurseries and organisation of flexible work).

Demographic change is ‘the major trend of the 21st century, as it will drastically change the political, social, societal and economic situation in Europe’, so it is essential that the Structural Funds be channelled into alleviating the negative effects of this change: investment in rural areas to prevent depopulation; urban child care facilities; benefits for older people, children and families; increased rate of employment for women; and a new policy for integrating qualified immigrant women.

The rapporteur’s intention is to examine and explore these developments, from the point of view of the opportunities and consequences of demographic change. As we stated during the debate, it concerns us that this debate is frequently used, in some ways that are more disguised than others, to pave the way for enforcing measures that threaten the fundamental rights and victories of the workers and peoples, like social security systems; for increasing the retirement age and reducing pension values, for overloading and damaging social infrastructure, and for abolishing rights to health care.</p>
      <p sl="pt">All this has been happening with the implementation of so-called austerity measures. If demographic change is not to represent a step backwards for society or jeopardise economic and social cohesion, public services must be universal and of high quality, adapted and reinforced according to new requirements resulting from demographic change, and publicly owned.

The problem is not demographic change itself, but politicians’ and society’s hesitation to address this change. Meeting the full range of demographic challenges is principally the task of the Member States, but the regions must be proactive, for which reason they need support at European level. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) can contribute to the task of addressing the challenges stemming from demographic change in the EU, namely, the increase in the number of older people and the decline in the young population.

Not only are they the continent’s far youngest minority with the lowest socio-economic status, but their communities can be characterised by reversed demographic trends compared to the majority population. Hence, in most new Member States, while there is a rapid ageing of the majority population, the proportion of Roma is quickly increasing within the active age cohort, which carries the social security system on its shoulders.</p>

A demographic change, indeed, leads to reflections and new strategies regarding European Structural Funds anticipated for the development of urban and rural areas. Evaluating, in the light of the new figures on life expectancy and birth rates, the policies relating to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and, more generally, those that concern mobility and social cohesion, is more necessary than ever. However, this evaluation must take place under the watchful eye of the authorities in individual Member States and regions. Mr Westphal’s report, for which I have voted in favour, reflects the need to tackle the theme of demographic change, in the diversity and complexity of its elements, keeping in mind the repercussions it can have on the economy, employment and mobility, and those that are closely linked to the citizens of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Demographic change in the EU is a fact and handling it constitutes one of the core tasks for the future. Europe’s population is ageing: it has the oldest population and the lowest population growth rate in the world. In most Member States, the birth rate is below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman (and continues to fall in some cases), while life expectancy is rising. There is a 50% probability that a girl born in Germany in 2010 will reach the age of 100. Demographic change is therefore rightly considered to be the major trend of the 21st century, as it will drastically change the political, social, societal and economic situation in Europe. This report makes some sensible suggestions for handling demographic change and I supported it.</p>

Member States and regions can draw on the Structural Funds to develop tailor-made strategies. In order to find answers to the challenges posed by demographic change, we believe that it is necessary, first and foremost, to obtain adequate statistics on this change.

      <p sl="ro">Demographic change is a current problem facing the EU, exerting an irreversible impact on society. In order to meet the EU 2020 objectives for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, demographic change needs to be approached as an opportunity rather than an inconvenience. The year 2012 is the European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations. The decline in the number of people of working age and the ageing population will have a crucial impact on the labour market. At the same time, youth unemployment is growing at an alarming rate, and the European Union is obliged, in practical terms, to establish a balance between generations.</p>
      <p sl="ro">An initial measure is to utilise the full potential of the European Social Fund to support opportunities for training, professional retraining and social inclusion involving women and young people. The next step must be to encourage workforce training, particularly in developing regions in countries which have joined the European Union more recently. The workforce in countries like Romania or Bulgaria is not used to its full professional capacity. Equal opportunities on the labour market will lead to beneficial competition and provide a dynamic, professionally well-trained workforce. Removing discrimination against workers, promoting their mobility, along with creating a stable vocational training system, are key factors contributing to the European Union’s future.</p>

It sets out a concrete proposal that is based on the conviction that the trend can be reversed in the long term and benefited from in the short term. The European Union cannot walk away from the responsibility of dealing with this phenomenon, since it will set the tone for the future economic and political structure of united Europe. The wide range of effects that it has on social dynamics suggests the use of the structural policy in order to take positive action. The report puts forward six priority areas for ensuring that the rights of all generations are protected, be they children, young people, women or the elderly. The idea of using the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) must be taken into consideration during the discussion on the legislative package on the new cohesion policy. The subject we are looking at is entirely coherent with the objective of promoting social cohesion, which is among the three priorities of the EU 2020 strategy.

The birth rate per woman remains below the 2.1 children required for sustaining the population, whereas life expectancy is increasing. Demographic change presents many regions of the European Union with new challenges. The European Commission communication on promoting solidarity between the regions states that the rights of each generation must be protected. Due to the diversity of the challenges, regions and cities will need strategies of their own. This generally falls within Member State competence, and it is therefore obvious that regions must act proactively, in which they require both guidance and perspectives. In their operational programmes for the 2007-2013 programming period, the Member States have allocated some EUR 30 billion (8.5% of Structural Fund appropriations) to measures in this field.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Regional policy is therefore a key instrument in tackling demographic change. In the future, the Structural Funds will need to be better aligned to the challenges of demographic change, and should acknowledge it as a horizontal priority in their operational programmes.

The trend towards an ageing population is not as pronounced in the new Member States in Eastern Europe as it is in the old EU Member States. Demographic change is certain to bring about decisive changes in the political, social, societal and economic situation in Europe. The abandonment of whole areas of land highlights the threats to which rural regions will be exposed in future if we cannot put a stop to the migration of younger people. Initial investigations into the costs and benefits of immigration should by now have made it clear that mass migration is not an appropriate response to demographic change.</p>

The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) must provide increased funding for urban and infrastructure development. It should be noted that the Commission has a special role to play in this area because it must ensure the effective and coordinated management of the consequences of demographic change.

      <p sl="el">I voted in favour of the report. We usually refer to demographic change as a problem. However, the fact that people are living longer is obviously not a problem. The real problem is low birth rates. The cause, apart from the modern way of life, is the economic insecurity and fear that people feel about starting and maintaining a large family. How could they feel otherwise when more than one in three large families – 31.3% to be precise – in the European Union today face the risk of poverty and social exclusion. This, therefore, is the major challenge: to adjust the Cohesion Fund at EU level and operational programmes at national level to support families, to support large families, to promise that social cuts to large families will not be accepted. This pledge, this social contract with large families, is the best safety net for safeguarding social cohesion and for resolving the current demographic problem, and it is becoming even more important in countries such as Greece, where citizens are suffering unprecedented and drastic cuts to social benefits due to the economic crisis.</p>

In this sense, I welcome Kerstin Westphal’s report. Making ageing a horizontal objective of cohesion policy, which is what is proposed, will make it possible for projects to be funded that are able to meet the expectations of our regions in terms of services, infrastructure and social policy in a context of demographic change. Better coordinated and targeted European funding programmes, such as the ERDF, the ESF and the EAFRD, may, in fact, be very decisive in helping regional and local authorities guarantee continuing medical coverage, good urban planning, the possibility of intergenerational communication, and an appropriate policy for the integration of migrants.

Indeed, the increasing ageing of the population requires ambitious and courageous strategies. A low fertility rate of 1.5 children per woman, continually rising life expectancy, a decline in the working-age population, and an entire generation of baby boomers who are now retiring require us to adapt our policies if we do not want to burden future generations with the debt of our present comfort. Europe’s role is not to impose an age at which everyone should retire, nor to impose a contribution model. Nonetheless, Europe may be of assistance in the coordination of policies, the implementation of a strategy for the employment of senior citizens through the European Social Fund (ESF), or investing through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in care facilities for the elderly and the refurbishment of social housing for dependents. For the period from 2007 to 2013, the Member States have allocated almost EUR 30 billion in their operational programmes to initiatives in this area.

It lags far behind the Castex report which was adopted by Parliament in 2008 and, as a result, will be a disappointment for many European citizens. Women, in particular, will find that the report contains very little for them, despite the fact that demographic change has a female face. In the majority of the Member States, it is women who have to choose between children and a career, who do the work of caring for family members which is generally unpaid and unrecognised, and who are therefore the largest group of people suffering from poverty in old age. The amendments which the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Quality and I, on behalf of the Group of the Greens, have submitted were an attempt to rectify this situation. However, the rapporteur rejected all these amendments and opted instead for a completely outdated picture of the family in which women, as in the past, are the unpaid care workers.

      <p sl="it">According to Eurostat, none of the EU Member States has a positive population replacement rate. Only a few, including Great Britain, France and Ireland, have steadily increasing populations. In truth, some say that the European countries characterised by population decline – Germany, Italy and Spain – have reached the point of no return in demographic terms. According to some demographers, these countries have fallen into a ‘low fertility trap’.</p>
      <p sl="it">The reasons behind a low birth rate are the fact that not having children and families with just one child is becoming the norm and this results in the cultural institutionalisation of ‘zero growth’. In the developed world, delaying having children is among the main causes of the low fertility rate, while access to contraceptives has allowed the adult population to exercise greater control over when they have children. Ever increasing numbers of men and women are aiming first of all to establish themselves at work, putting off having children until later.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I supported Ms Westphal’s own-initiative report because I believe that in order to stop current demographic trends and encourage people to have children, we must give the citizens of Europe hope. The reason for this is that a logical consequence of hopelessness and a lack of economic prospects is migration and relocation to more promising regions. However, the depopulation phenomenon afflicting several European regions could be reversed by following a targeted cohesion policy that takes into account intra-regional differences. We must therefore assess how sustainable a method of planning based solely on a GDP-based regional development indicator is when the overall picture it provides obscures the centres of poverty. Europe should pay increased attention to such micro-regions, and should assist them in participating in tender schemes and finding their way through the mazes of bureaucracy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">All this presupposes a far higher degree of flexibility on the part of the EU. It must focus on programmes that make micro-regions attractive again and create jobs.

The European Union has an ageing population, while its birth rate is falling. A healthy, active population is critical for the development of European society. In order to tackle demographic change, the EU needs to narrow the existing discrepancies in terms of health and improve access to health care services. Member States must be encouraged to use the ERDF and ESF Structural Funds to adapt housing to the needs of the elderly, so as to safeguard the quality of life in an ageing society and support young families. We call for the ESF rules to be made easier to manage and also to allow small organisations to enjoy this source of funding, and to develop and manage innovative social projects. We urge the Commission to create more flexible terms which will promote cross-financing between the ERDF and ESF funds by Member States and local authorities when devising and implementing integrated urban development plans/strategies.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I am pleased that the report addresses demographic issues, but there should be a greater focus on those challenges which have an impact on rural areas and towns. One third of Lithuania’s population lives in rural areas. While young people are emigrating, the rural population is ageing – a quarter of the rural population is over 60 years of age. The statistics are worrying. The birth rate in rural areas is 30% higher than in urban areas, but this percentage is falling every year, while the rate of mortality in rural areas is very high (75% higher than in urban areas). This has a negative impact on natural population growth. Demographic change also underlines the disparities in the quality of life of those living in rural and urban areas. In Lithuania, children, farmers and the elderly are worst affected by demographic change. Lithuania’s rural population is three times more likely to experience poverty than the inhabitants of its major cities. I agree with the rapporteur that the EU Structural Funds should be better adapted to the challenges caused by demographic change.

Between 1990 and 2005, Saxony lost 13% of its population and, by 2020, it is expected to lose another 11.4%. The causes of this are migration and, most importantly, low birth rates. Demographic change has an impact on almost all areas of life and, in particular, on the economy. Vocational education for younger and older workers is becoming increasingly important. However, this issue also involves infrastructures and many services. A number of regions within the EU are affected, not just eastern Germany. For this reason, EU structural funding provides essential aid. During the current subsidy period, around EUR 30 billion is available for operational programmes in the region. We also need to take this into account for the new subsidy period, which begins in 2014, and this is called for in the report, which I have voted in favour of.</p>
      <p sl="de">This can include support for education and training for young and older people, funding to help young families, and changes in urban and regional planning, such as subsidies for housing suitable for elderly people. We must now ensure that the money is distributed in a way which takes these challenges into account and allows the regions sufficient room for manoeuvre.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The financial crisis has highlighted many shortcomings in the financial system, such as ‘short selling’ and ‘credit default swaps’ (CDS). Credit default swaps are a form of financial insurance used to hedge the risks taken by the purchaser. These risks may be the bankruptcy of a company or of a state. Accentuating the speculation, CDS contributed to the bursting of the financial bubble in 2008 and led to the collapse of the US bank Lehman Brothers. However, CDS have not disappeared, and they threaten the euro area if Greece is declared to have defaulted on its sovereign debt. It is therefore imperative that the financial markets are regulated to a greater extent. As I am in favour of tighter regulation of CDS, I voted for Pascal Canfin’s report.</p>

However, the powers that national regulators have to restrict or ban such selling vary from Member State to Member State. This new regulation will create a harmonised framework for coordinated action at European level. This regulation bans or restricts these transactions and makes it more difficult to speculate on a country’s sovereign debt. The new legislation intends to increase transparency and enable regulators to more easily detect the risks of the debt market. The regulation also makes it impossible to buy credit default swaps with the sole purpose of speculating on a country’s default, owing to the negative impact that these can have on the stability of the sovereign debt markets. The European Securities and Markets Authority will be central to monitoring and supervision activities. The regulation also introduces stricter requirements as regards informing and notifying national and European regulatory entities, in order that these might be able to monitor the markets and detect the accumulation of risk more easily.

The proposal being voted on today contains limitations on sales and purchases of financial products and derivatives through the markets which, under the current structure, can be used by speculators aiming to damage sovereign debt securities and make money out of the downward spiral of prices.

They also delegate powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). The ban on so-called naked short selling is also appropriate. The current debt crisis shows how speculators who do not own bonds of euro area Member States but only bet on them can cause entire states to go bankrupt. It is therefore important that only bond holders can engage in covering securities through credit default swaps. Last but not least, we also need to strengthen ESMA’s powers.

However, as with all of the other European texts on the regulation of the financial markets, it did not live up to my expectations. The European Union contents itself with minimal, partial, incidental measures, when it should really be attacking the root of the problem and calling into question all of the acts that have brought us to this point, and I mean all of them: elimination of controls on capital movements, securitisation of debts, floating exchange rates, ban on the monetisation of public debts, and so on. In other words, we should abandon the general philosophy that has governed the globalisation of the economy for decades. There is no doubt that the financial sector is already preparing instruments that will enable it to by-pass or distort these measures. Indeed, the states are still under the control of the markets and the rating agencies when it comes to financing never-ending deficits fuelled in part by the exorbitant interest rates.

However, it is now possible to buy these products without being a creditor or an owner of sovereign bonds oneself. In this case, it is an advantage if a company or a state cannot meet its financial obligations, because the insurance amount is ultimately paid to the owner of the credit default swaps. It goes without saying that these two financial instruments can cause increased instability on the markets in particular in times of financial and economic crisis and, therefore, must be subjected to restrictions.

      <p sl="pt">Following the financial crisis, it became necessary to provide the legal systems of various Member States with legislative instruments enabling preventative measures to be taken against the risk of another systemic crisis emergency. In this context, the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps is justified, enabling consumers and investors to be offered means of protection and, at macro-economic level, the risk of systemic crises to be reduced.

      <p sl="de">I have voted in favour of the Canfin report because, following long-drawn-out negotiations with the Council, the European Parliament has succeeded in reaching an agreement and introducing improvements in the form of stricter regulation of short selling and credit default swaps. Parliament was able to convince the Council of the validity of its position on many points during the trialogue negotiations. Trading in uncovered credit default swaps on state debt, which has drastically increased levels of state debt in Greece, Portugal and Spain and, more recently, also in Italy, will be subject to stringent restrictions and will only be possible with the agreement of the European Securities and Markets Authority. For a long time, I did not understand why the Council spent so much time hesitating over this subject in the negotiations. At the start of the negotiations, the Council took a very cautious approach and spoke out in favour of a minimum level of regulation of short selling.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a result of the negotiating skills of the delegation from the European Parliament during the trialogue negotiations, it has been possible to achieve what, in comparison, represents a major step towards preventing high-risk speculation.

      <p sl="fr">I supported the agreement reached between the Polish Presidency and the European Parliament delegation to ban naked selling on sovereign debt. In my view, it is important, in the wake of the decision taken by certain Member States (Germany, France, Belgium, etc.), for the European Union to ‘clean up’ the jungle of financial instruments that are destabilising the markets and reducing the monetary funds available to finance the real economy. The creativity of the experts is clearly limitless, as in this case, where financial institutions have the possibility of purchasing credit default swaps without owning the underlying assets, for example, Greek state bonds. Applied to the real economy, it is as if a citizen were given the opportunity to take out a fire insurance policy on his neighbour’s house, giving him an obvious interest in a little arson.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is the worst possible temptation! In adopting this regulation here, the European Parliament is seeking a ‘return to normal’. As the rapporteur, Mr Canfin states, this compromise ‘will make it impossible for a hedge fund to buy Greek or Italian credit default swaps (CDS) without already owning the bonds of those countries, for the sole purpose of speculating on the country’s default’.</p>

The new European rules adopted today impose greater transparency and will prohibit the use of some kinds of credit default swaps (CDSs), which are financial products used as insurance against defaults. These rules prove that the EU can act against speculation when the political will to do so exists. The legislation will make it impossible to buy CDSs with the sole aim of speculating on a country’s default. For example, buying Greek CDSs will only be allowed from now on if the buyer already owns Greek government bonds or a stake in a sector that is highly dependent on their performance, such as a Greek bank, since, if the country were to go bankrupt, Greek banks would certainly suffer a great deal.</p>

It was utterly disgraceful to make it possible to speculate on the default and failure of others. The entry into force of the text will, in principle, enshrine the prohibition of such selling if the purchaser is not exposed to the sovereign debt concerned. However, national market authorities will be able to suspend the ban temporarily if a malfunction occurs on the sovereign debt market. We also welcome the progress made in respect of disclosure: this should enable the regulatory and supervisory bodies to carry out their duties better through improved preventive work and closer monitoring.

The European Parliament pushed to ensure a ban on naked CDS was included from the outset, and its inclusion is a victory for the EP and our efforts to curb the excesses of the financial system.

      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament has adopted a law curbing sovereign debt speculation by banning credit default swaps (CDS). Credit default swaps can be held by a speculator even if the speculator does not hold any debt. In practice, this amounts to insuring the house of his neighbour and selling this insurance when there is an increased risk of fire.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Credit default swaps have led to frenzied speculation, with speculators buying them in huge volumes in order to increase the perception of a risk that the country will collapse. In so doing, speculators artificially increase the price of these CDS and sell them at very high prices to the holders of the debt.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is an aberration. Banning credit default swaps if the purchaser does not hold bonds issued by the country involved is a positive step.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This measure will certainly not be enough to stem the crisis. However, it does have the merit of demonstrating to all who are still in any doubt that the financial crisis is not an act of fate but the result of political choices, and these choices can be re-examined. Determination to control the markets and to regulate the speculators is not a pipe dream, of which there is ample evidence.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I was keen to support this legislative resolution, which extends the financial regulation process launched by my political family in 2007. This text prohibits malicious financial operators from hastening the default of euro area Member States by banning naked credit default swaps (CDS). These financial instruments, originally designed for investors to take out insurance when purchasing a State bond, constituted an autonomous market. In other words, it was possible to hold the insurance on a house (the CDS) without being the owner of the house (the State bond). Therefore, it was in the interest of the holder of the insurance that the house burned down so that he could collect the payout. This grotesque situation in particular led hedge funds to create a climate of panic around Greece by acquiring CDS in huge volumes. These CDS then became increasingly lucrative as concern spread. Faced with this excessive speculation, Greece had to borrow at exorbitant rates of interest, thereby accumulating even more debt. In order to prevent other States from falling foul of such speculative madness, we are now demanding that the holder of the CDS must also hold the State bond.</p>

The reduced administrative burden and simpler questionnaires will allow more comprehensive data to be collated on the volume of production, products and crops on the European market. Having reliable statistics brings about a win-win situation; on the one hand, they help to ensure that the right decisions are taken in terms of demand, production and differentiation of European agricultural products, so as to make them more competitive and, on the other, they tell farmers and agricultural cooperatives how they can optimise their land. By definition, improving these statistics will be very useful to Greece, whose economy is heavily reliant on the primary sector.</p>

It is now being discussed again, as part of the vote on the extension of the Euratom Framework Programme. Pursuing nuclear research is all well and good, but the research budget should not be devoted exclusively to nuclear energy. Diversification is necessary. I say this in particular because, with the exponential increase in the cost of the ITER project since its launch in 2006 – from EUR 6 billion to EUR 16 billion – I believe that the project should now continue with the resources it has been given. While research – both fusion and fission – is a good thing (even if it should be diversified), I deeply regret the increase in appropriations (an additional EUR 700 000 for 2012) and the financial tinkering planned, as it would mean draining part of the EU research budget solely to fund ITER, not to mention the planned budget cuts in the field of research, which will only exacerbate the imbalance between research spending on nuclear energy and on renewable energies.

Given the relevance of the nuclear activities undertaken by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in the fields of testing and non-proliferation, of the safety of installations, of waste management and of radioactivity in the environment, it is also important that adequate funds are anticipated so that these activities can be continued at an exceptionally high level.

      <p sl="it">At a delicate time for the economies of Member States and for markets, and bearing in mind the enormous expenditures in the field of nuclear research, special attention should be paid to the definition of contractual arrangements intended to reduce the risk of failure to perform as well as to the reallocation of risks and costs over time.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to ensure the safety of existing nuclear power plants, it is necessary to keep an eye on the state of the structures and to invest in research to prolong their lifetimes. At this moment, the average lifetime of the current generation of active nuclear power plants in Europe is 40 years; this period of time can be lengthened if necessary. Generation III and Generation IV systems aim towards lifetimes of 60 years, minimising running and maintenance costs that are due to old age. The objective of the framework programme is to establish a solid scientific and technical basis to demonstrate the safety of the technologies for disposing of spent fuel.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another fundamental aspect concerns transparency of public information regarding atomic energy and the nuclear sector.

      <p sl="pt">The Seventh Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom FP) 2007-2011 is made up of two specific programmes – one of ‘indirect actions’ and another of ‘direct actions’ – which finish at the end of this year. The European Commission has tabled a proposal intended to extend the specific programme of ‘direct actions’ for a further two years (2012-2013), so as to ensure the continuation of EU-financed nuclear research and training activities. I am voting for this European Parliament decision because it is important to increase the sector’s funding and allocate more grants to the area of nuclear research, since that is the only way it will be possible for the EU not to lose its leading role at global level. I also believe a multiannual programme should be drawn up, which should include the scientific and technological priorities, the objectives of research and training activities, and the related implementation dates.</p>

The current Euratom Framework Programme, Euratom FP7 (2007-2011), comprising two specific programmes (one for ‘indirect actions’, and the other for ‘direct actions’ carried out by the Joint Research Centre (JRC)), will expire at the end of 2011. I voted to extend the specific programme for ‘direct actions’ for the 2012-2013 period to ensure that the research funded by the EU continues into nuclear waste management and the physical and radiological safety and protection of nuclear systems.</p>

There are numerous problematic points in all three reports, such as, for example, in connection with funding and the participation of the private sector in general in subsidising research, but that is not my main comment. The main reason I voted against the report is because I am opposed to nuclear energy in principle. Unfortunately, the report reproduces the distorted perception of the usefulness of nuclear energy for economic reasons and in combating climate change. It maintains that more public funding is needed for basic nuclear research. It also advocates the need for the Union to ‘lead the way’ in this sector. However, the funding needed, especially in these times of crisis, is funding for sustainable growth based on renewable sources, which is truly compatible with environmental and social needs.</p>

It is now being discussed again, as part of the vote on the extension of the Euratom Framework Programme. Pursuing nuclear research is all well and good, but the research budget should not be devoted exclusively to nuclear energy. Diversification is necessary. I say this in particular because, with the exponential increase in the cost of the ITER project since its launch in 2006 – from EUR 6 billion to EUR 16 billion – I believe that the project should now continue with the resources it has been given. While research – both fusion and fission – is a good thing (even if it should be diversified), I deeply regret the increase in appropriations (an additional EUR 700 000 for 2012) and the financial tinkering planned, as it would mean draining part of the EU research budget solely to fund ITER, not to mention the planned budget cuts in the field of research, which will only exacerbate the imbalance between research spending on nuclear energy and on renewable energies.

Shared research and training in this area is essential for boosting competitiveness, economic growth and scientific excellence in Europe. These entities’ contribution is fundamental for the development of new technologies that will consume fewer resources, guarantee greater safety and efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. Coordination and knowledge sharing are also part and parcel of the Euratom Safety Programme. Therefore, these aspects will be able to show the effective application of the results of research and development activities in nuclear facilities in light of better understanding of the causes of accidents and possible solutions.

      <p sl="fr">Respect for the free movement of workers as required for the operation of the internal market requires mutual recognition of professional qualifications. In 2005, the EU adopted a directive moving in this direction. Today, it is a question of ensuring its implementation within the Union. To do so, Member States must show mutual confidence and promote mobility for qualified workers, especially young graduates. I therefore voted in favour of Emma McClarkin’s report, which calls for a simplification of the recognition procedures.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Changing demographics will make the mobility of professionals across the European Union increasingly important. Professional mobility is a key factor for restoring economic development and a sustainable economy. According to the findings of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop), demand for highly skilled workers is expected to rise by over 16 million jobs in the European Union between now and 2020, and there must therefore be greater transparency, simplification and flexibility in the rules on the recognition of professional qualifications. One of the main reasons for difficulties in recognising academic titles and professional qualifications is a lack of confidence in the criteria used for accreditation and granting academic qualifications in the country of origin, so that there is an urgent need to establish automatic recognition measures by removing prejudice and formal national obstacles to recognition. I welcome the call to lay the foundations for an ambitious system for the validation of the professional skills of all workers, so that the latter can obtain full or partial certification (diploma, vocational qualification, statement of professional standing) on the basis of their professional experience following validation by a panel of their knowledge and skills.</p>

      <p sl="fr">It must be admitted that the recognition of professional qualifications in the European Union is far from being achieved. Many obstacles remain, as the 2005 directive did not settle all of the issues. It is therefore more than necessary to simplify and modernise the existing system. The Member States must cooperate more with one another, with recognition of professional qualifications being a matter of trust. It goes without saying that mobility must not be emphasised at the expense of quality. This is why we must continue the discussion of this famous European professional card, which we have been talking about since 2005, but which still provokes resistance. The pilot projects have shown that it can be a useful tool for improved recognition of qualifications. We therefore call on the Commission to continue along these lines by showing the added-value of such a card and by giving the necessary guarantees, especially as regards data protection.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Professional Qualifications Directive pursues the aim of ensuring that European citizens’ professions are recognised outside the country where they gained the relevant qualification. Currently, the complexity of the recognition process for professional qualifications, which is associated with an extremely high number of regulated professions – particularly in Italy – is an obstacle to entry for European professionals and, as a result, this limits internal competition in regulated professions, with negative effects on competition between European businesses.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore agree with the report’s demand to streamline administrative processes for recognising professions by making full use of new information technologies. In my opinion, the establishment of registration systems and an online portal containing all the information on the procedures could speed up processes for recognising professional qualifications while also facilitating more effective circulation of information between the administrations of Member States, thereby lowering the access barriers to professionals from different countries.</p>

Creating a favourable environment for cross-border professional mobility is an important means of ensuring economic growth and competitiveness in the EU, and the European Parliament therefore proposes establishing a voluntary European professional card certifying academic and professional experience acquired. This card could be a useful tool in aiding mobility for some professions, and might simplify administrative procedures and enhance the safety of workers. The European Parliament also urges the Member States, competent authorities and the Commission to ensure that recognition of diplomas and certificates is on a par with recognition of professional qualifications, so as to create a genuine single market at European and international level and thereby avoid regulating what has already been regulated. The Member States, competent authorities and the Commission should ensure greater transparency so that applicants or people who have received a negative response can be given a full explanation as to the reasons for the non-recognition of their diploma or professional qualification. All workers must therefore be given information both about their rights and the procedures for the recognition of professional qualifications in order to guarantee the rights of all workers and end their exploitation.</p>

This is another step towards reinforced EU strategy in the single market, which will limit national determination of what proof is required from those who claim to be highly skilled workers to corroborate their professional abilities. We cannot ignore the fact that there is a huge gap between professional standards and educational requirements in poor countries of Europe, which struggle to compete with the most advanced Member States such as Great Britain. I am against the EP proposal of setting up a voluntary professional passport linked to an electronic exchange system connecting public authorities across the EU, known as the Internal Market Information system. However I do agree that a lot of suspended or struck-off professionals, who leave their own countries to work in other Member States, pose an enormous danger, but I believe that national state authorities should determine the recognition of qualifications of those who are coming from abroad to work.</p>

The right to recognition of academic and professional qualifications can only truly exist when the national rules, which tend to make it disproportionately difficult to exercise the right to qualified jobs, have been eliminated. The very development of the markets requires increased transparency, simplification and flexibility of regulations concerning the recognition of professional qualifications, in which cross-border mobility should contribute to the smoother working of the labour markets, while encouraging economic growth and competitiveness in the EU. I therefore agree that there is a need to modernise and improve this directive, so as to ensure a clear legal framework, by improving the system for recognition of professional qualifications, with the establishment of automatic recognition measures, and by removing prejudice and formal national obstacles to recognition. At the same time, conclusion of the transposition of this directive in all the Member States and its implementation also needs to be ensured.

Indeed, that is of far greater importance, as the recognition of professional qualifications is of fundamental significance to the growth of competition, the economy and the internal market more generally. I believe that greater authority between the relevant authorities is needed, by means of new communication technologies that streamline and accelerate processes of recognising professional qualifications thereby reducing access barriers. In my opinion, greater balance between workers’ mobility and the quality of recognised professional qualifications is a key factor in economic development and sustainable growth, and crucial in a period of such deep crisis.

This is therefore a priority issue which should, nevertheless, take into account certain essential issues like an in-depth command of the host state’s language, the professional’s accountability and the safety of the public, through a proactive mechanism for warning of unsuitable professionals.

      <p sl="pt">This report has positive aspects, but is certainly not free of contradictions. The current economic and social context of a profound crisis in various countries, like Portugal, is pressurising many workers, particularly young people, to emigrate and seek work wherever they can find it. Mobility is therefore emerging, not as a desired option that is chosen from a number of possible alternatives, but as an escape into which people are pushed by a lack of alternatives in their home country. Naturally, it is important for anyone going to work in a country other than their own to demand the recognition of their professional qualifications. However, there are issues that must be borne in mind relating to health care professions, to the historical and cultural component of the country in question, and to the language itself. As such, the recognition of professionals’ qualifications must not threaten the rights of consumers and service users. Above all, however, there is a need to encourage and support the creation of jobs with rights in all the Member States, so that people can truly work where they want, and will not be obliged to leave their country simply because they have no work.</p>

The revamp will require true ownership on the part of Member States, whereby national governments and labour market players will have to engage in a structured dialogue on how better to guarantee professional integration of young people and the cross-border movement of workers with a view to establishing an efficient and transparent professional qualifications recognition system which is applicable throughout Europe.

      <p sl="da">I am voting in favour of the report on the recognition of professional qualifications, which is a step in the right direction if the free movement of persons is to work. If the professional qualifications that EU citizens have obtained through training or work in one Member State are not recognised in the other Member States, then, in my opinion, we cannot have a well-functioning internal market. As the demographics change as the population in Western Europe, on average, gets older, we need the internal market to work more than ever. I am in complete agreement with the report’s message that the most effective way to create a framework for free movement is to limit the number of regulated professions.

It is important that Europeans be able to work freely throughout the EU, because the benefits which flow from a competitive European internal market are going to be an important factor driving development of the EU, particularly now at this time of economic and financial crisis.

I also support the idea that language proficiency should not be set up as a basic obstacle to the pursuit of a profession.

This integrated single market can only function effectively if European workers are able to choose which Member State they wish to work in.

The issue of the recognition of professional qualifications is fundamental for the integration of our economies. This report will make the process easier and shorter for doctors, midwives, dentists, chemists, architects and other professionals wishing to work elsewhere within the European Union, without undermining the safety of European citizens.

When the action that determines them consists of a generalised removal of pre-existing defensive norms, the repercussions can be more damaging than the causes we are trying to eradicate. The free circulation of services and people represents, I would say, the most important part of the package of freedom to promote a common market. It seemed natural to propose that we take into account any relevant differences which still exist between the 27 national systems. Unfortunately, amendments to that effect have all been rejected. The intention was to anticipate, initially, the acceleration of processes for the homogenisation of training systems and equivalence of qualifications, as well as the reworking of orders and regulations on determining professional fees, with a view to protecting civil rights and liberties and not opposing competition.

Speeding up recognition procedures for professional qualifications would also help young Europeans to believe professional experience in any Member State is possible. In this context of crisis, all European professionals are hoping their mobility will increase so as to be able to exercise their profession.

However, the free movement of persons within the EU and the right to recognition of merit and professional skills will only exist when the invisible barriers that now exist have been reduced to a minimum. The recognition of academic and professional qualifications is a prerequisite for establishing a genuine internal market and for enabling everyone to fully enjoy the benefits of this freedom of movement. As a result, we must encourage all the initiatives aimed at making cross-border mobility easier. An effective way of making freedom of movement for professionals possible would be to reduce the total number of regulated professions in the EU, although one classification may be justified by consumer protection considerations, particularly in the case of the medical, legal or technical professions. We should encourage remunerated supervised practice for graduates from other Member States and ensure that the professional experience acquired during the supervised practice is recognised in the home Member State.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The proposals set out in the report are aimed at remedying the problems and shortcomings observed in the area of recognising professional qualifications since the entry into force of the directive in 2005, so that the right to access jobs or provide services in another Member State, which is enshrined in the Treaties, is fully implemented. To this end, there is a need to simplify regulation, increase the accessibility of information, enhance mutual coordination and boost confidence in the system. On the other hand, a balance must be maintained between the right to take up employment and the rights of consumers, including patients. I hope that the European Parliament’s proposals will be properly reflected in the legal proposal drafted by the Commission. We must ensure that everyone who has the right can take advantage of a system for the recognition of qualifications which is flexible, accessible and not too complex – this is what professionals throughout the EU expect of us. Health care professionals are the most mobile in the EU (around 57 200 professional qualifications of professionals in this field were recognised in the period 2007-2010). Of the 800 regulated qualifications, 43% are in health care systems, while 9% are in the social sector, including education. Countries like Lithuania, which, for a number of years, have experienced negative trends due to the emigration of highly qualified professionals, should reform the most sensitive sectors accordingly. Research shows that the majority of professionals would be inclined to work in the country where they acquired their qualifications, even for a relatively lower salary, if there were sufficient opportunities to work in their chosen profession upon graduation.</p>

Favourable conditions will thus be created to promote the mobility of professionals because currently, the refusal to recognise qualifications obtained in another Member State is often one of the greatest obstacles to ensuring the freedom to provide services and the free movement of persons.

The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training estimates that demand for highly skilled workers will rise by over 16 million jobs in the European Union by 2020.

We need to do so without undermining the confidence of the public and professionals. As a former midwife, I am acquainted with the challenges and risks inherent in areas where health and safety are at stake. Indeed, health care professionals are the most mobile, and the ability to communicate and safeguard patient safety have to be ensured. A key challenge lies in the recognition of academic titles and professional qualifications by shoring up confidence in the accreditation criteria. Dialogue between public authorities and professionals has to be stepped up. The ECTS system needs more transparency and comparability.

In the context of evaluating the results achieved thus far, it should be stressed that additional obstacles to workers’ mobility must not be erected, notwithstanding the recognition that measures to prevent mobility from putting consumers’ health and safety at risk are needed. For example, that will be the case for health care workers who, having been banned from working in one Member State, move to another so as to avoid being held accountable.

This raft of measures will still need to be supplemented with crucial safeguards to ensure a balanced recognition between the many qualifications that exist in the EU and to guarantee a reliable service from professionals, especially in the health sector. The challenge is by no means minor: duration of studies, supervised practical experience, language training; there are as many formats as there are Member States for each course. Modernising recognition will have to be done cautiously but confidently, given that over 50% of young people are willing to work abroad, according to the Eurobarometer (May 2011).

Recognition of qualifications is necessary in order to promote the mobility of highly qualified people and workers, and the bureaucracy surrounding it should be reduced. This directive sets out a distinction between the freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment, in line with the criteria laid down by the Court of Justice: duration, frequency, regularity and continuity of service provision. The automatic recognition procedure has demonstrated enormous successes, while the recognition procedure under the normal system, based on professional experience, is excessively slow and complex, so it does not fit with the free movement of people. It is also essential to create a proactive alert system, so as to prevent professionals who have been suspended or banned from practising from doing so in another Member State.

In order to enjoy freedom of movement, professionals need to have their qualifications easily recognised in every Member State. The Professional Qualifications Directive stipulates that any host Member State where a profession is regulated is obliged to consider the qualifications gained in another Member State and verify whether they correspond to those it requires. Although the internal market creates conditions for getting a job or providing services in another Member State, the level of professional mobility is still low in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Parliament report on the implementation of the Professional Qualifications Directive is a response to dynamic demographic changes and changes taking place in the economy and the labour markets. Free movement of highly skilled workers is an important factor in the development of economies across the EU and of a competitive internal market. Especially now, during the economic crisis, citizens need to be able to operate in a friendly legal environment which facilitates mobility.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The directive on the recognition of professional qualifications was adopted in 2005. We can now see that it requires further improvement and revision. There is therefore still much to do in order that citizens can freely take up employment anywhere in Europe based on the knowledge and skills that they acquired in another Member State.</p>
      <p sl="pl">During consultations which I organised in Poland, almost 3 000 people appealed to the European Commission to introduce a European professional card as soon as possible. I am pleased the report supports this proposal of young Poles. I hope the card will be introduced as soon as possible and that all citizens will be able to make greater use of the single market. Therefore, I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the implementation of the Professional Qualifications Directive.</p>

I agree with the rapporteur that this would stimulate economic growth and would give the labour market flexibility, but we should try to achieve this without creating a severe shortage of labour in countries like Lithuania. According to a Lithuanian report published earlier this year, the ratio of doctors and nurses per 10 000 inhabitants in Lithuania is one of the highest in Europe. However, an ordinary Lithuanian has to wait several weeks or more in order to get an appointment to see a doctor, particularly a specialist. This is because Lithuania has one of the highest rates of migration of doctors in the EU. Most worrying is the fact that the majority of young talented specialist doctors, such as interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons and vascular surgeons are emigrating. Last year, doctors’ salaries were cut three times, reducing the salaries of some specialists to a few thousand Litas. According to the Lithuanian Union of Doctors, half of all medical graduates go to look for work in Germany, the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. We must provide more incentives to keep doctors from migrating.</p>

To overcome the crisis, we need all the qualified manpower available throughout the European Union. I therefore support the application of the logic of the single market to qualified workers to promote and encourage their mobility within the Union. Naturally, each Member State organises and proposes its own training, but workers who are candidates for mobility are confronted with bureaucratic, time consuming and, hence, dissuasive procedures. Our economies need simplified, common, transparent procedures for the recognition of professional qualifications to operate most efficiently. This progress must be confirmed through, in particular, the introduction of the Internal Market Information (IMI) system and the professional card. Formalities for workers must be reduced, employers need to be informed, and data has to be protected. To retain its position as economic leader in the face of the BRICS group of emerging powers, the Union must, first and foremost, prevent a brain drain and optimise the skills of its workers. I therefore naturally voted in favour of this report to promote the employment, within Europe, of highly qualified workers, and to establish the Union as the world hub of innovation.</p>

I have voted for this report, which looks at the way the 2005 directive on professional qualifications has been implemented, because there is room to improve confidence in the recognition system whilst maintaining support for the principle of mutual recognition. There has been a lot of attention given to the way the directive has been implemented in the UK’s National Health Service, particularly as regards language skills for doctors. The NHS must be able to hire the doctors and other staff it needs to provide a quality service, and this often means that they must come from outside the UK. At the same time, doctors must, of course, be able to understand their patients, and there can be no exceptions to this rule.</p>

The Consumer Agenda should cover all important subjects and issues that are faced in the area of consumer affairs. Ensuring safe food, health and product safety should be its highest priority. Disclosure of information to consumers is both necessary and important in all sectors of financial services. Groups of people who are particularly vulnerable because of their mental, physical or psychological infirmity, age or credulity – for example, children, teenagers and the elderly – or who are made vulnerable by their social and financial situation (such as those with excessive debts) need special protection. It is therefore very important to inform consumers about their rights and obligations and ensure that consumers’ rights are fully respected when it comes to Internet use and protecting intellectual property rights, while, at the same time, protecting personal data and privacy.

The Commission will have to take into account consumers’ interests when proposing legislation. In particular, it will, along with Member States, have to communicate better on the subject of consumer rights in order to strengthen consumer confidence. The lack of certainty regarding consumer rights makes consumers especially reluctant to use e-commerce or carry out cross-border online transactions, which are of paramount importance at the moment to the development of the internal digital market. We also need additional guarantees about the safety of products on the market. This is why the General Product Safety Directive needs to be reviewed and the Toy Safety Directive needs to be implemented, as called for in this report.

Particular protection needs to be ensured for categories of consumer who are especially vulnerable, whether because of disability, or because of their delicate social and financial situation.

      <p sl="fr">Consumer protection is an area covering a number of major issues: ensuring food safety and the health and safety of products, tackling the problem of reducing inequalities among European consumers, and establishing a low carbon economy. That is why I voted in favour of the rapporteur’s proposal for an alternative resolution to pick up on a number of points that could not be adopted in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection due to opposition from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is, in particular, a question of ensuring that the consumer protection programme includes initiatives to protect minors against misleading advertising. Children, as a vulnerable group, are, in fact, an ideal target for advertisers, especially through the medium of television. Finally, the legislative vacuum existing in the field of collective redress should be filled by a Commission proposal to enable consumers to feel reassured that their rights are being better protected.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the resolution which has been adopted, the European Parliament suggests a course of action which the European Commission should adopt on consumer policy for the next few years. We believe that consumers and the decisions made by them are of crucial importance for the proper functioning of the single European market. The resolution addresses primarily correct implementation of the Consumer Rights Directive, the need to increase the confidence of consumers and retailers with respect to online purchases, reducing the risk to consumers from hazardous products, for example, through the RAPEX system, and creating a more accessible and effective system of redress for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to emphasise that a particularly important task in the coming years is to strengthen the role of consumer organisations, in particular, in the new Member States. Consumer organisations are effective in protecting the interests of consumers and do a great deal of work to promote knowledge about consumer rights. Unfortunately, they often have problems with funding. Therefore, I am inclined to think that consumer organisations should be supported.</p>

A significant proportion of European citizens are still not very familiar with consumer protection legislation. It is considerably important to adopt measures to raise their awareness of their rights and obligations, and to guarantee compliance with them.

Consumer empowerment depends on knowledge of consumer rights and information, the existence of well-known and effective non-governmental organisations and public authorities, an active media and simple and accessible means of redress. Ensuring safe food, health and product safety should be the highest priority in the Consumer Agenda. However, we also need a Consumer Agenda that will lower the inequalities between consumers in Europe, contribute to a low carbon economy, in line with the EU 2020 strategy, and protect children from advertising. More broadly speaking, we need to address the new challenges that modern societies have to face, such as the globalisation of our markets, the digitalisation of the economy and our ageing populations, as well as the importance of enforcement/redress instruments and support for consumer organisations. Finally a strong representation of consumer interests is a crucial part of a sound civil society. Such representation must be made possible and promoted, not only at EU, but also at national level in all Member States. Many years after EU accession, this is not the case in all our countries, and capacity building measures for the consumer movement in these countries are indispensable.</p>

The completion of the European single market is a must to ensure that.

      <p sl="pt">Inconsistency in the rules regarding the value added tax (VAT) applicable to cultural content products sold in physical and in digital format is a subject that has been of concern to the EU for some time. This new strategy is welcome and is in line with changes to the way Europeans consume: the purchase of cultural content – music, newspapers, magazines, books, etc. – over the Internet is becoming increasingly frequent. Given that the Member States can levy lower VAT rates on cultural products in physical format in order to promote access to these products, it does not seem right to me that these same products should be treated differently because they are sold online. We are, therefore, talking about an aspect of the VAT Directive that is completely obsolete in the face of new consumer trends. As such, it is important to revise this point, so that VAT will not be levied at different rates for the same products simply because they are being sold through different distribution channels. This development, along with the reform of copyright, will facilitate the free movement of audiovisual content online, and will therefore contribute to creating a genuine internal market for digital content.</p>

We must guarantee particular protection to groups of consumers that are especially vulnerable because of their mental or physical health or because of their age. It is also important to educate consumers from a very young age. Faced with the growth of financial services and e-commerce, we need to take measures aimed at defining good practices for e-commerce and rules covering electronic methods of payment.

However, we do not require a new consumer organisation in order to do this. Instead we need better cooperation and increased coordination between the Member States.

However, arbitrarily encouraging consumption is dangerous both for the economy and the environment and, in the end, violates the rights of consumers themselves. The new EU consumer strategy should promote responsible and sustainable consumption. To achieve this, there needs to be a greater focus on financial literacy among consumers, the provision of useful, targeted and understandable information, understandable labelling and the dissemination of information about consumer rights. There is still a lot to be done to guarantee consumer rights and protection in the financial services, e-commerce and energy sectors. A dispute resolution and damage compensation scheme must be established, the young must be protected from misleading advertising, and the consumer rights of vulnerable groups of consumers, such as the elderly, people on low incomes, people with disabilities, children, women and migrants, must be guaranteed. We must continue research into the impact that chemicals, nanotechnologies and antibiotics used in food, cosmetics and other branches of industry have on consumers’ health. These and the other proposals set out in the report will help create a culture of consumption in the EU which would see the growth of a generation of aware consumers who would know their rights, be able to defend them, and consume responsibly without wasting or overdrawing resources and would seek to do as little damage as possible to the environment.

The problem affects every one of us, because we are all consumers. We have to know our rights and the rules of the litigation open to us. Recent research conducted by the European Commission shows that it is necessary to strengthen the position of consumers, extend their knowledge and improve their access to information. Results published by the European Commission for 2011 show a clear improvement in almost all Member States. However, they also show a lack of awareness of consumer rights at a time of active development, computerisation and growth of the Internet. Therefore it is extremely important to have access to information, so that every decision can be made in an informed way. The need for all kinds of measures which contribute to increased awareness is a challenge for the European Union and is a challenge concerning specific action to improve the position of consumers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report shows strategies and possible means for making consumers aware of their rights and obligations by many different measures, such as promoting healthy food and healthy eating, for example. There is a need for clear and transparent information about benefits to health to make consumers aware of the choices with which they are faced. Food information should be clear and easy to understand so that it can enable consumers to make the right choice.

      <p sl="it">The guarantee of safe food, health and product safety should be the highest priority in the Consumer Agenda. According to the Material Deprivation Rate index, 16.3% of the EU’s population is at risk of poverty, and this percentage rises to 17.1% for women. Therefore, crucial to reducing the inequalities between consumers and citizens is that welfare services should be financed in solidarity and made accessible to everyone.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another important challenge for future consumer policy is the promotion of the interests of the ‘digital consumer’, along with the protection of personal data. It is essential, therefore, to provide the consumer with a safe digital environment, access to telecommunications networks as a means towards social and economic inclusion, and respect of the consumer’s fundamental rights, specifically, the protection of privacy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">This resolution contains a number of patronising and politically motivated proposals for European consumer policy with which the delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) cannot agree. For example, the resolution calls for ‘more sustainable patterns of consumption’ in order to reduce CO2 emissions, for empowering consumers and for ‘better coordination between consumer policy and social and environmental goals’. This is, to all intents and purposes, a typical leftist agenda that is being forced upon consumers and Member States. It appears that the European Parliament is assuming that consumers cannot make informed choices themselves. When did Member States stop being able to pursue their consumer policies independently? The PVV cannot agree to such unnecessary European meddlesomeness. It is therefore voting against this resolution.</p>

Furthermore, the EU must promote consumers’ right to information, education and to organise themselves to safeguard their interests.</p>
      <p sl="ro">According to the fifth edition of the Consumer Conditions Scoreboard of March 2011, consumers across the EU still face very different conditions. Forty-four per cent of consumers stated that uncertainty about their rights discourages them from buying goods from other Member States and that late delivery, non-delivery and fraud are the major factors preventing them from engaging in cross-border shopping.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I support the need to ensure universal access to broadband communications networks and broad access to goods and services online, including by removing distribution restrictions, tackling geographic segmentation and developing electronic payment services. To increase the number of consumers accessing goods and services online, we request from the Commission legislative initiatives on the mutual recognition of electronic signatures, electronic identity and the promotion of e-invoices. I support the removal of unfair contractual terms as part of the sale of goods and services.</p>

In this climate of mistrust, it is imperative to sustain consumption by maintaining confidence between buyers and sellers. In this way, we shall contribute to ordered, informed consumption, which is indispensable for economic growth in the EU. Henceforth, the EU is clearly committed to this path with this report that I supported and which aims to give consumers, who form the core of the single market, even fuller information. Citizens should be provided with clear, accurate information on all the products they buy, be it in relation to health, safety or sustainability. I believe that a great deal remains to be done in some sectors, where pricing is deliberately made incomprehensible for the consumer, where switching suppliers is laborious and onerous, and where automatic contract extension on expiry is commonplace. It is high time that the Commission took on these hindrances to competition and to free choice for consumers.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report indicates that efficient regulation of the online gambling sector must combat illegal gambling by strengthening technical and legal instruments for identifying and penalising illegal operators; guarantee effective protection for gamblers; preclude risks of gambling addiction; guarantee the integrity of sporting competition; ensure that part of the value of bets goes to sports and horse racing bodies; ensure that a considerable proportion of government revenue from gambling is used for publicly beneficial and charitable purposes; and ensure that gaming is kept free from crime, fraud and any form of money laundering.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although we reject any European legislative act uniformly regulating the entire gambling sector, we nonetheless take the view that, in some areas – given the cross-border nature of online gambling services – there would be clear added value from a coordinated European approach in addition to national regulation.

      <p sl="it">I completely agree with the report by Mr Creutzmann on online gambling. As the rapporteur notes, around 10% of all gambling in Europe takes place using the Internet, mobile phones and interactive television platforms. In modern society, children have increasing access to new technologies. This exposes them to hidden perils such as cyber-bullying, online grooming and child pornography, the dangers of which they are unaware of.</p>
      <p sl="it">Combating illegal gambling is worthwhile in order to avoid scams and combat the black market and gambling addiction, bringing in effective tools and safeguards to protect children and vulnerable adults. The Member States must be free to keep their own rules on online gambling. However, given the cross-border nature of the Union, it would be a good idea to institute EU-wide cooperation on measures to prevent illegal gambling – especially in order to protect children – through coordinated national legislation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The different approaches to regulating this sector in Member States causes major difficulties in protecting consumers and combating illegal online gambling and potential crime associated with it at European level. Consequently, the key objective being pursued must be to curb this black market significantly. In order to achieve this objective, one option which I urge Member States to resort to is a total ban.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, minimum standards need to be laid down at European level, not only for protecting minors and combating addiction, but also for combating money laundering and other criminal activities associated with gambling. I urge the Commission to devise standards applicable across Europe and binding on all licensed online gambling operators. This would allow Member States to set further criteria in the future.

      <p sl="fr">The online gambling sector is attracting more and more users in Europe, and it generates substantial profits in the billions of euro. This infatuation for the sector, however, hides irregularities that primarily affect European consumers. Online gambling is not subject to the same rules in all Member States. The sector is also threatened by illegal operators who harm the internal market. That is why, for the sake of legal certainty and safeguarding European consumers, in particular minors, I voted in favour of the Creutzmann report, for which I was the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In my report for the committee, which was subsequently incorporated into the final report, I placed particular emphasis on safeguarding minors, combating illegal gambling and preserving the integrity of sport.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this report. The online gambling sector is growing constantly, to some extent outside the control of the national governments, thus posing risks to consumer protection and bringing dangers associated with organised crime. Although gambling services are subject to a number of EU acts, such as the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the Distance Selling Directive, the Anti-Money Laundering Directive, the Data Protection Directive, the directive on privacy and electronic communication, and the directive on the common system of value added tax, there has so far been no specific European legislative act in the EU regulating online gambling. As the gambling sector is regulated differently in different Member States, this not only makes it difficult for regulated providers to provide lawful gaming services on a cross-border basis, but also for regulators to protect consumers and combat illegal online gambling. I agree that, in order to protect consumers, especially vulnerable and young players, from the negative aspects of gambling online, the EU needs to adopt common standards for consumer protection and ensure that principles for online gambling are laid down at EU level.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This market should be open and sufficient initiatives should be created for companies to offer legal services; a licensing model is the best approach, provided that it is based on the principle of non-discriminatory competition.</p>
      <p sl="pt">An open and regulated market for online gambling presupposes an independent and powerful national regulatory body. Owing to the cross-border nature of the Internet, significant cooperation between national regulatory bodies is therefore essential, so there is a need for institutionalised collaborative arrangements, on the basis of the Internal Market Information system.</p>

Following on from the European Commission Green Paper on online gambling, we have adopted a report that represents a move in the right direction. While recognising the competence of the Member States in this area, we wish to point out that coordination at EU level could provide added value. I welcome the fact that the report advocates stepping up the fight against the black market and abuse, that it focuses on protecting minors and vulnerable consumers, who are more exposed to gambling addiction, and that it advocates setting up a blacklist of unlicensed gambling providers. Finally, the betting right, which France was the first to incorporate into its legislation, is recognised in this text. The idea is that it is necessary to recognise the property rights of sports event organisers over their events in order to secure a fair financial return so as to continue to protect the integrity of the sport and to strengthen the fight against fraud and match fixing.</p>

Currently, there is no specific legislative act regulating online gambling in the European Union and the online gambling sector is growing with a market volume in excess of EUR 10 billion. Attention should be drawn to the fact that an increasing number of people are being exposed to the dangers of addiction, fraud, scams and underage gambling. Excessive online gambling can cause mental disorders which may take over a person’s private life and force them to relinquish many of their important work, social, family and material commitments. In order to reduce the amount of legal and illegal gambling in Europe, uniform laws concerning gambling licences and their regulation need to be adopted by all Member States.</p>

That is why I voted in favour.</p>
      <p sl="it">The difficulties of regulation and the legal fragmentation of the sector, including in view of the use of the Internet – which knows no boundaries – really make close cooperation between the licensing authorities of Member Countries a necessity. This could follow the Italian or French example, where a licensing authority may award an unlimited number of licences while, at the same time, carrying out thorough checks to prevent crimes such as money laundering or other gambling-related crimes being committed. However, there is a need to establish minimum applicable standards across the whole of the EU. These standards should be binding for all authorised operators who offer online gambling services and should grant Member States the power to come up with additional rules, so that they can protect minors and prevent gambling addictions more and more.</p>

Such a body must determine and, above all, also be able to enforce, the environment for gambling. National regulators must therefore be given the necessary powers to penalise infringements and act against illegal providers. Given the cross-border nature of the Internet, however, Member States alone are not in a position to regulate all areas of online gambling. Very close cooperation between national regulatory bodies is therefore essential. To date, collaboration has been on a small scale, for example, through bilateral procedures. What is needed, however, are institutionalised collaborative arrangements, for example, on the basis of the Internal Market Information system, in order to share information efficiently and quickly. Only through a common European approach can unregulated providers be prevented from exploiting regulatory gaps and playing national regulatory bodies off against each other. The challenge for the Commission and the Member States is to act quickly, therefore, in order to safeguard consumers in Europe against untrustworthy providers.</p>

While services offering games of chance were not sold on a cross-border basis until now, this activity has become possible since the expansion of the Internet. At a time when Member States have fairly different regulations on gambling, with two models of regulation available, based either on a controlled monopoly or on licensing operators, it has become necessary to define a minimum set of rules, especially with regard to consumer protection and fraud prevention.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also support the rapporteur’s idea that it is appropriate to adopt a set of standards for creating gambling operator licensing systems in a transparent, non-discriminatory manner for those Member States which use a licence-based system.

I am somewhat baffled over the introduction of the concept of the right to bet. I am not sure that all the implications have been weighed up sufficiently, and I would also point out that this decision is in contrast to the decision taken by the Italian Government.

Increasingly widespread Internet access has been causing new problems for governments and the relevant control entities. One of the rapidly growing sectors on the Internet or on similar channels of distribution – mobile telephones or interactive television platforms – is the online gambling market, which currently represents around 10% of all gambling in Europe. While there are Member States where such gambling is properly controlled, like France, there are others that have no form of regulation or control. As well as representing a significant loss of income, this enables indiscriminate access to these platforms, particularly by children, who end up becoming addicted.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As the Internet is a cross-border medium, there is an urgent need for legislative harmonisation.

      <p sl="pt">In particular, there is a need to take into account the different cultures and traditions of the Member States, specifically in those where there are public entities that control the gambling sector, and profits from it are channelled into social intervention, which is crucial for supporting the most deprived populations; that is the case in Portugal. This should be retained and protected, by ensuring that it is always the Member States that control decision making in this area, taking account of the principle of subsidiarity and sovereignty.</p>

      <p sl="sk">At present, almost 10% of all gambling takes place via the Internet or in a similar way. It is disconcerting that online gambling is on the increase. Online gambling recognises practically no borders and spreads without any major restrictions. However, the European market varies considerably as regards gambling. To a large extent, Member States themselves determine how they will regulate their gambling sectors. Such variation in regulation, however, substantially distorts the market, and has a negative effect on competitiveness. I therefore firmly believe that it is essential to restrict the unregulated black market that is operating in this way, and one of the options is a total ban – assuming that it would be strictly implemented and followed.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Another no less serious problem is the risk of dependency and the risk that young people will take up gambling. It is therefore also essential to support existing efforts to warn against gambling addiction through the establishment of Europe-wide standards aimed at protecting young people, combating pathological gambling, and also combating money laundering and other crimes connected with gambling. I firmly believe that such an effort at a common measure can be of key significance in securing a uniform high level of minimum protection for consumers throughout Europe.</p>

Already during the adoption of the Services Directive, the European Parliament and the Council had excluded the gambling sector from the advantages of the internal market rules. Gambling has no economic benefit and even has a dangerous social impact on addicted players. Even if it is very difficult to limit access to online games, Member States should have a free hand to block access to unauthorised sites. The gambling sector is an economic sector that is fundamentally unhealthy and must be combated as such.</p>

In its initial version, it was not very clear, and at times contradictory, as to whether it respected the exclusive authority of the Member States to regulate online gaming, maintain national monopolies, decide how to spend the tax revenue from bets, enact any prohibitions they desire and establish the level of consumer protection. Moreover, it barely said anything about horse race betting, which nevertheless serves to support the equine sector, especially in France, yet it devoted several paragraphs to sports bets and the rights of sports event organisers to the events they run. However, the equine sector, also threatened by Brussels, which is attacking the legitimacy of the VAT rate applied to it, is of great economic and social importance in many rural areas. A little more attention to that activity and its specific issues would have been welcomed. As amended, the report infringes the principle of subsidiarity and no longer even mentions this sector.</p>

As a result of ever increasing supply and the increasing number of gamblers, the current market fragmentation in this area in Europe is also becoming ever more obvious. In many Member States, there are total bans or bans with the possibility of authorisation, while others have a completely open and liberalised market. However, due to huge differences in traditions, the subsidiarity principle plays a particularly powerful role in this area. To a large extent, the Member States themselves determine how they want to regulate their gambling sectors. As regards the Internet, however, such considerable regulatory divergence also results in market distortions. Gambling service providers from Member States with open markets and low tax rates are also accessible in countries in which online gambling is banned, or are in competition with licensed online providers. It is virtually impossible for those providers, and for providers of physical, location-based gambling services from those countries, to compete. Furthermore, there is a large unregulated black market on the Internet. I agree that an open and regulated market for online gambling presupposes an independent and powerful national regulatory body. It must determine, and also be able to enforce, the environment for gambling. National regulators must therefore be given the necessary powers to penalise infringements and act against illegal providers.</p>

Pan-European, uniform minimum standards regarding the identification of the customer, for example, are vital to protect gamblers and consumers, to ensure that systems of gambling bans are effective, and to prevent underage gambling. Registration should be performed in such a way that the player’s identity is established. At the same time, we need to be able to ensure that players have access to no more than one gambling account per gambling company. Problem gambling must be tackled by means of bans on gambling, for example, and compulsory limits on expenditure over a particular period, albeit set by the customer himself.

That is something that we need to have dealt with when the markets are opened up. A common licensing system, whereby undertakings that have a licence in one country can provide their services in several EU countries, will give gambling operators an incentive to acquire a licence.

It rightly points out that pathological behaviour arising from such a dependency affects a high percentage of citizens in some Member States. Despite these statements, however, the proposed measures are, in my view, weak and therefore ineffective. There is, for example, a reluctance to introduce a regulatory approach to gambling through identification cards, and a reluctance to ban gambling advertising.

The health and social consequences arising from a dependence on gambling are comparable with the consequences of smoking or excessive alcohol consumption.</p>

It should be noted that the online gambling sector is growing constantly. According to the latest information, currently, around 10% of all gambling in Europe takes place on the Internet, which has a market volume in excess of EUR 10 billion. In line with these trends, related problems are becoming increasingly acute, such as the risk of addiction involved in gambling. Minors are particularly vulnerable here – young players and other socially sensitive layers of society. Research shows that since the advent of online gambling, there has been a significant increase in the number of people approaching centres for gambling addicts for help. It has been established that compulsive gambling is a behavioural disorder which may affect up to 2% of the population in some countries. When discussing public health therefore, we should not forget the specific nature of online gambling. Online gambling is often identified with criminal activities and fraud. Owing to the cross-border nature of the Internet, national borders are no barrier to such gambling. This is one of the reasons why Member States alone are not in a position to protect consumers against the dangers. I am convinced that the national authorities responsible for supervision in the Member States should cooperate as actively as possible, and exchange information and best practices.

The online gambling market is one of the biggest in the EU. There are currently around 15 000 gambling websites. Over 85% are unlicensed, while the annual volume of transactions on this particular market is estimated at EUR 10 billion. The most important thing, however, is that this is, to a large degree, a habit-forming market which puts underage players at risk. Its fragmented operating rules, depending on the national priorities set by each Member State, are giving rise to different legal frameworks and divergent and often contradictory policies are being applied. A market governed by complex and fragmented rules is a market exposed to financial crime and fraud. Recent experience with match fixing proves that.

I am delighted that the rapporteur has achieved the crucial balance, in a sector that is, by definition, a cross-border and sensitive one, since we are talking about protecting minors, cracking down on illicit games, but also prevention and addiction. I would mention two aspects in particular: firstly, I voted for paragraph 22 that supports the continuation of the many proceedings for infringement of European law, instigated by the Commission against quasi monopolies, sometimes going back a very long time. Although I understand their previous suspension when a legal grey area remained, these proceedings must be reasonably examined and the European Commission must fully play its role of Guardian of the Treaties, whatever those who wished to see these proceedings simply abandoned may say.

      <p sl="it">Moreover, the European Commission should examine the possibility of blocking financial transactions between banks and credit card institutions, and gamblers who appear on a blacklist. To protect young people and other vulnerable sections of society, age verification and restrictions on electronic payments before any gambling takes place should be requirements.

      <p sl="fr">Currently, 10% of all gambling in Europe takes place online, both over the Internet and using mobile telephones or interactive television platforms. In this context, national regulation is no longer sufficient to provide proper protection for consumers or to effectively deter the operators of illegal or fraudulent gambling. It is therefore necessary to increase cooperation between the national authorities responsible for regulating this sector and to discuss the establishment of common minimum European standards, whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity. I naturally supported the main points of this report: As regards the ‘right to gamble’, I welcome Parliament’s support for the idea of recognising the property rights of sports event organisers at a European level, as well as the introduction of legally binding agreements between the organisers of sports competitions and the operators. However, I opposed the idea of calling for regulation of spread betting. This type of betting is particularly dangerous for consumers and I should like to retain the option of banning it completely.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. The online gambling sector is growing constantly. Nowadays, according to current figures, about 10% – a figure which is rising – of all gambling in Europe takes place on the Internet or via comparable distribution channels such as mobile phones or interactive television platforms, with a market volume in excess of EUR 10 billion. The market for physical, location-based gambling and the online gambling sector are characterised by a wide range of products: traditional lotteries, but also sports betting, poker, bingo and totalisator betting on horse and greyhound races.</p>
      <p sl="en">By its very nature, the Internet is a cross-border medium. Online gambling therefore does not stop at borders. As a result of ever-increasing offerings and the increasing number of gamblers, the current market fragmentation in this area in Europe is also becoming ever more obvious.

As the Internet, by its very nature, is a cross-border medium, European legislation in this sector is absolutely essential. I am therefore calling for collective action at EU level to combat illegal gaming, money laundering, addiction and fraud, notably in sport. As the report notes, this regulation should, in particular, channel the natural gaming instinct of the population by restricting advertising to the level that is strictly necessary in order to direct potential gamblers to legal services. It should also require all advertising for online gambling to be systematically coupled with a message warning against excessive or pathological gambling.

For these reasons, the issue of protecting consumers, specifically those who are weaker and more at risk, is extremely delicate and important.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, we must ensure that the revenue generated for Member States through taxation of online gambling is not curtailed by the worrying presence of illegal gambling games which, other than providing an opportunity to launder enormous sums of illegally obtained money, place less cautious consumers in grave danger.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am in absolute agreement as regards the urgency to adopt the necessary measures to protect the integrity of the sport and to implement better coordination between states and relevant organisations.

      <p sl="ro">I think that a pan-European code of conduct is needed for online gambling which should deal with the rights and obligations of both the service providers and consumers. This code of conduct should ensure responsible gambling and a high level of protection for players, especially for minors and other vulnerable people.

The Creutzmann report urges the European Commission to come up with EU rules on online gambling. This scheme is supposed to make gambling transparent and – you will not believe it – even fair. Gambling can never become a fair sport, because providers of gambling services will always make a profit (the house always wins). If we introduce European rules for online gambling, those rules will not result in gambling providers from outside the EU complying with them. These providers will not be bound by EU rules. Although access to such websites within the EU can be limited, I would suggest the easy way out of this situation, namely, recognising that gambling is harmful to gamblers, their families and society, and therefore prohibiting online gambling throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Beekeeping is a very old means for humans to gather food and has extremely long traditions on the European continent. There is a clear need to protect this sector and undertake studies intended to ensure the good health of bees, which face growing threats. Despite this sector’s most immediate relationship with honey production, the impact of bees’ activity is felt far more widely: the majority of plants are dependent on them as an intermediary in pollination. Therefore, as we know, bees are an essential element in the preservation of ecosystems; they should merit special attention from veterinary authorities and should be considered in the context of European agricultural policy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The majority of citizens of the European Union are not aware of the role that bees play in the preservation of ecosystems and, consequently, in the survival of the human race. Albert Einstein said that ‘If the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe, then man would only have four years of life left’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report, by Mr Tabajdi, concerns the problems faced by the beekeeping sector, not least regarding bee health and the challenges faced by the sector. As well as a source of income for over 600 000 Europeans, beekeeping, which is an integral part of European agriculture, not only contributes to the preservation of biodiversity, but is also vital to agricultural activity because of pollination. Unfortunately, this sector has been weakened by the lack of support from the pharmaceutical industry. Moreover, the plant health products lobby is against removing active substances harmful to bees from its products.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore welcome the adoption of this report, and hope these measures will be quickly adopted by all the Member States and implemented by farmers and, in particular, by beekeepers.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report tackles a problem for which no coherent solution has been found to date, and whose persistence constitutes a cause for serious concern: the general and continuous weakening of colonies of bees, and the decline of populations of natural pollinators. While it is true that some of the individual proposals included in the report could be important, especially in the short term, we do not believe its approach and underlying philosophy to be the most suitable. In particular, the report does not touch on the fundamental issue, which cannot be separated from this problem, which concerns the need to change current productive models and the policies – like the common agricultural policy – that support them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why we voted for the alternative resolution which, unfortunately, did not end up being adopted. This resolution makes an important criticism of intensive farming models based on high incorporation of pesticides, and proposes alternative modes of production that are sustainable, and that respect and promote biodiversity, with specific proposals on how to achieve these. Nevertheless, it is not free of contradictions, particularly as regards genetically modified organisms and the clear reversal of the precautionary principle, since the moratorium on cultivation should be before the studies rather than after, as is wrongly being advocated.</p>

For all these reasons, I welcome the research proposals set out in the text, which aim to preserve the biodiversity of bees by means of effective and safe usage of veterinary products. To guarantee consumer safety, Parliament must also appeal for further care on aspects relating to production, food safety and protecting honey origins, bringing in a suitable monitoring system that will also safeguard the consumer and good producers.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report calls for increased support for research and development into veterinary medicines to combat the pathogenic agents currently affecting bees in the EU, especially the Varroa destructor mite. However, the report includes a number of contradictions. On the one hand, it states that the Commission should set out more flexible rules on authorising and making available veterinary products for bees, including medicines of natural origin and others that do not damage the health of insects. However, on the other, the report stresses the need to offer the pharmaceutical industry incentives to develop new medicines intended to combat diseases amongst bees.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nevertheless, we agree when the report urges that more financial resources be made available for beekeeping, and that support for the beekeeping sector under the post-2013 common agricultural policy be stepped up, whilst ensuring that the existing programmes are continued and strengthened.

      <p sl="sk">The beekeeping sector provides primary or additional income for more than 600 000 citizens of the European Union, and is an integral part of European agriculture. It provides important ecosystem services via pollination. It is also part of the European agricultural heritage and of national traditions. Beekeeping is unique compared with other animal husbandry sectors as it involves the breeding of insects, semi-wild animals which cannot be domesticated or directly controlled like other species.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Member States of the EU and other parts of the world have recently seen an increase in bee mortality, and a decrease in the number of bee colonies and the pollinator species that contribute to agricultural productivity. Changing climatic and environmental conditions, loss of plant biodiversity, land use change and mismanaged beekeeping practices may weaken colonies’ immune systems.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I therefore believe it is necessary to monitor the effect of environmental conditions, beekeeping practices and agricultural practices on bee health. Continuing support for scientific research in the area of honeybee health is also extremely important. Last but not least, it is equally important to achieve progress and strengthen relationships between beekeepers and beekeeping organisations in the individual Member States, since beekeepers themselves are striving to improve the health and living conditions of their bees.</p>

      <p sl="it">If we do not take effective action to contain recent bee mortality, this phenomenon could have an irreversible impact on our food production and on environmental stability in Europe. The wellbeing of bees is beneficial for the entire ecosystem. I will quote two simple statistics: around 84% of plant species and 76% of food production in Europe are dependent on pollination. That is what we were looking to protect in today’s vote. It is important for new, more flexible rules to be drawn up to facilitate the distribution of suitable veterinary products and increasingly effective vaccine research. Furthermore, I think all the Member States will have to bring in monitoring systems on imports of animals from third countries so as to avoid exotic illnesses or parasites entering the EU. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that beekeeping provides a source of income for around 600 000 European citizens. I hope, therefore, that Europe will do more to support this key sector, not only economically, but also in environmental terms.</p>

Apiculture also provides an important ecosystem service via pollination, which contributes to the improvement of biodiversity by maintaining the genetic diversity of plants and the ecological balance.

The market for such products is relatively small compared to the other livestock sectors, and the return on investments is low. Therefore, producers of veterinary products are not interested in the development of new bee health medicines. I agree that one of the main barriers to effective action against excessive bee mortality is the lack of reliable and comparable data on the number of hives, beekeepers and colony losses in the EU. There is a strong need to apply an effective harmonised surveillance system to estimate the extent and cause of bee mortality. While a harmonised surveillance system is necessary at European level, Member States also have to take action to mitigate the risks affecting bee health. Research has to be harmonised and the scientific results have to be shared at European level in order to avoid duplication of efforts. National authorities in the Member States have to support the dissemination of appropriate scientific and technical knowledge about bee health among beekeepers. A permanent and structured dialogue is needed between beekeepers, farmers and the relevant authorities.</p>

Some people may not understand our position in respect to beekeeping issues, but bees play a very important role in agricultural crop pollination.

Statistical data show, for example, that in Germany, there are only 720 000 honeybees, and there should be 5 million, and the situation is similar in Italy. There is no doubt that the beekeeping sector needs greater support, because the problem is a supranational one.

      <p sl="cs">As the shadow rapporteur in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I decided to support the alternative resolution in respect of the report on honeybee health, and I did so for the following reasons: first, the alternative resolution includes an objective analysis of pesticide toxicity in relation to systemic neurotoxins in particular, criticises the lack of impact studies and complies with the precautionary principle. Secondly, it is not clear from the report submitted to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development what dangers are posed by the use of neurotoxic pesticides, particularly those from the group of neonicotinoids, which act as hormonal and digestive disruptors. Scientific studies confirm the danger not only of nicotinoids, but also of the entire plants that contain these substances. Mere contact with the guttation dew from plants treated with neonicotinoids may have fatal consequences for bees. Thirdly, significant concentrations of the following active substances were measured: 47 mg/l for imidacloprid, 23.3 mg/l for clothianidin and 11.9 ml/l for thiamethoxam. In other experiments, however, far higher values were measured. Bees coming into contact with such poisonous dew stop flying within a few minutes and can only walk, or quickly die. The symptoms are irreversible. It was discovered that clothianidin and thiamethoxam are more toxic than imidacloprid, even in very low concentrations in guttation droplets. Neonicotinoids are banned in some Member States, and this ban should be extended to the entire EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Given the importance of honeybees for the maintenance of biodiversity, the implications of Colony Collapse Disorder are significant, and we must act now to prevent this. Farming activity can have an impact on bee colonies, especially if it leads to food shortages for bees, poor food resources or to inappropriate pesticide applications. These can contribute to the weakening of bee colonies which may then become more vulnerable to pests and diseases. We should also ensure that there is well coordinated communication between beekeepers and farmers to minimise the potential impact of farming activity on bees. We must have more harmonised data on disease incidence and colony losses throughout Europe, not just among domesticated honeybees, but also among wild bee colonies. Local apiculture organisations, like the Federation of Irish Beekeeping Associations in Ireland, can have a role to play in relation to the collection of harmonised data and must be involved in whatever actions we decide to take. Beekeepers themselves are primarily responsible for the health of their bees and we must look at providing quality training programmes in order to develop and maintain a healthy bee population in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As the rapporteur says, the European apiculture sector is part of European cultural heritage and the national traditions of some Member States. In this context, the Portuguese case stands out because Portugal is part of the group of professional beekeeping Member States. Although the economic scale of this sector is significant, with around 600 000 Europeans directly or indirectly dependent on it, it should be said that this is not the only important issue: it is also about the environmental effects, since bees play a central role in the ecological balance. There is therefore justification for a holistic approach suitable for confronting the sector’s problems: the recent increases in bee mortality, the presence of toxic agents that have been damaging the health of hives, and the increasing average age of beekeepers, which are jeopardising the subsistence of the sector. I voted in favour because I share these concerns.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As a signatory to the alternative resolution to Mr Tabajdi’s report on honeybee health and the challenges of the beekeeping sector, I can only deplore the vote cast at noon today by the European Parliament. A vote that gives priority to the interests of fertiliser and pesticide producers to the detriment of honeybee colonies that are disappearing from many regions in Europe. The European Parliament, however, has a pressing duty to provide better protection for honeybees and other pollinator species that are so important to the planet and biodiversity. Indeed, the explanatory statement says it all: ‘84% of the plant species and 76% of food production in Europe are dependent on pollination by bees, the economic value of which is much greater than the value of the honey produced and is estimated at EUR 15 billion per year in the EU’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is why I am still hopeful that a true plan for European support will be adopted, opening up a real future for the beekeeping industry. To do so, it is essential to ban the most toxic neonicotinoid pesticides and to propose a new agricultural model based on crop rotation and the measured use of pesticides.</p>

      <p sl="it">One of the main obstacles for effective action against excessive bee mortality is the lack of trustworthy and comparable data regarding the number of hives, beekeepers and losses of colonies in the EU. It is important that the Commission propose an exhaustive directive on animal health in early 2012, which aims to replace the current basic veterinary legislation, and which includes the health of honeybees within the framework of European veterinary policy.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, the rules for authorising veterinary products for honeybees and making them available should become more flexible, and pharmaceutical companies should be given incentives for the development of new products to combat the Varroa destructor mite, the main pathogenic agent responsible for around 10% of annual losses.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Almost 85% of plant species and over 75% of our food production is dependent on pollination by bees. The beekeeping sector is also an integral part of our agriculture because apian products are very important and exceptional agricultural products, not only as food, but for the production of medicines and other purposes. The beekeeping sector is, directly and indirectly, an important employer and a source of income for over 600 000 beekeepers in Europe. We are seeing an increased mortality among honeybees, which is threatening food production and environmental stability. However, there is a lack of fully representative comparative data on honeybee colony losses. There is a need to standardise national counting systems. To determine the cause of bee mortality, research in this field should be increased and made more specific, and joint programmes at European level should be undertaken. There is no unambiguous knowledge of the extent to which plant protection products or diseases and pests are the cause of bee mortality. One thing is certain, namely, that training of farmers in good practice in the use of plant protection products that are not harmful to bees should be supported. I want to point out that there is a lack of suitable research on the possible adverse effects of GM crops on the health of bees. Let us remember that agriculture cannot exist without bees, and bees cannot exist without agriculture. We need agriculture which is sustainable and produces food products of sufficient quantity and quality.</p>

      <p sl="it">The number of pollinating insects has fallen drastically in Europe over recent years. The European Food Safety Authority’s scientific report on bee mortality and bee surveillance in Europe ends by highlighting the general weakness of most surveillance systems and a lack of representative national data – and comparable European data – on colony loss.</p>
      <p sl="it">This can also be traced back to the general lack of standardisation and harmonisation that was observed in regard to monitoring systems, analysis of case studies and information gathering, which I think is essential if we want to combat the serious and widespread situation of bee mortality.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to underline that there are several reasons behind the drop in honeybee numbers in Europe and that we know little of the causes or the risk factors. There is no doubt that it all depends on the way that the beekeeping is carried out, which can bring about stresses in the colonies, on biological agents such as viruses, on environmental factors such as qualitative and quantitative biodiversity loss, on climate change, on genetically modified organisms, electromagnetic radiation, and other factors such as a drop in the number of queen bees and immunosuppression. We cannot, therefore, focus our attention solely on pesticides, as is often the case.</p>

The current honeybee losses, for which even the reasons are not entirely clear yet, are endangering the entire agricultural sector. The EP believes that more funds should be allocated to investigating the phenomenon, because without knowing the reasons, we have no way of stopping the process. A mere 10 million euro are currently allocated to the problem, which needs to be multiplied as we do not even know whether this is a transmittable disease or the result of environmental damage. However, this is not the only problem confronting honey supply. Low-quality, sometimes counterfeit, honey is flooding the market. Precise designations of origin and solid quality management are needed to ensure that beekeeping remains a profitable sector and to allow this healthy foodstuff to be widely available to European citizens. To this end, we must also find a solution for providing targeted support to the approximately 700 000 beekeepers of Europe.</p>

The survival of the vast majority of plant species and of our food production, but also the incomes of 600 000 people in Europe, amateurs and professionals, are at stake. What is more, because of the specific nature of this form of rearing, training for beekeepers does not exist; nor does awareness raising for farmers, or a specialised veterinary industry. Today, an emergency has been finally declared. It is important to protect this beekeeping industry as soon as possible through the following: by encouraging young people to become beekeepers, by supporting the research of the pharmaceutical industry in this field, by establishing a permanent dialogue between the different actors, and by creating a harmonised European registration network.

(A study carried out by the European Food Safety Authority in 2009 shows, for example, that genetically modified organisms represent a major stress factor for bees).

First of all, Parliament has called on the Commission to simplify these rules so that an unnecessary administrative burden is not placed on service providers. Secondly, Parliament has called on the Commission to clarify certain aspects of the rules, which are not worded clearly enough in the decision currently in force, with the consequence that the European Court of Justice is constantly required to explain them, a fact which does not provide any legal certainty to either local authorities or public service providers.

Services of general economic interest (SGEIs) are services that are indispensable to society which would not be provided adequately, or at all, without state intervention. State intervention, therefore, aims to offer quality services accessible to all while also promoting social, territorial and economic cohesion within the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">Such services, which differ greatly among themselves, are determined by central, regional and local authorities. The compensation paid by the state should be subject to EU Treaties and, in particular, to rules on competition. Therefore, it is necessary to reform the rules on State aid regarding services of general economic interest because often, the administrative burden for implementing these rules is too great for small local authorities, and it would be beneficial to consider specific and higher thresholds for the amount of compensation given for delivering social services of general interest (SSGIs).

At the moment, there is no single, clear definition of an SGEI and, given their diversity in Member States, it is probably very difficult, if not impossible, for us to have such a definition. I think that it is counterproductive in this area for us to harmonise rules just for the sake of harmonisation, as each Member State applies a definition according to its particular domestic situation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Against this background, I feel that a horizontal directive on SGEI is inappropriate as we cannot draft a law without having a definition of the legislative object first. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) very clearly sets out how the competition rules are applied to these services, obviously with the proviso that the public service objective is not jeopardised. The aim of the rapporteur’s proposals is to remove SGEI from the competition rules, especially the one referring to the exemption from notification, without setting a ceiling for State aid for hospitals, social housing and so on, or the one for raising the ceiling for the de minimis rule.

      <p sl="pt">The amendments proposed in this reform focused, above all, on clarifying the application of the rules on State aid, taking into account their enormous diversity, particularly the clarification of the relationship between the internal market and the provision of public services, ensuring that the principle of subsidiarity is applied in the definition, organisation and financing of SGEI.

      <p sl="el">The Simon report is based on the Commission proposal for the forthcoming review of State aid rules on services of general economic interest. These particular services are especially important for all citizens; however, without State aid, there would be no such services or they would be inadequate. One of the general objectives of the review presented in the report is to increase the contribution that services of general economic interest can make to economic recovery in Europe as a whole. Similarly, it rightly states that citizens need services of general economic interest of high quality, especially social services that moderate the social impact of the crisis. Unfortunately, however, although the report rightly recognises the importance of services of general economic interest to citizens, the guidelines it contains for their application come within the framework of the antisocial EU 2020 strategy. Thus, the application and funding of services of general economic interest are determined mostly by provisions to prevent distortions of competition and their role is clearly undermined. That is why I abstained on this particular report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The importance of services of general economic interest (SGEI) in promoting fundamental rights and social, economic and territorial cohesion is irrefutable. They contribute to combating social inequalities and fostering sustainable development, as well as to improving the Member States’ economic performance and competitiveness. They should, without a doubt, play an important role in the EU 2020 strategy as regards the pursuit of growth targets, particularly in the areas of employment, training and social integration. In order to properly serve the public, these services should be characterised by high levels of quality, safety, and affordability, by equal treatment, and by promotion of universal access and users’ rights. Despite the measures introduced in the ‘Altmark package’ in 2005, there is still a need to make legal instruments clearer, simpler, more proportionate and more effective, so as to ensure a satisfactory minimum of legal certainty. I welcome the Commission’s plans to reform the State aid rules on SGEI, so as to increase the contribution that these services could make to relaunching the EU economy, in general, and to promoting sustainable economic growth.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am in favour of reforming EU State aid rules on services of general economic interest (SGEIs). SGEIs have an important place in the shared values of the Union since they promote fundamental rights and social, economic and territorial cohesion. They are thus crucial to the fight against societal inequalities and to sustainable development. I think access to compensation for undertakings is essential as this represents an important economic and financial condition for the correct operation of the tasks assigned to them by public authorities, especially in these times of crisis, in which public services are playing a vital role as an automatic stabiliser. SGEIs can thus be of high quality and accessible to all sections of the population, bearing in mind the social mix and universal access. It is also important to introduce greater flexibility and transparency in the monitoring of compensation. Lastly, I would underline that State aid should help stimulate local entrepreneurship and the local economy, create jobs and promote competition in the telecoms market and elsewhere. The services provided thus make an important contribution to economic performance and competitiveness, thereby supporting the achievement of the goals set out in the Europe 2020 strategy for growth.</p>

      <p sl="it">The social dimension of our communities – particularly small and medium-sized ones – is more significant than their economic weight. In this vein, I would like to underline that some essential services, such as those relating to people’s health, the environment (including the water and waste cycles) and local public transport, should be thought of as directly connected to fundamental human rights. This is because they can be defined, in political terms, as public goods and services, even if they are managed by private entities. Making them more efficient, effective and economical, while pursuing increased and higher quality standards is another thing. Moreover, denying access to many sections of the population, especially the most vulnerable and neediest, whenever we apply the rules of the market plain and simple to these sectors is something else entirely. That is why, given their special status and social relevance, in the next reform being drawn up, we must retain a precise distinction between the rules that regulate State aid for services of general economic interest and the rules that govern other forms of State aid. The adopted report partly upholds this view.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report undeniably includes some positive aspects, including several comments that contradict the neoliberal vision that dominates this Parliament, viewing public services as areas of business, from a mercantilist perspective. We have been advocating some of the positions expressed for some time, but they have frequently been rejected by the majority, including the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the other main political groups. Examples include the position that public services should be of a high quality and universal; that investment in modernising infrastructure in various areas should be stepped up; that the Commission should not use the various forms of free trade agreement – association agreements, economic partnership agreements, etc. – to impose the liberalisation of public services on third countries; that compensation payments for all services of general economic interest (SGEI) that the Member States consider to be satisfying essential social needs should be ensured; and that the existing exemption without thresholds for hospitals and social housing should be retained.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nevertheless, the report stresses the difference between services of general interest and SGEI, with which we disagree.

However, it is not based on sound premises. The petty distinctions between services of general interest, social services of general interest, and services of general economic interest, can simply be put down to hair-splitting by the Commission to deny the very principle of public service and the absolute right of States, recognised by the Treaties, to define public services, to organise them, and to decide how such services are to be funded. It also serves, in network activities, to cream off the markets to the benefit of the private sector, to break national monopolies only to replace them with private oligopolies, to nationalise losses and to leave it to public authorities, meaning the taxpayer, to construct and maintain the networks. There are two possibilities: either the service is a public service, whether economic or otherwise, or it falls within traditional economic activity. In the first case, it is not subject to the vague and fluctuating shifts in the ultraliberal policies of the European Union. However, it must be totally excluded from the scope of competition rules and the rules governing public subsidies.</p>

      <p sl="en">I fully support the approach for more simplification, more clarity and more proportionality in the future revision of the State-aid package on services of general economic interest (SGEIs). Any future review of EU State aid rules on SGEIs should ensure that we are not dogmatic in our approach in order to reflect and be aligned with the present economic problems and social realities of Member States. The introduction of a more practical and pragmatic approach towards State aid rules in the sector could potentially help to contain the re-emergence of protectionist attitudes at Member State level, which act as a direct threat to the completion of the single market. That is why it is important to watch out for protectionist policies. Last but not least, I believe that a high standard of social services is essential to achieving the fundamental objectives of the European Union. Therefore, a future framework establishing a level playing field, common principles and conditions for the operation of SGEIs, while respecting the subsidiary principle between the Member States, would serve as minimum guidelines for high-quality standards, accessibility and affordability of services for the benefit of all EU citizens.</p>

In particular, I supported a reference whereby, without the state intervening, these services would be lacking or would not be provided at all. That is why we are emphasising the reference to Article 14 and Protocol 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and the discretionary role played by Member States in financing, organising and providing SGEIs. As far as social services are concerned, it is necessary to take their huge diversity into account, especially by means of new notification exemptions.

The Commission is responsible for investigating whether State aid meets these requirements on the basis of the four Altmark criteria. It is absolutely clear that services in the areas described are far too important in terms of prosperity and social order in the EU Member States for the European Commission to be able to decide whether the aid is being provided efficiently and cost-effectively.

Such services are highly diverse, and national, regional and local authorities within the EU have discretion in determining what constitutes a service of general interest, i.e. which services ought to be offered in the interests of the general public. However, all such services have this much in common: they are services regarded by the state or state authorities as particularly important to all members of the public but they cannot be provided, or cannot be provided adequately, without state intervention.</p>
      <p sl="en">The state intervenes to ensure that all members of the public have access to these services and/or that they are provided for all members of the public at an affordable price and a high level of quality. The services provided make an important contribution to economic performance and competitiveness and promote social, economic and territorial cohesion in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I supported this report in plenary because it establishes clear guidelines for the future reform of EU State aid rules on services of general economic interest (SGEI), namely transparency and simplification. Transparency is necessary: public funds must be allocated and managed in accordance with rules that are known to all, where every service provider is on an equal footing. Simplification is just as necessary: local authorities and local service providers must be able to understand them and to implement them easily, which is not always the case today, and which may raise issues of legal certainty. However, I will remain vigilant on one point: simplification cannot be to the detriment of transparency. Finally, I welcome the fact that the rapporteur reminds the Commission that public services must be of a high quality and accessible to all sections of the population.</p>

      <p sl="el">I voted in favour of the report by Mr Simon because I believe that services of general interest play not only a decisive role for individual citizens, but are also of huge importance to the prosperity of society as a whole. Services of general interest are services which the state or state authorities consider to be especially important to all citizens. These services make an important contribution to the performance and competitiveness of the economy and strengthen social, economic and territorial cohesion in the EU. However, it is important to guarantee that the rules are applied correctly, so that undertakings responsible for providing public services are in a position to discharge in full the duties allocated to them.</p>

      <p sl="it">The report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) highlights the need to simplify and streamline the rules, in line with the results of public consultations. There are certain key concepts underlined in the report and contained in the Commission’s reform proposal that are in need of clarification – for example, those that relate to the distinction between economic activity and non-economic activity – in order to provide greater legal certainty.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the opinion, it is also proposed that, on the basis of the consultations, the Commission should raise the thresholds that determine implementation of the decision concerning exemption from providing notification of certain compensation payments. To sum up, it is a call for greater transparency and flexibility. I believe, then, that it is necessary to emphasise that the proposals to reform the Altmark package, as prepared by the Commission, do not seem to amount to genuine simplification in this area.</p>
      <p sl="it">The excessive quantity of texts, between communications, decisions and regulation, runs the risk of further confusing the normative framework rather than contributing to a genuine, functional and practicable update of the evaluation criteria for compensations and of State aid for services of general economic interest (SGEIs). In fact, despite being under profiles of a different nature, the various acts reiterate the same principles and elements of analysis, so as to render the fundamental objective of the reform less evident and harder to distinguish at first glance.</p>

The Union should therefore adopt a concrete and immediate course of action to realise the objective of lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty by 2020.

There are still crucial disparities between rich and poor when it comes to appropriate access to health and social services, as well as differences in income and wealth, which are continuing to widen in some areas. I think that poverty is a multi-faceted problem requiring an integrated response which takes into account the different stages of life and citizens’ different kinds of needs, and which is also based on guaranteeing access to rights, resources and services, in order to meet the basic needs of any individual. It is impossible to reduce exclusion and poverty without combating inequality and discrimination or guaranteeing the growth of national economies and solidarity with the most vulnerable groups in society, in other words, without allocating national wealth fairly and appropriately.</p>

I would like to underline that it is impossible to reduce poverty or to boost inclusive growth if nothing is done to combat inequality and discrimination, or if there is no solidarity with the weakest groups in society. We should also consider that the most vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and people with disabilities, have been those most severely affected by the financial, economic and social crisis. For this reason, the austerity measures must not undermine employment and social protection, worsen the situation for the most disadvantaged, or put at risk of unemployment or poverty millions of people who were previously still managing to live on their wages or retirement pensions. With this text, we call on the Commission to play a coordinating role and to guide the Member States to meet the current challenges, and combat poverty and social exclusion.

In order to achieve this, a comprehensive approach that takes into account all the stakeholders concerned (NGOs, social service providers, etc.) must be adopted.

The scheme for food distribution to the most deprived people in the Union, set up in 1987, currently provides food aid for 13 million people suffering from poverty, and its distribution chains involve some 240 food banks and charities.

This report is not legislative but it has the merit of establishing a fairly comprehensive view of the situation and identifying several ways to improve the situation by putting forward a model of society based on ‘social’ values. The development of a suitable European action will require the development of national platforms to fight poverty and the full use of the existing options in the Treaty of Lisbon, in the first instance, the famous horizontal social clause. It is only by truly taking into account the social impacts of every European policy that we will achieve this famous social dimension to the EU that seems to be so far off at present. As the preservation of social rights in the Union is fundamental, the specific nature of services of general social interest must be recognised and the discussion of sectoral legislative initiatives on the quality and accessibility of these services must continue.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European platform against poverty and social exclusion is one of the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy and intends to provide the Member States with a plan of action with a view to pursuing its main objective of lifting 20 million people out of poverty by 2020.

As is often the case, we are, in fact, speaking of policies in favour of Roma populations and their social inclusion, when instead we are dealing with an ethnic group which, quite simply, does not demonstrate any desire to become integrated into the social fabric of our societies. Furthermore, we talk of guaranteeing quality housing to categories of immigrants, all the while forgetting that, before such people, national and EU authorities should be concerning themselves with the destitute in our own countries who number so many, and with those disadvantaged categories that are suffering the disastrous effects of the current financial crisis, such as the elderly, young couples, and so on.

In my opinion, the main cause for the spread of this phenomenon is that the minimum wage is set too low in the Member States.

      <p sl="lt">In this context, the proposal to consider the validation of leave for those caring for family members throughout the EU seems very sensible. Such a decision would allow the problem of calculating women’s length of service to be resolved because currently, women caring for relatives and family members lose years out of their length of service, and their pensions subsequently suffer as a result.

      <p sl="it">The gradual increase in the number of areas affected, or at risk of being dragged into a state of poverty or ‘severe material deprivation’ as a result of the financial crisis, means that we have to strengthen and differentiate our responses.

To fight poverty, it is not enough to make speeches on growth: with 8.4% of workers poor in the EU, employment no longer protects against poverty. I am pleased that the proposal by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to tax high incomes has been approved. It is high time that the Heads of State or Government understood that they are not there to serve the interests of the richest 1%, but to defend the 99%. I am pleased that people living in poverty will play a crucial role in the establishment of this platform. Today, policy must be drawn up ‘with’ and not just ‘for’ the poorest. I regret that our call for a framework directive on the quality and accessibility of social services of general interest was rejected. Universal access to public services is fundamental to the protection of the poorest.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I have just one thing to say: poverty and social exclusion have increased in recent years in Europe, despite the commitments made by the European Union to reduce them. As a result, in 2010, the number of people at risk of poverty was still around 116 million, which is more than 20% of European citizens. The – non-binding – resolution that was voted on at noon proposes that the Member States develop minimum income schemes based on at least 60% of the median income of each Member State of the European Union and calls once again on the European Commission to work towards introducing appropriate legislation. This is vital. In addition, paragraph 73 of the resolution, which I, of course, supported, also calls for a framework directive on the quality and accessibility of social services of general interest, in particular, in the areas of health, education, public transport, energy, water and communication.</p>

Just before the vote on this report, the Council reached a compromise to prevent a sudden ending of the food distribution scheme for the most deprived by continuing it until 2013. I am relieved that Member States and food banks will now have the time to prepare themselves for the consequences of a reformed common agricultural policy. This report calls for a continuation of the scheme for the period 2014-2020 as well. I personally believe that the Commission and Member States should work towards social and employment policies that enable people to live a life in dignity, without having to rely on free food distribution. I therefore do not support a structural continuation of the food distribution scheme in the EU, making it a permanent element in the EU’s anti-poverty strategy.</p>

Beyond announcing grand objectives and declarations that lack realism, the European Union should not lose sight of the fact that it exists for the people. Any initiatives that it undertakes against poverty and social exclusion should bear in mind the issue of each human being’s dignity, and should not confuse the establishment of large bureaucratic structures with actually helping those most in need. While the multidisciplinarity of the problem makes it advisable to give it a multidisciplinary response, the programme’s sensitivity makes it advisable not to lose sight of the fundamentals of each human being, bearing in mind the financial difficulties that the Member States are experiencing and the realism that this limitation imposes.</p>

The European Parliament and the Council declared 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. In addition to this, in December 2010, the European Commission published a communication entitled ‘European platform against poverty and social exclusion’, a European framework for social and territorial solidarity. It is one of the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy, the aim of which is to reduce the number of people in an insecure situation by 20 million by 2020.

      <p sl="it">In order to achieve the ambitious objective of lifting 20 million people from poverty and social exclusion by 2020, the European Union must work to do more on awareness-raising, coordination and funding. Above all, I think European funds should be used in a much more targeted and efficient way in order to combat the increased discrimination and social marginalisation that more often than not represent the cause and the direct consequence of poverty. Furthermore, fighting poverty cannot fail to involve combating unemployment. I would like to underline, however, that frequently, having a job is not enough to ensure an escape from poverty. Accordingly, more action is needed to combat the phenomenon of poor workers and ensure access to decent, long-term employment. Unfortunately, the European Union is currently home to more than 80 million people living at risk of poverty, equivalent to 8% of the working population. We must face up to this dramatically worsening situation, remembering that poverty is a shared responsibility and a challenge for the whole of society; it must not be stigmatised or seen as the failing of individuals who find themselves in economic difficulty or socially excluded.</p>

Their massive and continuing arrival – 200 000 a year in France alone – inevitably creates tensions in rents for an inadequate housing stock. I would have preferred the report to emphasise the 42 million Europeans deemed poor and also the 116 million threatened with poverty. These figures are frightening and are not just due to the crisis, because the downward pressure on Europeans’ incomes goes back a long way: competition from immigrant workers, competition from countries with low wages, ECB policies against hypothetical wage inflation, pension reforms and so on. The general impoverishment of pensioners, unskilled or low-skilled workers, the working class and, increasingly, the middle classes, is the direct consequence of your policies.

Is this an acknowledgement of weakness or an admission of the abandonment of the principle of solidarity, one of the Union’s founding values? Unfortunately, it can be seen in this way, given the ‘solution’ for the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons of the Community: it will be safeguarded for 2012 and 2013, but with unacceptable conditions, namely, the definitive scrapping of this programme and the abandonment of any EU-level social policy from 2014. This proposal is a provocation at a time when citizens are sorely affected by the crisis and austerity plans. It threatens to reinforce the impression of economic, social and moral regression. This is why, out of respect for the idea of a progressive, supportive Europe, we must continue to rally round this programme: for my part, I shall be paying particular attention during the negotiations on the financial perspectives after 2013.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Poverty and social exclusion have been increasing in recent years despite the European Union’s undertakings to reduce them. The impact of the 2008 crisis has further exacerbated the problem by putting pressure on society’s most vulnerable groups.</p>
      <p sl="pt">While the fight against poverty and social exclusion is primarily the responsibility of national governments, the Union can nevertheless play an important role in terms of awareness-raising, coordination and funding. To this end, and in order to ensure sustainable, inclusive growth, it is essential to make the most vulnerable groups a central focus of European integration, since poverty reduction will be a driver of future growth. Listening to the actors on the ground was the concern that guided the drafting of this report, to which the parties involved contributed significantly by tabling proposals intended to eradicate the scourge represented by poverty and social exclusion. I voted for this report for these reasons.</p>

      <p sl="it">Although the European Union is one of the richest regions in the world, a large percentage of the population is affected by poverty and social exclusion. This situation is incompatible with the European values of justice and solidarity, so in this vein, the Union has, for years, been committed to polices and interventions to reduce it. However, it is worth considering that despite the Union’s action, poverty and social exclusion have increased in recent years, exacerbated by the crisis of 2008 which worsened the problem further. In light of the facts, I am voting in favour in order to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth. I think it is important that the platform is intended, in particular, to promote innovation and social experimentation, reduction of poverty – in its various forms – at all stages of life, better use of EU funds and more effective social protection.</p>

The European platform against poverty and social exclusion, devised by the Commission, completely ignores the gender aspect of poverty and social exclusion. The Commission and Member States must adopt a gender-specific perspective in order to eradicate poverty and combat social exclusion, and must take the gender dimension into account in their national recession recovery plans.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the Commission and Member States to take measures to prevent feminisation of poverty by promoting women’s employment and entrepreneurship, combating the gender pay gap, facilitating the reconciliation of work and family duties, developing child care facilities, through a system of services for dependents, and by promoting flexible working arrangements. The fight against child poverty must focus on prevention, through the provision of equal access to high-quality early childhood education and child care services and to other facilities for children, by ensuring that the distribution of such services and centres provides adequate cover at regional level.</p>

      <p sl="en">I think this report highlights and explains the need for more detailed and more specific information and statistics on social inclusion. More detailed information is needed if programmes such as the convergence objective of EU structural funding are to achieve their stated aim of helping the least developed Member States and regions close the gap between them and their neighbours. It is important to remember that these programmes are supposed to improve the lives of the people who live in these regions. In this regard, greater information would lead to a more targeted approach to solving problems of poverty and social exclusion. Broad, one-size-fits-all approaches are inappropriate when dealing with regionalised and localised problems of unemployment, globalisation, lack of education and inequality. In the case of Social Fund allocations and European Structural Fund allocations, it is important that decisions about whether or not an area belongs in the convergence objective category, or the regional competitiveness and employment category, or the territorial cooperation category, are taken on as local a basis as possible.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Poverty and social exclusion translate to obstacles of the first order for the integrated development of various communities. A society with severe social asymmetries is, in fact, inclined to suffer situations of enormous instability, with clear dangers to the public, above all. Unfortunately, even today, almost 20% of Europeans live on the so-called poverty line. As such, there is justification for the EU authorities to adopt policies that help Member States to confront the social inequalities being experienced, so as to reduce – and, ideally, eradicate – remaining situations of poverty, which, in total, encompass 80 million Europeans. I therefore voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted for Mr Daerden’s report on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion, which aims to focus attention on the economic insecurity or risk of insecurity that threatens more than 80 million Europeans. This is a particularly important initiative when we realise that the economic crisis that has been raging for over three years has mainly affected those who are most vulnerable. Unlike my group, I also supported paragraph 95 on a European minimum income. As it is certainly premature to discuss a figure, it is, however, our duty to agree on the principle and to call on the Commission to examine the possibility of legislation on the issue, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I frequently have to repeat myself. The European Union has a social vocation. However, it can only exercise the competences that are conferred on it by the Member States and the European Parliament. So when ‘Europe says no’, it is often the Member States who are really doing the blocking. For proof, just take at look at the recent saga regarding food aid. We must, therefore, continue to fight against such national reluctance, scepticism and selfishness to advance towards a Europe of solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Forty-two million Europeans live in conditions of severe material deprivation and cannot afford to live a decent life in Europe. Faced with these figures and with the economic prospects for the coming months, the European platform against poverty and social exclusion is crucial. The report from Frédéric Daerden contains several key ideas. Thus, the text calls for the Commission or Eurostat to compile a comprehensive scoreboard on poverty and social exclusion, and for national statistics on poverty to be improved and made more comparable. As regards the minimum income, it expresses the desire for the Commission to launch a consultation on the possibility of a legislative initiative in this area. In addition, on the creation of new jobs, it calls for action in accordance with the basic principles laid down by the ILO, putting into practice the concept of decent work and quality jobs. It also recommends appropriate taxation of very high salaries to help fund social protection systems and the minimum wage. I think these are fair ideas and I wished to support them in this vote.</p>

      <p sl="it">Too often when we think about people living in poverty, we think only about the lack of financial resources. Instead, there are other hardships which exacerbate this state of precariousness and stand in the way of its eradication: the right to a home, a job, a family, to food, health care, education and justice. People who are unable to make their own contribution to society in an equal measure to others are also poor. Poverty and social exclusion contribute to the poverty of the entire society.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe’s strength resides in the potential of single individuals. By approving this report today, Parliament has adopted a genuine action plan in which the fight against child poverty and the creation of new jobs are the key elements.

This report calls for a continuation of the scheme for the period 2014-2020. However, I personally believe that the Commission and the Member States should work towards social and employment policies that enable people to live a life in dignity without having to rely on free food distribution.

Sixteen per cent of the European Union’s population live below the poverty line. For this reason, all the proposals adopted in the resolution are extremely important.

      <p sl="pl">I am full of praise for the report which has been debated and adopted, and for the discussion we have had in Parliament on this subject. I cannot imagine that during an economic crisis, we should not tackle the growth of poverty, which has been caused mainly by rising unemployment and falling support for the poorest. We have allocated huge sums to the support of banks and a variety of financial institutions, so we must also find many times smaller amounts for the fight against poverty. In this work, we must pay particular attention to children and people who are unemployed, homeless or excluded, and this is just for today, because with tomorrow in mind, we must give an important place to education, support for families with many children and ending unemployment. Put simply, what is important is economic development and tackling the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Against this backdrop, the lack of action and the lack of a decision on the part of the Council of the European Union on free distribution of food to the poorest is incomprehensible, and we should be ashamed about this.

This is, therefore, a well-balanced report which receives my full approval.</p>
      <p sl="it">Allow me to reiterate some statistics from my own country. Italy has drawn up its own national programme for reforming its own objectives and programmes concerning the fight against poverty: EUR 3.9 billion have been invested for social inclusion. Of this figure, EUR 2.4 billion is set aside for inclusion in the labour market of women and other disadvantaged people such as immigrants and ethnic minorities. The remaining EUR 1.5 billion will instead be used to improve the offer of collective social health services.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I supported the creation of a European platform against poverty and social exclusion precisely because 22.4% of Romania’s population have an income below the national poverty line. The per capita GDP in 2010 was roughly 55% lower than the average per capita GDP in the European Union. Not only is Romania allocating in these circumstances just 14% of GDP to social welfare, while the EU average is 27% of GDP, but Romanians’ purchasing power has also fallen drastically in the last year due to the austerity measures adopted by the current government.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Since, at the moment, the measures taken by the Romanian Government are simply destroying the foundations of the European social model, excluding the fact that it is actually social welfare which has reduced poverty by 38% in the European Union, I think that this platform is needed to help countries like Romania combat poverty and social exclusion.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU has more than 80 million people at risk of poverty, including 20 million children and 8% of the working population. The multiplying effects of this problem require an approach that is integrated but is simultaneously individualised, since poverty and social exclusion express themselves in various ways. I think it is important to use the open method of coordination, so that monitoring of the targets achieved in this struggle in the Member States can be regulated and the sharing of best practices can be enabled.

Poverty is not a result of, it is prerequisite to the capitalist system. Poverty is not merely a product of the capitalist crisis; it exists and increases even under conditions of capitalist growth. Poverty cannot be eliminated without overturning the anti-grassroots policy of the EU and of the governments and parties of capital that support it, without overturning the economic and political power of the monopolies.

According to official statistics, in Lithuania, poverty threatens not just the unemployed. The rate of poverty among working people in Lithuania is higher than in other Member States. Approximately 10.4% of working people in Lithuania are threatened by poverty, compared to 8.4% in the EU 27. Information from a survey on low-income families has shown that the main causes of the risk of poverty are a lack of education and a high number of dependents. The rate of poverty among working people in Lithuania who have a lower than average education is 21.1% (EU 27 – 16.4%). Both Lithuania and the EU should try to improve education across all generations. The latest EU reports show that the majority of workers on low incomes live in rural areas.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, the past few weeks have again shown how much is at stake for the European Union today. We must react quickly and decisively to events that affect every citizen and every household in Europe. Against this background, it is more essential than ever that our institutions strengthen our cooperation and show common resolve to deliver rapid and effective responses to the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The basis for a successful response is to have a clear consensus about where Europe is heading. I believe that the Commission and this Parliament share this consensus – this ambition for a European Union that is stable and strong, that is open and really united.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission work programme is a key building block to achieving this vision. It is therefore particularly important that it rests on a series of intensive exchanges between our two institutions. This intensive dialogue has been decisive in determining the focus of the programme for 2012. Through the Conference of Committee Chairs, the Committee of Presidents, and the structured dialogue between Commissioners and Committees – and I would also add, Mr President, the political dialogue which we had with you when you were invited several times to the College of Commissioners – through all these occasions, we have been able to explore key measures across the full range of our work.</p>
      <p sl="en">The State of the Union debate was at the core of this work. It set the tone. We were right to be ambitious for Europe. Our common messages were heard. Many of them are indeed reflected in the recent European Council conclusions, and they provide the backbone of the programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The events of the last weeks only confirm that we are at a key moment in the history of our Union. To secure the reforms that Europe needs to transform itself, we have to win the confidence of our citizens and also of investors. We need a European renewal, and regaining confidence requires swift and decisive action. We are constantly being called upon to take swift decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week, we reshaped the Commission’s rules to give a special role to the new task of Vice-President for Economic and Monetary Affairs. This was done as a matter of urgency to allow Vice-President Rehn to appear before this Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 23 November also as Vice-President for the Euro.</p>
      <p sl="en">For next week, we have accelerated the annual growth survey. We will also present new proposals on further deepening European Union and euro area economic governance to provide further stability, discipline and convergence, and to complement the reforms agreed through the so-called ‘six-pack’. Since we are going to have the opportunity tomorrow to discuss these matters in more detail, I will not go into this part now, but I know that we have the support of this Parliament for such decisive action.</p>
      <p sl="en">The political consensus that we are shaping together to tackle the crisis is the springboard for this action. I can now say the same should be true for next year’s programme. By the end of 2012, we should see the ambitious measures we are putting forward today being passed into national law. We should see implementation starting to bite and have a real impact, and we will have further measures proposed by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know well what our common priorities are: we must achieve sustainable and job-creating growth; we must bring public finances back on track; we must restore confidence in our European Union’s ability to get out of the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the next year, we can show that the European Union has what we need to overcome the crisis and restore growth. It has the vision we need in the shape of our political consensus for action on this renewal. It should have the tools we need, with the transparent and democratic approach enshrined in the Community method, and it has the collective determination we need to carry through ideas into action.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our joint determination has also managed to move opposition in Council to the programme of aid to the most deprived persons. Following our insistence, Council finally approved this scheme for the most deprived persons yesterday. The Commission has already tabled a new proposal for after 2013. It is now up to this Parliament and the Council to decide on it. One thing should be clear: the Commission does not give up on having this kind of programme after 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has focused its work programme for 2012 on reinforcing stability and responsibility, while at the same time stimulating growth, doing everything we can to counter the very negative outlook we have today for the economic situation in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the Europe 2020 strategy, we have the blueprint for achieving sustainable and job-creating growth. We now have to keep up the momentum and agree and implement changes that bring real benefit. We have to be coherent and consistent in implementation. We cannot just approve measures and then afterwards forget about their implementation. It is extremely important to follow on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe 2020 can be the spark to a virtuous circle of growth, and I can count on your support to help give this process the political momentum it needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The work of the European Semester will be critical over the next year, to drill down action into Member States and ensure that all parts of Europe help each other to recover.</p>
      <p sl="en">Part and parcel of this work is, of course, to ensure sound public finances. We cannot do this by turning our backs on ways to improve revenues. That is why we need to keep up the pressure for a financial transaction tax, and why we will be looking at new measures to tackle tax havens and counter VAT fraud. We will also make a focused proposal on protecting the financial interests of the European Union, including by criminal law.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will also press on with financial sector reform. Key proposals will be on the table by the end of this year, including ones on bank resolution. Next year, we will press on with measures on investor protection, critical to deepening confidence in the sector. Institutions for occupational retirement provision are also a sector to work on next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The backbone of our strength, as we have said so often, is the single market. It has made us what we are today, the world’s largest economy. We need to further develop it and bring it into the 21st century so that it can continue to generate growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Twenty years on from its inception, we can show that the single market remains a key motor for sustainable growth in Europe. This is why we have proposed fast-tracking the priority proposals set out in the Single Market Act. We have accelerated our work on these proposals and we are asking the legislators to work to see these in law by the end of next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a wide range of proposals now on the table. If we want to have a real impact on growth, and quickly, we need to adopt them and see them implemented. The European patent, roaming charges, the Energy Savings Directive – these are all examples where early adoption would also show a European Union determined to do everything possible to boost growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">The modern European economy also rests heavily on the digital single market. We will address the risks of electronic services being hampered by incompatible national copyright regimes, with a proposal on rules for the cross-border licensing of online music. A pan-European framework for electronic identification and signatures will give the confidence needed to boost electronic transactions across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Growth is also generated by consumers. Their confidence is key to boosting demand. A comprehensive consumer agenda will provide a secure foundation for consumer transactions in the single market, while revised rules on general product safety will offer a clear framework both for consumers and manufacturers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The growth we need to achieve in the European Union has to go hand in hand with the creation of sustainable jobs. We need to give a new momentum to flexicurity to drive a jobs-rich recovery, closely involving the social partners. More than ever, social dialogue is necessary both at European and at national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will help young people to move around Europe with a Youth on the Move card. We also want to look again at the handling of supplementary pension rights of people who change jobs: this must not be allowed to remain an obstacle. I am also determined that we do not lose sight of our longer-term need to build an economic recovery that is sustainable. Next year will be a key moment of transition to the revised Emissions Trading System.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Rio+ Summit will remind us of our global obligations for sustainability and green growth, looking in particular at a new water strategy. New proposals on emissions for passenger cars and vans will spur innovation and give manufacturers the necessary regulatory certainty. We will also draw the conclusions for legislation from the stress tests following the Fukushima accident.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that next year, we will see important initiatives in the field of green growth. I know that now, in the face of the difficult situation in economic and budgetary terms of many of our Member States, speaking about this agenda is not so popular, but I believe that we need these kinds of initiatives more than ever and we are working precisely on linking some of our initiatives in terms of climate action and protection of the environment with the e-economy, the digital economy, so that we can indeed have important breakthroughs in terms of our action for green growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Providing security and justice in a borderless Europe continues to be a big challenge. For an open Europe to work, we need to make sure that its border regime is up to date. Modernisation and the use of new technology will ensure that the system encourages cross-border activity while providing the necessary safeguards.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also believe this is a time of real opportunity for the European Union on the global stage. This is key to recovery. We will be taking forward a wide range of bilateral trade negotiations, as well as continuing to make the case for a European approach in fora such as the WTO, the G20 and the G8. At the same time, we must continue to respond to the dramatic changes in the southern Mediterranean. I believe we have a responsibility to do everything we can to help the post-transition societies there to develop successfully, and the Commission is determined to support that process. I believe that longer-term stability and prosperity in our close neighbours is also – apart from our commitment to important values – in our very urgent interest.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that we already have a wide agenda on the table. The measures on economic governance, on the single market, on financial services, not to mention the multiannual financial framework, will make huge demands on us all over the coming year, and we know that we are also going to deal with these very important initiatives against a backdrop of economic financial instability, where the news coming from Europe and also from other parts of the world is not always the best. That makes us need more than ever this spirit of responsibility and solidarity among the Member States and among the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that confidence comes through showing that the European Union has the determination to act. I believe that in the past, we have seen that, sometimes, it is under conditions of huge pressure and precisely when we are resisting or reacting to crises that the European Union is able to show how important it is for the prosperity of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope the Commission can count on your support in joining us in delivering concrete, ambitious action.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on behalf of the EPP Group, I would like to share some thoughts about the new Commission work programme. My colleagues will go into detail, but I would just like to welcome the Commission’s proposals for 2012, especially as we cannot ignore that Europe is in deep crisis. The engines of the European recovery should be the European Parliament and the Commission together, in cooperation with the other institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I notice with confidence and with satisfaction that the test which the Commission applied in the past towards different legislation is basically about better and new measures and whether new legislation is really contributing to growth and job creation. This will also be the test from my group’s point of view; whether any kind of measure we discuss in Parliament or the different forums of the European Union in the framework of legislation really contributes to this kind of general goal and whether it creates jobs. This is the general test we are applying to everything. I hope the Commission will agree with us on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to make another point on the procedure itself. We have been having this general discussion on the Commission work programme year by year. Now we are in a new procedure, but we do not see very much difference. Very often, we see that a part which we adopted the previous year does not show up in the programme for the following year. We have to improve this process, because it is Parliament’s very important prerogative to influence what is going on at legislation level because we do not have the right of initiative. This is why it is of special importance for us to see the results. In my specific area, comitology, we are still awaiting the application from last year’s work programme to the acquis according to the new comitology procedure. We did not see much this year except in the international trade issues, but we would like to see the programme reflected in the daily work of the different institutions. We asked the Commission to move closer to this general goal. We, in the PPE Group, will support you as you apply this test on how to create a better economic environment and on how to create jobs and growth in the European Union.</p>

    <intervention id="2-445-000" speaker_id="2295" name="Hannes Swoboda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, we must not beat around the bush. We are in a difficult situation and it is the responsibility of the Commission and the European Parliament to work very closely together, particularly next year, in order to ward off the attacks currently being made on Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">The initial attacks are coming from the financial markets. They do not like us and they are very fond of themselves and their own profits. Mr Barroso, I think it is essential for us to make rapid progress with all our plans for introducing regulations, in particular Mr Barnier’s. It is important for us to move ahead with the financial transaction tax, because this will transform financial investments into real investments, which is crucial for growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, Mr Barroso, we are focusing on budget deficits and on sanctions against them. This is an important consideration, but it is not the only one. If we want to encourage growth, as you have said, we need an overall concept behind all of this which is based on growth. We need investment and we also need the surplus funding from the budget. We are very well aware that much of the money available in our common budget is not spent. I would like to see a proposal from the Commission showing how this money can be used, in particular for investment in Greece, for example, or in other countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, there are the institutional issues. Mr Joschka Fischer, the former member of the Green Party – or he may still be a member, I do not know – has written a famous essay in which he tells us to forget the current Europe. I do not want to forget the Europe which we have now, despite all its shortcomings and problems. The alternative, which involves dividing Europe in two or breaking it down into the euro area with a euro government and a euro parliament, together with our Parliament and our Commission, is not acceptable. We are opposed to this concept. It will not allow us to make progress. In addition, the economic and political links are too strong. I am not ruling out special regulations for the euro area. However, we have had enough of separating, splitting and dividing Europe. We need to move forward. There is only one common Europe and it is the job of the European Commission and the European Parliament in particular to make this clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some people also say that we should forget the social question. That is not our position, particularly with regard to the social elements. The pay gap and the divide between rich and poor are widening – with regard to consumers that is also an important growth issue – because the salaries of the people at the top of the tree, who tend to consume relatively little, are increasing and the people at the bottom are earning less and less.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, it is very important for us to focus on the issue of distribution. It is not only a question of the Occupy movement. In many countries, it is giving rise to genuine anti-European feeling and I believe that we need to be aware of this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barroso, a Treaty change is imminent. Many of us are very, very sceptical that this is the right route to take. However, we need to make one thing clear. Firstly, in the case of Treaty change, the focus must be on the Community method. We must stand up together and support the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we must not consider only the budget issues. There are other economic and social problems in Europe. In the case of any Treaty changes, we must stick together and make it clear that we need the Community method and joint resolution of Europe’s economic and social problems, within a united and not a divided Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this work programme brings the Commission and Parliament back to centre stage. We have had too much recently of panicky and chaotic summitry from our Prime Ministers that have destroyed not only market confidence, but also democratic confidence in the integration process. It is crucial to show that, despite this turmoil, we are able to proceed with a serious legislative programme crafted in the common interests of all the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">This must be the year of fiscal solidarity. It must also be the year where we see the clear first fruits from the Treaty of Lisbon in terms of a common foreign and security policy. It will be the year when we have to change direction from seeking multilateral agreements on trade to a series of bilateral agreements with our principal trading partners.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is also some important business from previous years which is far from complete. If I could just mention one, it is the European Union’s accession to the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights), which is essential to provide a uniform standard of protection of fundamental rights across the continent. This accession process has now stalled and I hope that President Barroso will do all he can to see that it is brought to a successful conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, I have taken part in these debates about the Commission work programme too often to be able to say that I am impressed. On the contrary, it seems to me that this proposal for the work programme is very much about business as usual and that you are failing to cope with the situation that the European Union finds itself in barely 14 days after the last crisis summit, which was supposed to have resulted in a breakthrough.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact that we now have two old European countries being run by technical governments is an indication of the decline of democracy within the European Union, which we simply must acknowledge in a self-critical way. In my opinion, the blame also lies with the Union. The laissez-faire approach to the markets and the laissez-fair attitude in Brussels to the countries with deficits and those with surpluses is also your responsibility. In order to be credible, the work programme should include a statement on this situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not believe that the Papandreou government failed only as a result of Mr Papandreou. I think it was partly due to the fact that the crisis programmes adopted in Brussels were too one-sided and that we need to recognise – and it must finally sink in, damn it – that programmes which focus only on austerity and which do not seriously come to grips with economic growth in the deficit countries at the same time are doomed to disaster. The situation will be just the same for the technical governments, both in Italy and in Greece, as it has been hitherto in the problem countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are all very pleased to hear your remarks about the Community method. However, should I believe them? I think it is a good thing that Mr Rehn has been given a more prominent role and will have more to say in future. What does it mean, however, when Mr Van Rompuy’s role is also upgraded at the same time? We take a step towards the Community method and, at the summits, we simultaneously take two steps back from it. If all the crisis instruments are operating outside the Treaties, how will the Community method work? We need to discuss this as well while you are promoting your ideas concerning the Community method in this House.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of the programmes that you are proposing, I would like to say that green growth is something that I have heard you talking about over a long period with regard to energy and the climate. I do not want to repeat mantra-like something that I have often said before. We are in a very poor position in the run-up to Durban. We have not put in place any firm measures which could help us to reach the two degree-goal that you have so often committed to. As I said recently in the context of a smaller group, green growth, for example, in the agriculture industry does not mean what Mr Cioloş wants. Instead, for you, it means more concentration, more large businesses, fewer farms, fewer jobs, more intensive farming, more monocultures, less added value for the individual business, a greater impact on the environment and an increased dependency on imports. That is not what I understand by green growth. I believe that green growth in this work programme is a genuine example of greenwashing, because it is not consistent with the individual regulations that you are drawing up.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of Joschka Fischer, Mr Swoboda, as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I completely share your view. I also cannot take seriously anyone who does an arbitrary about-face of this kind, talking one day about the United States of Europe and then only a week later coming up with this half-hearted proposal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, unlike some of my colleagues, I welcome this proposal because I see that it is much more focused than we have seen before on the real priorities that we have to tackle, which are to support economic growth and job creation. This is absolutely the most critical thing we have to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Duff referred a bit earlier to us coming back to centre stage after all the summitry. I just want to remind him that, on 23 October, at the first summit of that week, the communiqué had as its two top priorities the priorities of this Commission work programme – to complete the 12 levers of growth in the Single Market Act. My group certainly supports that very strongly and, as Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I clearly support that as well. But the second priority for the Council – and indeed we see this in this Commission work programme – is to create the digital single market at the same time and keep that investment going. The third priority in the 23 October summit was to tackle the problem of regulatory burden and to go for smart regulation, which I also see is in here. I want to thank the Commission President for putting that in here, because those targets have been largely invisible up to now. As I have said to him, we want a higher profile for those policies to help business move forward. He is quite right to point out that we have made progress there.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we do not want in this proposal are actions that would actively undermine economic growth. By his own impact assessment, the one proposal in here that will do more damage to economic growth than anything else – in his impact assessment, a minimum of cutting economic growth by half a percent of GDP across Europe – is the financial transaction tax. What are we doing now if the priority is about economic growth in putting this in your work programme?</p>
      <p sl="en">I just conclude by what it said in the Council conclusions. The European Union needs to support all actions on economic growth and job creation. The single market underpins that, and that is a policy all of us must share and all of us must move forward. We absolutely cannot have divisions in the way that we plan to move forward in developing the single market.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Barroso, you presented a programme which, to my mind, does not take into account the extreme seriousness of the crisis, the loss of popular sovereignty that we have been witnessing in recent days, and the rejection by the people of the European idea itself, because Europe, in truth, is neither united, nor social, nor ecological.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Admittedly, you are continually talking about growth and employment, but threats of recession and unemployment are all that lie ahead. Hyper-austerity and the destruction of social rights are leading us straight towards bankruptcy. That is why, Mr President, I suggest that you consider – simply consider – another approach. If there is any need to change the Treaties at all, this would have to entail changing the missions of the European Central Bank to enable it, by way of monetary creation, to take on or guarantee the debts of Member States and to promote new credit that would support an economic and social recovery. In connection with a new human, social and ecological development fund, paid for by a tax on financial transactions that you just mentioned, and by cracking down on tax evasion, which you also mentioned, and in connection with the European Central Bank, it would be possible to kick-start public services in the areas of transport, education, housing, health and social security for those in work and in training, which are vital investments for creating jobs in Europe. These tools should provide incentives for social progress everywhere, with the introduction of a European minimum income and minimum wage in order to put an end to the deadly competition between employees.</p>

Instead, one should speak clearly about separating banks that are collection oriented from those that are speculation oriented, such as Goldman Sachs, which, in fact, seems to have become the calling card with which you present us the saviours of Greece and the saviours of Italy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Lisbon strategy’s aim in 2000 was to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. As we know, it failed. And now, looking at this proposal for a work programme in the EU, it will continue to be a failure. According to Eurostat, industrial output in the EU fell by 19% during the economic crisis, in comparison to 17% in the US. Downturn in industrial output in the eurozone has been worse than the EU 27 as a whole, suggesting that the euro is a burden to recovery. Even the EU’s own figures show that more job growth is created outside the eurozone than in, and yet unelected President Barroso says the UK is obliged to join the euro. No thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="de">I am a member of the third generation since the Second World War. My children, who are two and four years old, are the fourth generation. We have learned that the worst disasters in the world are quickly forgotten. I became aware of this during the time I spent in Japan with the Committee on International Trade. All along the coast, there are warning stones which indicate where major catastrophes involving tsunamis occurred in the past. Everyone knows that tsunamis can hit anywhere and that they penetrate far into the interior of the country. Nevertheless, nuclear power stations and other facilities have been built in these areas. Tens of thousands of people died in the earthquake and tsunami, because although everyone knew about all the dreadful things that had happened in the past, they did not take them seriously or act accordingly. I am concerned that we are doing the same thing here in Europe three or four generations after the Second World War.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barroso, we are in the midst of a serious crisis and you are presenting us with a Commission work programme which is almost identical to that of last year. I am convinced that you are paying no attention to major changes. When will we finally get around to enforcing European law? When will we force countries to comply with European regulations, for example? During our discussions on the euro, why has no one called on Sweden finally to join the euro? In this area, we could also start enforcing the European Treaties. We should be launching initiatives which focus on new subjects, which present the European Union in such a way that the citizens of Europe are brought on board, which give rise to new ideas, and which do not simply continue as if nothing had happened.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have to say frankly that I am very disappointed. The work programme for next year is also a disappointment. I would be very grateful if we could introduce some improvements in this area.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year and the next are crucial to the future and unity of Europe. The work programme should therefore be included more fully in this framework of exceptionality, which certainly means focusing on key objectives, giving more concrete efficacy to our actions, concentrating investments towards those bodies which can, in turn, put into action other private resources, but also, as my colleague has said, seeing the Commission – President Barroso, if I could just have your attention for a moment – playing a more active role, which is better directed towards the reality of certain countries and of the entire euro area and of the whole of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">We hope that the Commission will take on this role, and I say this even as a representative of a country which, at this moment, is changing its government; which is not a technocratic government but rather a technical government that demonstrates not the rejection of political forces and politics but, if anything, the generosity – and I say this as a force that was in opposition in my country – of parties that are ready to do what is useful for the country even without direct representation.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the theme of stable and equal growth should regard the theme of supporting businesses in two ways: access to credit and innovation. The Commission and Europe are capable of achieving this in a concrete way. When we recapitalise and help to recapitalise banks, even, perhaps, with public support, we should demand that this credit go to the real economy – first and foremost to the real economy. When Horizon 2020 becomes one of the main dossiers, we should initiate wide-scale research on innovation for enterprises, whether these be large or small. The chapter on the digital agenda is also very important because the creation of this unique market will be of great help to society.</p>

      <p sl="en">Her solution to this particular problem is to call for closer political ties and tougher budget rules. In purely economic terms, this may be a possible solution in that it will help to balance the books. Mr President, you yourself spoke of deepening integration, of an enhanced ‘six-pack’, of economic governance, and of completing the single market. However, Commissioner, for many citizens, that is simply not enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">Balancing the books on its own is not an adequate response. It cannot be just about economics because, if it is, then it will not be possible to win the confidence of the citizens you spoke of. And we need to win that confidence. We need that support so that citizens can see that the EU is working for them, not just to satisfy the markets or recapitalise the banks.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I have real concerns that we are not addressing the social and employment areas adequately. This morning, we had a debate on the European platform against poverty and social exclusion, looking at how the Commission, the Parliament and the Member States can take concrete actions to assist the 80 million Europeans that are at risk of poverty. And Commissioner, those numbers are growing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our work programme must ensure that inclusive growth and employment-generating projects are at its core. That message needs to be delivered loud and clear to citizens. Europe will succeed if its citizens are confident that they are its real concern. It is not enough that that message is implicit. It must be explicit. We need to articulate a vision for Europe that citizens can believe in – balance the economic with the social, and I think then we might just get their attention.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Barroso, I listened carefully to your speech. I respect you as a politician, and I very much liked many of the points you made. However, in a situation in which we are feeling the crisis, we are feeling the weakness of the Lisbon Treaty, and we are feeling, too, a weakening of your own authority. I expected you would say something more, and not speak as if you were only a bookkeeper. I expected you to talk about the causes of the crisis in Europe. I would also like to hear from you in subsequent statements about what lies at the root of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">You should be speaking about a return to traditional republican values – not going around the world with a collection hat, but going back to the traditional virtues of thrift and prudence, and talking about the demographic crisis and the crisis of the family. In Europe, there is a sense of prevailing crisis, and for this a bookkeeper will not be enough – what is needed is a politician who will define the fundamental problems which lay at the root of this crisis. They are not just bookkeeping problems, they are problems of a much more serious nature. They are problems of our attitude to our neighbours, with the fact that we shut ourselves off from others, with the fact that we do not know how to save, with the fact that austerity programmes and programmes for change are only programmes on paper. We are waiting for you to give a lead.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, like many of my fellow Members, I would also like to say that we need to be honest and admit that the central task for the Commission in 2012 is nothing less than holding together the European Union. We need to take a joint approach to developing it further.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need more Europe. We must stick together in the interest of the citizens and we must not allow individual Member States to be exposed to attacks from financial capitalism. However, more Europe must not mean less democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 2012, we will undoubtedly have to lay the foundations for the future development of the European Union, which will perhaps come close to being a state. However, in this Europe which resembles a state, decisions must not be made by decree by the Council and the Commission. The groundwork carried out by the Commission for the convention in 2012 must not result in the citizens of Europe and their parliaments being disenfranchised. Instead, we need a more democratic Europe with a focus on peace, environmental change and social progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">Do you not realise, Mr Barroso, that you and the Commission are increasingly being regarded by the people of Greece, Portugal and Italy as their enemy? The Council has succeeded in making you the scapegoat. Brussels is ordering the privatisation of state assets, cuts in wages and pensions, and the removal of protection against dismissal. This is all pure neoliberalism.</p>
      <p sl="de">Stop, Mr Barroso! You must finally turn the Commission into the ally of the citizens. You must defend people against the effects of greed and join with us in 2012 in bringing an end to the business model that has driven entire states to the brink of ruin with extortionate interest rates. You must stop feeding the predators. Instead, you must channel the funds into urgently needed investments in the future and make the financial transaction tax your touchstone.</p>

Albert Einstein’s definition of insanity was to keep on doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result. You propose yet more swathes of legislation and yet more power to the EU. You have previously said that the EU must assume economic and financial fiscal governance of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where has all this centralisation of power actually got you? The EU underperforms economically with the rest of the world, mainly because of the burden of job-destroying and prosperity-restricting legislation. The crises in Greece and Italy have been, in part, caused by their membership of the European single currency. Instead of organising an orderly exit, they have had to sacrifice democratic government and have it replaced by rule by economists and technocrats. You propose yet more of the same thing and expect different results. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to predict the result.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the 2012 work programme talks about commitment. I would like to look at some points that are very important to me. The negotiations on the new multiannual financial framework give us the opportunity to introduce own resources in order to remove the burden from the Member States and, therefore, from the citizens of Europe. The financial transaction tax should already be something that we take for granted. Furthermore, in the light of the ongoing economic crisis, unemployment, in particular among young people, is a cause of great concern. We must make a targeted attempt to counteract this problem by means of education, training and appropriate investments. We need investments in new and sustainable technologies, including in the field of energy, in order to create new jobs, generate economic growth and take a step towards the fulfilment of our climate goals.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Mr Barroso, as coordinator of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I naturally welcome the Commission work programme. There is not really anything else I could do, as the topics covered by it were already mentioned last year, and already then we welcomed them. I have to say that we agree that the focus should be on employment and growth. We also agree that faster and more efficient work is needed. However, my colleagues have entrusted me with delivering to you the message that we are very dissatisfied with the speed at which the Commission is working. Allow me to name a few examples. We were expecting the Posting of Workers Directive in January this year. You promised us the Working Time Directive for the third quarter of this year. Yes, I know, you are consulting with the social partners. However, if you cannot come to an agreement after all, we expect you to put forward a proposal immediately. The deadline for the third amendment of the White Paper on pensions expired last week; now it is supposedly by Christmas that we will be seeing something. Again, it is uncertain whether this will be realised. Similarly, there have been promises regarding economic services of general interest. These remain unfulfilled, and now we are once again in a situation where it is the end of the year and we have yet to begin discussing the employment directives, even though these should serve as guidelines for the next year. Perhaps we wish to repeat the situation of last year, where it was at the end of the year that we managed to adopt that which we were supposed to be already reporting on by that time. Mr President, the Members wish to do their work, but they cannot do so without you. It is not enough that we communicate our needs to you through own-initiative reports; we also need your cooperation and collaboration.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have certainly made some important comments about governance, reforms and consolidating the internal market, and I have no problem with these. However, Mr Barroso, may I also say that your speech has left me perplexed. It is clearly not the best speech you have ever made, particularly given the enormity of the economic, social and political crisis that Europe is experiencing. It seems to me to be just another speech, and it is not good enough considering the challenges we face.</p>
      <p sl="es">You have said you would like a partnership with Parliament and with public opinion, and that is what is needed. However, with such an unambitious work programme, I fear you will find it hard to build this partnership, a strong partnership that will rise to the challenge.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, we have adopted an important report in the fight against poverty. Read it, Mr Barroso! Not one of the measures in this report is in your work plan. The Anti-discrimination Directive is not in it. The directive on social services of general interest is not in it. The directive on minimum income is not in it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nothing in your work programme suggests any desire to build a social Europe, and I am not saying this because it does not mention social aspects, but because you in the Commission still believe you are going to overcome the economic crisis without meeting the needs of society or our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">Do not talk only about flexibility, Mr Barroso. Let us talk about flexibility combined with security for workers, which is so badly needed in these times of crisis. Workers need security, because they are having such a tough time, and it is not acceptable to discuss only the market and the market’s requirements. We must also discuss people’s requirements.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Barroso, there is probably a philosophy behind all this, that there is no room for a social Europe in a time of crisis and globalisation. We need a social Europe now more than ever in this crisis, Mr Barroso, and a social Europe in the midst of globalisation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the big challenge for 2012 is not only how we respond to the sovereign debt crisis and how we manage to maintain sufficient budgetary margins to prepare the future; it is nothing less than the continuation of European integration itself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that the Commission’s budgetary means are inadequate with only 1% of European gross domestic product to make things happen. We would even be tempted to paraphrase Stalin here: the Commission, how many divisions? However, that would be the wrong way of putting the problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The central issue is this: does the Commission still have enough authority and coherence to wield influence? Or will the answers to the major problems be found in such a ludicrous context as the one that characterised the last meeting of Heads of State or Government in Brussels?</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this Chamber, many of us believe that the speech made by President Barroso during the debate on the state of the Union would have been salutary had it been made with the same vigour in 2008, for the abundance of the proposals will not, in itself, be enough to remove the threat of European integration unravelling. From now on, it is important to tackle the very causes of the crisis, which, meanwhile, is becoming social and political.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am aware that I have mentioned this many times already and that the novelty has worn off, but what is important, first and foremost, is the method we use in the great European project, a method that must give new impetus on the one hand and must, if need be, put pressure on Member States that are found lacking in solidarity. I am not only thinking of countries that admittedly have played a part in worsening their budgetary situation, but also, and above all, countries such as Germany. Not to mention this would be tantamount to brushing part of the problem under the carpet.</p>

If the Commission knows that it can get around the veto with a clever legal manoeuvre regarding the legal basis of such attacks, then let us hear about it.

      <p sl="pt">How does the Commission justify the rigidity of a Stability and Growth Pact that an ex-President of the Commission has called stupid and that prevented real convergence for the sake of nominal convergence?</p>
      <p sl="pt">How does the Commission justify the instruments enabling speculation on sovereign debt to remain essentially untouched?</p>
      <p sl="pt">How does the Commission justify the recession, the unemployment, the robbery of workers and pensioners, and the despoiling of national economies under the cover of the aggression of the European Union and the International Monetary Fund?</p>
      <p sl="pt">How does the Commission justify the destitution of an EU budget that makes a dead letter of any mention of cohesion in the Treaties?</p>
      <p sl="pt">What sort of democracy is this, when it is now the markets – that wonderful entity – that make or break governments?</p>

This is a crisis which no longer affects just national budgets, but also the confidence of people in the European Union. It is threatening to become a crisis in European democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Responding to the consequences of over-hasty monetary centralisation by making further moves towards centralisation in the form of economic governance is the equivalent of jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. In addition, the proposed Treaty change will have to be subject to democratic approval in Europe and in the individual Member States. I am curious to see how that will be managed in the Netherlands, in France and in Ireland, where referendums will have to be held on these modified Treaties.</p>

      <p sl="en">First, let us not forget about gender mainstreaming, which also concerns pension system reform. For reasons such as the pay gap, care work and because of work in precarious and undervalued sectors, women often receive pensions barely above the minimum subsistence level. We were talking about poverty and social exclusion this morning. Women aged over 65 years are at a much higher risk of poverty than men. This needs to change.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, the regulation on the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) – and I am very pleased to see that my favourite Commissioner dealt with this issue – will be applicable from next April. I am sure that everything will be ready for the starting date on the logistical side. Our colleagues are working hard on it. When it comes to the political aspect, I hope that the Commission will prove to citizens that it is worth starting an ECI.</p>

If we do not create jobs, people will regard the European level of decision making as simply irrelevant – and they would be right. We have to deal with the deep, corrosive fear of unemployment and insecurity. Otherwise, democracy itself will be at risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I welcome the emphasis from the Commission on growth in the single market, and I support the comments made by Malcolm Harbour, but I did want to hear more specific detail, especially for small businesses. In 2012, will we get concrete measures to free small businesses from the burden of regulation? Will there be a small business impact assessment for every piece of new legislation? Will the action plan on access to finance focus on the particular difficulties faced by SMEs, for example, in relation to venture capital and a second chance after bankruptcy?</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the Commission’s determination to get an early agreement on the Energy Efficiency Directive. This will boost employment directly by stimulating the construction and services industries. It will also put money back into people’s pockets so that they can spend more of their cash in the local economy instead of simply burning it. The new innovative renewable technologies offer the greatest potential of all for creating jobs. I hope that in 2012, the Commission will give these industries the investment stability that they are looking for beyond 2020 targets.</p>

Europe is deeply wounded and limping; the very social fabric is tearing apart. The pressures in our nation states are there for all to see, and our citizens are beginning to turn, increasingly, to the extremes. Germany provided us with a very stark reminder just yesterday.</p>
      <p sl="en">Are we to follow suit, and follow a policy of pulling up the drawbridge between Europe and the world? President Barroso argues against doing so. He says there are opportunities globally, yet when he speaks about those opportunities and bilateral agreements, he makes no mention at all of the most advanced of those negotiations, on the EU-India Free Trade Agreement. Does he not mention it because he knows it is ‘locked’? It is an agreement which requires political pragmatism; it needs him to go forth and deliver that, yet there is no mention of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, that agreement has become a test case to demonstrate the future way in which we are to progress.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, developments in Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, in the EU in general and in Greece, where they culminated in the three-party black-front coalition government of social democrats, neoliberals and the far right, are the ‘will’ of the EU and of capital and mark an even more savage and barbaric attack by capital on the rights and lives of the working classes, the grassroots classes and young people.</p>
      <p sl="el">As was to be expected, the three-party government of capital in Greece has unleashed a storm of anti-grassroots measures in its programming statements and anti-grassroots budget which are making the people’s lives hell: there have been thousands of redundancies in the private and public sectors, with 30 000 civil servants due to be dismissed by the end of 2011 alone, followed by a further 200 000 over the next three years, new sweeping wage and pension cuts, new taxes on the workers and even bigger social spending cuts.</p>
      <p sl="el">Greece is a perfect example of the fact that the policy of capitalist restructurings adopted by the EU and capital and the policy of the bourgeois governments is the strategic choice of the monopolies and is being applied uniformly to all EU Member States, irrespective of whether or not they have a memorandum, irrespective of whether or not they are in the support mechanism, whether or not they have deficits and debts and whether they are lenders or borrowers. Despite their serious differences, the bourgeois governments of the EU Member States are united when it comes to striking at the rights of the working and grassroots classes, in order to shift the burden of the capitalist crisis on to them.</p>
      <p sl="el">For the workers, the only popular solution is to re-establish the working and grassroots movement, to organise in the workplace and in grassroots neighbourhoods, to build up the grassroots alliance and to overturn the power of the monopolies, in order to break free from the EU and write off their debt, with power to the people and a grassroots economy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Europe will definitely be different after the crisis. The question is simply: what will it be like? The other important question which we need to answer is: what sort of role should we and the Commission be playing? I believe that if we have enough courage, we can bring about more Europe and, as has been said, this is what is expected of us. Therefore, I am also calling on the Commission to be braver about tackling the problems, but, unfortunately, I think there is very little of this kind of approach to be found in the work programme for 2012.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us look once again at the area of implementation. We are constantly adopting new regulations. If we had correctly implemented the regulations which we have jointly produced, we would not be in the position that we are today. We have the Treaty of Maastricht, which sets clear limits for public debt and net borrowing. If the Commission had ensured over the last 10 years that these requirements were met, we would not be seeing the loss of confidence which all the Member States are now struggling with. It is not the case that the Member States have suddenly plunged themselves deeply into debt. In fact it is the markets that have lost confidence. Unfortunately, we and the Commission are also responsible for this loss of confidence. Therefore, we simply need to do the things that we are doing well and to call on the Commission to put in place a zero-tolerance policy with regard to implementation. The Commission is not brave enough to point the finger at those who are really causing the problems.</p>
      <p sl="de">One of my main concerns is the environment, where there are similar problems. We have excellent regulations, but many Member States are completely failing to comply with them. We have fixed collection rates for electrical equipment. Now we are being presented with a new proposal for new collection rates. If we had implemented the old regulations correctly, we would not need this. Therefore, I feel obliged to call on the European Commission to nail its colours more firmly to the mast, otherwise I foresee a difficult future for Europe as it stands.</p>

It takes time to realise the need to tackle financial markets and to limit our risks if you have ideological spectacles that prevent you from seeing the obvious.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the S&amp;D spokesperson on development, I am much more positive about the Commission proposals for the external action by the EU in our relations with the rest of the world. I am glad to see the Commission making a case for a common European approach at the WTO, G20, G8 – this should be a key part of our external relations next year. Europe is only 5% of the world’s population: if we want to be heard on the world stage, we have to join forces.</p>
      <p sl="en">I appreciate that we must respond quickly and flexibly to changing situations outside Europe, as we did in the case of the Arab Spring – slowly in the case of Tunisia, but increasingly effective afterwards. However, it is unacceptable that we betray long-term development programmes in one part of the world in order to fund short-term foreign policy gains in another. We should do both. I am extremely pleased to see that the Commission has promised to keep up pressure for a financial transaction tax. An FTT will prove vital in providing a fair share of the finance we need to help developing countries escape the devastating cycle of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Closer to home, I believe that the forthcoming signing of the accession treaty with Croatia is proof of the credibility of the EU’s enlargement policy. Europe is a magnet that attracts countries towards democracy and an open society.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Europe’s strength, Mr Šefčovič, has been in our cohesion, despite all of our differences. The European Commission’s role, and yours too, is to guarantee that this same cohesion can continue and be strengthened. I hope, Mr Šefčovič, that this will be your top priority for 2012. The splitting apart of Europe – into those Member States in the north, south, east and west, the richer Member States and those that are not so rich – that is currently taking place, could end in disaster for Europe if we do not act, and this action needs to involve all of the EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I listened very carefully to Commission President Barroso, and made a few notes. He said that he wanted his programme to bring about sustainable and massive growth, a recovery of confidence in the EU as an instrument of growth, a common sense of resolve, a renewal of growth and an employment strategy. It would be relatively easy to attack Mr Barroso’s statements. It is nevertheless necessary to think differently, and it is necessary to be aware of the deepening loss of competitiveness of the EU, of businesses in the EU and of European economies. It is necessary to bear in mind that the European Commission is actively repealing many nonsensical regulations which hamper business. We must signal a withdrawal from the policy of extensive harmonisations and we must move towards liberalisation of employment law, so that as many people as possible can find employment, and so that as many people as possible can work. Debts are not the cause of the current sorry situation – debts are the result of this situation, and we must therefore do something about it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, the Commission work programme clearly addresses the challenges that are facing us, at least in its headings. However, the decisive challenge today is to keep the Europe of 27 Member States together. Here, I believe that we must go beyond what the Commission is proposing. I agree with what Mr Seeber has just said in this respect. I would like to make a few concrete suggestions, in order to prevent the whole thing from being quite so vague.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that the Commission needs to improve its horizontal coordination before it submits proposals. There was a great deal of applause earlier when Mr Barroso mentioned the General Product Safety Directive. However, no decision has yet been made about which Directorate-General will ultimately be responsible for monitoring products on the internal market. Should it be the Enterprise and Industry Directorate-General or the Health and Consumers Directorate-General? A decision of this kind would be extremely helpful. With the internal market acts, you have given examples of how coordination within the European Commission can work effectively.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I would like to say that the proposals you are making will only have an impact if they happen quickly and if they are imposed and implemented effectively. For this reason, the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would like to see at least half the proposals taking the form of regulations, so that the Member States cannot make any mistakes during the implementation process.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, Mr Barroso, we want the programme that reduces the administrative burden on small and medium-sized businesses to be continued. The Commission has done a good job and 25% of the red tape has gone. However, we can definitely take this process further, even if we do have to focus on higher-hanging fruit.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, Mr Barroso, I believe that we need to continue to follow up on Treaty infringement cases where the Member States have not fulfilled their obligations under the terms of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, we have spoken in today’s session about the Commission work programme for 2012, but part of this work has not yet been defined, and could well take up a fair part of the Commission’s work. It relates to the institutional implications of economic governance, including a potential revision of the Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to encourage the Commission to continue to maintain its stated position on these issues, which it has defended here in Parliament. This position will help to prevent separation between the members of the euro area and other countries; moreover, it will stop them from splitting into two groups, which could advance at different speeds within the euro area. It will also help to go beyond mere restriction and the stability policy, including growth measures and solidarity measures; and it will help to boost democracy through the involvement of Parliament and respect for the European Union method.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, returning to the work programme, I would also like to encourage the Commission to be part of an effective communication policy around the European Year of Citizens, in 2013, and similarly to get involved in finalising the negotiation work on the European Union’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Barroso, even though he is absent, ladies and gentlemen, the subjects which the Commission presented were acceptable, but the tone was not right. We had the feeling that in its programme for 2012, the Commission was doing what it had already announced in 2011 and was taking less account of what is actually happening.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are talking about growth, stability and credibility. As the coordinator of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would say that this is a key area for taking concrete action on these projects. Transport plays a central role for every citizen, so it is highly relevant to the people of Europe. It is also a key issue in the context of the environment and sustainability. In addition, it is crucial for growth, with 10 million jobs in Europe and around 7% of GDP. I would now like to refer to what my fellow Members have already said to you, which is that credibility depends on how we make our decisions. There are many examples in the field of transport. We have been waiting for nine years for directives to be implemented and this still has not happened.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we are not speaking with one voice in some areas. One example is the Single European Sky. It would be helpful for everybody, it would save energy and it would also be safer, but the Member States are doing nothing. We have 27 different opinions instead of one.</p>
      <p sl="de">My last point concerns taking new paths. The Trans-European Networks project is now under way. This represents an excellent opportunity to invest in sustainable products. What is happening once again? Every country wants its own little project and every country wants to take a different approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">We hope that the Commission will work with the Council to implement what it has decided on and that both institutions, in order to remain credible to the outside world, will implement in this form the things for which we are jointly responsible.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, our colleague who has just spoken is right. We need networks, we need an economic development model which gives us a future in every sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us take the case of youth employment. There is no way we can believe in the future and trust policies when youth unemployment is over 15% or 20% and when young people are even denied a first job.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I was disappointed by what Mr Barroso had to say. I would have liked practical solutions, for instance, priority access to public procurement for companies that hire young people for their first job. I would have also liked the Commission to present a tailored strategy for development. Yes, we have regions in Europe that are worse off than others. Yes, we have pockets of poverty and, with that in mind, we found out that one Head of State was calling into question the sustainability of the funding for the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union (PEAD).</p>
      <p sl="fr">If there is no future for young people, if there is no solution for the most deprived, if there is no development strategy, you have enough resources to carry out social impact assessments, sector by sector, to determine where jobs can be created in companies, industry and services. It is not enough to say or claim that we could guarantee job security; we must ensure that the young and unemployed can access qualified jobs that enable them to find a solution, since without a job, there is no social dignity. How much progress has the Commission made on the Posting of Workers Directive, Commissioner? We have been waiting a long time for the divide between our countries concerning human resources and employees to be removed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like and hope to receive specific answers from you and I shall conclude by saying that I am disappointed that Mr Barroso only devoted one hour to a year-long programme that is meant to bring about a sustainable recovery and a permanent resolution to our Member States’ sovereign debt.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would also like to address Mr Barroso, even though he is not here right now, via the Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that a reasonable work programme has been set, as in previous years. However, what I feel is missing is the sense of urgency, and this worries me. In many countries, of course including Spain, my own Member State, people get up every morning driven by the urgency of the reforms that must be carried out: in the job market, in budgetary stability, public debt, and so on. What we have here is a programme that, to my way of thinking, lacks that sense of urgency. The main thing it lacks is, essentially, the power of the European Union project to help develop growth and employment, which is the internal market, and the digital internal market as a variant of this.</p>
      <p sl="es">We urgently need to address everything that continues to hinder the development of the internal market today – and there is still a lot – in terms of the transposition and development of directives (such as the Services Directive), and many other aspects that prevent us from unifying and integrating the extraordinary legislative fragmentation currently hampering the development of that market. My main message is that you need to regain the sense of urgency, because if you do not, there is not much that the European Union can do.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Indeed, several months ago already, Commissioner Andor presented to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs several guidelines for the work programme for 2012 in relation to employment and social affairs. This morning, in the context of the debate on the platform for combating poverty, these proposals and others were reiterated by the Commissioner, particularly with regard to employment, young people, social services, the minimum income and child poverty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also welcome Mr Andor’s proposal for an increased budget for these areas, especially the European Social Fund (ESF). We must make sure we have the necessary resources for more solidarity and, above all, turn these declarations of intent into reality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that 2012 will see real progress in combating poverty and that social protection and employment will not suffer from increased economic governance, something that failed to be reiterated this afternoon.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me start in a positive way because there are a lot of critics in this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Commission came up with a general regulation on all the EU’s shared management funds for the regions, for fisheries and also for rural development. This is a positive step because we can make much more synergy between these different funds. We can throw out a lot of bureaucracy and we can be much clearer for all those partners and regions and states.</p>
      <p sl="en">But there is reason for criticism, because in this whole framework on the regulations for next year, we are missing a common strategic framework. In this framework, the European Commission will regulate all those practical things for the beneficiaries, and this is outside the legal package. This is a delegated act and this is something we cannot accept. So, take this in the whole legal package and you have Parliament on your side.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second remark is about the Solidarity Fund. Since 2006, Parliament has expressed a wish to make it more flexible and also to use more money for prevention. We talked about natural disasters, but nothing came out of it. The European Court blocked it. I say to the Commission: this is your chance. Parliament is on your side.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Barroso’s presentation had a negative impact on me, striking me as a long list of arguments without any one priority.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that a key factor for next year should be to concentrate every effort on avoiding a process of uniform growth in all the Member States. Therefore, it is firstly necessary to find resources, and an important instrument such as the tax on financial transactions cannot be debased by reference values which render it more symbolic than concrete.</p>
      <p sl="it">President Barroso then said that social dialogue is necessary. Action is therefore needed on all elements that determine social cohesion. It is necessary to approve a hypothesis on reorganising the social security system quickly, to give stability and certainty to millions of people who are working today, and I would also like to say that it is necessary to bring the horizontal society clause to a positive conclusion, given that this has already been a topic this year. If work changes and there is an increase in employment as we all hope, it is very important that the rights of those who work be guaranteed in every situation.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as President Barroso has already emphasised, it is essential to comply with European Union principles, including solidarity, in Commission policy and in its work programme. However, the proposals for Commission regulations envisage that during the next financial perspective, the budget for convergence objectives will decrease by 20%. A new absorption ceiling has been introduced, which provides for reduced funding, for example, for the Baltic States, whereas increased funding is envisaged for the so-called transition regions, even though the richer Member States are surely able to support their weaker regions themselves.</p>
      <p sl="lv">The decisions of the Commission are contrary to the objectives of cohesion and solidarity, because the differences between the Member States will increase. In 2012, significant work is necessary in order to amend and improve these proposals, which have little to do with solidarity. The same applies to direct payments. Latvians receive EUR 97 per hectare, whereas the Netherlands, for example, receives five times as much. The proposals envisage an increase to EUR 144 for Latvia, whereas the payments to the Netherlands will still be almost three times greater, although climatic and production conditions in Latvia can in no way be valued as three times more favourable and cheaper. This political approach distorts competition, whereas fair competition is a principle of the Single European Market. The Baltic States have completely opened their markets to foreign producers, but this kind of unfair competition is destroying our agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Finally, I should like to point out that the report of the High Representative on European Union human rights policy has been unacceptably belated. We shall have to work on that as well next year. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Barroso left this debate early – too early; it was getting very uncomfortable for him – just like he always arrives too late for crises; to previous ones and to this one.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What is Europe’s great crisis today? It is not the recapitalisation of the banks: that might be the immediate crisis, but the great crisis is of the young graduates who are unemployed; it is of the young people who have Masters degrees and are in precarious jobs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Countries like Portugal, France, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and so on, have 25% youth unemployment; it is 43% in Greece and 45% in Spain. That is the great crisis and Mr Barroso mentioned it zero times in his speech. Out of 127 measures for next year, Mr Barroso is tabling one that relates to education, culture and youth, which is neither a legislative measure nor – I must say – a comprehensible one.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, I am going to say how we could combat the crisis, by doing exactly the opposite of what is in this programme.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Firstly, we need to create universities in the Union. Our competitors in the emerging countries have them. Brazil has federal universities, India has federal universities, so let us create them in the European Union too.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, let us put these universities in the crisis countries: in other words, let us help the European Union by helping those countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thirdly, let us prioritise these universities so that they can work on the things currently throttling the Member States’ budgets: for example, health care spending; the health care spending, for example, that the pharmaceutical companies force on us with their artificial monopolies. What is needed is not to break the backs of the trade unions because of what we pay a nurse in hospital: what is needed is to break the backs of the cartels currently demanding extraordinarily draconian prices from European countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These are three measures for combating the crisis. They require a European Union with a great vision, which the public can understand. A President of the Commission who has never been elected will probably never be able to provide that.</p>

Populist messages sell and I am afraid that I would echo the words of President Van Rompuy when he said that ‘time is the cement of politics’. But it seems that time is something that is in short supply.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the specifics of the work programme, I think we do need to look at legislation and implementation. We have had failure to implement which has led us to this crisis because we have turned a blind eye in the past, particularly on the economic issues. But, for example, this morning, colleagues met with Commissioner Dalli on a small issue of electronic identification of sheep – legislation that we passed which we now believe to be defective and needs to be changed. In these matters, we need to react more swiftly.</p>

I would like to thank the Commission for its determination in this difficult period, because planning a programme in such turbulent times really is difficult. On the other hand, this is the Parliament, and our job is to warn the Commission about any errors in this planning, and I would therefore like to mention two points I consider important.</p>
      <p sl="sk">First, the Commission must focus on adopting tough financial market regulation. It is absolutely vital for measures aimed at improving the resilience of the financial system to be supplemented in the future with measures aimed at limiting risk, such as measures for reducing costs in the event of failure.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The second point I would like to mention is something that we in Parliament recommended to the Commission a few months ago in similar circumstances. It will be necessary to subject to regulation businesses that are closely connected with banking systems and which provide similar services without being subject to the same legislation. It is necessary to bring under surveillance so-called shadow banking, which now genuinely competes against official banking in its volumes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, global financial markets are in chaos, pensioners are worried about their financial security and companies are too nervous to invest in the EU. Commissioner Šemeta was therefore right when he said that growth prospects are slowing down and public finances, and Europe’s social economic models, are at risk. This is why we should have serious doubts about his proposal to introduce a policy which, it is estimated, could cost the EU 0.5% of GDP.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now is not the time to put our fragile European economy at risk by introducing an EU financial transaction tax (FTT). It may be politically popular for the Commissioner to claim this move is punishing the banks, but in reality, the effects of an EU FTT would resonate through the entire economy. Taxing financial transactions does not just affect banks. It would have a material effect on pension funds, other long-term investors and businesses, all of whom we should be encouraging to invest in the EU; we should not be putting up barriers to make it even more difficult for them. Introducing knee-jerk legislation is one of the worst possible things we could do to the EU economy in these troubled times. Growth in a single market, not tax, needs to be our focus.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the European Commission work programme in this period of economic stagnation, and in a time of worsening poverty for families, when Member States can no longer lend for their survival, must be more creative and capable of reflecting the changes taking place in Europe and worldwide since the onset of the global crisis.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Those of us who experienced the way that incompetent communist regimes in Eastern Europe operated will remember how their leaders were unable to respond to change in a fast-moving world. Just like the President of the Commission, they shamelessly expounded their visions and objectives to the public while looking on powerlessly as their countries’ economic systems hopelessly disintegrated.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Commission members must not take this path. They must consider whether it is not necessary to address other operational problems in Europe today, rather than just continuing to fulfil the visions of the 2020 strategy.

In 2010, the last year which the European Court of Auditors evaluated, we had been reporting serious implementation deficits for 10 years, because two countries with a huge number of irregularities, in other words, infringements of the law with regard to the use of EU money, were at the top of the list. Spain and Italy have been in this position for 10 years. I would like to know how many years we will go on like this without changing anything. Therefore, I would like to call strongly for urgent action on precisely this issue. We simply cannot continue in this way any longer.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will try to react to the most frequent questions and comments, but first I would like to thank all honourable Members for a very interesting and lively debate. I believe that most of us in this room feel the same way: we are really going through the defining moment in European history.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think, judging from most of your interventions, that we have come to the same conclusions: we need more Europe, not less; we need to move forward together, or risk fragmentation. How much more proof do we need of how interdependent we are in Europe? Therefore, I think that the answer should be a stronger, more responsible Union, and one which safeguards what makes us unique: the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our work programme for 2012 brings us closer to deeper integration of economic policies and governance in the euro area. Clearly, the deepening of euro area integration must be done through the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree absolutely with Mr Swoboda. The Commission will do everything possible to prevent a possible split in the European Union. I also agree with the many speakers who said that we need to offer even more assistance and help to the countries in need. Therefore, we are exploring all the possibilities we have at our disposal. We have just established a Task Force for Greece and we are looking at other ways to help the countries with problems to absorb European funds better. I am sure that the discussions we will be having next year about how to simplify our programmes will also be very important in that respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">To return to the subject of what action we intend to take, I would like to assure you that we really do feel a sense of urgency in the Commission. We know that we are in an extremely demanding and difficult situation and that urgent steps are needed. You have seen how many steps we have taken so far. I think the governance package will truly change the character of how we govern – from both the macro-economic and the micro-economic point of view – the European Union as such and Member States’ economies in particular.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will be having a deep debate on this issue tomorrow with President Barroso and Vice-President Rehn, so I will not go into further detail now. I would just like to assure all of you that we will soon be presenting you with a list of proposals and a request to fast-track them. Some of them have been mentioned here in this Chamber this afternoon. These are the proposals through which we believe we can guarantee growth and speedily create jobs. They relate to the single market and are oriented towards removing barriers in the market. They are focused on using new technologies, including digital technologies, to create jobs and growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the economic situation, the Commission will come, on 23 November, with a new package, alongside the Annual Growth Survey. It will comprise not only an analysis of the state of the economy in the European Union, but also very clear and concrete country-specific recommendations concerning what the Commission believes should be improved in this or that Member State. Here again, we will need your help to reinforce the message from the European Union and support the measures which, sometimes, can only be taken at national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, we will put forward two other very important proposals in this area which are based on Article 136. One will be a communication on the external representation of the euro area and the other – as promised – will be the Green Paper on stability bonds. We know that we need to have a very thorough look at this proposal, and you know how important that discussion will be.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you referred to the discussion on Treaty change. As you know, the President of the European Council has been asked, in close collaboration with the President of the Commission and the President of the Eurogroup, to explore the possibility of limited Treaty changes in the context of the strengthening of economic governance. An interim report, including a road map, will be presented in December 2011 and should offer the first orientations. As you know, the report should be finalised by March 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are absolutely convinced in the Commission that Treaty change is not a short-term remedy for the crisis and that it has to be seen as part of the wider thrust towards reinforced economic governance. I think what is very important for this Parliament is that we are also absolutely convinced that Parliament should be consulted on this measure. Parliament should be involved in the process of thinking about how to approach this issue, and the Commission will definitely proceed in this manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to programming, I think that this is the first programme on which the European Parliament and the Commission have cooperated so closely. I calculate that we have had more than 80 meetings between the Commissioners and the respective committees. Many of them were devoted to the so-called structured dialogue, so we really see it as a common project.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to Mr Szájer, we are also reflecting on the proposals we heard from the European Parliament. There will be a proposal on the status of the European political parties. We will continue making progress on comitology. As has been said, on the trade area, our work is done. In AGRI we are continuing, and we promise that this process will be completed by 2012. I believe that this will be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you asked about the proposals which we promised to deliver this year. As you know, we promised to deliver 40 strategic initiatives. 23 have already been delivered to the legislator and 11 will be done before the end of the year. Here, I would like to assure Ms Trautmann, Mr Őry and Mr Cercas that both the Posting of Workers Directive and also the Social Services of General Interest Directive will be presented to Parliament in December of this year. In the end, we aim to deliver to you 34 out of 40 promised directives. Clearly, the rest need more elaboration and analysis, but I can assure you that they will be coming very soon next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">To reply to various interventions from the floor, with regard to SMEs, I would like to assure you that every impact assessment now contains a chapter on SMEs and how our policies will influence them and their ability to perform in the single market. We are very much aware of how important it is to reduce the administrative burden and, as was correctly pointed out, a 25% reduction of the administrative burden has already been delivered.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has delivered even more. We have delivered 31% of the proposals, and 6% of them are now in the legislative process. But legislation at European level is one thing; how it is transposed at national level is another. Therefore, we need the good cooperation of the national Member States to actively reduce administrative burdens at national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to Mr Duff, who asked about where we stand on the accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, I would like to briefly assure him that the Commission is committed to speedy accession and that the current draft accession agreement results from technical negotiations with the Council of Europe. We believe that this is a well-balanced compromise text. Therefore, the Commission would be willing to reopen this package only if absolutely necessary, to address the concerns of the two Member States. The Commission and the Presidency are working very hard to reach a common position and to find a possible compromise so that we can conclude this process as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will respond very briefly to all the various interventions on the financial transaction tax. I think that we have to be very fair about this question. What we are looking for is a fair contribution back to society from the financial industry, bearing in mind how much society has helped the financial industry. European governments had to provide EUR 4.6 trillion in credit guarantees alone.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is a fair approach to try to look for additional revenues in the European Union. Should we tax labour? Should we tax consumption? Should we again transfer the burden to the citizens? We in the Commission do not think so. Therefore the legislative process will continue and we believe that, in the end, we will be able to find a good solution. Apart from the revenue side, we also have to look at how healthy the regulatory effect will be, especially when we see what kind of results high-frequency trading can cause. This process will have a positive effect on this as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, on Ms Grässle’s question concerning the Staff Regulations, I am sure that she is well aware that we are going through what I believe will be the last phases of the social dialogue. I have a conciliation meeting with staff unions planned for tomorrow afternoon and we definitely would like to present the proposal for Staff Regulation reforms before the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the enforcement of European law, this is a very important issue and we are taking our powers very seriously. To give just one concrete example, we are taking three Member States to court for failure to transpose the Services Directive. In this case, we are asking for financial penalties as well.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We sense, along with the President of the Commission, how much is at stake in today’s debate, in view of the events taking place outside this Parliament, in the real world which is bewildered and rocked by crisis, youth unemployment, the euro crisis, Greece and Italy, and God forbid that any others should follow. Everyone has expressed their displeasure here today, some more implicitly, others more directly. Some of the regulations promised and needed in light of the crisis have been delayed for an unacceptably long period of time. Perhaps the 2012 programme is not enough. However, the question is: What should we do about the real problems? What should we do about mass youth unemployment? Is centralising the decision a solution or not? Can we launch now the amendment of the Treaty which has had such a difficult path to adoption? I believe that these questions must be answered by actions taken in the coming days, not only in the 2012 programme. I believe that the wisdom and power required are available to provide these responses. I hope that the necessary courage is available too. God’s help be with us.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In your statement on the state of the Union, Mr Barroso, which you made on 28 September this year, you stressed, and I quote: ‘Greece is and will remain a member of the euro area’. In view of recent events in that country, I hope the European Commission is continuing to give strong support to the above commitment and will firmly resist attempts to exclude Greece from the euro area and/or the European Union. In my opinion, the one solution to this crisis situation can only be European consolidation and united action. I hope that this very purpose will be served by the European Financial Stability Fund which is being set up and the European Stability Mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It now depends on the Commission to ensure that these mechanisms are sufficiently strong and flexible to cope with the current and future crises. I would also like to express my support for the creation of Eurobonds, which, in my opinion can play a key role in stabilising the euro and restoring confidence in the common currency. In view of the fact that the introduction of Eurobonds will require changes to the present Treaty on European Union, I trust that the Commission will keep Parliament regularly informed about a future plan of action in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My final remark concerns the financial transaction tax proposed by my political group a year ago now. This is another innovative proposal which could contribute to a reduction in the burden of savings which, unfortunately, is mainly going to affect ordinary citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fi">When are we in Europe actually going to start the debate on the need to implement recovery measures? The only way to respond to the economic crisis is to invest in smart, sustainable and comprehensive growth, and in research and innovation. Comprehensive rescue plans for Europe have already been established three times this year: but when will they be put into effect? Recession-torn Europe needs robust recovery measures to support growth and, as a result, create jobs.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As for the countries in crisis, besides recovery and belt-tightening measures, they need investment and growth, if they are ever to recover. How can we restore confidence to the public and to the markets, when even the Heads of State or Government in Europe cannot agree on clear and credible measures to resolve the crisis?</p>
      <p sl="fi">The people and the markets expect our leaders to be capable of making responsible decisions. Up till now, however, the measures implemented lack both a sense of leadership and responsibility. We need a long-term vision regarding what short of Europe we want. Making economic cooperation part of the European Union is the only long-term solution. Economic integration is something that we have failed to realise fully.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The year 2012 is to be European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations. A strategy for active ageing must not be lacking in the Commission programme. In the coming decades, there will be a sharp rise in the number of older people in all the Member States of the European Union. It is anticipated that by 2050, the number of people over 65 years of age will rise by 70%, while the number of people over 80 will rise by 170%.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Senior citizens, who are becoming an ever larger social group, have relatively low incomes. Many of them belong to the group of the 16% of the European Union’s population who live below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold; they have difficulties in finding work and somewhere to live and have restricted access to basic services, particularly health and social services. According to Poland’s Central Statistical Office, there are about 6.4 million older people living in Poland, who represent around 17% of the country’s population. According to predictions, by 2035, this group will then constitute approximately 27% of society. It is also predicted that on average in the EU, there will be a fall in the number of people of productive age. This creates two main challenges and objectives for the Commission’s work in 2012: adapting health care to the needs of an ageing society and ensuring that health care is available for as long as possible and is as effective as possible.</p>

    <intervention id="2-548-000" speaker_id="28269" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral questions to the Council and the Commission respectively, by Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the climate change conference in Durban (O-000216/2011 - B7-0639/2011), (O-000217/2011 - B7-0640/2011).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In view of the fact that the Durban conference will be held in just a few weeks, the debate on these questions would seem to be particularly important. In accordance with the priorities of the European Parliament and the European Union, this is one of our most important issues, and even at a time of economic difficulties and crisis, we do not want it to disappear from the agenda – we want it to continue to be important and we want to be aware of our objectives in Durban.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-549-000" speaker_id="4262" name="Jo Leinen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Maćkowiak-Pandera, Ms Hedegaard, ladies and gentlemen, this week, the European Parliament is submitting a resolution which includes comprehensive proposals on combating global climate change. Mr President, I know that you are committed to overcoming climate change and it would, of course, be good if you could come with the parliamentary delegation to Durban. However, I understand the constraints you are under here in the House with regard to the 2012 budget. Nevertheless, a strong delegation will be going to Durban ready to exert pressure and to use its lobbying skills, so that the process of combating climate change does not come to a halt and so that we can continue to make progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the sponsors from the five groups who have drawn up this resolution. There was a broad consensus in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety about what should now be done and we had the support of the Committee on Development and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Parliament has clear ideas about what we need to achieve in the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP 17) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
      <p sl="de">We have no time to lose. The extreme weather events in 2011 alone and the melting of the glaciers and icebergs show that climate change is well under way. This is why we need to make substantial progress at the COP 17. Parliament’s goal remains the same: a legally binding instrument for all states in the UNFCCC or a global climate agreement, if you want to call it that. We will not be able to achieve this in Durban, but we need to establish further milestones on the road to a global climate agreement. This is primarily about meeting the promises and the undertakings which were made last year in Cancún. I will only mention the mechanism for technology transfer from rich northern countries to poorer southern ones and the institutions which will put in place the necessary measures to allow us to adapt to climate change.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, there are other open issues which we can hopefully resolve in Durban. One of these concerns closing the gigatonne gap. In Cancún, everyone agreed that we want to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, but the commitments that are already on the table are not sufficient. We will end up with an increase of 3.5 or 4 degrees Celsius, which is much too much, as we all know. Therefore, we need to understand how the gigatonne gap can be closed on the basis of common but differing responsibilities for stabilising the earth’s atmosphere.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in Parliament are of the opinion that greenhouse gas emissions will peak in 2015 and this is a very ambitious goal. However, the scientists are telling us that we have to reach this point during this decade. We know that by 2050, we must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by around 50%, which is a huge task.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Durban, the focus is likely to be on the Kyoto Protocol. We must prevent a gap from occurring between the first commitment period and a further second commitment period. Therefore, we need a solution for the period after 2012 and Parliament is calling on the EU to give its clear support to a second commitment period. We know that we do not have many partners, but they include Switzerland and Norway, together with Australia and New Zealand. I believe that with effective climate change diplomacy, we can achieve a critical mass which will make it worthwhile to implement Kyoto II and, at the same time and most importantly, to force the emerging countries and also the USA to commit to a timetable involving everyone. The idea is that we will succeed in implementing an overarching climate agreement in 2015.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to mention an issue that we are all aware of: the funding for combating global climate change. We hope that we can establish a Green Climate Fund in Durban, but we need to know who will manage it, who can become a member, how it will work and where the funding will come from. Parliament has made a number of suggestions including the income from emissions trading, taxes on aviation and shipping and the financial transaction tax, if it is imposed.</p>
      <p sl="de">I shall be brief. We must not use the economic crisis as an excuse for doing nothing. The message that comes out of Durban must make it clear that we cannot allow climate change to overcome the human race. Instead, the human race must have the determination to overcome climate change. That is the message that the European Parliament is taking to South Africa.</p>

    <intervention id="2-551-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joanna Maćkowiak-Pandera" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, thank you very much for your welcome. There are not quite two weeks left before the climate summit in Durban. This year, the conference is playing a particular role in terms of measures for climate protection, and Poland, as the country which holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, is treating this matter very seriously. We know that in 2012, the commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol comes to an end. Our ambitious task at the Durban climate conference will be to ensure that the world will still want to talk about climate policy and that a certain legally binding mechanism which guarantees climate action will be secured.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the Environment Council in October, there was a difficult discussion in the forum of the Council, but we managed to agree on a single joint position of the European Union on how we intend to conduct these negotiations and how we intend to achieve progress in the negotiations. There are two objectives which we are going to make every effort to achieve. The first of these is a question of encouraging an openness to the Kyoto Protocol. As Mr Leinen has already said, the Kyoto Protocol is currently the only mechanism which binds countries on climate issues, so we must maintain a positive attitude to the Kyoto Protocol, and use both the good and the bad experiences of the Protocol to talk about a legally binding new commitment under the convention. This brings us to our second objective – for the Kyoto Protocol to be a certain transitional form leading to a new, legally binding commitment under which all countries will agree to join the Kyoto mechanism and accept a differentiated but common responsibility for questions related to protection of the environment. These are the ambitious political objectives we are going to pursue at the conference in Durban.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Naturally, besides this, there are measures which arise from the work and from the negotiations. There is, in particular, the question of implementing the Cancún agreements, which means the question of further negotiations related to technology transfer and adaptation to climate change – which is particularly important for the developing countries – and the question related to mitigation, technology transfer and funding. Funding is also going to play a very important role in Durban because it is important for the developing countries. We have made certain decisions and have pledged certain amounts, so opening an institution connected with the Green Fund will be a very important outcome of the Durban Summit, and we hope this will be the case.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The transparency of countries – and here this means the transparency of the European Union – in the area of ‘fast-start’ financing is going to play a very important role. According to the reports we have at our disposal, the European Union is going to distinguish itself concerning this commitment and, in 2012, pledges amounting to over EUR 7 billion will be presented to the developing countries. In this area, it is important that as the European Union, we do, in fact, maintain full transparency – full transparency of the measures we are going to present in Durban.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As the Presidency, we are also currently taking a series of measures related to putting pressure on the world’s large economies for them to want to join with and agree to the European Union’s proposal on what should be done next to achieve a global agreement on climate change. We have been involved in numerous meetings at political level as well as with the negotiators and with experts. We have very good contact with the developing countries and with the African group. Several meetings at ministerial level have already taken place in Africa. As for the outcome of the Durban Summit, we have great hopes concerning China, as this country has recently been showing a very constructive attitude, and we hope we will be able to achieve further progress in the negotiations.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-553-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Connie Hedegaard" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to discuss where we are heading for in Durban. Needless to say, the Commission is trying to do whatever it can through outreach, through bilateral contacts at all levels, through proposing draft texts, suggestions, and by trying to find ways forward to ensure that we make progress in Durban.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know that Durban is not going to deliver what we would like to see in Europe – the internationally binding deal. That is not because of Europe. It is because of others.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Polish Presidency already mentioned many of the issues that we are pursuing like how to close the gap, as Mr Leinen said as his first point. It is extremely important in Durban to figure out how we can close the gap.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are discussing a lot of technicalities, but are we actually reducing emissions? This is what is at stake. We should never forget that this must be the key issue, so I agree with Mr Leinen on making that the first point.</p>
      <p sl="en">Accounting rules, finance, new market-based mechanisms, a lot of things must be implemented that were agreed in Copenhagen and which were agreed in Cancún.</p>
      <p sl="en">But let me use this very limited time to talk a bit more in depth on one of the key issues that was not solved in Cancún last year: the question of the legal form of whatever we can agree in the future. That will, of course, be on the table in Durban.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s goal remains an ambitious, comprehensive, legally binding international framework covering all parties. It is, and it remains, the best way to keep the global temperature increase below 2 °C. And let us be clear: the EU is in favour of the Kyoto Protocol. The EU has taken targets under the Kyoto Protocol. We have not only delivered on these targets; we are actually on a path to overshoot our targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have built our own legislation up to 2020 in line with the Kyoto principles. So when it comes to Kyoto, Europe is not the problem. We are doing, and will continue to do, whatever we can to get as much of the Kyoto acquis and the rules established for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, of course, Europe is willing to take a second commitment period, but, as has already been mentioned, unfortunately not too many are following us there. Japan, Russia, Canada, who used to be members of the Kyoto family, have very clearly stated that they are not going to take a second commitment period.</p>
      <p sl="en">Up till now, the Kyoto family has accounted for around one-third of global emissions. There is the possibility that after Durban, the second commitment period family will account for 15% of global emissions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nonetheless, Europe has said yes. We are open to taking a second commitment period, but because what matters to us is the climate, and because what matters to us are real reductions, we have also attached a condition. We say there are some things with the environmental integrity, AAUs and LULUCF, but we also need to have this put into a context where, together with a second commitment period, we secure the bridge to the future; that others accept we must agree on a road map where other major emitters engage in a broader framework and where Kyoto rules are improved to ensure the environmental integrity.</p>
      <p sl="en">That means we are trying to find middle ground. We are open to this second commitment period, but in the clear road map that we want, we also need to have a timeline. When will other major economies commit? And when will they commit in the same legal form as we do?</p>
      <p sl="en">That is going to be one of the main discussions in Durban.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said, we are not the problem there. We are the ones trying to secure our ambition. And it is fine for Europe to make the bridge to the future, together with Norway, Switzerland and a few others that will take a second commitment period. But it is also a legitimate question for Europe to ask: what is the point in making the bridge to the future if nobody will follow us into that future?</p>
      <p sl="en">If they are not ready now, then we need to know when they are ready. That is why the timeline is a key request for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have spent my time explaining this because I think it is also key that others understand that Europe is ready and that Europe is not the problem. The problem is those who are not moving their position in order to deliver what must be delivered if Durban is not just to be about process, but about really achieving something that can improve the climate.</p>

    <intervention id="2-555-000" speaker_id="1038" name="Karl-Heinz Florenz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Maćkowiak-Pandera, Ms Hedegaard, I am very pleased that you are in the chair today, Mr President.</p>
      <p sl="de">I support this resolution with all the political power available to me and I believe that we have done a good job. However, Ms Hedegaard, as you know, I have been here for a long time and before all the climate conferences, we have shaken hands and said that we want to work together to achieve a specific goal, but afterwards, we have not really understood what actually happened in Copenhagen or in Cancún. Two or three good approaches were proposed in Cancún and we must put them into practice. That goes without saying.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the question that we need to ask is: Why are other countries not able to get along with Europe? I have one very simple example of this. The US President came to Copenhagen and said: ‘No money, no treaty’. Then the Chinese stood up and replied: ‘Mr President, we do not need your money’.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, we need to consider once again whether our approach is the right one. I believe that it is correct, but that we are not yet clear about what lever we should be using. It is obvious that we need a follow-up concept to Kyoto and that we have to develop the long-term cooperation actions (LCA) even further. What conditions should apply to them? When should you say yes to China if China presents you with a modified five-year programme? I have taken the opportunity to say this to Ms Maćkowiak-Pandera. If I were working in a private company, they would be asking me: What is your strategy and who are you working with to achieve your goals? This question is very important in ensuring our lasting success.</p>
      <p sl="de">One decisive development which has taken place in Europe over the last few years will be very helpful to us, and that is the issue of resource policy. I believe that the shortage of resources throughout the world is just as important a problem as CO2 emissions. I also believe, as Mr Leinen has said, that we can have an influence in this area. Therefore, we should be using the issue of the efficiency of resource policy as a lever for finding partners all over the world who are prepared to step onto this innovation staircase and to attempt to introduce more free market instruments to carry industry along with us.</p>
      <p sl="de">The United States and its environmental and climate policies are really not something that we should be happy about. However, US industry has clearly recognised that resource efficiency and efficiency policies are very helpful in winning international contracts. When we in Europe rightly establish an aviation emissions trading system, the US has no choice but to build the necessary jet engines, which they then sell all over the world. We are influencing this policy and we should continue to do so in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same applies to China. The chair of the Chinese environment committee said to me: ‘Karl-Heinz, we are the most important committee in the world. Do you really imagine that we are subject to any authority other than the Chinese people who evaluate our programmes?’ They will not do that, Ms Hedegaard, and therefore we need another more modern lever to allow us to exert our influence here. I would like to give you every encouragement in this area, because some areas of European industry are on the brink of collapse. No one can deny that.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we focus on the measures that you have implemented in a range of legislation, if we move towards renewable energy and sustainability and force our industries to make use of the very latest technologies, I am sure that we will give this policy an additional impetus. That is what I would like to encourage you to do. Otherwise, you can work on the assumption that I am very happy to vote in favour of our resolution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the International Energy Agency just recently published a report saying that the developed countries of this world, the industrialised countries, have about five years to change fundamentally the way they produce energy and the way they consume energy in order for us to stay below a two degree increase in temperature.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, if we do not stay below two degrees, we know what will happen. This is when the self-enhancing effect sets in, when it gets out of control and catastrophe happens. Then, if we look at what has actually now been pledged by the same countries, the countries that need to change fundamentally within five years, it is unfortunately very unsatisfactory. We see a situation now where the pledges are about half of what we need in order to reach our target. We see a situation in which the pledges of the major countries, the developed countries, are not even close to where we need them to be.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why Durban is so important, why we are in so much of a hurry to create real results. We all know that we will not get a full legally binding agreement with regard to mitigation in Durban that will solve these problems, but we know also that we have possibilities to pursue targets that are ambitious nonetheless – targets that will get us closer to our final goal. This is why I think it is extremely important when the Commissioner states that the EU should push for legally binding agreements under certain terms.</p>
      <p sl="en">We think that the Kyoto Protocol is a good idea and that the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol could be a way forward but only if, first of all, it has environmental integrity and, second, it is combined with a road map for emerging economies, especially for when they will start to reduce their emissions. This is not only about mitigation. We also need to discuss adaptation, because even if we do succeed in having the mitigation targets we want, we know that the world will experience climate change and we know that the poorest countries of this world, in particular, will have difficulties adapting to this.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why we have a moral obligation to help them financially; we have a moral obligation in the industrial countries to find money so that they can have capacity building and so that they can have the necessary means to adapt to these situations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Ms Maćkowiak-Pandera, Commissioner, the Durban conference is indeed an important one in what is a very difficult context.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The worsening of the climate situation is increasingly obvious and emissions have never been as high as last year. Cancún was a relative success but since then, nothing has happened in practical terms. Finally, thirdly, it is true that today, Europe is in economic and financial difficulty and that what is also at stake in Durban is its geopolitical and geostrategic position.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we want to move forward in Cancún, I believe we must firstly be extremely firm about our own situation. We committed ourselves to a ‘Green Fund’. This Green Fund really must make progress, on the legal issues, the issues of governance and everything else of course, but the most important is to be able to find ways of financing this Green Fund. Now on this issue, we have made no progress, or very little.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We could talk about innovative financing until we are blue in the face, but what really matters is where this financing comes from. A tax on financial transactions, a carbon tax, a tax on sea and air travel? It might be a combination of these, I do not know, but in any case, what is essential is to be specific and show the countries of the South that this is indeed not virtual but for real.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will make exactly the same comment with regard to binding commitments. Yes, we need a Kyoto II. Yes, it is true that a Kyoto II limited to Europe would certainly be very good as far as ethics and industry are concerned, for I share Mr Florenz’s point of view on the fact that we need to give a boost to our industry in the area of renewable energy and energy efficiency. However, I am not sure that this would be enough to make a difference globally. How, then, can we effectively, by deed and not only by word, convince the countries of the South –which are the first to suffer from climate change, because let us not forget that the first to suffer from climate change are the poorest countries, and within the rich countries the poorest among us – that we must move forward?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we all know that it was primarily the United Nations that was saved in Cancún and not the climate. Therefore, the climate ought to be at the top of the agenda in Durban this time around. The most important thing we have internationally is the Kyoto Protocol. Therefore, if anything very clearly needs to be done – because the Kyoto Protocol will expire at the end of next year – if anything is important, then it is continuing with the Kyoto Protocol and doing so straightway. Instead of attaching any strings to that, Europe should simply say: we are in favour of the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You said, Ms Hedegaard, that Europe is not the problem, but why are we then still not quite clear about what rules apply for the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol? What will happen to all the hot air? If we really want to make a difference, we need to ensure that we bring no hot air from the first to the second commitment period. I am also addressing this to the Polish Presidency; I hope that it will make out a case to ensure that none of that hot air is brought to the next Kyoto period. That was my first point.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The second crucial point is, indeed, a clear timeframe for a binding target in 2015. We need to ensure that, in 2015, there is a binding target, the rules for which have been decided upon by more countries than just the EU. China is the key country in this respect. We all know that we looked to the US for too long in Copenhagen. This time around, though, the lynchpin will be China. If you look now at what China is doing, not just in terms of investment in renewable energy, but also with regard to energy saving, then China is the country with which we jointly, as Europe, should be making deals. Let us, therefore, just leave the US out of the picture, because we should not expect anything from the US at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, let me turn to the EU’s leading role. You said: Europe is leading the way. However, we seem to be leading less and less. Australia already has plans to make taxes on carbon higher than those in Europe. In Japan, they have a more energy-efficient society. Europe should really ensure that we maintain that leadership and that also means that our own ambitions, our own climate ambitions, need to be markedly increased. Our reduction target therefore ought to be more than just that 20% with which we have been complying for years and which is easy for us to achieve. We need higher levels of ambition.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I think we are all being less than honest with one another here. As a participant in several climate conferences in recent years, I am becoming very sceptical. We are always saying that we have to reach a global agreement, and without a global agreement, measures at European level make no sense. If you look at the emissions data today, they are numbers that primary school children could understand. What we have now done ahead of Durban and after Cancún is another example of unilateral commitments. We claim that Cancún was a success. Cancún was saved from failure and tragedy at the last moment. As the fellow Member said, the UN was close to collapse. We cannot consider this a success. If we again offer unilateral decarbonisation of the EU in our declaration, if we offer unilateral commitments that have no global impact, and if we offer to include a tax on financial transactions which does not even exist yet, then I am afraid I will be unable to sign this document, and I am also withdrawing from signing this document on behalf of the ECR Group. They will, of course, wish our delegation all success, but I am a sceptic, and I must emphasise that an agreement will not be achieved.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, before the negotiations in Durban, the EU must indicate that we will be committed to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. It must be a strong second commitment, both in its aims and its legal version.</p>
      <p sl="ga">It is clear that the aim is an ambitious global resolution. The EU can help achieve that and can display leadership without regard for the stance of other people. In Durban, we must close the gigatonne gap between current levels of ambition and the levels that are necessary according to science. It will also be crucially important that there is climate funding in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In addition to combating the big political issue surrounding the framework on the way forward, the negotiations in Durban must taken certain steps to implement the Cancún agreements. As regards the issue of funding, the summit in Durban must provide a path for the scaling up of climate funding for the period 2013-2020 and provide appropriate long-term funding to support a low carbon future for developing countries so that they do not go down the same dirty path of development. Also, it must help developing countries deal with the damage that has already been caused.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now known that some of the world’s great economies have already declared that they will not be signing a second Kyoto agreement. The European Council of 23 October, taking note of this stalemate in negotiations, declared that the European Union will be prepared to sign a Kyoto 2 only as part of a transition towards a global climate treaty which establishes a schedule and timeframe for all countries. Commissioner Hedegaard has led us to understand that proceeding unilaterally would be a strategic error.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nevertheless, Parliament continues undaunted, living in a utopia and asking, with the umpteenth resolution which is detached from any sense of reality, that the European Union undertakes to disregard a unilateral reduction of emissions of over 20%. What exactly is the point of Parliament’s mission to Durban, considering that it has no negotiating role, all the more thanks to this resolution which threatens to throw out this piece of scrap paper?

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the climate is soon to be discussed in South Africa during the UN conference on climate change. Great! Perhaps that will be an opportunity to finally do something about improving the political and social climate in South Africa, which could be said to be terrible under the current ANC apartheid regime.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Improvements to this are needed in every area. The fight against the huge level of unemployment and lack of prospects facing young people, the fight against the terrible criminality that is past bearing, the tracing and prosecuting of black radicals who murder farmers on their own land, also known as ‘farm murders’, the fight to preserve Afrikaans, the fight against the ANC subordinating its own population, because discrimination based on skin colour is a reality again.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) therefore strongly supports climate change in South Africa, but these are matters which will definitely not be discussed at this conference. Unfortunately, they will be talking again about the supposed climate change. A theory adhered to by only a few fervent believers. I have the firm impression that global interest in this issue is declining. Even I was urged on a number of occasions to please join the flight to South Africa. Besides, the IPCC itself finally now appears to have realised that there is hardly any global warming to speak of. Let me give you a quotation from the draft report for Durban: ‘The uncertainty about possible changes in climate extremes in the coming decades is quite high, because signals of climate change appear to be quite small compared to natural climate changes’. If the IPCC itself is already openly expressing doubts about the usefulness of Durban, why on earth are members of the European Parliament still going to the conference? Why are we actually still spending our taxpayers’ money on this? The PVV will therefore not be going to Durban. Baie dankie.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Ms Maćkowiak-Pandera, Ms Hedegaard, the climate issue can be interpreted in different ways. Today, we are discussing meteorological factors and I believe that when we go to Durban, it is important for us to be aware of the circumstances we find ourselves in. We have committed to decarbonising the world economy by 2050 at the latest. At the same time, we are in the midst of the most serious economic crisis of recent decades. This means that we need to convert our economy without being able to rely significantly on public subsidies and, most importantly, without being able to change the international pricing structure for major raw materials, in particular, energy sources, because the major polluters, such as China and the US, have already indicated that they are not prepared to do this. The result is, of course, that Europe is facing particularly serious challenges and I believe that when we go to Durban, we should break our activities down into what we can do here to set a good example and what we can do externally.</p>
      <p sl="de">Internally, I have to say that I am a little disappointed by the lack of an ambitious approach to the problems concerning water, including too much water, too little water, floods and droughts. The Commission could take more action in this area. We should play a more decisive role with regard to F-gas emissions – I am hoping that we will see an ambitious proposal being produced next year in particular – and the mainstreaming of the common agricultural policy and regional policy. I hope, Ms Hedegaard, that you will be successful in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">Externally, I think we should work towards the goals decided on in Cancún. With regard to Kyoto II, we need better quality projects to allow us to get where we want to go, in other words, to achieve these objectives.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, there was a window of opportunity at the climate conference in Copenhagen, as several speakers here have already mentioned. This window was closed by the confidence gap that developed between the richest countries and the poorest and fastest-growing countries. What are we going to do about this in Durban? Well, firstly, it is vital to get the financing of the adaptation measures for the period 2013 to 2020 in place if we are to be able to close this confidence gap. Quite simply, we need to keep our promises. Otherwise, no changes and no results will be possible.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our second task must be the comprehensive climate agreement post 2012. In this regard, while still being one of the world’s strongest and richest regions and despite the lack of trust and the objections that have been raised here in the debate, we really need to show that we are taking a leading role. Without leadership, no one will follow.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Several people have mentioned the economic crisis. This is going to affect us for a long time, but should it mean that we give up on all of our other social development and other political ambitions? If that is the case, we can discontinue this Parliament. The truth is that if global warming continues the way it has been going for a while now, it will affect us not only during a period of crisis, but forever.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the resolution we are going to approve tomorrow urges the parties to ensure the conclusion of a comprehensive, international, fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement but, as has already been said, that is not going to happen. A triumph of hope over reality. And that is a pity because global warming emissions rose by 6% last year. The Barclay study, funded by arch-climate change sceptics, has just concluded that in practice, the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were right all along and temperatures are indeed growing as predicted.</p>
      <p sl="en">But just when we need action, we are going to get Kyoto II, which is going to be weaker than Kyoto I, and 85% of the world’s emissions are not going to be covered by it. It is hard to justify the way in which the UN process has worked, despite the incremental gains that have been made.</p>
      <p sl="en">Global warming is being forced ahead by population growth and demand for energy by all those extra people: 200 000 extra people on the planet every day. It is clear that the nations of the world do not care very much about the more vulnerable ones, about protecting those at most risk from climate change, or indeed about passing on the costs of dealing with climate change to future generations, but maybe self-interest will start to prevail.</p>
      <p sl="en">We look at the predictions of the International Energy Agency, of oil prices within five years going up to USD 150 a barrel as a standard. That, I think, is double what the Commission was predicting when it carried out impact assessments for the climate change package just a few years ago. Perhaps also it will be driven by the self-interest of fear: fear of being left behind. No country is changing its energy mix faster than China; no country is trying to move away from coal, develop global warming, improve its energy efficiency, develop an emissions trading scheme more than China. There are going to be economic winners, and there are going to be economic losers on this planet. We need to make sure we are on the side of the winners.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate has already made reference to the recent warning by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that the window of opportunity to keep climate change below two degrees will close in a few years’ time. When such a conservative establishment as the IEA gives so serious a warning, it really needs to be taken seriously.</p>
      <p sl="fi">All countries need to step up their measures to combat climate change and immediately end subsidies for fossil fuels, which, according to the IEA, are six times greater than those for renewable energy. One key issue in climate talks is the financing of measures to combat climate change in developing countries. The EU should not approach the subject merely as a pawn in the negotiations. It is in our own interests that the measures to cut emissions, for which this funding is needed, actually exist, which is to say, both those that the developing countries themselves take to cut emissions and also their adaptation measures.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU should increase its international climate funds to EUR 30 billion by the end of the decade. The EU should also do all it can to reach an agreement on innovative financing methods. That is also in the interests of the developing countries, because a financial transaction tax and an air and shipping tax are much more reliable sources of funding.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for being here this evening. Tomorrow, the European Parliament will vote ambitiously on a resolution on the climate change conference in Durban. The EU is currently responsible for around 11% of global emissions. Who is responsible for the remaining 89%? When will we have binding commitments from other parts of the world to carry out the same reductions as the EU in order to achieve a 2 °C reduction?</p>
      <p sl="da">Having said that, I unfortunately have to say that I cannot support the joint resolution for three reasons. The resolution seeks the complete severance from fossil fuels by 2050. I consider this to be unrealistic at a global level. The resolution proposes to change from unanimity to a qualified majority as the future model for decision making in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This would involve the surrender of a significant degree of sovereignty. I do not see this as a realistic solution either. Thirdly, the resolution proposes the introduction of an international financial transaction tax. Here, we are mixing a controversial financial policy into the climate debate. As I see it, this may jeopardise a positive outcome of the conference. I do not want to stand in the way of the EU speaking with one voice in the negotiations in Durban. I will therefore abstain in the vote tomorrow.</p>

It was cooler in the Little Ice Age in the early 19th century. We also know there has been no significant change in climate over the last 6 000 years and we also know that most scientific organisations have confirmed that there has been no significant statistical global warming in the last 15 years?

With the climate summit coming up, I would like to affirm our support for the key message which emerged from the G8 and G20 in advance of the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP 17), namely, that the conclusions of the summit should be balanced, fair and credible, while at the same time maintaining and strengthening the multilateral rules-based response to climate change.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully support the need to build on the foundations of last year’s Cancún agreements, particularly the full realisation of the Green Climate Fund which, of course, is crucial to many potential outcomes in Durban. With such a firm working basis ahead of negotiations, it is therefore vital that the latest round of talks is not encumbered by unrealistic, unworkable and unaffordable wish lists. Yet that is precisely what this Parliament will present in Durban with the resolution which was recently adopted in the Environment Committee.

In the transition to a low carbon society, sustainable technologies will play a key role. Therefore, on a European and global scale, we must invest more in the research, innovation and establishment of new technologies. A binding agreement on the technological mechanisms and networks needed to enable technology sharing must be reached in Cancún as soon as possible. In a time of financial crisis it is difficult, but we must also make provisions for corresponding investment programmes. In the EU, we have already adopted a climate-energy legislative package and also pledged financial assistance to developing countries. However, the EU cannot stop global warming on its own. We will only see results if the rest of the world acts with us. We not only wish to strike a balance between the environment, security and the economy, but also hope to share responsibility between the EU and the rest of the world and, in this context, I strongly agree with the Commissioner about building a bridge, with conditions and timelines. These measures will prevent the transfer of pollution outside the EU and carbon leakage. We must avoid importing into the EU products that are competitively priced due to poor environmental standards. So we must also look at what is happening on our borders. We must consider the possibility of carbon leakage. During climate negotiations, the EU should also stress that a healthy environment is one of the fundamental human rights. Rights that should be guaranteed by every country in the world.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, in reality, the figures tell us that Europe alone is not capable of accommodating the effects of climate change. According to the data, 33.5 billion tonnes of CO2 were emitted into the atmosphere in 2010 – an increase of 5.9% on the year before. We know that the main emitters are the United States and China. We also know that China is the largest producer of CO2 and that its economy is, to a very large degree, based on energy generated by carbon, which produces one-fifth of China’s energy, and that a large part of China’s domestic heating relies on carbon.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my opinion, all this tells us that we must change our approach. Copenhagen was cloaked in great but delusive expectations, whereas Cancún, when it became more concrete, produced some results. I believe that today, we should aim towards a new climate strategy which truly focuses on research, on renewable energy sources and on energy efficiency, whose potential has been little tapped into in the past.

When President Obama was elected, we were somewhat confident but then, unfortunately, the House of Representatives is now climate-sceptical. So, in this context, it is no longer ‘Yes we can’ but ‘No we won’t’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then there is China: we hear a lot about China’s investment in a green economy, but this is simply to invade the international market. Meanwhile, China is building coal plants every week.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, let us be innovative, let us invest, for if we do not, I greatly fear that broke and frustrated European citizens will be under no illusions about preparing for this new deadline.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, firstly, I would like to offer my support to the ambitious objectives of the resolution that will be voted on tomorrow, in particular, with this desire to limit the temperature rise to two degrees, but also to have a policy that will ensure that these greenhouse gas emissions do not exceed 20%.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, your desire, Ms Hedegaard, is to have a proactive approach at Durban, as you have demonstrated since becoming European Commissioner, to enable the continuity of the Kyoto agreement despite the difficulties you yourself mentioned in your speech this afternoon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, leaving aside this proactive approach, I would like to put a number of questions to you: how are you going to implement this negotiation strategy so that the various financial commitments taken at Copenhagen are enforced, the USD 30 billion from 2010 to 2012, but also at Cancún, the USD 100 billion, the Green Fund that you mentioned with a view to helping developing countries? What governance do you intend to promote for the multilateral management of these funds, considering the large number of beneficiaries and donors? Finally, what do you intend to do to ensure that these committed funds are not taken from current development aid?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution we have drafted this year is much better than the one we presented last year. Last year, we set ourselves much more ambitious objectives. We thought that having set these objectives, everyone would follow our lead. Unfortunately, they turned out to be too much for many countries. From a practical point of view, we had a big problem with presenting our resolution in such a form. Therefore, at the moment, the most important matter and the most important priority is that in the climate negotiations, we agree on the future of the Kyoto Protocol, which is coming to an end, and that we specify conditions which it will be possible for other countries to meet.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, I would not like to be one of those Europeans who have the kind of belief we see being expressed by the Chinese or the Americans: ‘It’s the economy, stupid’. We should adopt balanced objectives and present our proposals in a way which will mean that others want to act upon them together with us. We created the Green Fund to support developing economies. We also have to say that by ‘developing economies’, we do not mean China or Brazil, because they have already made considerable advances. The Green Fund has resources which are to be used to support those economies which really are the poorest. Thank you very much.</p>

I agree with Mr Florenz and those who say that we must chiefly focus on energy efficiency, the technological development of renewable energy sources and our cooperation with China, the US and others. However, the fate of global emission allowance trading is also important, in particular for the new Member States, because they have considerable climate assets. It is obvious that these climate assets cannot be fully carried over, but it would be very good to find a fitting solution to this, as the new Member States of the EU have made numerous sacrifices and have lost a great deal of jobs in contributing to climate protection.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, one year on from the Cancún climate change conference, and two years since that of Copenhagen, numerous unanswered questions, deadlocks and obstacles remain. For our part, we are still convinced that the difficulties and contradictions that mark these conferences stem, in large measure, from the incomprehension of the main industrial powers – including the European powers too, naturally – of the true and deeper meaning of the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Moreover, these powers almost always seem more interested in making use of the climate as a lucrative business opportunity, or in containing potential or real competitors, than in actually achieving real levels of emissions reduction, which would necessarily involve calling into question the model of economic and social organisation currently dominant at global level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why we insist on the need for serious debate on the perversity of market instruments, on the carbon market, and on flexibility instruments like the clean development mechanism.</p>

It is all very well that the European Union is at the forefront of this fight, but let us admit, other than setting a good example, little is achieved through Slovenia, Estonia or Hungary, for that matter, adhering to strict climate protection rules. After all, it is not the European Union where most of the shortcomings are found; a climate protection minimum should be set in Durban and in some way, through diplomatic means, the United States, China and India should be compelled to at least take decisive steps in the protection against climate change.</p>

      <p sl="sk">We must also come out clearly in support of continuing the Kyoto Protocol, as its effectiveness will expire at the end of next year. This is an absolutely clear demand and a wholly unambiguous indicator of the success or failure of the Durban Summit. If the Kyoto Protocol does not continue after 2012, Durban will go down in history as the scene of the destruction of global efforts to bring climate change under control. At the same time, I firmly believe that this would be a sorry testimony to the declining influence of the EU in this area.

      <p sl="ro">In 2010, carbon dioxide emissions rose by 5% globally due to the rise in productivity of the emerging economies. This is why, until a global agreement comes into force on this, we must focus on short- and medium-term measures to be able to achieve the proposed objectives by 2020.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, everyone I have heard taking the floor here today has expressed the wish that we must continue to pursue the goal of getting an international deal done. Everyone I have heard here today shares the common frustration – which is, of course, also my frustration and I think everybody’s frustration in Europe – at the lack of speed in progress. It is not that there is no progress. There is, but it is not as speedy as the urgency of the matter should tell us that it ought to be.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also understand that everyone here agrees that, in order to have an internationally global deal that effectively combats climate change, we need all the major emitters, all the major economies, to be part of the solution. When we agree about all this, the next question for all of us will be how do we then proceed best in order to get them into the global deal we want?</p>
      <p sl="en">I heard one Member here say that we should encourage them. I agree, but I think that we have encouraged them for some years now and so far not with enough success. Some of them simply are not ready to commit. What choice does that leave us with? We could, of course, give up on them. I do not feel much appetite for that here. So instead we will have to find other ways to achieve the goal.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have heard some here say that we should drop these conditions and just take a second commitment period, no matter what. My question is: try to think whether that will increase or weaken the pressure on those that we want to push forward? That is the key question. I could also put it this way. Say that we now, today, from Europe announced that, without any conditions attached, we would just take a second commitment period. Do you think that those other major emitters that we want to bring into a legally binding global system would then do more? Or, on the contrary, would they lean back and relax and say, ‘Oh, it is fine. Europe is taking a second commitment period up to 2020 or whatever, so now we can relax. Let us discuss it again at the COPs in 2018, 2019 or whenever’?</p>
      <p sl="en">That is the challenge here. I think that is why we tried to – it would be easy for Europe just to say we could take a second commitment period – but it would not bring others to move their position. I must say that, from a lot of outreach activities in recent months, I feel that a lot of countries – a lot of developing countries, a lot of the most vulnerable countries, the least developed countries, Pacific island states – understand what Europe is trying to do is increase pressure on others to engage.</p>
      <p sl="en">Dan Jørgensen referred to the World Energy Outlook and that it said that we have only five or six years left. That is, of course, why we cannot afford a conference in Durban where, when we leave for home, it seems that we got something good for the process but we did nothing that could reduce emissions. We must always bear in mind that reducing emissions is the important thing. That is why we tried to use whatever we have to give leverage to the negotiations in order to try to push others in our direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have two final points. Corinne Lepage and Mr Pargneaux asked about funding. The EU delivered fast-start funding last year and I am glad to say that in the Ecofin last Monday, it was clear that we are now also delivering this year. Mr Pargneaux asked about governance. There, I am also glad that the transitional committee that should prepare Green Climate Fund governance has agreed, with the exception of Saudi Arabia and the US, to ask the COP 17 to adopt a governance structure for the Green Climate Fund. I really hope we can make that operational in Durban.</p>
      <p sl="en">I must also say one more thing on funding. I can feel now when we come out – whether it is Ethiopia and Africa, or it is 14 Heads of State at the Pacific Island Forum or wherever it is – that they are starting to explicitly thank the EU because they can see that our fast-start finance money is starting to work out in the field. That is what we need, and it is also what is very important that the Member States deliver on.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I will reiterate that a critical way for the EU to convince its partners is by also showing leadership at home, as several of you have mentioned. Chris Davies and Ms del Castillo also mentioned energy efficiency. International negotiations are important – we all know why – but domestic ambition is also important. I agree, and the Commission is also in full agreement, that we could take it much further in Europe if we were actually addressing energy efficiency much more systematically. Even better, it would also contribute to job creation and make us much more competitive if we actually did that.</p>
      <p sl="en">You will know that the Commission has made proposals here. I really hope that Parliament can help the Commission keep the ambition level up here. Finally, I am very much looking forward to working with the EP delegation in Durban and with the Presidency, all of us ensuring that Europe speaks with one voice and hopefully together, we can achieve progress in Durban – progress that does not only look like progress when it comes to the process, but actually is progress also when it comes to taking care of the interest of actually combating climate change.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to thank everyone for what they have said, because their contributions to the debate are very important to us. This discussion is important. Cooperation with the European Parliament, which will also be represented in Durban, is important because we need to speak with one voice and present the position of the European Union together.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to refer to something which has been said many times today and to say a few words about what is a certain negative evaluation of the state of the negotiations and, therefore, of the outcome we can achieve. Broadly speaking, the situation is serious: the climate is changing, emissions are rising, Europe is experiencing a financial crisis. However, I cannot imagine saying on behalf of the Presidency that we are going to Durban thinking that whatever happens, there is nothing we can achieve. That would be a bizarre situation, and I do not know how I would justify such an approach in Poland and here before you all. I would like to give an assurance that we are still going with the hope that we will reach agreement on key matters. As for those key matters, the route which I personally see for the negotiations with the countries represented in Durban is firstly to make specific progress on the Cancún agreements. This is the first basic point; it also includes funding, which is very important for making progress in the negotiations. The second matter, which you have underscored repeatedly here, is a clear signal concerning the Kyoto Protocol. The European Union is interested in talking about another commitment period. It is extremely important to maintain this mechanism, and we will make every effort to do so. The third and perhaps most important element is a new legally binding agreement, which will include all the emitting countries with which we will be able to sit around the negotiating table and look at everything that has happened with the Kyoto Protocol. This will allow evaluation of the situation 20 years after the Protocol was negotiated. The situation has changed, and we can see that there are countries which currently have a variety of possibilities for reduction, but there are also countries which need adaptation funding. It will certainly be very important in Durban to achieve a good balance between mitigation and adaptation measures; not forgetting, either, what there is for us to do in Europe, and this also means adaptation to climate change. In the context of what is going to happen in the future, Mr Florenz made an important comment on the question of increasingly limited natural resources. We need to have a broad perspective on this problem, and not look at it as just a question of climate, but as an issue of ecosystems and their relations with water and waste.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Every day, there are more and more of us in the world while there are fewer resources and we continue to consume more. Therefore, we certainly do need to take action in the next one or two years. It is important to take urgent action in Europe to reduce the consumption of natural resources – and I am counting here on good cooperation with the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I am deeply disappointed that over the last two years, EU climate policy has been more like a dialogue among deaf people than cooperation between parties understanding and capable of accepting each other’s interests. In the Council, some of the old Member States selfishly and in a very short-sighted way refuse to accept the arguments made by the new Member States from Eastern Europe in seeking to protect their Kyoto quota surplus, which constitutes national assets to them. Yet when it comes to flaunting the EU’s excellent results in reducing emissions before global negotiating partners, the excellent record of the new Member States in overachieving their Kyoto commitments comes in handy even for them. What is all this still about? It is about the fact that the EU 15 would not have been able to fulfil their Kyoto commitments without the considerable emission reductions of the new Member States, including Hungary. It is about this reduction largely being a consequence of the collapse of the heavy industries of the former socialist countries, the price of which we paid in the form of the severe social and economic crisis that emerged in the 1990s. Meanwhile, however, several old Member States were merrily developing their industries and increasing their carbon emissions. Why is it that nobody wishes to penalise them? Why this double standard? In the light of this Council approach, I am glad that the European Parliament at least managed to openly stand up for the continuation of the Kyoto regime and for a new, legally binding commitment period. Although the resolution in itself does not guarantee that the quota surplus of Eastern European countries will be fully carried over, I definitely consider it a welcome step that should be followed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Fossil fuels are still subsidised all over the world to the tune of USD 409 billion each year. Part of this funding comes from sources which should be used to combat climate change. Coal is the fossil fuel which is most harmful to the climate. However, new coal-fired power stations are constantly being built, particularly in China and India. International funding for combating climate change offers a paradoxical incentive. The argument goes that, without the subsidies, power stations with even higher levels of emissions would have to be built. In this way, Chinese companies are earning millions in subsidies. The same game is being played with funding for disposing of refrigerants that are harmful to the climate. This continued until it became obvious that production was being increased in China specifically to obtain subsidies. Any country that wants to be a global player must take responsibility for the environment. Subsidies that clearly fail to achieve the desired objective must be stopped. We must not allow Europe to impose restrictions on its own industry and, at the same time, to help finance coal-fired power stations in China and India.</p>

We failed to persuade them, and there are no particular chances either of this happening at the Durban conference. Many analysts are predicting another failure there.</p>
      <p sl="bg">According to the latest forecasts, if current emission levels are maintained and no suitable measures are taken, the threshold will be surpassed for limiting warming to 2 ˚С already during this decade.

      <p sl="pl">The European Union is the only international organisation which, at a time of crisis, wants to go against the grain and be a leader in the fight against climate change. We have set ourselves further targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions, and in so doing we are strangling our own industry. The text of the resolution presented for the forthcoming climate summit in Durban is heading in a similar direction. We have decided that we must be the leader, when the whole world is going in a different direction. So I am opposed to the proposals to increase targets for reductions in CO2 emissions and to the ideas for levying ecological taxes on energy-intensive branches of industry in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be borne in mind that in the last year, Canada has radically increased its emissions by 25%, while China, which is dramatically developing its industry, has recorded an increase of 10%, India one of over 8% and the US one of around 4%. Even our nearest Eastern neighbour, Ukraine, is planning to increase its use of coal for power generation from 22% to 33% by 2030, which will automatically be reflected in an increase in CO2 emissions. There have already been enough concessions on greenhouse gas emission reductions. All the more so because for some time, the Commission has not been able to present an impact analysis of the changes which are being introduced in the heavy industry and power generation sectors in Europe. The development of the green energy sector which has been presented here seems just a poor substitute. In Durban, it is our partners who must make the next move – we can wait for them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am honoured to be present here today before this Parliament to participate in this debate on the presentation of the European Court of Auditors’ annual report on the implementation of the 2010 European Union budget, which I already presented last week to the Committee on Budgetary Control of this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">As in previous years, the Court’s annual report mainly covers the reliability of the 2010 European Union accounts and the regularity of transactions underlying them. This year, it also includes a chapter on the results of the European Union’s spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the reliability of the European Union accounts, the Court concludes that the 2010 accounts present fairly the financial position of the European Union and the results of its operations and cash flows at the year end. Nevertheless, there remains scope to improve the quality of financial reporting and the underlying information systems – not least with respect to financial engineering instruments in relation to which the Court considers that the Commission must revisit the relevant accounting rule and take further action to ensure that the necessary information is available from Member States to improve the Commission’s supervision of those financial instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards regularity of revenue and expenditure, revenue and commitments underlying the accounts for the year ending 31 December 2010 are legal and regular in all material respects. In contrast, the payments underlying the accounts were affected by material error, with an estimated error rate of 3.7% for the European Union spending as a whole. It should be noted that this is not an estimate of fraud, as there are many reasons why errors may occur. Overall, control systems were found to be only partially effective in ensuring the regularity of payments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cohesion, energy and transport was the most error prone group of policy areas of European Union spending. After falling in previous years, the estimated error rate in 2010 was higher than in 2009, leading to an increase in the estimated error rate for payments as a whole compared to 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">A relatively small number of wholly ineligible projects and serious breaches of European Union and national procurement rules accounted for much of the error found. There continues to be room for improving Member States’ correction mechanisms and audit activities, not least because some of the errors found could have been detected or corrected by Member States on the basis of available information before payments were made.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the other groups of policy areas, the audit results were relatively stable. For agriculture and natural resources, the estimated error rate was 2.3%, slightly above the materiality threshold and systems were partially effective. Direct payments covered by the Integrated Administrative Control System, which accounted for almost EUR 40 billion of the EUR 57 billion spent, were found to be free from material error, but spending on rural development remains prone to error.</p>
      <p sl="en">For research and other internal policies and external aid, development and enlargement, the Court concluded that payments were not materially affected by error, although systems remained only partially effective and there was a significant risk of error for interim and final payments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, for administrative and other expenditure, the Court concluded that it was not affected by material error and that systems were effective as in previous years.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission provides its own assessments of the capacity of internal control systems to ensure the regularity of spending in the annual activity reports of the Directorates-General and in its Synthesis report. In those reports, the Commission includes a number of reservations highlighting areas of risk. However, the Court finds that the scope and scale of those reservations made for the 2010 financial year should have been greater in several areas, including in cohesion, where the Court considers that the Commission’s approach may lead to an underestimation of the amounts at risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">The annual activity reports of the Directorates-General also provide a self-assessment of performance, including the results achieved from European Union spending. This year, for the first time, the Court presents the results of its review of the performance reporting on three Directorates-General responsible for much EU spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Court recommends that the Commission puts more focus on performance in Annual Activity Reports, including on economy and efficiency, and that it sets appropriate targets for assessing progress towards achieving multiannual objectives. In addition, the Court makes recommendations in areas of shared management for improving the definition of objectives and indicators and the monitoring of progress and results based on the main performance audit results in the Court’s Special Reports.</p>
      <p sl="en">That completes my summary of the main points in the annual report for the 2010 financial year. I believe this year’s annual report confirms the main message of previous years. After many years of incremental improvements in systems, there remain significant risks to the regularity of payments and scope for improving the results obtained from European Union spending. The proposals for sectoral legislation governing spending after 2013 provide an opportunity to address those risks by reforming legislative frameworks and redesigning control systems. Reforms should focus on improving both regularity of the performance while also reducing the costs of control and ensuring adequate accountability. In addition, there have been a number of significant developments in European Union economic governance that risk giving rise to gaps in public accountability and public audit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last month, the Heads of the European Union Supreme Audit Institutions and the European Court of Auditors expressed their concerns on this matter and they called for the principles of transparency, accountability and public audit to be respected when public funds are at stake. The establishment of the European Stability Mechanism was identified as an opportunity to apply these principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">Promoting transparency and accountability is a responsibility shared by all institutions. It is crucial now, when the pressure on public finances is high, the importance of the European Union meeting its objectives is great, and the need to build citizens’ trust in the European Union and its institutions is acute. I trust that the annual report I have had the honour to present to you today will provide the European Parliament with a sound basis for playing its role in ensuring accountability in respect of the European Union funds for the 2010 financial year.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, President Caldeira, honourable Members of the Parliament and of the Court of Auditors, the key messages outlined by President Caldeira demonstrate that over the years, we have made progress in improving the financial management of the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">For 2010, the accounts are clean; all commitments and revenues as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards payments, the overall level of quantifiable errors found by the Court is 3.7%. For internal policies, external action and administration, the level of quantifiable errors is below the materiality threshold of 2%.</p>
      <p sl="en">Agriculture is fairly stable with a 2.3% level of quantifiable errors. Moreover, the Court says that for 2010, direct aid – about EUR 400 billion paid to millions of farmers – is free from material error.</p>
      <p sl="en">But some other policy errors and, in particular, cohesion, still deserve serious efforts. Implementation of the EU budget in the areas where management is shared with the Member States is a complex issue, and reducing errors there remains our main challenge and priority. In 2010, the majority of the errors were concentrated on seven operational programmes in three Member States. However, the analysis of the errors in cohesion policy presented with the cohesion package last month shows that from 2006 until 2009, more Member States contributed to the level of errors, including so-called net payers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission considers that it is not primarily the design of the programmes that is wrong, but the way they are implemented on the spot. As President Caldeira said, in the majority of cases, the Member States’ authorities had sufficient information to have detected and corrected the errors prior to certifying the expenditure to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is unacceptable. It reflects a lack of responsibility by the authorities involved despite their enhanced obligations under shared management as required by the Treaty. The Commission has confronted the Member States concerned with those findings. We expect to receive quick and appropriate responses from them in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will, of course, continue to act preventively, providing guidance, assistance and advice to Member States’ authorities, but it will also continue to strictly apply corrective measures such as interruptions and suspensions of payments and financial corrections.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the next financial period, the Commission has proposed the definite reduction of the financial allocation to Member States that do not address effectively the weaknesses in their systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another issue raised in the Court’s report refers to the financial engineering instruments. Last week, several members of the Committee on Budgetary Control expressed concerns regarding the management of these instruments and their inherent risks at Member State level.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, the problems identified by the Court of Auditors have been addressed. The necessary adjustments have been made in due time before the closure of the 2010 accounts. Moreover, the Commission has already proposed amending the current legal basis to obtain systematically the information needed from the national authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the effectiveness of the systems, it is worth noting that the Court found that more than 90% of the errors are identified outside the Commission at the level of beneficiaries. This is of particular importance when we know that 80% of the budget is spent under shared management. That said, the Commission agrees with the Court that the definition of objectives and indicators and the monitoring of progress and results need further improvement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, identification of objectives, targets, milestones and key performance indicators are now systematically included in all our legislative proposals for the next financial period. The Commission will issue the very first evaluation report based on Article 318 of the Treaty by the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, let me say a few words on the various European financial assistance mechanisms. The Commission agrees that the principles of transparency, accountability and public audit should be respected when public funds are at stake. Today, the Court of Auditors is entitled to audit the balance of payments facility and the European financial stabilisation mechanisms to the extent that they are guaranteed by the EU budget, and Note 9 to the Union’s accounts gives adequate information on the existing lending operations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased that the European Court of Auditors has confirmed that the Commission is on the right track. Despite these rather good results, there remains ample room for improvement, and the Commission takes full responsibility for addressing these areas together with the other financial actors involved, in particular, the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several new measures included in our proposals for the next generation of EU spending programmes are inspired by the Court and the Discharge Authority’s recommendations. Whether these measures will become EU law depends now on the colegislators – the Council and this Assembly. The Commission will facilitate the negotiations and hopes these necessary improvements will be supported.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the Court of Auditors for an excellent report. I think you have succeeded in the feat of presenting more details while, at the same time, making it easier to understand.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, let me start by putting this year’s discharge procedure in context. Confidence in the way Europe manages its budgetary discipline and administration of public funds has been shaken to the core. It is up to us, in conjunction with the Commission, the Court of Auditors and, above all, the Member States, to start to show that Europe, in the shape of the EU, is at least successfully dealing with these issues and, in so doing, to rebuild confidence. Therefore, this year’s discharge procedure is a particularly important one. Nothing must be hidden away, nothing must escape critical inspection – and that is our responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="sv">If I were to be unkind and summarise the message that I heard from the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Caldeira, and Commissioner Šemeta, I would say that I have understood the Court of Auditors to be saying that the situation is stable and that we do not see any dramatic changes. The Commission agrees, but indicates that we are on the right road and sees progress in the areas of aid and research. The problem is simply that stable is not good enough. We were disappointed last year. To hear that things look about the same this year is, unfortunately, not good news. What I think stands out from the stable situation is, sadly, the negative aspects.</p>
      <p sl="sv">If I were to make three quick observations then, firstly, there is the fact that we have serious problems with cohesion policy. In this area, the Member States have a large degree of responsibility. A small number of Member States – often the same ones – account for the lion’s share of the problems year after year, which is unacceptable. It is particularly worth noting what the Court of Auditors points out, namely that 58% of the problems are ones that the Member States could have anticipated.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The second observation concerns the question of financial engineering instruments. Reading chapter 4 of the Court of Auditors’ report makes me feel genuinely concerned, particularly as the Commission is saying that we should increase the use of these instruments and that they pose a big risk.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Last but not least, the question of how the budget crisis will affect the EU budget. We are in the midst of a crisis – a budget crisis – in the Member States. This clearly involves risks for the EU, both financial risks and risks of more errors. We need to examine this. I am grateful to President Caldeira for taking up the problems with the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). We need more scrutiny and parliamentary influence in this regard. We promise to talk more about this. Thank you for your excellent work thus far. I look forward to continuing our cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, the overall error rate for spending from the EU budget was 3.7%. This figure is too high. A resolution by this House based on the Liberadzki report calls for this figure to be constantly reduced.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am concerned that the Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010 shows that the trend is being reversed. After three years of falling error rates, the figure is now increasing again. Unfortunately, European regional policy is once again responsible, because the error rate in this area rose from 5.5 to 7.7%.</p>
      <p sl="de">Interestingly, information from the European Commission shows that the United Kingdom is in third place behind Spain and Italy in the list of states where the most errors take place. We know that errors are being made because of divided management in the Member States and we know which Member States are responsible.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, we are calling on the Commission to focus on monitoring activities in these countries. The Commission must suspend or interrupt the programmes, but the error rate must come down.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look at revenue, it is clear that one eighth of the European budget is made up of income from external tariffs. The Member States are also failing to fulfil their obligations in this area. Duties are not being levied efficiently and once again Italy and the United Kingdom, together with the Netherlands, are the main culprits.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the European Court of Auditors, you, Mr Caldeira and all your staff for this important document, which we will make detailed use of in the forthcoming discharge procedure.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this year’s report from the European Court of Auditors presents a positive picture, but there are some problems. The good news is that many areas are satisfactory, in particular, the major area of agricultural spending, as Mr Fjellner has already said. The bad news is that the predicted deterioration in the area of cohesion has taken place and 49%, in other words half, of all the payments audited in the area of cohesion had errors. That is a great number.</p>
      <p sl="de">A total of 90% of all the payments with problems are made in the Member States. In our committee, we were critical at the time of the fact that the Council was not present. I am looking at the Council bench and the Council is once again not represented. The Council really should be here for this debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two-thirds of all the errors occur in three Member States. I would like to congratulate you, Mr Šemeta, for having the courage to name these Member States in the committee. You have said that they are Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic. You have our support for this new policy of naming and shaming.</p>
      <p sl="de">You have followed up another call by the European Parliament and I would like to thank you for this too. You have interrupted payments amounting to a total of EUR 2.4 billion. This is the only way that we will be able to introduce discipline in the Member States. After the process of damage limitation, we must identify the errors and name the culprits.</p>
      <p sl="de">The key words here are effectiveness, efficiency and economic viability. There is also a new chapter where you, Mr Caldeira, make it clear in your report that the Commission often does not achieve the goals which it sets itself. Mr Šemeta, we will be interested to see the evaluation report from the Commission, which is expected in December. However, we would also like to say that in times of financial crisis, we must use taxpayers’ money in a way which is even more effective, more precise, more carefully targeted and more efficient. That is our job. I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for helping us to do this.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to concentrate today on the functioning of Regional, Social and Cohesion Funds in 2010, which account for nearly EUR 37 billion by way of payments.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Court of Auditors’ analysis gives us food for thought. Several figures have already been mentioned. I will not repeat them. I would like to concentrate on perhaps the most important section in this chapter, namely recital 425. It reads as follows: ‘The Court takes the view that, in 58% of the transactions that showed errors, the authorities of Member States had sufficient information to detect and correct at least some of the errors’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Last week, the Commissioner did indeed tell us, in the Committee on Budgetary Control, that three Member States, Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic, are responsible for two thirds of all the errors. A country like Poland, which is easily the largest recipient of all the funds, has done well, with an error rate of zero. This means that it is possible. I therefore think – as has been acknowledged by many speakers – that, in this discharge procedure, we very much ought to set our sights on the Council. Today, the Council is again not attending the debate and finance ministers are still refusing to sign a statement by which they would make it clear that their administrations, their people in charge of carrying out checks, are working correctly and indeed, that they have made no mistakes or that, in any case, any errors have been properly checked. I and many others, therefore, increasingly believe that we ought to tighten the tap pouring subsidies to those kinds of Member States. We have to suspend payments. We may need to withhold payments. We may need to go to the Court of Justice. We cannot allow this situation to continue. That, I think, is the only language the finance ministers will understand because, in that case, there will be questions asked in the national parliaments: what are you doing?</p>

They should have been here – their presence is quite frankly a must. I think I can repeat what we said when the President of the Court of Auditors attended a sitting of the Committee on Budgetary Control: the work of the Court of Auditors is very important in terms of building respect for the European Union’s institutions, particularly during a crisis, when the European taxpayer will want to look at every euro to see whether it has been spent as it was intended to be spent. It seems to me to be a very sad thing that there are, in fact, so many irregularities in terms of the Cohesion Fund, because this fund is one which is used by the majority of the ‘new’ Member States.

As we have already heard, the payments that form the basis of the accounts are seriously defective. That is not all, however. It is also going in the wrong direction. Year after year, we in Parliament have been critical of the far too high error rate in the EU’s management of taxpayers’ money. Every year, however, we have been reassured by the Commission that it is going in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="da">Last year, the Commission was particularly proud, as I remember. We were told that the overall reduction in errors was due simply to the Commission’s sterling efforts. I recall that I commented on this in my speech on 11 November here in Parliament. I said, and I quote: ‘I am happy to give the Commission the credit, but it is also clear who will be responsible if the error rate increases next year’. Here we now are, a year later, and the error rate has increased. It is now no longer enough to ask who is responsible. We now also need to ask who will take responsibility.

More important than what the auditors tell us today is what they do not tell us. For example, the EU has paid EUR 60 billion worth of Structural Funds to Greece since it joined the euro. Where were they spent? They do not seem to have fuelled any growth in that country.</p>

For those who have been observing this process for a long time, it is not surprising that the Court of Auditors has produced a negative result for 2010. In these very difficult economic times, this amounts to a confession of failure by the European Union, because it clearly indicates that taxpayers’ money is being used illegally or even wasted. The error rate in the EU budget amounts to 3.7%, but this figure can be increased, because the error rate for cohesion, energy and transport stands at 7.7% and this is once again higher than the previous year. In the cases audited by the Court of Auditors, the error rate is 49%, which is equivalent to every other case.

      <p sl="ro">The reports from the Court of Auditors of the European Union for the 24 agencies do not make any specific references to the issues of management, public procurement, human resources or performance. There is absolutely no information about some agencies and only general details for others. This year’s reports contain less information than last year’s reports. If these agencies have improved their operation, we need to see figures and arguments to convince us.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would firstly like to thank and congratulate the Court of Auditors, because it has once again given us a perspective on the visibility of responsibility and the areas of concern in expenditure and budgetary control, and has also given us a forecast of trends, which means we can work on the most important areas.</p>
      <p sl="es">The fact is, and we view this with utmost concern, that a trend which, until recently, was controlled within the cohesion policy, a central European policy, is now getting worse. We therefore find that the Commission is seriously looking at revising the information provided by the Court so as to have better instruments available with which to control these accounts.</p>
      <p sl="es">In any case, other very important items have appeared for the first time in the Court of Auditors’ 2010 report, which covers all the issues related to financial engineering. These herald new concerns. As these are fundamental instruments for expanding and supplementing financing, above all for projects that go beyond a multiannual basis, and which we obviously need in order to continue developing and creating jobs, I would like to ask both Mr Caldeira and Mr Šemeta what results they expect from improved control of these instruments, which are necessary, but open up new problems.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to ask about the frequency of mistakes in research, development and innovation policy. Although these are clearly immaterial errors and below the average, the rate is high and, more than anything else, this causes a problem with independent auditors.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I would like to thank the European Court of Auditors for the sympathetic attitude which it always takes towards Parliament. I think the cooperation is excellent and I hope it will stay that way. The ultimate goal for all of us still is to receive a positive Statement of Assurance (DAS). We all know that that has not been possible in the past seventeen years, and I agree with Mr Fjellner that maintaining the status quo is not satisfactory. Things are getting better, but the ultimate goal must be two per cent.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We will soon be starting again with the preparatory measures for a new multiannual budget. We also have legislation providing the basis for that. It would be good if the Court of Auditors and the Commission could publish items on where the bottlenecks, in their eyes, really are. It is very good that certain countries are being highlighted, and I think that the Commission should focus on that. As the Committee on Budgetary Control, we have invited the finance ministers of those countries to provide us with a text and an explanation. They have still not responded to that invitation, but we hope that that will happen soon.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is essential for Parliament, as indeed was recently confirmed in a vote in this hemicycle, is that Parliament still wants more political responsibility for spending in the Member States.

However, I would like to draw your attention to one aspect of this discussion, which is that Commissioner Šemeta, at last week’s meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control, named three states that are apparently most at fault in respect of cohesion policy: Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic. As I hail from the Czech Republic, and as the Czech Republic is mentioned in this context for the first time, I tried to find out the details behind these statements. The response is simply that 16 projects or payments were audited in the Czech Republic, and four of these were classified among the seriously quantifiable errors. I would not like to cast doubt on the work of the Court of Auditors, of which I have a very high opinion, but I would like to call on the Commission to be more restrained in its statements, as they need to be substantiated first. I welcome greater mutual awareness in these matters, of course, and perhaps much greater awareness.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for its analysis in the Parliament section of this year’s annual report. In relation to the Parliament’s discharge, I would like to raise several issues for the Parliament’s consideration in today’s discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I would like to discuss the publications of the internal auditors for the financial year 2010. It is regrettable that this year, reports were not made available on time to members of the Committee on Budgetary Control since previous years’ reports clearly represented an added value for the EP discharge procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, there was a lack of information about the previous years’ status of Parliament’s accounts. Having available data for previous years will help us, through comparisons, to improve our data analysis and finally improve the quality of our recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, the question of security still represents a major issue for many MEPs. However we still lack enough details on the progress of the global security concept. What other concrete measures and what steps will be followed to implement an efficient security system for all of us?</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourth, an important issue mentioned in the Court of Auditors’ annual report is the question of visitors’ groups and the methodology for calculation of the subsidy schemes for these groups. I believe we still need to improve the process through a more transparent and effective reimbursement system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, these are not all the issues that I would like to mention here today. We will discuss all of them in more detail in committee, but I want to highlight that, in these difficult times of budget constraints and challenges, everybody has to make their utmost effort to save EU taxpayers’ money. We rely very much on the European Court of Auditors to provide us with high-quality information about the spending of all EU institutions, including the spending of the European Parliament. We represent the voice of the citizens, but we are also accountable to those citizens for the way we spend their money.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I, too, should like to thank President Caldeira for presenting the Court of Auditors’ 2010 annual report, which contains a great deal of new information, such as the total error rate in payments and a new chapter evaluating the Commission’s performance.</p>
      <p sl="el">In the current economic and financial crisis, the pressure on public finances has never been greater and efficient use of public money is more important than ever. Given that political cohesion is at the heart of the debate on the error rate and its impact on the EU budget, it is vital that we underline what is an error and what is not: an error is a transaction which is not fully in keeping with current regulations; error does not mean that funds have been lost or wasted or that fraud has been committed. Furthermore, the statistics illustrate that two-thirds of errors are concentrated in three of the 27 Member States and in seven out of 455 programmes. That means that, with targeted efforts on the part of the Commission and certain Member States, it will be possible to reduce the error rate considerably.</p>
      <p sl="el">I am sure that everyone will agree that, during the next cohesion policy programming period, there should be a greater degree of simplification, transparency, responsibility and controls that marry efficiency with cost, as this will ultimately help us to improve how we protect the financial interests of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, my first words will be to echo the compliments made to the Court of Auditors, to President Caldeira, and to Commissioner Šemeta. I am disappointed that the Council is not here, since it is the second budgetary branch, and I join my colleagues in saying that within the shared management, this is where we have the highest error rate, and the Council is not here to discuss this. Need I remind you that we refused to grant discharge to the Council? The least we could expect is that this institution be here today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say a few words on the DAS, which is the statement of assurance. This is an obligation under the Treaty. I would like to know, Mr President, Commissioner, whether we have a positive or negative DAS. I should also like to congratulate Ms Kaljulaid for her work in presenting the DAS opinion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Regarding the annual accounts, we have an unqualified certification opinion. I must say that I cannot get used to the fact that we are not entering in the accounts the EUR 30 billion that Member States owe us in respect of pensions, in application of accounting standards in the public sector. On the underlying transactions, we have two opinions and one observation. I therefore believe that we need to make progress so that we in Parliament know what is the general opinion on the accounts and underlying transactions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I think that the number of tests is far from enough: Two-hundred and thirty-eight in agriculture, 90 in outside access. I believe we need to analyse whether this number of tests is sufficient and once again, I would like to reiterate the proposal whereby the European Court of Auditors relies on national courts of auditors for its opinion on shared management, as authorised by the Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my biggest concern is the error rate in cohesion policy of 7.7%. The benefits of Structural Funds can be seen right across my country of Wales and it is often the most visible sign of the European Union. Therefore, it would be a great shame if high error rates allowed critics of cohesion policy to undermine it. That is why it is important that issues around procurement policy, eligible projects, eligible costs, supervision and audit are resolved quickly.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also say that one of the biggest critics of cohesion policy is the UK Government, yet its error rate for some Structural Funds is higher than most other Member States. Of course, this would not apply to Wales, which has an excellent record on spending its EU funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, it would be useful if the Commissioner or the Court informed us about the biggest offenders and what is being done to ensure things improve in those Member States.</p>

Of course, I do not wish to insult those fellow Members not working in the Committee on Budgetary Control or working in other Committees who are now honouring us with their presence. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, Commissioner, I fully agree with the key idea of Mr Fjellner. This year’s report indicates that the use of European Union funds is stable. It is stable, but it is unfortunately showing problems. In today’s debate, I would like to point out two important aspects of future stability.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In order for the EU’s financial management to show a stable and improving trend over the upcoming period, we need efficient, transparent, controllable and readily applicable common rules that provide a guarantee for the appropriate use of funds, and we also need stability as regards the use of potential funding, especially under the Cohesion Funds, ensuring that everyone can expect to receive similar amounts of funding in the upcoming budgetary period.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I am not going to repeat what has been said so far. I simply wish to touch on a subject which I feel is extremely important. I want to pick up on the statement made by Mr Ton Van Lierop, the spokesman on regional issues, who said that it is natural for us to have more errors during this period because all the programmes have been implemented at a normal rate and, in any case, the money is not lost because we will recoup it in a few years. The programmes may have been implemented at a normal rate. However, it is not natural for the actual control systems not to be implemented at a normal rate, as well, and not to be adapted to ensure that the errors are not greater than they were at the start; if anything, they should be smaller.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To put it in another way, the money is lost. On the one hand, this is because we will not recoup it all and, on the other, because during these wasted years, the money will not be spent where it is needed, as it was intended, and at the time when it was needed. Therefore, I say that we need much better control systems which are much better suited and much more effective in the period ahead.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank first of all the President of the European Court of Auditors, Mr da Silva Caldeira, who came here to Parliament today to present the 2010 annual report.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should point out that the work carried out annually by this institution is particularly important: through the publication of its reports and opinions, it keeps all European citizens objectively informed on topics such as the most significant errors recorded in requests for funds, thereby helping consumers to improve the format of their requests and, consequently, to obtain funds more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as I have understood from the President’s speech this afternoon, in 2010, payments underlying the accounts still showed up some relevant errors – some 3.7% of the EU’s spending, which amounts to a total of EUR 122.2 billion.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am also happy to hear the information the President wanted to underline, which was that this error percentage does not provide an estimate of cases of fraud. Often, it relates to imprecise calculations of costs declared for projects cofinanced by the EU or declarations of costs which are ineligible when instead, they were thought to be eligible; as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in consideration of the anticipated reduction in funds, I am particularly interested in the 2.3% error rate for agriculture with some substantial differences: the control of spending on direct payments has not brought up relevant errors, while payments for rural development display a higher frequency of error, at no less than 50%. Finally, the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund registered a 27% error rate on examined payments.</p>

    <intervention id="2-671-000" speaker_id="28165" name="Lambert van Nistelrooij" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I, too, would like to express my gratitude to the Court of Auditors for its excellent report and to the Commissioner for the contribution he has made.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is not just a matter of control; it is one that concerns the entire House here. I myself am coordinator of the regional policy, for the Cohesion Funds, and, as rapporteur, I will also be working on the new regulations for 2014-2020. I believe that we could win major battles with those very regulations by the way in which we define things there. We have, of course, done that for the current 2007-2014 period. That has already improved significantly. We need such broad cooperation in this House as well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, allow me to make two points. First of all, we are referring to the countries concerned by name. That is a very good thing, I think, because it allows you to address the specific issues of these countries. If you see that a handful of countries is responsible for 60 per cent of the errors, you can then apply custom-made solutions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second point is to do with public procurement. Forty per cent of the errors concern public procurement. What is actually going on here? It might be that, on the one hand, the legislation is too complicated. On the other hand, it might be that the countries concerned lack the administrative capacity to properly implement the legislation. Therefore, you either adjust your legislation in that respect – the Commission is also currently looking at that – or we provide better support, or significantly reduce the funds for countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, let me turn to financial innovations, or financial engineering as we call it: this is, in itself, a very good thing, but on top of that, it also means that we should arrive at a point, together with the Committee on Budgetary Control, where we have greater transparency. We could score major benefits from that.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak for a second time in this debate. The Member States have a great deal of responsibility. That is why, for the first time, we have invited the Member States to meet with the committee in order to be involved in the hearing and debate on discharge, because we have some important questions. Why do we have the same problems in the same Member States, often with regard to the same programmes? What can we do about them?</p>
      <p sl="sv">Shared responsibility must not mean no responsibility. The EU, too, has a responsibility. Even we have a responsibility. Our most important responsibility right now – now that we also have the power of codecision – is probably to learn from the problems, particularly now that we are, in principle, reviewing all sections of the policy areas where we have problems. Will we have to put an end to certain programmes? Will we have to review certain programmes in certain regions? It is not acceptable to simply hide behind the Member States, even if that is where the problems are greatest.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Commission has the right to discontinue certain payments. However, if it is the case that we have the same problems year after year – that is something we talked about a lot last year – then perhaps we should talk more about the grounds on which these payments are resumed if the problems in certain Member States and certain contexts have not been resolved. I therefore think it is important in our ongoing work for us to emphasise that we have a shared responsibility – a shared responsibility for the budget and for budgetary problems, which means that we also have a shared responsibility for finding solutions. We need to take the lessons learned from this year’s discharge procedure and use them in the designing of the new programmes that we are working on right now.</p>

I would like to appeal to the Court of Auditors to specify very precisely what we are talking about when debating in Parliament, because even in this Chamber, different kinds of numbers are being bandied about which are quite alarming. It needs to be said very clearly when we are talking about the lower error limit, when we are talking about the upper error limit, when we are talking about the most likely rate of error and when we are talking about the frequency of occurrence of errors, because public debate has already got the idea that the usual suspect – cohesion policy – has a 49% error rate, whereas this refers to frequency. I appeal to the Court, particularly during debate in Parliament, to specify exactly what we are talking about, because if we do not make this clear, it will lead to a great many misunderstandings.</p>

It is indeed the case that when we read the materials, the extent of these irregularities is not in fact completely clear. So I decided to make a somewhat different type of analysis. Well, if we assume the extent of these irregularities in a policy group in which problems are increasing – I am thinking here of cohesion, energy and transport – comes to 7.7%, and we convert this into actual amounts, we have the following situation: a sum of EUR 41 billion has been spent on this, which means that the irregularities come to EUR 3 billion. This is, of course, EUR 3 billion too much. I would appeal for us however to give consideration to whether the methods for combating this problem are effective ones. This is because if, in spite of these efforts, the situation is deteriorating slightly year-on-year, it can be said that these methods are not very effective. However, let us remember that this is not everything, it is not even half – it is something of minor importance. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is clear that the EU has shown its inability to guarantee that it has legitimately spent taxpayers’ money.

We must make sure that the employees in the Member States have the right training and we must also attempt to reduce the amount of red tape and increase efficiency in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">Every year, the European Court of Auditors reports an average of three cases to the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), so it is clear that fraud is not the major problem, but instead, the large number of financial procedures. Hundreds of financial procedures are in use within the European Union and this puts too great a burden on many of the employees in the Member States. Therefore, I am asking the Commission to consider establishing its own training programme to help prevent technical errors from occurring in future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am really pleased that the Court’s 2010 annual report confirms that our efforts bear results.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to stress that the report of the Court of Auditors means that 96.3% of all spending of EU money is free of error. 96.3% – so I think this is a significant achievement but, of course, we want to do better.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our discussion today indicates that part of our efforts needs to be focused on those European programmes where management is shared with the Member States, in particular, in the area of cohesion. Here, I also would like to draw your attention to the fact that 2010 was the year when spending on cohesion reached its full speed. So all the programmes were triggered and yet, despite this fact, the level of error in 2010, although it increased in comparison to 2009 – to 7.7% as some of you rightly pointed out – is nevertheless much lower than in 2008 or 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I think this also demonstrates that the systems which were developed in this programming period are working. Of course, implementation of those systems requires more efforts at the level of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you – or many of you – also discussed the issue of financial engineering instruments and we do, of course, take into account the risks related to these financial engineering instruments, but I think that it is also very important to take into account that these instruments are the source of financing for small and medium-sized enterprises which are so important in the situation of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission actually adopted a very exhaustive guidance note on the implementation of financial engineering instruments. We developed a new and very comprehensive audit methodology for financial engineering instruments and we also strongly advise audit authorities in the Member States to produce thematic audits on the use of financial engineering instruments. All this demonstrates that we take this issue very seriously into account, but of course we will be ready during the discharge procedure to discuss this issue in more detail.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is undertaking follow-up, as we speak, to the issues identified in the 2009 discharge resolution and to the new findings disclosed in the 2010 Court report.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the future, major proposals for the next multiannual financial framework have been tabled already, notably for cohesion and agriculture policies. You will find in these proposals how the Commission has duly taken your recommendations into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">Other proposals will follow until the end of this year and will include as well the necessary provisions to improve further the financial management of EU funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am looking forward to a constructive and fruitful debate with you and I would also like to assure you that the Commission will provide you with all necessary support as it has done in the past.</p>

      <p sl="en">We are indeed committed to continue further cooperation with this House, with the relevant committee, the Budgetary Control Committee, and with all the committees – covering agriculture, regional development, or any other area – which find that our work is of relevance for the discharge of their responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">This annual report provides this Chamber with more detailed information. We have provided you with quantifiable indicators that might prove confusing to a non-expert reader. But we explain clearly that this offers you a kind of thermometer whereby you can compare a series of areas which are most likely to affect, and have a financial impact on, the payments underlying the budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can see the evolution since 2006 and we will be able to see how the situation develops after 2010; that will be, one might say, the thermometer that we can use to see what the temperature is. But more importantly, I think, we have been able to indicate to you where the problems are and where the roots and the causes of those problems lie, so that you, as legislators, you as the discharge authority, the Council and the Commission, can take your own responsibilities to ensure that the rules are indeed implemented by all those responsible in the Commission and in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">We cannot forget that the budget is implemented by the European Commission, in cooperation with Member States. So we need to fully implement current legal frameworks but we also say that we need to simplify. I believe that the future reforms to the next financial framework envisaged by the Commission proposals offer a golden opportunity to redress the problems we face.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think there is a focus to be put on the results to be achieved in terms of the added value we want to get from funding from the European Union budget. It must not be forgotten that we have to comply with rules, but we want more than that: we want the funds to be effectively used in the most economic way and in an efficient way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you have talked about the complexity and bureaucracy of the systems in place. The new financial period may eventually benefit from simple rules and more effective mechanisms, but minimising the costs of control cannot lead to there being no adequate accountability from those responsible, either in Member States or in the Commission; the mechanisms must be sufficiently transparent.</p>
      <p sl="en">Be sure that the European Court of Auditors is working according to the Treaty provisions to issue its own opinions on the proposals that have been put forward by the Commission to change the regulations in agriculture and in the Structural Funds. We believe that these principles of transparency and accountability should be key, should guide all these reforms, and also should be applied to other areas that are outside the budget of the European Union. We have a lot of new interinstitutional instruments where a lot of public funds are committed, and we need to ensure that there is sufficient accountability and public audit. I think you have a good example with the European Stability Mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to make two remarks on concrete questions raised by Members of this House. Let me reassure Ms Macovei that the report on the agencies has already been delivered for all the agencies and that the horizontal issues to which she referred will be delivered in due course. She is absent, but I believe the message will get to her.</p>
      <p sl="en">A word to Mr Audy. We are indeed very committed to working with the national audit institutions. In this annual report, we have worked together with the national audit institution of the Netherlands and with the national audit institution of the Czech Republic on a pilot study where we could work together. The results of that work underlie our conclusions on agriculture. This is an experience we have to assess, so as to measure the advantages and the disadvantages, the costs and benefits, but it is for sure the way we have to go, because we need to have a single concept for auditing the Union budget.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The error rate for the cohesion policy, energy and transport policy area group is estimated at 7.7%, according to the annual report. The error rate has even increased compared to the previous year. It says a lot about how, in a large number of cases, the rules on spending have been flouted. It may have to do with contravention of the rules on public procurement or the notification of unjustified or wrongly estimated costs of aid. The role of the Member States in this is absolutely crucial, because they could prevent, discover and correct errors. This is about significant sums of money, because cohesion policy is, after agricultural policy, the second largest item of expenditure in the EU budget. It represents a third of the budget – around EUR 350 billion in this current Structural Funds period. The EU must apply sanctions more readily and more purposefully, so that abuses and errors can be brought to an end. Sanctions would include suspension of payments, the freezing of assets and the recovery of funds paid.</p>

The Council acknowledges, too, that it is precisely because of the crisis and its many aspects that it is more important than ever to keep to the commitment we have made to meet the target of giving 0.7% of gross national income in official development assistance, or ODA, by 2015. The European Council reaffirmed this in June 2011.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, it cannot be denied that donor countries have also been hard-hit by the global situation – the crisis – and that this is forcing often drastic budgetary restrictions in the economies of developed countries too, including the economies of the Member States. We are feeling the effects of the crisis, and we are talking about it in a number of European forums. We have to realise that without making major efforts, we will perhaps not manage to achieve the collective targets for development assistance and development cooperation. In this situation, it is all the more important that our citizens understand why development policy and the budgetary resources associated with this are so important. In this regard, we welcome the Commission communication on increasing the impact of EU development policy: an agenda for change. It has been published at the right time. The Council would like to hold a debate as quickly as possible on appropriate fiscal and monetary policy – policy which would mean that money given as aid is spent effectively, brings the best possible results, has greater impact and is used in a way which encourages further funding for development.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mention should be made, here, of the conference soon to be held in Busan on this very subject – effectiveness in development cooperation – something which is so important, particularly to donors such as the EU. In May 2012, we expect the Council will adopt conclusions on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Despite the difficulties and challenges of last year and this year, in 2010, collective EU ODA amounted to EUR 53.8 billion, and this is more than ever before. I cannot agree with those who present the situation from one side only – the negative side. We have made significant progress towards achieving our ODA targets. I would like to stress once again that this is the largest amount of ODA we have ever been able to give.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union remains by far the world’s largest donor of ODA. Over the period from 2004 to 2010, the EU and its Member States provided over half of all ODA given to developing countries. We should be proud of this. Despite the global financial and economic crisis over the past years, most Member States have been able to increase their ODA spending. More Member States are coming close to joining the group of donors which give 0.7% of gross national income in ODA.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Bearing in mind that each Member State decides its own level of ODA spending, in the first annual report to the European Council on EU development aid targets, the Council invited the Member States to take realistic, verifiable actions for meeting individual ODA commitments by 2015 and to share information on these actions and their planned ODA spending for the next budgetary year, as well as on their intentions for the remaining period until 2015. ODA will continue to play an essential role, including as a complement to, and catalyst of, other sources of financing for development. However it is not restricted only to additional funding and support for development. This is why implementation of all parts of the Monterrey Consensus is so important – all of the parts, not just those which concern financial commitments. The Council will continue to take a comprehensive approach to the question of development. ODA alone will not be enough. We must mobilise development financing from all possible sources and guarantee the effectiveness of our aid, including by democratic scrutiny of the use of aid, in order to fight poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, honourable Minister Stanowski, I would like to thank Ms Striffler and the Development Committee for this timely question.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Commission relies on the confirmation by all the EU Heads of State or Government at the June 2011 European Council that they plan and are committed to achieve the 0.7% aid targets by 2015. The ambitious EU commitment to the 0.7% ODA target is a strong indicator of our resolve in helping the developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">As this collective target is based on the individual commitments by Member States, the EU Union collective Official Development Aid level depends on the individual budgetary decisions by all EU Member States. I really believe that they will stand by their words despite the complicated economic climate in the EU. The European Commission will continue strongly to call on all Member States to respect their commitments.</p>
      <p sl="en">I admit that the EU has fallen short of its collective intermediate indicative target for 2010. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that, compared to 2009, European Union official development aid increased by more than EUR 4.5 billion, reaching EUR 53 billion in 2010. In the global context, the EU is leading the world on development aid increases. Since 2004, we have provided 65% of global aid increases and today, the European Union accounts for more than half of global development aid. Official Development Aid remains important for reaching the Millennium Development Goals’ targets and all development partners can also be called upon to contribute their fair share.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also true that the European Union budget could and should be a part of the increase of Official Development Aid. In the multiannual financial framework proposal, the European Commission has put forward increasing resources allocated to development aid. The proposed increase reflects the commitment to reach the 0.7% target, under the assumption that the share of EU-channelled ODA remains stable.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, Official Development Aid increases alone will not be sufficient to meet all the financing needs of the developing world, to address the numerous global challenges. To bridge the financing gap and provide the necessary resources, they should be ready to put all their efforts into mobilising all financial resources, including private resources, because only in this way can we dramatically increase the scale of support.</p>
      <p sl="en">This also includes looking at mechanisms, such as guarantees and blending loans and grants. I believe the G20 process, under the French Presidency, has started a very important discussion on a financial transaction tax and that these resources should also be used for development needs. There are other sources indicated in the Gates report, which we should look at and discuss at the appropriate time.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I would also like to emphasise other aspects that are of particular importance at this time when each euro spent in the European Union is looked upon twice or three times – that the money spent provides exactly the results that we should expect – so that means aid efficiency is crucial. We will look at the global relations in this respect, between the developed world and the developing world, to ensure that aid money is spent efficiently, transparently and with the profitability that is needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was also asked a question about a peer review. Definitely, the European Commission fully supports Parliament’s full involvement in the OECD/DAC Peer Review and a peer review team will be coming again and will be working with Parliament to find the right answers for EU development cooperation. We are very much looking at the result of this peer review. In previous times, it gave a lot of very valuable contributions on how to involve it and I believe it is the right instrument internationally to reflect on it.</p>
      <p sl="en">And the last point I would like to emphasise is that, even under the Lisbon Treaty, a rather complicated treaty, we had excellent cooperation with the Polish Presidency on development issues and I would like to thank Minister Stanowski for his engagement in keeping development issues rightly on the Council agenda. His presence today is very much a confirmation of his personal engagement and that the Commission, Council and Parliament need to work together in this area to help the poorest people.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Stanowski, Mr Piebalgs, I would like to thank Ms Striffler for the motion for a resolution on the accountability report on financing for development. I agree with the opinion of the Council and the Commission that one of the keys to sustainable development is the mobilisation of domestic resources in partner countries. In our resolution, we call on European Union donors to prioritise capacity building in this area. This especially concerns building stronger tax systems and better tax governance. We also call for increased efforts to promote tax-related transparency and country-by-country reporting and to combat tax evasion and illicit capital flight. In relation to this, we ask the European Commission to include the fight against the misuse of tax havens and against tax evasion and illicit capital flight in its development policy as a matter of priority.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, the resolution is not restricted just to analysis of the current situation. In it, we call on the European Union and the Member States to do what the Commissioner has spoken about: to seek other sources of international development finance, besides official development assistance, which could be given to development. This includes proposing innovative levies to fund global public action, including giving development aid, although not all Members of the House are of the opinion that this innovative levy should be a financial transaction tax. It also includes significantly reducing the cost of remittances, which, as we know, are an important source of income for developing countries, stepping up the blending of EU grants and European Investment Bank loans, although the position of the Committee on Development is very clear that this mechanism must not cause a reduction in aid spending, and supporting micro-finance schemes, which improve access to financial services in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would also like to say that it is very important for us to bear in mind the principle that other policies must, in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty, be consistent with development goals. Once again, we appeal for implementation of this principle, for the introduction of structural measures to eradicate poverty, and for European policy to be made more consistent.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Council of Ministers has set the right priorities for the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation since parliaments and civil society, to name but a few, ought indeed to be more involved in policy making when it comes to developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We also need to agree with the emerging economies, China and India, that they should take care of their own poor themselves. Obviously, our business community can play a greater role in the development of the economy in the south, but we must be careful that we do not return to tied aid, where development money flows back into our own pockets through orders placed with our businesses. However, what is essential for the European Union is to recognise that the effectiveness of development aid stands or falls on coherence of policy. For instance, the Council’s fine priorities will mean nothing as long as our businesses pay little or no tax in developing countries. If they had a healthy fiscal revenue, they would hardly need our financial support. I am therefore very pleased with the proposals by Michel Barnier of the Commission concerning the Transparency Directive, which are certainly coherent. We could certainly strengthen the detail of his proposals, but if we had insight into what European mining and forestry companies pay in poor countries, we could make those companies much more accountable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, what will the Commission do to ensure that Member States deliver on their pledges to spend 0.7 per cent of their gross national income on development cooperation in 2015? A call alone does not, unfortunately, appear to be enough. Obviously, this pledge is under severe pressure because of the economic crisis, but the least the Commission can do is to start the debate now, in a powerful way, about what needs to happen after 2015.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Ms Striffler is right to question the consistency of the commitments taken by the European Union in terms of official development aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us say this straightaway: without the European Union’s contribution to development policy, achieving the Millennium Development Goals would remain a pipedream. Let us nevertheless add that the European Union shares this responsibility with other players.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The United States is an important donor in absolute terms, but with 0.2% of its GDP devoted to official development aid, it is far behind the European Union in relative terms, without forgetting the emerging countries, which generate substantial resources, an increasing part of which will have to be allocated for the purpose of development and combating poverty within their own borders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, what is comforting is to see that various EU Member States – the list is not exhaustive – are setting an example in this regard. With only a few days until the Fourth High-Level Forum on aid effectiveness in Busan, I think it would be wise to insist not only on the volume of the European Union’s official development aid, but also on its ‘leverage effect’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As the largest provider of funds, we have a position that enables the European Union to assert itself more at global level. Without being perceived as giving lectures, the European Union can and must remind those at Busan that combating poverty is an obligation for all the Member States; as developing countries and, more specifically, emerging countries gradually generate their own resources, they must also devote them to eradicating poverty within their borders. It is, first and foremost, up to them to act and we cannot take their responsibilities in this area upon ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU committed itself to help developing countries reach the Millennium Goals, achieving 0.7% official development aid by 2015, and committed itself on aid effectiveness, debt, climate, finance, etc. The EU has not reached the 0.7% target and, with the crisis, is unlikely to do so in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Greens believe in a change of policy, addressing tax havens and tax evasion, with binding measures, implementing Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty on policy coherence, by matching words with actions, with coherent policies between trade, agriculture and fishing, addressing farmland acquisition by foreign investors with the risk of undermining food security, such as in Africa, and putting in place fair trade rules to break the vicious circle whereby developing countries are locked into dire poverty despite agricultural and mineral resources. The trade pattern where developing countries export raw materials and buy manufactured products from industrialised countries has to change. The next report on the EU’s accountability should include the abovementioned policy changes as well as its financial commitments.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as stringent austerity measures are being introduced across Europe out of necessity, and democratically elected governments are being dismantled and replaced by technocrats backed by the EU, the self-same Union’s Court of Auditors has found unforgivable budgetary flaws, including EUR 3.2 billion squandered overseas, at a time when European Union Member States are in dire financial crisis. Those EUR 3.2 billion are effectively unaccounted for, due to non-compliance with procurement procedures and VAT and a host of ineligible activities in European Development Fund projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">The eurozone has had to turn to the developing world to ask for help as it is heading towards ruination due to the inept handling of the common currency. Yet, at the same time, vast amounts of money are simply being lost abroad.</p>
      <p sl="en">Foreign aid should be the sole concern of individual countries and should relate to the nation’s foreign policy and development-funding ethos. It should not be the concern of the EU, which has been proven, time and again, as unaccountable and ineffective.</p>

    <intervention id="2-705-000" speaker_id="25704" name="Eleni Theocharous" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, the EU budget for developing countries has a deficit in the order of EUR 50 billion. At the same time, however, financing for development is considered to be insufficiently effective, especially in light of the fact that millions of European citizens are living below the poverty line, even though numerous areas of the European Union have exited the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="el">Therefore, we are forced to raise the basic issue of more intensive management and efficacy controls of European taxpayers’ money, especially now, at a time of severe economic crisis and serious effort to rescue the euro and the euro area. I have always ardently supported the need for bold support for underdeveloped and developing countries, because it benefits the people of Europe in the medium term. However, this is not possible without adequate and strict controls, so that the European taxpayers’ money is not lost in the black hole of corruption and unaccountability.</p>
      <p sl="el">I will go even further, beyond financing for development: it is not right that Greek citizens, for example, should be subjected to humiliating terms and degradation in order to save a Member State of the euro area while, at the same time, millions are being lost left, right and centre due to the lack of controls. Not a single cent of European taxpayers’ money should be handed over without controls and accountability.</p>
      <p sl="el">To go even further still, pre-accession aid should also be subject to controls. I was recently in Turkey, which boasts that it is spending millions to become the leading country in the area, in Gaza, in Libya and in the Horn of Africa, while, at the same time, complaining that it is receiving crumbs from the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">We do not want the European taxpayers’ money to be used for weapons and nuclear programmes and multidimensional national policies; we want it to be used for development projects.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the statement by the Council and by the Commission. It is vital that we keep our promises in these very, very difficult times. The crisis which you refer to is a crisis which was created by developed countries and inflicted on developing countries. It is a case of saying: ‘I am doing badly but you can do worse than me; you suffer more’. Quite frankly, that is unacceptable to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, you are right, we are the biggest donor in the world, thus the importance of the EU and the devastation inflicted when we pull back on our commitments and fail to match our promises. In good times we must deliver, and equally in bad times. Aid effectiveness is based on long-term planning and thereby the predictability of funding. It is vital that we keep our word and our commitments to those most in need.</p>
      <p sl="en">Aid is investment, and it is necessary and vital for the wellbeing of all: developed and developing countries. We talk of crisis; think of the crisis when your child is dying from malnutrition, disease, deprivation. Think of that. Think of children dying from diseases which are preventable. Those are the crises we should be addressing and not necessarily a crisis which has been created through the pursuit of greed by banking and financial institutions. We ask the poor to make the sacrifices and give up that which they do not have, whilst at the same time we search for trillions of euro to satisfy rating agencies and bond markets which will never be satisfied.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sadly, we have the ECR not wanting binding commitments to targets. Why not? Why is the EPP seeking to remove the commitments on the land grab issue? These are issues that should unite the entire House, not divide us.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the Millennium Development Goals were a megalomaniac plan. Few care about results when it comes to projects funded from the public purse. No one feels personal responsibility, only political responsibility, and political responsibility is often just an empty phrase.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This is 2011. I am certain that the Millennium Goals will not be achieved. The European Union will also be blamed for this. It is absurd, but few European politicians will stand up at home in a time of crisis to defend an increase in development aid when unemployment is rising, pensions and health services are under threat and their own citizens are dependent on food aid. Development aid is defensible only when it is targeted and transparent, when the donor and the beneficiary are real people, families, small communities or at most a state. Where the personal dimension of aid disappears, we see waste, corruption, market distortion and summit conferences.</p>

In actual fact, today’s oral question is intended to highlight again the responsibilities which we have to the poorest countries in the world, to the millions of people who live in poverty and die every day. Indeed, the European Union remains the main donor, but I am concerned about the rate at which international donations are decreasing, especially those coming from the private sector. Another concerning aspect is the indifference or inability of Member States to allocate 0.7% of gross national income to social development aid by 2015.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We have a huge shortfall in funding. This is why I believe that Member States need to step up their efforts to generate additional income for assistance. In this regard, I support the proposal to adopt binding budgetary timetables, like the one for increasing the effectiveness in using this money. We all hope that Member States will return to economic growth and job creation, which will not only help improve the lives of people on our continent, but also provide hope for the poorest countries in the world and for the most afflicted children on the planet.</p>

      <p sl="ga">The fact that the European Union is the world’s biggest donor – contributing half of what the world is contributing – is something we should be very proud of, and which is indeed admirable. Certainly, it is something that we should put before other countries so that they can try to emulate what we are doing. Particularly when you consider that part of our 2020 strategy is to lift millions of people within Europe out of the poverty trap, the fact that, at the same time, we continue to help the poorest of the poor in the world is something we can be very proud of.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I know in my own country that we are very pleased with our contributions, both in terms of personnel who go to the Third World – long-term missionaries and other people for the short-term – and of giving to charitable causes, and with our commitment, like other countries, to meeting the 0.7% of GDP.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I have just two questions. Firstly, I would ask the Commission whether it considers that there are too many NGOs. If we had an amalgamation of NGOs, would we not save a lot in administration and have a better focus? Secondly, at what stage do we say that an emerging country can take care of itself and does not need help from us so we may give it to poorer countries?</p>

I think that we need to set an example, and not only by keeping to our financial commitments. The EU’s policies must be consistent and focus on the sectors which form the basis for sustainable development. This is why I support the approach proposed by the Commission in the Agenda for Change presented in October. I should emphasise the importance of coordination between donors and joint programming.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the Commission to provide us with more details about its efforts in this area.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, it is true that we tend to think less of others when we ourselves are in a crisis. The issue of low development levels and poverty in the countries of the so-called developing world are therefore pushed into the background. It is still true, however, that the differences between the rich north and the poor south are wide, and the crisis only exacerbates the absolute level of this inequality or catastrophe.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The crisis, however, could actually be an impulse for introducing more courageous and ambitious policies for promoting and fulfilling development goals. At a time when EU Member State budgets are running dry, there should be more pressure for alternative sources of development funding. Let us be frank – we are losing huge amounts of money through tax havens. The legislation to limit tax havens should bring in higher revenues, which could also be invested in the development of poorer countries. The same applies to the tax on financial transactions. In my opinion, it is a great pity that, due to the objections of the right, the resolution lost the references to a legally binding mechanism which would force multinational corporations to publish data automatically on the taxes they pay in their countries of operation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, that was really one of the most heated debates I have heard on development cooperation and that is why I will pick only a couple of issues that I think should be highlighted.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of financial volumes, 0.7% of GNI is really a very small amount of money. And for new Member States, it is only 0.33%.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, development aid is clearly a form of investment: investment in our security. To take just one example, the EU’s Operation Atalanta to combat piracy has cost, I am afraid, more than all the development aid that we have provided.</p>
      <p sl="en">The root causes of piracy are not to be found at sea, but on land. This is just one example. If people are dying from poverty, with no access to food, they will go out to rob others. So it is very clear where there is investment in people.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also learn courage from our African friends. 200 soldiers, mostly from Burundi but also from Uganda, have died this year fighting and protecting the Somali civilian population. 200 of them died, 800 are injured. What they say is that when there were difficult times in Burundi, they got help. It is about solidarity. And if there is solidarity inside the European Union, we should also have solidarity with the poorest nations in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">To answer Mr Kelly’s question on NGOs, we are rich because of our civil society. I know that there are a lot of issues such as whether NGOs should be more streamlined, but I think NGOs are an asset to our society. Even if their activities are not always fully efficient, they are doing what they do from the heart and I do not think we should try to limit them.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, the EU basically provides support through states where we can. Where we cannot, NGOs are the most effective mechanism to provide support for people on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">On differentiation, the Agenda for Change is very clear. There will only be support to the countries most in need. By developing the fight against poverty, we can increase our support to them.</p>
      <p sl="en">My last point is on John Bufton’s comment: it is wrong. We are accountable for each euro. Yes, the Court of Auditors and Parliament’s Budgetary Control Committee look at how we spend – and how we document – each and every euro. There is what we call an ‘error rate’, but for these operations, we put all the preconditions in place to monitor each euro spent and ensure that it is spent according to the needs, and to the benefit, of the poorest people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we should be proud of our assistance and positive example. The European Union has brought other donors to this table where we share what we have. We should be proud that other countries – emerging economies – are joining the team of those who are supporting countries in need, and supporting people in need.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is especially true today. Two weeks before Busan, we should concentrate on effectiveness – on effectiveness in the investment sense. Yes, this is investment. Countries like Poland understand that foreign support can be investment, enabling countries to become stable and independent. This is how we in the Council see our official development assistance. We would like to support those who can achieve stability later on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Certainly, it is extremely important to share, and discuss, values and rules with the new donors. Busan, and our joint position for Busan, will be the space where we can discuss the rules with new donors. One of the most important rules, especially for us in the European Union and in the Council, is the issue of transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given that we are spending public money, first of all, we should be transparent on our side. On the other hand, we expect this transparency also on the recipient side. We discussed this in the Council yesterday. When we think about budget support, we discuss the responsibilities on their side, and what kind of conditionality we should apply when placing so much trust in a country to support the budget directly at sectoral level.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also understand that if we do not invest in development, we will be forced to provide humanitarian assistance. We see this situation in the Horn of Africa. We see that the lack of resilience in local communities leads to famine – a situation which should not be happening at this time. Unfortunately, it is happening, precisely because there is not enough development, and we cannot provide effective support to these communities and these countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, in response to Mr Berman’s comment, yes, we should support entrepreneurship. This is exactly where the key to development lies: in finding a way to empower local partners and local communities, with our support, to set off on the path to development.</p>
      <p sl="en">To sum up, I would like to say again that we should be proud of what we have done, and we should share with others the values and the standards we try to uphold.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, when it comes to innovative financial instruments, we need them both for ourselves, to support our economies, but also to support those who are in need, especially when we are talking about our neighbourhood in Africa. This is really also about our security. Without development in these regions, we will also be in trouble. This is why we should try to build solidarity with the new donors to provide reasonable assistance to these countries.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Filip Kaczmarek, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2010 (2011/2120 (INI)) (A7-0315/2011).</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Mr Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is an important aspect of democratic cooperation with the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states. Through the regularity and quality of its work, the Assembly has succeeded in establishing itself as a key player in North-South cooperation. We want EU-ACP cooperation to be a partnership, and in the Assembly this is, in fact, the case. The parliamentarians from the ACP countries are our partners.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Joint Parliamentary Assembly met twice in 2010. The 19th session was held in Tenerife in April, and the 20th plenary session was held in Kinshasa from 30 November to 3 December. Nine resolutions and the Declaration on the Second revision of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement were adopted. One regional meeting was also held during the year, in the Seychelles. Lastly, in 2010, the Working Group on the Working Methods of the Assembly, established in order to enhance the Assembly’s political role as well as to provide for improvements in efficiency, began its work. The Commissioner with responsibility for development, Mr Piebalgs, who is present here today, took part in the work of the Assembly. The Co-Presidents of the ACP-EU Council also attended the first session, but only the ACP Council was represented in Kinshasa. The absence of the European Union Council for Question Time was acutely felt, and the Assembly agreed to communicate its regret over this matter to the High Representative, Ms Ashton, urging her to ensure that this was remedied for future sessions. I am pleased this matter has been resolved and that Ms Ashton has agreed that at the next session, which is in fact taking place in Lomé in a week’s time, the Council will be represented by Mr Stanowski.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Assembly’s standing committees met four times: twice alongside the plenary sessions, and twice between sessions in Brussels. As you know, the committees’ main role is to draw up reports which are subsequently adopted at the plenary sessions. Moreover, the committees are responsible for following up resolutions by hearing the Commission officials with responsibility in the relevant areas. This also provides an opportunity for in-depth dialogue on the action taken on resolutions which have been adopted. The Committee on Economic Affairs, Finance and Trade was entrusted with an additional responsibility, that of scrutiny of the regional strategy papers for the different ACP regions. The Committee appointed co-rapporteurs for each regional strategy paper, the conclusions of which were adopted in the session in Tenerife.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Commission subjects country and regional strategy papers to parliamentary scrutiny by both the European Parliament and the ACP countries’ national parliaments. It is important for the Committee on Development and the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to monitor the situation and ensure that effective use is made of this means of parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Assembly also plays a key role in monitoring the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements. Hearings of the head negotiators on both sides, meetings with economic and social players and interaction between European and southern parliamentarians have helped to make the process more transparent and have made it easier to take local issues into account.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In 2010, the European Commission and the ACP countries negotiated proposals for the second revision of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement. The revision provides for an enhanced role for the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in the scrutiny of other institutions as well as for the regionalisation of the ACP group being brought about by the Economic Partnership Agreement process. It is important for the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to monitor these developments extremely closely, because the future of the Assembly itself is going to depend on their results. I have tried to include these matters in my report. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, let me congratulate Mr Filip Kaczmarek on his excellent report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2010. As the honourable Members will know, attending JPA meetings has been a top priority for me since my appointment as Commissioner for Development, and it will remain so.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the EU co-Chair, Louis Michel, for his tireless efforts to enhance the leading role that the JPA has to play in nurturing and developing a truly democratic dialogue between the representatives of the European Union and ACP Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that strengthening the political nature of the JPA and its oversight functions – as reflected in the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement signed in Ouagadougou in 2010 – is of paramount importance. Not only will it ensure that the agreement functions democratically, more importantly; it will also usher in a new and more effective interaction between the joint institutions, namely, the Joint Council and the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the entry into force of the second revision, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly will be fully able to exercise its powers of democratic scrutiny by discussing and commenting on the ACP-EU Council of Ministers’ annual report on implementation of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, with the economic partnership agreements and other trading arrangements, the European Development Fund and strategy papers included as subjects for discussion, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly now enjoys greater parliamentary oversight functions. On this point, I would like to thank Parliament for acknowledging that, in sending the draft country and regional strategy papers to the JPA, the Commission had fulfilled its promises.</p>
      <p sl="en">The improvements brought about with the revision of the Cotonou Agreement do not end there. I believe that developing the national parliamentary dimension, an aspect emphasised in your report, will help promote the broader and more inclusive partnership we seek. It is certainly a move that the Commission welcomes, in line with its policy to foster country ownership and democratic governance. The Commission encourages and supports efforts by partner countries to build up parliamentary oversight capacities so that the use of public funds is subject to proper supervision.</p>
      <p sl="en">An assessment of European Commission support to parliaments in the ACP region during the past decade found that it amounted to just over EUR 100 million, spread across some 30 countries, most of them in Africa. While our initial efforts focused mainly on law making, recent support has increasingly addressed parliaments’ oversight duties. Building on that assessment, we have now completed the reference document entitled ‘Engaging and Supporting Parliaments Worldwide: EC Strategies and Methodologies for Action to Support Parliaments’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Together with our already healthy collaboration with Parliament’s Office for Promotion of Parliamentary Democracy, this document will help the Commission both achieve more with the parliamentary support it offers and contribute to fulfilling its policy commitments in this field.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the role of national parliaments is even more important in the countries where budget support is used. The Commission audit publishes on our website the exact amount each country receives in budget support.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to remind Members of this House that the Commission is rated as one of the most transparent organisations in the world. Furthermore, there is a wide range of reporting covering budget support issues, such as the Annual Report on External Assistance, country fiches on budget support sent to Member States and the European Parliament, country evaluations and, in ACP countries, the joint annual reports on the implementation of the country strategy papers.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 13 October 2011, the Commission adopted a communication on the future approach of EU budget support to third countries. This revised budget support policy highlights the need to link budget support to the fundamental values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and to bolster the assessment of eligibility criteria. It also seeks greater transparency by ensuring that this becomes one of the eligibility criteria in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this regard too, the Commission is eager to take up the excellent suggestion contained in Mr Kaczmarek’s report and develop closer relations with the national parliaments when asked to do so, naturally while fully respecting the national sovereignty of each ACP country.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for procedure, the Commission recently presented a proposal to the Council to conclude the agreement on this second revision of the Cotonou Agreement and to start the ratification process at EU level. We hope that Parliament will give a favourable opinion to the Council on this so that provisional application can begin at the earliest opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the EU is a world leader in development aid. Every year, we send hundreds of millions of euro to our partners in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. There are experts to see that this work is effective and sufficient, and that it has sensible structures and rules. They draw up reports, background documents, assessments and recommendations. Europe acts on the basis of these documents.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The significance of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, however, is a different matter – creating space for personal meetings between the elected representatives of parliaments, as well as an opportunity to discuss problems at this level. The joint discussions on problem topics enable us to understand one another, get down to the essential details that are not to be found in any report, and explain positions that would otherwise often remain misunderstood.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Cotonou Agreement is vital for cooperation between Europe and the African, Caribbean and Pacific states. The Joint Parliamentary Assembly plays an irreplaceable role in fulfilling this agreement – if only by adding a genuine human dimension to the numbers and tables on amounts of development aid. I would like to congratulate Mr Kaczmarek on the drafting of this report.</p>

    <intervention id="2-733-000" speaker_id="4532" name="Michael Cashman" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the S&amp;D Group but also as Parliament rapporteur on the revision of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement – the framework of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Congratulations to the rapporteur because the report takes an integrated approach on the cooperation between the EU and the ACP countries. The JPA has played an important role in monitoring the negotiations on, in particular, economic partnership agreements. The report quite rightly calls on parliaments to exercise close parliamentary scrutiny of the European Development Funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the EU Council was absent from the 20th session in Kinshasa, and that sent entirely the wrong message. So I hope that it will be present in Togo for the 22nd session at the end of the week: this would send the right message to ACP states. However, I regret that such issues as mass sexual violence, notably in DR Congo, are often only touched upon in order not to have a thorough debate. The JPA should be a platform to embrace such issues and get them on the table in a frank and robust discussion, especially as the debate could have happened in Kinshasa.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me turn to the Cotonou Agreement which Parliament is asked to ratify. However, the explicit refusal by the ACP in particular to include all grounds of discrimination and the principle of non-discrimination will make it extremely difficult for me to recommend to this House to agree the proposed Cotonou text. Let us be open and transparent on this issue. There is only one ground which is a cause of dissent between the EU and the ACP states, and it is non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Debates that we have had at the JPA level have been heated, often misinformed, and clearly mark a dividing line between us. But I want to send congratulations to the co-chair, Louis Michel, for his courage and his commitment to human rights and equally to others who have the courage to speak out in the JPA. The report insists that the principle of non-discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation, will not be compromised in the ACP-EU partnership. The EU will stand up for these values and will not back down.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, let me state the obvious: universal values declared at the UN must apply universally. Human rights conventions are not an à la carte menu; they define civilised societies. It is for that reason that we will defend what we believe is the principle of the universality and indivisibility of human rights.</p>

    <intervention id="2-735-000" speaker_id="840" name="Charles Goerens" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly can be interpreted in both a positive and a negative way.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us start with the negative way, because I always like to end on a high. Overall, the responsibility of both African and European parliamentarians remains very limited, first and foremost, in the way the partnership is funded. Indeed, the European Development Fund does not come under the European Parliament’s budgetary prerogatives and with respect to the allocation of funds from the European Development Fund to African countries, there is every reason to believe that parliamentary supervision and the involvement of African parliaments in their country’s budgetary affairs leave a lot to be desired.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, considering the low level of commitment of many African parliaments in their country’s budgetary affairs, the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly looks more like a club of people who talk a lot but have nothing to say.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Vice-President of this Assembly, I have to say that I am not always very proud to be part of a Bureau of an Assembly made up of people who are given budgetary powers, especially in small doses. Every balanced political system has checks and balances. This state of affairs cannot go on. This anomaly cannot be made to last. The second reason for my negative interpretation is the Council’s insufficient – and the term is much too weak to describe what I feel on this matter – involvement in the Assembly debates. Last year, during our meeting in Kinshasa, the Council was absent. It was not represented at ministerial level; the European party should be ashamed of itself. This situation is totally grotesque. Who are they trying to kid? Who stopped the Union’s Presidency from sending someone to represent the Council’s position on the EU-ACP partnership? Let us remember that it is the Council that gives the Commission the mandate to manage the funds of the European Development Fund. It is the Council that has the power to approve the broad outlines of this policy. This situation, too, is unhealthy and cannot continue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to finish on a slightly more positive interpretation. I believe that this more positive interpretation is materialised by the role of political driving force that our Assembly plays. This Assembly is vested with a power of political impetus, it is fair to say. The work is organised in such a way that information circulates on the main themes of EU-ACP cooperation. That is all very well, but for political impetus to bring to bear in the long term, those who can facilitate this work through their debates need to have a certain amount of power. A guard dog with no teeth will end up not being perceived as a guard dog any more. We have to be aware of this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another reason for my slightly more positive interpretation is that the Assembly is an interesting platform for exchanges and I believe Mr Cashman has just referred to that. Even the most sensitive issues can be discussed there. These are issues on social debates that are uncomfortable. All the subjects that relate to minority rights can be uncomfortable, but the EU-ACP Parliamentary Assembly knows no taboo and here, too, I would like to pay tribute to Louis Michel, our Assembly’s Vice-President, who has made sure that no aspect of these issues has been overlooked.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I am also keen to congratulate Mr Kaczmarek, who found more positive elements than I did in his report. That shows how much research work he has done. I should like to encourage him to persevere along these lines. It could have an even more positive influence on the future speeches that I will be called on to make in this context. Thus, by way of conclusion, let us highlight that things are far from being perfect. Consequently, there is room for improvement. I hope that outside the European Parliament, other institutional players are also aware of what I have just said and we need everyone to be involved if things are to improve.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I, too, am not very proud to be here. There is only a small number of us to discuss what is, after all, an Assembly that deals with issues of great importance that affect a large population and a region of the world that is paying an extremely high price, which, in the end, serves to reveal all the issues that we are raising today, be it climate change or issues around energy, finance and democracy. It is probably this part of the world, the African continent and the countries of the Caribbean and Pacific, that faces these issues most acutely. The parliamentarians who are here, who are doubtless those who are the most interested in being part of the ACP–EU Joint Assembly and maybe also the Committee on Development for some of us, or in other parliamentary committees, show to what extent we can be isolated when working on such an important issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To echo the words of Mr Goerens, is the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) a club with a few well-meaning friends of Africa who chat in the sunshine while taking a bit of Malarone and anti-malarial medicine before leaving, or is it a genuine instrument?</p>
      <p sl="fr">On this point, I agree with him: probably a bit of both. A bit of both, because I think that this Assembly is both a remarkable sounding board, a unique and invaluable place of debate, meeting and dialogue – and I am grateful to the rapporteur for having highlighted these extremely positive aspects – but, at the same time, we must, at all costs, strengthen the power and levers of a parliamentary assembly, not only for the budget, but on other aspects too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall take an example that is close to my heart, for which I had already put forward proposals in the context of the reform of the JPA: the follow-up of the economic partnership agreements. We have been overtaken, as it were, by another place, other follow-up places, the follow-up of the economic partnership agreements. Whatever one’s view is on the content, we need a democratic follow-up. I call for the Committee on Economic Affairs of this Joint ACP-EU Assembly to be the one that deals with the follow-up of the economic partnership agreements, otherwise it makes no sense. Our budgetary power is already small. Admittedly, we have a power of impetus, dialogue, meeting, of taking into consideration a series of problems, but if we cannot follow up on the economic aspect, whatever we may otherwise think and whatever our point of view on the economic partnership agreements, if we are not able, within the JPA, to follow up on them, question them and be the follow-up committee for these agreements, which really are the heart of economic policies in the relations between the European Union and these countries, I think we would miss an extremely important point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I come back with the idea that we could reinvest the JPA committees with real subjects of democratic control, real issues and not only, as we are currently doing, quite well for that matter, motions, resolutions, debate texts like the one we have just discussed on precisely all the democratic issues, on political power changing hands in African countries, on a series of issues that are central, but that are, in the end, only reference texts. I urge us to take more power in this Assembly and to give ourselves the means to exercise real powers of parliament and joint assembly, in relation to the Commission which is working, among other things, on the economic partnership agreements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe, therefore, that there is a very interesting link here. I ask you and I put the question, ladies and gentlemen: are we ready, yes or no, with this report and, in future, to go a bit further in the Joint Assembly’s application on a democratic and parliamentarian follow-up that is a bit more powerful than the one we currently have, or else we may turn into a mere club of friends of Africa, which is very well-meaning but altogether inadequate for the parliamentarian function that is ours?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it is regrettable that there are not even 20 people in the Chamber, but on their behalf, I would like to commend the rapporteur, Mr Kaczmarek, for a very good and professional report. Both the main points and the details have been presented with great skill. I have attended a large number of meetings of the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly, in Mali, Papua New Guinea, the Netherlands and many other countries. It is a much-needed instrument, not only in terms of aid, but also for the purposes of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Of particular importance is the development of parliamentary scrutiny in these countries. We need to make our partners enthusiastic about this idea. Often, they are not entirely democratic countries. We must not export ideologies or impose our values, and much less our anti-values. We do need to help, but also – and I say this most emphatically – we should be keeping a very close check on the money we donate, because at a time of crisis, European taxpayers are demanding that we keep track of this money. What I am saying may not be popular, but it seems to me that it does need to be said very clearly. At the same time, I must emphasise that development aid is very necessary, and it is good that we are providing it.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, we would like to bring into this debate an issue that concerns us greatly, into which the Joint Parliamentary Assembly of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) and EU will absolutely have to go further. It is the issue of expropriation of land – known as ‘land grabbing’ – in ACP countries. A number of reports mention the enormous area involved in this process of expropriation of land for producing biofuels, and for feeding speculation on the price of land and foodstuffs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The expression ‘expropriation’ is not misplaced, as that is what this is. The euphemistic description ‘land acquisition’ that is sometimes used obscures the effects and consequences of the process, which involves expelling farmers and local communities from their lands.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union has responsibilities with regard to this, both because many of the companies at the forefront of this process are European, and because legislation on fuels of so-called ‘renewable’ origin is encouraging the race for the ACP countries’ arable land. This race threatens biodiversity, degrades soils and other natural resources, and tends to dangerously accentuate the food deficit in many of these countries, leading to hunger and destitution.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Another issue that concerns us is the conclusion of so-called ‘economic partnership agreements’ (EPAs) and the European Commission’s insistence on free trade.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As the rapporteur rightly says, more attention needs to be paid to the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. If you have paid attention to this body over the course of the last year, the repeated resistance of the ACP countries to EPAs – which is fair, legitimate and entirely understandable – cannot have escaped your notice. The way that they have been conceived means they could be very lucrative for some European multinationals, but will be disastrous for these countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In conclusion, we would like to raise an issue here that is as old as it is current: that of debt and servicing debt.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The economic and financial crisis and its effects on the ACP countries require the cancellation of this enormous burden, which is a debt that has already been paid several times over yet is still growing, so as to bring an end once and for all to this unacceptable expropriation of wealth, and effectively help these countries to find a sovereign and independent path to development and social progress.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, Mr Kaczmarek has presented us with a report on the activities of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly of African, Caribbean and Pacific states and the EU in 2010. As well as listing the various activities of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), the report draws attention to the discord among EU representatives over the implementation of the Cotonou partnership agreement. The absence of an official Council delegation at the 20th meeting of the group in Kinshasa, where discussions took place over a revision of the agreement, is clear evidence of this.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The report also draws attention to the dangerous phenomenon of land grabbing in poor developing countries, which leads to an exploitation of the food sources of small-scale local land users, and the loss of access to the land and of food security for the population. The urgency of this situation also gives rise to the challenge directed towards the JPA and the European Commission for ACP parliaments and governments to support the full right of the domestic population to the land, and to introduce effective measures to prevent the large-scale acquisition of this land.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Even though it can be stated, according to the report, that political dialogue on the floor of the JPA is improving, the attitude to certain topics such as the position of women, gender violence and human trafficking still remains an unresolved issue in many countries. The report describes the benefits and shortfalls of the JPA, and confirms the need to maintain a permanent dialogue with the countries represented in the Association of African, Caribbean and Pacific States.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Kaczmarek for an excellent report. We do not all have the opportunity to be represented in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, but I think that it is extremely useful for the entire Parliament to gain some idea of what goes on in this forum. As has been mentioned, it is the most important parliamentary body bringing together representatives from Southern and Northern countries. It discusses important issues, including conflict prevention and settlement.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like, in actual fact, to mention one example. I remember that after the much-discussed, controversial elections in Côte d’Ivoire last year, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly was one of the first international bodies to state, during its meeting in Kinshasa, that the electoral process had been hijacked by Laurent Gbagbo. This was a first clear sign at global level that the Gbagbo regime’s attempts to ignore the wishes of the Ivorian people would not be tolerated.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the resolution which we initiated in the European Parliament on the situation in Côte d’Ivoire, we obviously referred to this stance adopted by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. Unfortunately, this does not always happen, and I would like to encourage my colleagues to take into account the texts adopted in this unique forum, if we want to be consistent. I believe that it is a real opportunity for us to be able to benefit from the contribution made by our partners in the South, one which we must not waste.</p>

      <p sl="es">After saying that I agree with a great deal of what has been said here and the text that we will vote on tomorrow, I would like to express some pleasure, some concern and a few ideas on the work that Parliament has done and will continue to do through the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am pleased with the work done by Louis Michel, as co-President of the Assembly, and by our friends in the Commission, led by Mr Piebalgs, for the interest and care they have shown and their characteristically straightforward, sincere and efficient participation in our work.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I am concerned that, absorbed by the rest of their work in Parliament, our representatives are becoming noticeably absent from the Joint Assembly, the work of which we are discussing here today.</p>
      <p sl="es">It seems clear to me that members who give priority to other concerns should take a good look at the situation and either give their work in the ACP-EU Assembly the importance it deserves, or make way for other members who may have more time to devote to this activity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, I feel that Parliament itself should place more focus on this area of work and understand the political importance of the Cotonou Agreement, which is the most representative example of North-South cooperation, involving almost 80 developing countries around the world, as well as the 27, soon to be 28, Member States that make up the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">At a time when world governance needs to be coordinated on a multilateral basis, our ACP partners offer enormous political potential for organising joint actions on the international stage.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament should also pay greater attention to the resolutions that our delegates adopt with our ACP colleagues in the Parliamentary Assembly. We should not continue adopting all kinds of resolutions on Parliament’s behalf without any note being taken of these texts, at least by the relevant parliamentary committees.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I, too, will begin by mentioning the importance of this report and of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which has successfully become established as a vital instrument in North-South cooperation. I am sorry that the Council’s representatives were absent from the Kinshasa meeting in 2010, but I hope that the European External Action Service will successfully strengthen its cooperation with this influential and extremely useful parliamentary body in the coming period, as highlighted by the election monitoring missions and the negotiations on concluding the Economic Partnership Agreements.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I support the criticism voiced in the report about the absence from the agenda of the meeting in Kinshasa of any item about the increase in acts of mass sexual violence and the general sense of impunity across Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to UN statistics, a disturbing number of 200 000 women and girls have been victims of rape or sexual violence in Congo during the last 15 years. This is why, in light of this, I call for progress to be made towards including on a permanent basis female leaders, local women’s rights organisations and civil society groups in all of these decision-making processes at every level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, all these regulations about the participation of women, young mothers and children must feature as part of national and regional strategy documents. In the same way, closer EU-ACP cooperation at parliamentary level is vital to the process of strengthening democracy in African, Pacific and Caribbean countries and, by extension, to their parliaments taking a more active role in defending human rights. I should also stress the importance of the fact-finding missions and the interaction between MEPs and members of parliaments in Southern countries, which have fostered transparent processes and resulted, at the moment, in a better assessment of the situation on the ground. Before concluding, I wish to express the hope that all the points mentioned will be taken into consideration for future sessions of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I wanted to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Kaczmarek, on his excellent work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is important that every year, the European Parliament take stock of the work of the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), insofar as this assembly plays a determining role in enhancing the North-South dialogue and in implementing a development policy that is founded on partnership and exchange.</p>
      <p sl="fr">2010 was an eventful year for the JPA, which met twice – as previous speakers have said – in Spain and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to discuss, among other things, the impact of climate change in ACP countries, the impact of the global crisis, freedom and independence of the media, and food security. In 2010, the JPA also sent the first election observation mission of this parliamentary term. I had the honour of co-chairing this mission in Burundi for the presidential elections with Mr Assarid, a Malian MP. This election observation mission was a real success. We were able to meet all the political players involved and thanks to the dual origin of this delegation, both ACP and European, we embodied a different legitimacy from European and African missions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore call on the JPA Bureau to renew this experience, since it will make it possible to put into practice solidarity and the special relations that unite the European Union and ACP countries.</p>

As Vice-President responsible for Human Rights, I really welcomed the active work of this service on the ground in individual countries where there are problems particularly, of course, with open violence against women. It is also necessary for our ambassadors in these places to help with the creation of strategic plans, and with the implementation of what we are striving for in our Joint Assembly. In conclusion, I would like to ask again what steps the Commission has taken or is taking against enforced collectivisation of the land. This has already been said here. We cannot ignore the expulsions of white farmers, whether in Zimbabwe or Kenya or elsewhere. I would also like to ask how powers will be shared between the Commission and External Action Service.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is definitely welcome that the relations between the European Union and the ACP states have grown tighter over the past few years. We need only look back at the rebuilding of Haiti, the reinforcement of the peace in Southern Sudan or, for that matter, at the progress made in the field of food security. I do not think anyone is saying that any of these are wrong or inappropriate, but we also cannot ignore the fact that both the economic and the social climate of Europe has changed substantially in recent years. Good and close relations with the ACP states are an important and forward-looking development, but neither in economic nor in social terms can Europe continue with the sacrifices it has been making so far. As regards economic aspects, it is the economy of the European Union that should be helped first, as there are regions within the EU itself, especially in the Eastern parts, where conditions virtually resemble those seen in third world countries; it is these that should be helped first and foremost. As regards society, we should bear in mind the enormous problem represented by immigration and migration. The case of Libya, for example, has shown that nearly one million immigrants entering Europe in a short period of time causes social tensions that can quickly lead to tremendous problems.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, I think that was very encouraging for the further work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, because I believe the experience that we get helps us in future meetings. The next meeting in Togo will now definitely be much more productive compared with the previous one.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like also to assure you that the issue of non-discrimination on a sexual orientation basis is also always on the agenda in my bilateral meetings, because we should also clearly understand that there is a need to discuss with partners why we believe that there should be change in their legislation. It cannot be done by force but by conviction and explanation, so I believe that the whole process of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly helps us to address the issues where much discussion is needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the issues that I have been asked about in one of the interventions was to do with land grabs. We definitely ask our partner countries for full transparency with land deals when we work with these countries. On the separation between the External Action Service and the European Commission, we do not make artificial boundaries. Basically, we all work for good and productive relations with our partner countries, so we try very much to work together on the issues at the same time. To make a rough distinction: the EEAS is responsible for external relations, the Commission is responsible for development cooperation, but there is no simple boundary and both services work together to achieve the best possible results.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would finish with again thanking the rapporteur for a lot of positive things in the report. Expectations are always high, but I believe it is a very difficult assembly because, on one side, the EU is very coherent, while the ACP countries are definitely much more divergent. It is not therefore an easy assembly, but it has proven its value and the leadership of Louis Michel is very helpful in this respect.</p>

Mr Martínez Martínez, Ms Roithová, Mr Gahler and co-President of the EU-ACP Assembly, Mr Michel, are people who do an enormous amount of work on its behalf.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree with what Mr Goerens said – not everything about the Assembly is good or as good as it could be. Please look at paragraph 2 of the resolution, in which we appeal for more participation and involvement of MEPs in the meetings and activities of the Assembly, because if we are going to change something for the better, we have to start by changing ourselves. We have had long discussions about this. It seems the only way to increase our involvement is better correlation with Parliament’s calendar, and we hope this will be possible in future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The comments made by Mr Cashman are also to be found in our resolution. We note the deficit of the principle of non-discrimination, and refer to this in paragraph 18, and we note the fact that in Kinshasa, we did not say enough about the violence in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, so aspects which are less favourable are also to be found in the text. However, I am very pleased that there are more positive than negative aspects, because this means we can look to the future with optimism, and I hope that it is, in fact, these positive aspects which will determine the course of the further work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.</p>

The family of a woman who enjoys equality is also better educated and healthier. This accelerates a society’s economic growth.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the position established by the Council at first reading (10303/2011 – 2010/0044(COD)) with a view to the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and the Council establishing a European Union action for the European Heritage Label (rapporteur: Chrysoula Paliadeli) (A7-0331/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-763-000" speaker_id="97007" name="Chrysoula Paliadeli" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="el">Madam President, the idea for the European Heritage Label was initially tabled in 2005 as a transnational initiative designed to highlight sites connected with European history, the creation and role of the European Union, and the values on which it was founded.</p>
      <p sl="el">In that particular form, the European Heritage Label has been awarded to date to 64 sites in Member States of the European Union and Switzerland. These sites reflect a broad spectrum of symbolic concepts illustrating intangible values and material cultural monuments to our common European civilisation.</p>
      <p sl="el">In November 2008, the European Council expressed the intention of making the label an official EU action. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the adoption of the European Heritage Label, in its European form, would be completed under the codecision procedure.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Commission text was communicated to the European Parliament in March 2010. A few days later, I was appointed to draft the relevant report, which was adopted by a large majority here in Strasbourg a year ago, marking the start last December of negotiations with the other European institutions to create the final legislative framework.</p>
      <p sl="el">The result of this long but very constructive process, which was supported by excellent cooperation on the part of the Commission and Council representatives and clear guidance from the chair of the Committee on Culture and Education and, of course, excellent cooperation with the other shadow rapporteurs, is the legislative act that will be put to the vote tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="el">Once again, I should like, as I stand here, to thank everyone who participated in this joint effort to create a broadly targeted label based on clear-cut criteria, a more rational approach and, most importantly, continuous evaluation compared with the previous transnational label. This conversion from an intergovernmental procedure to a European action was no easy task. We needed to deal with the old label respectfully, but critically, in order to give due weight to the new label, to ensure its viability, and to guarantee clear criteria, transparent selection procedures and its regular application.</p>
      <p sl="el">We started by accepting the symbolism of this action as the most important criterion; in other words, the sites to be labelled would be selected not for their beauty, but as three-dimensional reflections of the ideas and values on which European civilisation is based and the European Union was created. Our basic requirement was the educational value of the sites labelled to the young generation, the networking of sites and their attraction to tourists.</p>
      <p sl="el">The main issues that concerned us were: a possible change of name, so that it clearly declared its identity as an EU action; unfortunately, this was not accepted by the Committee on Culture at the initial stage and the name of the old intergovernmental label was therefore retained. However, we made important changes to the Commission text and here I owe a great deal to my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and to the constant exchange of views with the Commission and Council representatives at the two official meetings and in numerous informal meetings held in support of the codecision procedure.</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, we secured the participation of the European Parliament on an equal footing in the panel of experts which was set up. Secondly, the European Parliament was kept informed by the European Commission at every stage of the procedure to apply this action. Thirdly, there will be complete transparency at all stages of the action, from the initial selection at national level, with the facility for Member States to contest selections that affect vital priorities and the facility to withdraw the label from sites that no longer meet the criteria for the label.</p>
      <p sl="el">We amended the frequency of selection by States from every year to every two years, added one member to the panel of experts, so that the Committee of the Regions would be represented during selection and designation and, finally, we managed to postpone the widening of the scope of the action to other countries until after its first evaluation, because we felt that we wanted the European Heritage Label to become a well-established action which could then be used beyond the borders of the European Union and the European continent as an instrument for peaceful foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="el">We supported the acceptance of thematic sites in order to encourage cooperation at national, regional and transnational level, using networking as the instrument and again setting maximum possible cohesion at European level as the objective.</p>
      <p sl="el">I am basically satisfied with the Council’s first reading, because it incorporated most of my amendments and changes. Even if we have a number of objections on certain points, we consider the final text to be very important and we believe that the European Heritage Label may heal our dented and damaged European cohesion, especially in these times.</p>

      <p sl="en">As you know, this proposal was one of the very first to be adopted by the new Commission just after it took office, and it is one of our priorities in the field of culture for the years to come. Through this label, our aim is to give European citizens, especially young people, new opportunities to learn about our common yet diverse cultural heritage and about the history and the building of the European Union. I strongly believe that this will contribute to bringing European citizens closer to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Heritage Label will also help to increase cultural tourism, bringing economic benefits as well. The Commission is firmly convinced that the compromise that was reached is very positive for the three institutions, and that it is fully in line with the ambitions we all share for the Europe Heritage Label. This compromise will ensure the quality and the prestige of the label, which are absolutely primordial for the long-term success of the action.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also appreciate that the rules and procedures were kept as clear, light and flexible as possible so that they can be easily understood by all European citizens and easily implemented by the Member States and by the European Union.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about culture at European level, we always mention the sum of the cultures of the different Member States that everyone should discover and make their own, but we rarely talk of a common heritage, a European heritage that transcends the history of each nation, reflecting the intense interaction and rich exchanges that have linked us for centuries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Heritage Label was originally an intergovernmental initiative that was already testament to Europe’s cultural roots. Which sites were labelled? The Acropolis in Athens, the cradle of humanity’s first democracy. The Cluny Abbey, at the crossroads of Romanic civilisation, which saw the birth of European humanism. The Gdańsk shipyards, stronghold of the Solidarność union, whose courage changed the face of Europe. The house of Robert Schuman, a political visionary and founding father of the European Union. All are so many places where one can see our common history and the values that we defend together.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Tomorrow, we will vote to turn this intergovernmental initiative into a Community project, to enhance the credibility, profile and prestige of this label by establishing transparent and rigorous selection criteria.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you to Chrysoula Paliadeli and the spirit of openness she has shown to defend a quality label awarded every other year, which encourages cooperation in promoting transnational sites, has an independent panel of experts fairly appointed by the institutions, and which finally does not reward a site’s beauty or architectural quality but its symbolic value for European integration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We wrongly attribute to Jean Monnet, Europe’s founding father, the quote ‘If we had to do it again, I would start with culture’. The success of this formula is based on the idea that our Union was first economic, then political, but has never been cultural. Nonetheless, Europe was a community of painters, philosophers, artists and writers well before the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) or the Treaty of Rome.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is not about creating an artificial European culture but rather about recognising the heritage we share. The European Heritage Label is an essential initiative to promoting a cultural Europe because it enables it to be recognised, taught and be influential.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would like to start by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Ms Paliadeli, as well as our entire committee and the Commissioner, Ms Vassiliou, for the fact that we were able to put together a genuinely good text, and also push through this idea in a debate in Parliament. Unfortunately, it was timed for 22.00, of course, which is perhaps rather detrimental. Perhaps we might occasionally replace a debate on economics with a debate on culture sometime in the morning – but let’s get back to business.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I welcome this initiative, of course, since it is unique and differs from the Unesco World Heritage List and the Council of Europe’s European Cultural Routes initiative. I consider it important, because it can strengthen local and regional identity, as well as European integration. The label should promote the common cultural heritage of the Member States while respecting national and regional diversity and supporting the cultural diversity of territories. It is important for citizens to learn about Europe and to value the monuments and know-how of individual regions and towns, thus strengthening the shared sense of belonging to the EU. The label can also make European cities and regions more attractive, thus supporting growth and employment at local and regional level. I also welcome the fact that it is not really about protecting localities as such, but rather about how these monuments can offer an educational dimension for young people in particular.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In this context, it is, of course, important that we cover such an intergovernmental initiative with a European label and that we cover it with an EU label. There is no reason for us not to do this. It is an excellent and viable project, and the EU has an interest in it. Cooperation and support for culture in these difficult times for almost no cost at all is an opportunity that must be exploited. Support for education concerning culture – concerning that which is beautiful in us – is important for the forming of future generations, and the protection of these monuments is therefore in our interest.</p>

This document is not a bad one, it is not something to which we are strongly opposed or which we reject as a matter of policy. However, it is one of those documents which was not really necessary. I think that with regard to such documents, one could follow the advice of a certain philosopher which says that we should eliminate unnecessary entities – and I have the feeling that this document is just such an unnecessary entity and that perhaps, in our capacity as politicians or as the European Union, we ought not to be working on it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am not fully convinced, as the Commissioner and Ms Neveďalová are, that introducing the European Heritage Label will, in fact, stimulate the economy and tourism. I do not see such a direct connection and I fear that the money which will be invested in this project – all those panel members of whom the rapporteur spoke, all the experts who will have to be used for this – will be financed from the budget, from the taxpayer’s pocket, but that this will not necessarily make things better for the taxpayer.</p>

The ECR Group will abstain from voting on this precisely because we do not want to be hypocritical in supporting something which we think is unnecessary, which will be costly to taxpayers, and which, in my opinion, will not necessarily help – as it is supposed to do – enhance a sense of shared European identity.

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, in the debate on this report at first reading, we drew attention to the eminently exploitative understanding of culture current in the European Union. Culture is here viewed as an instrument to, in the words of the rapporteur, ‘strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to the European Union’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us talk, then, about culture in the European Union and let us talk about the scars that the European Union’s policies are leaving on culture. Let us talk, specifically, about the so-called financial bailout programmes of the European Union and the International Monetary Fund; programmes of veritable aggression; aggression against democratic values, against social and labour rights, and against culture too. It is the heritage being neglected; it is the penury budgets; it is the restrictions on the free creation and enjoyment of culture; it is the closure of schools; it is the increased prices of museums and cultural attractions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is in this context – largely, I cannot fail to point out, imposed by the European Union – that this report is being debated. We are talking about making efforts, on the basis of a symbolic cultural dimension, to legitimise integration whose direction is, unfortunately, ever more against the interests and legitimate aspirations of the public.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This initiative cannot, therefore, be separated from the intense ideological struggle, naturally linked to the extremely lively social struggle taking place throughout the European Union. This attempt will achieve little in this context, let me tell you.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We would also like to raise another concern. Heritage is a sensitive area, because it cannot be separated from history.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the European Union is becoming increasingly unpopular with citizens across the continent. It is rightly seen as out of touch, undemocratic and dictatorial. The euro, its grand unifying political project, is collapsing round its ears. Greece and Italy are the first to pay the price by having undemocratic government imposed on them.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what does the Commission do to halt this decline in popularity? It comes up with vain and crass projects in an effort to make itself appear more relevant to Member States. First, it attempted to place the EU flag – which is not meant to exist anyway – on the sports kits of national teams. Then it calls for the EU flag to be flown at sporting events, and now it comes up with the crackpot idea of EU heritage labels.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the report, it says that these EU heritage sites would be monuments, cultural landscapes, archaeological sites, and even places of remembrance. What an insult! Are you really suggesting that war memorials which honour the brave and fallen in two World Wars should have an EU plaque placed on them? There is only one memorial in England I can think of where it would be appropriate to stick an EU plaque, and that is the gravestone of Ted Heath, the man who betrayed Britain into the European Union. I do not think anyone would object to that, least of all him.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also says that the plaque’s aim is to strengthen the sense of belonging to the EU. It will not: it will just enrage the natives.

It is a crisis that threatens Europe with the menace of becoming spiritually empty and worn out. Globalism or, to use a slang word, ‘multi-culti,’ is stripping away and destroying all national and traditional cultural values, and leaves behind a great emptiness, a great void. In such times, any award or event that guides people, the European people, and youths back to healthy, normal Christian values, anything that leads European people back to nation, family and God, and gives youths a purpose and prepares them for the hardships of life is very important.</p>
      <p sl="hu">What I request is that the European Heritage Label not be an abstract award or an abstract concept, but be brought close to the people. I absolutely agree that it should indeed be used for job creation, but it is quite ambivalent to mention culture, tourism and the economy together, while the European Union is ordering Hungary to cut down the vines of some of its historic vine regions, or its apple plantations.

There is no need to call out the English soldiers who fought in the Second World War, because they were not fighting solely for England’s sake but to bring back liberty and democracy to the whole of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is no need to recount that this label comes at a price, as with anything of importance. In reality, this is a price which is comparatively small compared to so much of what we support, because by means of this provision, our territory will have factories, houses, libraries, historical centres, castles and places of worship that will remind us, in the diversity of our lands of origin and our nations, that we are children of the same culture, that we are children of the same land which we call Europe, and that, perhaps, if we always return to look at these places, we will find the answers to so many of the problems that trouble our Union today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to follow on from what Mr Scurria has said and to celebrate our common European heritage, because we do have a common European history despite what UKIP or the GUE or the ECR may think. We are part of the same continent and we do all share a history. That is what this label is seeking to celebrate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I certainly welcome the European Heritage Label. I think it is an excellent initiative. I think it will be good because it will bring economic benefits. There is little doubt that it will increase tourism, and it will also be good because it will provide an educational focus for those who wish to take advantage of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see the European Heritage Label as something to celebrate in these bleak economic times when things in Europe are not as good as they have been, something we can get on with and enjoy and see for the good of us all. It is about time that we viewed this in this spirit. It is a good initiative, a joyful initiative and something which we can all take part in. I would hope that those in other groups who do not see it like this will actually change their minds and go out and sell this concept to the rest of the European Union, to the rest of Europe, and indeed to the rest of the world.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I sit in the part of the Chamber where the voices of Euro-enthusiasts are not often heard, but in this matter, I am not as sceptical as some of the fellow Members who sit next to me. In Europe today, we face many problems, these problems divide us and it is increasingly difficult for us to agree on numerous matters, such as the budget or the common agricultural policy. No matter which of these important problems comes up, it causes controversies which are difficult to settle.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Therefore, something which can unite us is of great value, and the matter of cultural heritage may be one such thing, if we are going to seek agreement sensibly on this issue. I think the fundamental thing is a judicious coupling of European heritage with national heritage, and this very often means religious heritage, so as not to create conflicts of interest between European and national heritage. The results of this might be interesting and could be beneficial to Europe at this very difficult time. I imagine, for example, that a city in my region – Łódź – could serve as such a symbol, as its history and development have been shaped by people of different nationalities – not just Poles, but also Germans, Jews and even Russians. Showing such examples of European heritage should be good for the future of Europe. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I, too, should like to thank Ms Paliadeli for her very important work on this particular report, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, Ms Sanchez-Schmid from our group and all the others who worked on this report.</p>
      <p sl="el">The importance of the European Heritage Label, to pick up where Mr Scurria left off, is dual and two-way. It highlights diversity in Europe and, at the same time, reinforces the feeling that we live and share common historic monuments and common memories. However, it has an important added value when designed, mainly for the benefit of young citizens, to cultivate a common European conscience, the perception that Europe is an entity with different foundations but identical reference points.</p>
      <p sl="el">There are bright spots in European history; however, there are also points of which we are not proud but which, nonetheless, form part of it. Besides, the lessons from these historic errors were, to a decisive degree, what inspired and shaped the present European Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">The label does, of course, offer a unique opportunity to become more outward-looking from a cultural point of view, to highlight our history and culture to the rest of the world, to utilise monuments that, when we visit them, make us wonder in sadness why they have not received the recognition they deserve.</p>
      <p sl="el">As regards the broader benefits, I think that there can be no doubt whatsoever that the label helps to increase cultural tourism, bringing economic as well as other benefits. We should not forget that, especially at this time, at this time of crisis, at a time when the main objective is economic growth, culture can, I repeat, provide an important answer. It already accounts for 3% of European GDP and has the potential to account for much more. I am certain that, if we all make a positive contribution, the European Heritage Label will also make a positive contribution.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it is right that we are seeking common European roots, but let us not seek them selectively. If we do really want to return to our shared European heritage, then let us say boldly that it was, to a large extent, a Christian heritage. I am very glad about the voices in Parliament which say we have much in common, but it was also in this Parliament that very many people did not want the preamble to the European Constitution, which contained a reference to the Christian heritage of our continent, or what we call the ‘old’ continent. There is a certain hypocrisy in this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I very much welcome initiatives of this kind, by means of which young generations of Polish, French and German Europeans – Europeans of course, but not Europeans as such – can be shown their past. It is a step in the right direction, although I definitely would not want this initiative to involve too much bureaucracy, because this would only bring about a result opposite to the one intended.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Ms Vassiliou, ladies and gentlemen, once again, the European Parliament has shown that it can play a dynamic and active role, in this case with the resolution on the European Heritage Label, which is primarily aimed at strengthening European awareness, as defined in the report by the Committee on Culture and Education.</p>
      <p sl="de">At a time when the events of the crisis are making it clear to more and more people that no individual national state can meet the current challenges and problems on its own, Europe is sending out a clear signal with the European Heritage Label, which will increase European citizens’ sense of belonging to the European Union and which clearly focuses on young people and on those critics who are still not convinced of the value of Europe in their own lives.</p>
      <p sl="de">All the Member States must nominate two sites for the European Heritage Label which have played a key role in European integration. Values such as democracy, human rights, intercultural dialogue and the social market economy lie at the heart of our culture and our history and form part of our everyday lives. To give a better understanding of these values, I would like to mention two examples from my native country. One is the home of Ludwig van Beethoven in Vienna, where he completed his ninth symphony, from which the European anthem is taken. The second is the place on the border with Hungary where the Austrian foreign minister, Alois Mock, cut the barbed wire which formed the Iron Curtain together with his Hungarian counterpart, Gyula Horn, and ended the decades of separation between Eastern and Western Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should be pleased about the European Heritage Label and ensure that it is a success for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the culture of every civilised society includes the enhancement and documentation of its cultural heritage in order to allow the better dissemination of cultural values, and to pass these on to future generations. Making the common cultural and Christian heritage of Europeans visible, and emphasising common European values from the perspective of history and culture, gives the Union a new dimension which is closely connected with an enhanced sense of mutual belonging.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The future of the EU and its basic values depends on the extent to which its citizens and civil society get involved in long-term ideas about Europe as a single unit in terms of culture and values. In a time of material crisis of an economic or financial nature, when society needs to mobilise and adopt fundamental decisions on the direction it will take, it is particularly important to develop a cultural dialogue and increase the sense of shared ownership of the EU among our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The future vision of the EU is based on shared fundamental values. The European Heritage Label can therefore reflect and promote values such as freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, cultural diversity, tolerance and solidarity. In my opinion, special attention should also be paid to the fight against racism and xenophobia when awarding the label.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In conclusion, I would like to express the conviction that through this label, we can help to spread knowledge about culture and history and therefore to bring about a flowering of the cultures of Member States and greater understanding between the citizens and nations of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to express my satisfaction that the European Heritage Label is being transformed into a European Union initiative. The Union should give particular distinction to sites which have played a key role in European history. I fully agree with the idea that the symbolic value and educational dimension of a site should determine its inclusion as part of the European cultural heritage. In Poland, the label has been given to sites such as the Gdańsk Shipyards and the Cathedral of Saint Wenceslas and Saint Stanislas on Wawel Hill in Kraków, and in France to Robert Schuman’s House.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The criteria proposed by the European Parliament for awarding the label streamline the selection process from the technical point of view. It is good that the number of proposals from each Member State is limited to two and that there is a procedure for monitoring and upholding proportionality in the selection of sites. Growth in prestige of the label is also exceptionally advantageous from the point of view of European cultural tourism, which is very fashionable today and much in demand, and it is also associated with economic advantages.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Heritage Label will be an important factor in promotion and will also give rise to a forum for cooperation between labelled sites. I am counting on and believe in the success of this undertaking. I think that in the long-term perspective, it will help to enhance the shared European identity. I hope the label will contribute to a better knowledge of the history of our countries and nations. Sites which have been given the label can become an extremely important tool for education about history. It is important that they be places for meetings, discussions and dialogue and that they be full of life. Europeans today, as never before, need to draw on the traditions of our continent – Europe was built on Judaeo-Christian foundations, and these became, and were for centuries, the basis of the continent’s cultural strength.</p>

The spirit of the label would strengthen our values and our sense of belonging to the EU. By acknowledging diversity, we still strengthen intercultural dialogue. To emphasise this is particularly important for all of us. By laying down criteria for the selection of sites, and through the scope of the geographic criteria and clear and simplified provisions, we are taking steps towards citizens that must meet high expectations.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is important to finally transform this intergovernmental initiative into an official EU action. Objects that can be grouped on the basis of a specific theme and can apply together for the label represent an opening up towards young people compared to other initiatives in the field of cultural heritage. These are signs of caring, of which our youths are in great need.</p>

Founded in 1871 and opened in 1890, this library was described in the reports of that time as an intellectual repository for society, required for good administration. The site of the ‘V.A. Urechia’ Library was the first headquarters of the European Danube Commission, which began its activities in 1856 in Galaţi, tasked with ensuring freedom of navigation on the Danube. The European Council adopted the European Union strategy for the Danube Region 155 years after this Commission was founded, in recognition of the importance of the Danube Region to the EU’s past, present, future and cohesion. V.A. Urechia said that the strongest fortress is that in which citizens defend themselves with learning and science. The ‘V.A. Urechia’ Library in Galaţi is a fortress of European culture which deserves to receive the European Heritage Label.</p>

I only wish to point out one minor additional detail to those present, namely, that we should not forget that the time for the political agreement came during the Hungarian Presidency, at the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council meeting in May, and that this is where the decision-making process came to a conclusion. It was then that the deadlock was resolved and the compromise permitting us to be here today was reached between the three main bodies.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It was also then that this agreement on the remaining contested issues, such as the budget, the awarding of the label to certain sites and the competent institution as regards its withdrawal, could be reached.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the European Heritage Label will help people assume a sense of belonging to our continent’s common cultural area. Not only principles and European history, but also mutual understanding are elements which produce added value for the EU. The label initiative is focused on promoting designated sites, spreading information and increasing public access to them. We are therefore acknowledging that the project has not enjoyed the high profile it deserved during the intergovernmental phase. I welcome the agreement that has been reached with the Council, especially to simplify and clarify transitional procedures. I also feel that the issue of transnational sites is significant to the process of European integration.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I believe that we need to consider in the future providing access to this project for the European countries which are not yet part of the European Union, and I provide as an argument for this a symbolic EU initiative: Sibiu was designated as a European Capital of Culture when Romania’s accession to the EU was not certain. This designation was a real European success.</p>

The new label fortunately complements existing international programmes such as the UNESCO World Heritage List or the Council of Europe’s ‘European Cultural Routes’ programme. The general extension of European heritage is especially important and beneficial for Central and Eastern European countries and nations which joined the European Union later, are less well known, and were formerly isolated by the Iron Curtain, as the incorporation of their universal values into the common cultural heritage effectively facilitates their actual integration and their catching up with the EU.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, with the aim of boosting the public’s sense of belonging to the EU, the Commission is proposing to create a European Heritage Label to identify buildings or localities that are of symbolic value in terms of European integration and history of the EU. The participation in the use of the label is to be voluntary for countries, and each of the participating countries is to have the right, every two years, to propose up to two localities to a group of independent experts, from which a jury will select one locality from each state that will get the European Heritage label.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I applaud the fact that the European Commission is now thinking about the symbolic labelling of localities that are linked to the development of the EU in a significant way, to make real for young people the processes and events that had a formative effect on the Union. However, the initiative must be implemented very sensitively and unobtrusively, especially in the present period when, as a result of economic problems, citizens in many countries see the Union rather as an insensitive dictator.

That is something that we cannot all share, because we had different versions of those events. Some of the countries in the European Union were active participants in that manipulation and destruction of history.

I am pleased that today, we will reach a compromise with the Council, because during a crisis, we should talk about culture and our identity with even greater emphasis, and in contrast to what Ms Sinclaire has just said, we should learn lessons from history, which means that the European Heritage Label initiative should talk boldly about what was good and what was bad in Europe so that similar tragedies cannot be repeated in the future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Which is why it seems to me that the eminent Polish philosopher, Zygmunt Bauman, is correct here in saying that in the whole construction of Europe, the most important matter is that Europe is the sum of cultural horizons from which we can learn lessons because, after all, we are all each other’s neighbour. If we want to achieve benefits in the economy, education or tourism, based on the example of UNESCO, for example, we should learn the lesson of Mr Migalski’s words that this label and this initiative must be implemented properly and professionally, and that it must not be another unsuccessful or fairly successful initiative. So this is why I would like to appeal strongly to Ms Vassiliou for the cultural heritage label to be prepared in a truly professional way, so that in all the clamour for attention, it will be able to capture the imagination of all Europeans and achieve the right objective.

I should point out that the European Heritage Label complements other similar programmes, such as the UNESCO World Heritage List. The programme supports the exchange of good practices between sites, with the aim of improving the provision of information and communication. At the same time, the European Heritage Label harmonises environmental protection measures in the areas where the cultural sites are located.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I must admit that I did not expect such broad participation at this time, at after ten o’clock at night. I have listened very carefully to my colleagues’ speeches, including under the catch-the-eye procedure.</p>
      <p sl="el">May I therefore say that, as regards individual questions, the final text that we adopt will take account of the concern about cross-border cooperation and transparency and will take account of the concern of those who question whether we should, in fact, have such a label at these difficult times for Europe or if it should be seen as a luxury.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, culture is not a luxury; the application of the label should not be funded from European money over and above the small amount needed, mainly to cover bureaucratic and administrative requirements. On the contrary, local communities will be asked to fund their own participation in the action, meaning that it will galvanise local communities, and not only with a view to highlighting their local sites.</p>
      <p sl="el">We shall reward cooperation and that will support cohesion at national, regional and European level. Of course, one of the objectives is to widen the application of this action to countries that are due to become members of the European Union and to third countries that belong to the European continent and to countries outside Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, we felt that the trial period for this action should be limited initially to the 27 Member States of the Union. In four years, following the first evaluation, we shall see if we can widen it further. I believe that one of the reasons we have reached this economic crisis and a crisis in values is precisely because of the reduced importance the European Union has attached to culture.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe that this is the right instrument and that we should use it to regain the Europe of those who envisaged it not just as an economic union in difficulty, but as a cultural union. I therefore take the view that culture is perhaps the only instrument that can make a positive contribution in reversing this massive crisis we are living in, which will not, I trust, take us into worse times.</p>

This is why I think that we are debating this proposal, already at second reading, at a suitable moment when it can actually add value to the notion of a United Europe. Based on an intergovernmental initiative which has proved successful, the European Heritage Label has all the requirements also to continue in the same vein when it becomes an EU programme, not to mention that it also benefits from the experience acquired through other similar programmes, the most notable being the European Capital of Culture, which has an unquestionable impact.</p>

While the historical experiences of our nations may differ, we are all Europeans with the same fundamental values. It is important that we pay tribute to the events, people and places in our common past which have helped us to develop this unique union. Our unity in diversity is what makes us strong, and a common understanding of our neighbours and ourselves can only strengthen this bond. Places such as Athens, the birthplace of democracy, or events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 1989 Baltic Way, where, in spite of overwhelming force, people demanded freedom and the reunification of Europe, connect us all.
