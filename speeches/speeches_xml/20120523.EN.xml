      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Anni Podimata, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on a common system of financial transaction tax and amending Directive 2008/7/EC (COM(2011)0594 - C7-0355/2011 - 2011/0261(CNS) (A7-0154/2012).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, allow me first to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their contributions and their productive work, which was indispensable for the finalisation of this report. Allow me also – although this is not customary – to thank the Commission, and especially Commissioner Šemeta, because despite the initial reluctance to introduce an EU financial transaction tax, the Commission modified its position, endorsed the main points of Parliament’s arguments adopted in various resolutions in the past, and finally responded to our call and presented a legislative proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">I consider it a very fortunate coincidence that we are having this debate in plenary today, on the same day as the informal European Council summit, whose agenda is exclusively dedicated to growth and job creation, because I believe that the financial transaction tax is an integral part of Europe’s strategy to exit the crisis. This is because it can raise significant revenues which can be used for stimulating growth, job creation and smart fiscal consolidation, as well as public goods such as development goals and tackling climate change. This will bring a fairer and more balanced distribution of the cost of the crisis, which is today being borne by labour and the productive economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me remind you that we are all in favour of a global financial transaction tax, since the broader the jurisdiction the more effective the tax. Our challenge is how to reach a global agreement, and since Europe has the largest financial market in the world, it is up to us to make the first step and open the way. That is why we are in favour of an EU-wide financial transaction tax.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are aware that the unanimity rule makes it exceedingly difficult for us to advance on such issues. We have taken huge steps on enhanced economic and budgetary rules and compliance, which contrasts with a lack of progress on tax coordination. A minimum of tax coordination in the context of this enhanced budgetary and economic surveillance is certainly a must. It is an integral part of the new architecture which we are designing. We cannot be held hostage by a handful of Member States, and that is why we can support, as a first step, enhanced cooperation among a certain number of Member States – once we have exhausted our efforts to achieve an EU27 agreement, of course.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the technical aspects of the proposal, the success of the financial transaction tax depends on its design, which should leave no scope for tax avoidance. The report seeks to strengthen the design of the directive and make sure that the framework will be watertight and tax evasion minimised. We have introduced two new elements: the issuance principle, which complements the residence principle, and the ownership principle, which ensures effective enforcement of the law.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a financial transaction tax which can safely be introduced at EU level, or by certain Member States, without significant risk of relocation. Let us keep in mind that the cost of relocation will be much higher than the cost of compliance, due also to the very low rates.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me underline that the clear precondition for an effective financial transaction tax is its wide scope, covering all transactions without exemptions. Exempting institutions from the scope of the tax could pose systemic risks and encourage risky strategies. Exemption would open the door wide to tax avoidance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Dear colleagues, I call on you to support by a large majority this tax, without exemptions, because it is one of the fairest and most effective tools we have to exit the crisis and ensure that it does not happen again, and also because I believe that it is now time to give substance to our claim that the financial sector should be at the service of the real economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on behalf of the Danish Presidency I would like to thank Parliament for its continued interest in this important issue of taxation of the financial sector in the follow-up to the crisis. I am aware of Parliament’s keen and long-standing interest in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, we will discuss a possible common solution for taxation of financial transactions at EU level. The subject was highlighted in a resolution adopted in March 2010 on ‘financial transaction taxes – making them work’, as well as in a subsequent resolution in February 2011, which looked at innovative financing at global and European level. There have been many other resolutions on the wider issues of the financial crisis that have addressed this subject, and today we are debating a report by Ms Podimata on the Commission proposal for a common system for taxing financial transactions within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Members of this House will also be aware that the Council has been taking the issue of a financial transaction tax (FTT) very seriously. The Council fully agrees with Parliament on the need to ensure a fair contribution from the financial sector in the light of the huge costs and risks inflicted on Member States’ public finances by the financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before the Commission presented its proposal on an FTT, various options for further taxing of the financial sector were discussed extensively in the Council High Level Working Party on Taxation, as well as at ministerial level in the Economic and Financial Affairs (Ecofin) Council. Broadly speaking, the Council discussions have reflected different views from Member States as to which tax instrument should be given priority.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the end of last year, the Commission submitted to the Council a proposal for a directive on an FTT. The Polish Presidency announced a political discussion and a technical analysis of the proposal. This work was subsequently taken over by the Danish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given the importance of the issue and the interest in it, the Danish Presidency has engaged in an intense programme of work. We have accommodated the wish expressed by some Member States for a speedy process. There have been extra meetings at a technical level, as well as political-level discussions both at the Ecofin Council in mid-March and at the informal Ecofin meeting in Denmark at the end of March. These discussions have enabled us to make progress, and I expect we will have the issue on the agenda at the June Ecofin meeting.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Presidency concluded the first technical examination of this matter in March and, at the time, identified a number of issues that will require further attention, some of which are also of concern to Parliament. Among these are the risks of reallocation of financial activity outside the EU, and tax avoidance issues, if the EU were to move forward with its own FTT. The design of the tax should, to the greatest possible extent, accommodate such concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another question is whether such a tax should allow for possible exemptions – for pension funds, etc. That would naturally impact on its revenue potential and would lead to other competition-related challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then there is the impact of the FTT on growth and jobs, on banks’, companies’ and households’ borrowing costs, and on the functioning of financial markets in general. Not all aspects and possible effects of the tax are sufficiently understood, nor is there agreement on answers to all the questions that could be raised. It is clear that there are challenges to be overcome if the FTT is to be made workable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the comprehensive work that has been done and the good progress achieved to date, honourable Members will be well aware that not all Member States are able to support the Commission’s proposal. I note that adoption of the proposal requires unanimity. At the Ecofin Council, it has been decided that we should follow a two-track approach: while discussion on the basis of the Commission’s FTT proposal would continue, exploring room for possible compromise, we would look, at the same time and in the light of the Member States’ various points of view, at alternatives with regard to both the substantive and the procedural aspects of an FTT and with regard to other tax instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">This approach is designed to facilitate progress on the matter. One alternative, for instance, could be a financial activity tax applied by some Member States. Another could be a transaction tax that builds on some elements of stamp duty. While work along these lines must continue, there is also a wish among Member States in the Council to clarify matters and to reach a conclusion on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am looking forward to hearing your views, which will provide useful input for the Danish Presidency as it seeks to take forward the work in the Council. The Presidency will submit a report on this issue for the June Ecofin Council. This will give ministers an opportunity to discuss a way forward and will provide guidance, as to future options, for the incoming Cypriot Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to use this opportunity to thank Parliament and the rapporteur for their constructive cooperation on the ongoing work in the EU to further this discussion and to strengthen financial regulation in the light of the crisis. One of the main priorities of the Danish Presidency is to strengthen financial regulation so that future crises can be avoided. I sense that this work is accorded high priority by all the European institutions, including Parliament, and all the parties involved. I thank you for your attention.</p>

    <intervention id="3-010-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Algirdas Šemeta" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish first to thank the European Parliament, and in particular Anni Podimata, for the excellent work on the financial transaction tax.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an extremely important file for me because I truly believe in all that an EU FTT has to offer. It will create a fairer tax system in which the financial sector makes a just contribution to public finances. It will act as a market-based instrument which incentivises steady financial activity and deters high-risk speculation and, of course, the FTT will deliver substantial new revenues without asking any more of the ordinary citizens. This money can be channelled into growth-promoting measures, used to support growth-friendly tax reforms, or help to finance global challenges. Used as an own resource as proposed by the Commission, this would result in a net decrease in Member States’ GMI contributions to the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would now like to address four main issues related to our debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the Commission welcomes the idea of exploring how to widen the net of our transactions. In this context, elements inspired by the issuance principle should certainly be discussed. We believe, however, that this approach should be limited to instruments with a clear link to EU territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the Commission is not opposed to making the legal enforceability of a transaction conditional on the payment of the tax. However, the Commission does not see a reason to act at EU level. Member States should decide how to achieve this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the Commission would not support the exemption of UCITS and pension funds. We have defined a broad-based approach for tax neutrality, to avoid distortions of competition and to encourage long-term ‘conservative’ investments. The impact of the tax on pension funds should not be overstated.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, although a step-by-step approach could be considered if necessary, I do not believe this should be modelled on the UK stamp duty. That tax has too limited a scope and leaves most transactions, and notably those of professional dealers, untaxed. With such an approach, we would not meet our policy objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I really appreciate the strong support for this proposal that we have seen from the European Parliament up to now. I hope that I can rely on your continued support in making this tax a reality in Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="3-011-000" speaker_id="96987" name="Ricardo Cortés Lastra" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that this Parliament can make a financial transaction tax become a reality today. We are, therefore, facing a very important moment and a very important decision in order to be able to tackle this crisis and put forward a new growth model in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">This tax clearly has a very high social content, and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in particular has been trying to develop that content so as to foster solidarity and sustainability in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the Committee on Development, we have raised awareness considerably so that part of this revenue can be earmarked for solidarity and the aim of eradicating poverty throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would therefore like to thank both the Commission and the Council, and particularly the rapporteur, Ms Podimata, for the excellent job she has done, for the sensitivity she has shown towards the Committee on Development and, above all, for working with us so that part of that financial transaction tax can be spent on those who most need it.</p>

    <intervention id="3-012-000" speaker_id="4440" name="Anne E. Jensen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets">
      <p sl="da">Mr President, the Committee on Budgets looked at one particular aspect of the Commission’s proposed financial transaction tax, namely, whether some of the revenue from this tax could be used as a new own resource that would then replace part of the current national contributions to the EU’s budget. The Treaty does, after all, clearly state that the Union is to finance its budget from its own resources. Nonetheless, the majority of the budget is paid for by contributions from the national budgets, which are subject to all kinds of special arrangements in the form of rebates and rebates on the rebate. It is a complex, incomprehensible system that is in need of reform. The Committee on Budgets considers that a financial transaction tax could be a source of new own resources, since it would have broad geographical coverage and could generate significant revenues. Naturally, this would require all 27 Member States to be on board, and it is pretty clear that not all 27 countries want to be. Personally, I am opposed to this financial transaction tax, but I would like to thank the rapporteur for receiving the opinion of the Committee on Budgets constructively.</p>

    <intervention id="3-013-000" speaker_id="96876" name="Frank Engel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, while this morning our debate could be considered as merely going through the motions, given the situation in the Council, I would still like to reiterate that, in general, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection warmly welcomed the Commission’s proposals for three main reasons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, if we wish to avoid serious distortions in the internal market with regard to any type of financial transaction tax, it is essential that the land base for this tax is the EU, and nothing but the EU. Neither the euro area nor an alternative geographical arrangement would constitute an adequate base or have a suitable framework for it. Only the EU has an internal market. Only the EU has a budget. All other considerations relating to the budget and the correct functioning of the internal market can only be of worth if they are useful for the entire European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, we clearly stated that it should logically be a tax that favours certain types of healthy financial transactions which are necessary for the economy, such as the fund industry, which we proposed should be less heavily taxed than derivatives or High Frequency Trade, and that other types should be penalised. Finally, we insisted that this should be an own resource, because we should not create the first truly European tax simply to bail out Member States’ budgets.</p>

    <intervention id="3-014-000" speaker_id="40599" name="Sirpa Pietikäinen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly thank all the colleagues who have participated in this work for their excellent cooperation. Secondly, the rationale behind the financial transaction tax is worthy of great support. The FTT is needed for better transparency; to curb speculation and, in this way, to decrease systemic risk; to boost own resources and revenues; to encourage long-term investments; to cut down the pressure on other taxes; and to ensure a fair contribution from the financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this, it needs to have a model which delivers the targets. So that means it covers broadly both all markets and all financial instruments. A uniform capital allowance-based stamp duty would leave out up to 70% of financial markets; that could not deliver the targets of the financial transaction tax which has been proposed by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report and the message we are adopting today send a clear signal to the Council. The financial transaction tax has broad support, not only in this House but also amongst our citizens. Even though the negotiations are difficult, I would like to encourage the Council to take this message seriously and to shoulder its responsibility. It should try to find an approach enabling it to establish an all-inclusive, residence-based financial transaction tax for Europe. The model proposed by the Commission and advocated in this report is too good to be thrown away lightly.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-015-000" speaker_id="28308" name="Elisa Ferreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Ms Vestager, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, globalisation has brought with it disproportionate growth in the financial sector, where transactions are known to be currently 70 times greater than global wealth. The non-transparency and frequency of these transactions, along with high pay and very high risk, not only characterise the world in which we live today, but also constitute fundamental reasons behind the crisis that we are currently experiencing. However, it is ordinary people who have been forced to take responsibility and to shoulder the burden for the crisis to a far greater extent that the sector that caused it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This moment is therefore crucial. Given its importance, I personally would like to get to a situation in which this tax were brought in universally in all of the EU Member States and later extended to the rest of the world, with the active involvement of the Commission and the EU in general, under the G20. I would like it to cover all products, without exceptions. I would also like it to serve as a basis for the necessary strengthening of the EU’s own resources.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the short term, it is necessary to accept compromises, but we should not lose sight of the direction that we need to follow. This can only be achieved if the objectives are clearly identified by Parliament and by the Commission, and if they receive strong backing from the Council. That is what Europeans are looking for us to deliver today, and I can only express my thanks for the role played not only by Ms Podimata, who was tireless in this process, but all of those who have succeeded in overcoming their differences to arrive at this common position.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-016-000" speaker_id="28244" name="Wolf Klinz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all products and services are taxed, so one might well ask why financial transactions should not be taxed also. I can therefore fully understand the idea behind taxing such transactions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The financial sector has, after all, caused considerable damage in recent years, and is not exactly without blame for the difficult situation that we currently find ourselves in, particularly in Europe. The speculative losses of JPMorgan Chase that recently came to light bear witness once again to the fact that the financial industry really has not yet learnt from past mistakes. It seems that the greed of some players has still not been assuaged.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has tabled a very creative proposal, and the residence principle that it has proposed has been supplemented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with the issuance and the ownership principles. Together, these should actually ensure that the risk of financial transactions being shifted out of the EU to other regions of the world can be relatively well averted. Nonetheless, naturally, there are still issues outstanding.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unlike the Commissioner, I feel that we should, in fact, exempt pension funds, because I do not see why savers who are putting aside money for their old age should be penalised. Moreover, there are naturally a few questions regarding the practical implementation of how the tax is levied that have yet to be clarified, and last but not least, how the revenue is actually going to be used. What will go to the EU and what will go to the Member States?</p>
      <p sl="de">In our approach to resolving this, there are two things that we should not lose sight of. Firstly, we must not weaken Europe. Secondly, we must ensure that we do not fragment Europe further. We have to achieve the exact opposite – not fragmentation, but as much progress as possible on the harmonisation of our taxes.</p>
      <p sl="de">A global introduction of the tax is not feasible at present; we know that. Regrettably, we cannot introduce it EU-wide either. It appears that the British veto cannot be broken. The rapporteur’s suggestion that we proceed now by means of enhanced cooperation does not seem to me to be sufficient. If we were to push ahead with only nine or ten Member States, we would actually be contributing to further fragmentation in Europe. That is not what we want. That is why I feel that as a minimum, we must have all 17 euro area members plus a couple more on board.</p>
      <p sl="de">We therefore have to look for alternatives that would enable all countries to participate. I feel that we could even take the UK’s stamp duty as a starting point, and then of course expand it and include not just shares, but also bonds, derivatives and professional dealers. If we content ourselves with the current proposal and the mechanism of enhanced cooperation, then I believe we will be going down the wrong route.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – I would like to ask Mr Klinz something. The financial transaction tax is to become part of the European Union’s own resources.

How much will go to Brussels and how much will remain with the Member States is still a matter of debate. Even among the Member States, it has not yet been settled which Member State would receive the funds.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, this debate has already taken up quite a lot of our time in this period of office. The interesting development is that precisely through Parliament’s efforts, we have achieved a clear shift in the Council’s position and in the position of the Commission. Commissioner Šemeta, I am pleased that you have truly had a Damascene conversion on this. That is pleasing, and I fully endorse what you have said here.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the background that we must discuss is how we can implement this tax as generally and widely as possible on a broad tax base and as evenly as possible. That is precisely what we are wrestling with now. In other words, the issue is whether we will succeed in including as many taxpayers as possible, based on the proposed residence principle, so as to avoid competitive disadvantage. Parliament is therefore proposing that we supplement the Commission’s proposal by adding the principles of issuance and ownership. I would be pleased if you could examine this very carefully. In my opinion, and in that of many experts, this makes the tax stronger; it ensures that it can be levied more evenly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, we immediately start now to debate its scope of application. Firstly, currency transactions. We propose that currency transactions, which is where the whole debate on a Tobin tax began, be included. We do not find the legal concerns that have been asserted in that area to be very convincing, nor do various experts. We think it is right to include these currency transactions.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns the issue of high-frequency trading. In this case, we are proposing that transactions that are not completed are also included in the tax base, since in practice, the number of instructions that are not executed, not completed, is 15 times as high as the number completed. The tax would then also put a brake on high-frequency trading. I regret to say that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is currently proposing a general exemption in this area for the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). Exempting the large investment funds market would be a serious mistake. It would mean that banks would simply establish a UCITS and thereby be able to carry out their transactions without any tax liability. That would be doing ourselves a real disservice.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the matter of pension funds, I regret to say that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is now also proposing that pension funds be exempted. That, too, is a mistake in our view, because studies show very clearly that the less frequently that pension funds trade, the more profitable they are for their investors in the end. The OECD has just presented such a study. Implementing this tax consistently will not penalise them.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would also like to address the Council. The Danish Presidency – a country with a high tax burden, including on the factor of labour – should have a particularly great interest in progress being made in the area of the taxation of capital yields. So far, you have achieved little in this respect. Please would you get moving on this, and instead of looking into alternatives, just go with Parliament’s proposals.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the position of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group in today’s vote on a financial transaction tax remains unchanged, and we fundamentally reject this concept. There are many fundamental reasons why we reject this matter, and I would now like to set out some of these.</p>
      <p sl="cs">First, European statesmen have long talked about boosting European competitiveness and kick-starting growth. Economic history provides no examples to show that tax increases of any kind may lead to the kick-starting of growth and greater competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="cs">My second point has been mentioned by some of you, and it was explicitly raised by Mr Engel of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and the time is now right to make a reply, in my opinion. The financial transaction tax (FTT) is seen as part of the long-term attempt to find new sources of funding at European level. For us, this is fundamentally unacceptable because we believe that the European budget is overweight and needs a drastic diet. We need to cut budget expenditure, not look for new sources.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Thirdly, economists have now correctly concluded that the banks need more capital and liquidity. How can it then be logical to take money out of the sector? If the FTT is introduced, we can expect to lose a significant part of the financial sector to places where there is no FTT.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Fourthly, imposing the FTT on transactions involving shares and derivatives will not help improve the stability of the financial sector, as the great majority of you believe. On the contrary, it will lead to greater volatility. The new tax will oblige traders to focus on other, less standard and as yet untaxed financial transactions.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Fifthly, if the FTT is approved, it will lead to slower growth in the European area and a lack of capital on the markets, which will restrict the investment that industry and the economy so badly need.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a financial transaction tax sounds like a very good idea, does it not? It plays well politically, and we can hit those greedy bankers, whom we all hate in public while we shovel money into their pockets in private. However, I do not think it is quite going to work out that way. All taxes are passed on to customers at the end of the day – sorry everybody, but that is just how it works – so again it will be the little people who pick up the tab. It will be savers, it will be pensioners and it will be ordinary folk who pick up the tab for this tax, not the greedy fat-cat bankers that you are trying to get at.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is interesting, when you look at the small print, to see they are saying that some of the money raised can perhaps go towards saving future failed banks. So we know – we concede, do we not? – that more banks are going to fail. We know this because we have the same ridiculous, fractional-reserve banking system, the same crooked, money-printing, criminal behaviour at the central banks, and so on and so forth. So nothing has changed. This is another strong signal to bankers and politicians to continue the theft.</p>
      <p sl="en">But beware those who think that taxing London is a risk-free game – and we mean London don’t we? When it comes to financial services, other EU countries are Mickey Mouse. Financial services account for 14% of UK GDP, and the UK contributes GBP 50 million pounds a day to this crumbling institution. Do not kill the goose that lays your golden eggs!</p>
      <p sl="en">Zurich, Geneva, New York and Hong Kong are licking their lips wondering what piece of glorious stupidity we will come up with next. An FTT is a special tax, so what next? A special tax on sunshine holidays in Spain; high fashion in Paris; luxury cars in Germany; mobile phones in Finland; and perhaps a justifiably special tax on dreadful flat-pack furniture from Sweden? It is coming to your street next! The greedy bureaucrats just want your money.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, thank you, Ms Podimata. Today, for the first time, we are discussing the financial transaction tax. If approved, it will be the first clear signal that speculators will not go completely unpunished for the crisis that we are currently experiencing. Parliament and the EU institutions should be responsible for people, not the financial markets. For decades, the financial markets’ lobbies have succeeded in ruling the world without any opposition or hindrance. It is obvious to us that, during 2008 and 2012, the crisis of the speculative financial markets was at the root of most of the problems we are experiencing. Yet these speculative financial markets have managed to achieve not just a complete failure to take action, but also a direct transfer from the public purse to those same speculative markets.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have been fighting for this for many years, Mr President, but it was only when people across Europe started to say that enough is enough that we have finally seen some initiative on the part of the institutions that govern the EU. This is the very first sign of the answer that we have needed to give to the people. The citizens of Europe, who have paid for everything, do not deserve to be paid so little respect. This proposal is neither complete nor perfect, and it will not solve the whole problem of financial speculation, but it is an important signal. We have been … or rather, the EU leaders have been apologising to the financial markets. They should apologise to the people who have been affected. To finish, Mr President, I would like to recall the words of a famous politician, who said that these markets that we are talking about govern us without ever having been elected.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I sincerely hope that governments will give a signal that they trust the people, and I sincerely hope that following the adoption of this directive and a positive vote from the Members, we can begin to talk about justice and solidarity in Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, let us pluck up our courage and make this project succeed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as co-founder of the inter-group working party on the Tobin tax in 1999 here in Parliament, I recall very well how we were completely sidelined and pretty much treated as a laughing stock. The turnaround in mood to the point where a majority now realise the necessity of a financial transaction tax, particularly the Commission, is very much to be welcomed. Now it is a matter of winning the numbers game.</p>
      <p sl="de">The arguments we have just heard put forward suggest that the revenues would amount to EUR 50 million, when in reality we are talking about potential revenue of EUR 60 billion. We now have to prevent what we consider to be propaganda from the United Kingdom from taking root among the people of continental Europe. It is not true that it will massively harm those who have put money into pension funds. One could argue, in particular, that the opposite is true if pension funds pursue long-term investment strategies.</p>
      <p sl="de">The important thing, of course, is that the money does not just go into the EU budget, but rather that it actually benefits those who have unjustly suffered in the crisis; in other words, that it is actually invested in measures to promote growth. Studies already show that the allegedly negative effect of the loss of economic power can be turned around, that the financial transaction tax can even result in economic growth; so all these arguments that we are hearing, driven by the City of London, can be refuted.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this tax has caused quite a stir, and we have seen how some of our colleagues have engaged in mudslinging before immediately leaving the debate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to simply reiterate the fact that Parliament has already made its position regarding this tax very clear through several resolutions and decisions. I think that the important thing today is effective implementation, because we are sustaining the report with a whole series of plans, a whole series of words and, behind it, nothing much is happening. In my opinion, it is important for us to be realistic. Since this is a tax matter, Parliament is only being consulted on this report and, in view of this, I feel we must be clear and concise when stating our views.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission’s proposal is interesting and good, and I believe we should support it. We must not try to weaken it; there are already strong disagreements within the Council and the chances of seeing the success of this report as we wish, at EU level, are relatively slim. That is why some people suggest that we work in closer cooperation. That is one of the ideas. Parliament is only consulted on this subject, but we should put all the necessary efforts in place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is clear. After discussions and equivocations, the PPE Group is, today, in favour of the financial transaction tax. We would like the tax to be as comprehensive as possible, but, as the PPE Group is realistic, we know that this is not possible in the current climate. We would like the tax to be adopted at European level and that it not be implemented at a lower level, as this would certainly be detrimental to the European financial economy. We must not look the other way: if there were no European internal market – the European market forms a single entity and, personally, I do not believe in running away from things – if it falls to a lower geographical level, there is a real risk.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Ms Vestager, Commissioner, when discussing a proposal on financial regulation, in a very classical way, two arguments are put forward. The first is that it is only possible to act on the largest possible scale, if possible on a global scale, and that any descent to a lower level would lead to a risk of unfair competition. The second argument is to say, ‘Oh, no, but certain products, which are safe, have to be excluded’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would simply remind our fellow Members of the commitments made by the European Union, in particular through the members participating in the G20, who, in London, in April 2009, said, ‘We have decided that all financial institutions, markets and products of systemic importance should be subject to an appropriate level of regulation and supervision’. It seems to me that the taxation of financial transactions must also, under these conditions, cover undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and pension funds, that the level of intervention at which we will be able to launch this proposal will be the correct level of intervention, and that the issue of risks must be assessed on a global scale and not simply always to protect them.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Ms Vestager, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commission for having had the courage to table this proposal and the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs for trying to work on it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, if we only dealt with issues on which there was already a consensus, there would be less work to do in this House. If we only dealt with issues on which there was general agreement from the start, on the basis of a notion of the internal market which entails, at times, simply taking full advantage of it without ever wanting to play the solidarity and level playing field card, that would be much easier. However, we live in the real world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would invite you to reflect on the following. We are making an effort in the euro area and throughout the European Union to consolidate public finances. My feeling is that much greater importance is always attached to the ‘expenditure’ component than to the ‘receipts’ component. However, to balance a budget, it is important to reduce expenditure and to manage it properly, but it is also important that receipts flow into the coffers of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I invite you to consult the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report on the growing inequalities in Europe, and I would truly recommend that you read it. It is not a document produced by a far-left outfit. It is a document produced by the OECD showing that the increase in inequalities, which jeopardises political stability in our countries, is, in part, linked to the fact that there has been a shortage of tax revenues for a number of years. This is a major problem and, regarding this issue, I would say that the procedure for introducing a financial transaction tax is secondary. There are always manoeuvres to focus on small details, to try to exempt one category or another or exclude one country or another, and to turn a blind eye to what is happening right now in our societies, namely, a scandalous rise in inequalities linked to the fact that large companies and rich individuals no longer pay tax.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been debating this financial transaction tax (FTT) for a good number of months now, and many things have been said about it that are not correct. It has been said that an FTT would have to be global in order to be tenable, whereas in fact a number of countries around the world already have a form of transaction tax, including the United Kingdom, South Korea, Switzerland, India, Hong Kong and South Africa. It exists, and it exists in a way that is effective. It has also been said that an FTT could easily be avoided, but the European Parliament has just set out that we will supplement the principle of residence with a principle of issuance and a principle of ownership that will make the tax extremely difficult to avoid.</p>
      <p sl="da">It has been said that an FTT would cost us in terms of growth and jobs, but the Commission’s updated calculations in fact suggest the opposite. If we use the revenue wisely, if we use it for investments, then it could, in fact, boost European GDP by 0.2% to 0.4%. It has been said that ordinary pension savers would be hit when they put their money into savings plans, but alongside this is the fact that we need an incentive for pension companies, too, to choose more long-term investment models. That is, after all, what this is all about. It has also been said that a financial activities tax would be just as good as an FTT, but the fact is that an activities tax would not change the financial sector’s speculative behaviour and would not bring in the same revenues. It would also be easier to avoid than an FTT. I would therefore urge the Council and today’s summit to listen to the European Parliament, to look at our report and at some of the suggestions that we have made to improve the Commission’s proposal. I think you should listen to the very large majority of the European population who would like to see a tax on financial transactions. I think it is time to shift the debate out of the vacuum that it has been in. I believe we need to move on swiftly to enhanced cooperation, and I believe that we need an FTT that could bring in revenue and cut down on the highly speculative behaviour in the financial sector.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, picture a Spanish home buyer paying an extra EUR 2 000 on an average mortgage, a German pensioner losing 4% return on his equity options investments and a French SME facing a 90% cost increase for foreign-exchanged hedging. I am not describing the consequences of predatory bank practices or an external economic shock. I am simply illustrating what proponents of a European FTT are willing to inflict on their own constituents in pursuit of a misguided attempt to make someone, anyone, pay for the financial crisis of 2008. It is no secret that the UK stands to lose the most from the imposition of such a tax, but I am not here to argue against the FTT as a Brit, but as a European concerned about the welfare of our economy, and the future wealth of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ever since this tax’s inception, the discussion around the FTT has not been an objective, evidence-based one. Instead, the Commission, and some in this Parliament, have pretended that the effects of the tax would be negligible, when they are not, that the tax would be just, when it is not, and that it would be internationally viable, when, thankfully, it is not. It is high time that we were honest about the true detrimental effects of this tax on European savers, the European economy and, in fact, financial stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are dire economic times and we have an awful lot of work still to do before we can rightfully claim to have made financial markets safer and more beneficial to the real economy. Making our voters believe, however, that this tax will get us any closer to fairness and growth is untruthful and a distraction from our massive workload in the area of financial services.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me give you just one example of how we are pre-empting and improving upon the objectives of the FTT in other dossiers. In the course of the review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, we are discussing ways of dealing with any risks posed by high-frequency trading (HFT) which are more sophisticated and effective than any FTT could ever be. I call upon my colleagues to follow the Council’s lead in rejecting a European FTT and to leave it up to individual Member States to pursue such a tax if they feel it necessary.</p>

In the light of what you said, I should like to know what you think of these investigations that have been carried out by the Commission and the study carried out by the Commission, which establish very, very clearly that, by oversight, there has been too little consideration of the real economy’s dependence on the financial markets, that 95% of companies are not dependent on it in any way for raising funds, and that it is highly likely that any negative effect on growth that has been mentioned in the past could be turned into a positive by making appropriate public investments to promote growth.</p>

That is 26 times the tax; that is a phenomenal burden to put on a hedge for a business transaction.</p>

      <p sl="en">In addition, the legal argument on which this House is trying to base the establishment of an FTT is incorrect. The different sizes of the financial industry in some Member States are not an indication of distorted competition, but rather due to historic developmental differences. This should never have been interpreted as a reason for tax harmonisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the Commission proposes to tax both sides of the transaction. If one of the parties is not a signatory to the treaty, then the other party would have to raise both amounts. What would then happen to the UK veto? It would be useless. The UK taxpayer would end up paying the tax on all transactions that involved Member States who have signed the treaty. However, it would not enjoy a reduction in its EU contribution as it has not signed up to this treaty.</p>

      <p sl="nl">And the worst part is that most of my fellow Dutch politicians actually agree with all of this. The VVD, CDA, PvdA, Groen-Links and D66 delegations to the European Parliament are all ready to hand over our wallets and our sovereignty to the failing Brussels bureaucrats.</p>
      <p sl="nl">But we are not going to do that. In the upcoming Dutch elections on 12 September, Dutch citizens will vote en masse against Europe, against the ESM, against European taxes, against Eurobonds and against all this money wasting. The Dutch are not going to be told what to do.</p>

      <p sl="de">Overall, the Commission has tabled a good proposal. It is better than many others, such as in the area of energy taxation. It is good on the residence principle, on the tax rates, on the reasoning. I salute the Commissioner. What I cannot support is the justification. In his opening remarks, he repeated that this tax must come about without adding to the tax burden on citizens. However, this is an illusion. If we tax the financial market, then we know full well that, in the end, the burden will be borne by consumers, customers, citizens, and not by an anonymous financial market.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am convinced that what this is about is a different issue entirely, which is that the financial market has to be slowed down. If the financial market has to shrink overall and return to its service function in order to achieve this, then such an instrument – high-frequency trading has already been mentioned, elements are included in our proposal – is certainly ideal for this. However, linking it all with own resources, revenues and issues of fairness is not sufficient for its implementation. I believe it is important that we somehow prompt London, the largest market, to come on board. That is why it is important to have a clear vote in Parliament, because more than two thirds of all financial market transactions in the EU of 25 Member States are made via London.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we only manage a partial solution, then we will not make progress and will not achieve our objective. That is why I am asking for a clear vote in favour of this financial market transaction tax, in order to create a basis for the whole of the EU to participate. Naturally, one cannot simply disregard the alternatives that are currently being discussed in the Council, namely, an expanded stock exchange tax that includes derivatives. We have passed a regulation on derivatives and created the conditions for this. It all belongs together, and I hope that we will support the Commission on this with a clear vote.</p>

      <p sl="es">As regards regulation, the origin of this crisis lies in the deregulation of the financial market, and introducing this tax will provide us with an instrument to better regulate it and prevent future crises in this area.</p>

I am a little curious as to how this tax is supposed to actually differentiate between those who are speculating in the market and those who are actually investing for their future. The pensioners that we have talked about really will suffer as much as, if not more than, those that you claim are speculating.</p>

Therefore, the discussion and debate on specific aspects will take place at a later stage.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I should point out that, as regards the second part of your question, there are pension funds that are productive in nature and protect pensioners’ rights in a stable way, with real investments, and there are pension funds that act speculatively, in which case the same tax should be applied to them.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Ms Vestager, Mr Šemeta, it is not surprising that many European citizens are angry about the banks turning a deaf ear to calls for moderation and a reasonable approach to compensation and risk-taking. However, a transaction tax is not the right response to the citizens’ anger. It is a bad tax which risks increasing charges for ordinary bank customers, making investment in Europe more difficult, damaging growth and, as a result, jeopardising jobs. In addition, I believe that the calculation of the revenue cannot be relied on.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This proposal has been under discussion for the last 40 years and it has been tried once in Europe, in my home country of Sweden. The result was that the majority of share trading moved from Stockholm to London. If a transaction tax has to be introduced, it must be introduced globally or at least throughout the entire EU. However, I think that the financial sector should pay more tax. A better model, for example, would be to introduce a stability fee for all banks.</p>
      <p sl="sv">To summarise very briefly, I think that the banking and the financial sector should pay tax. It is not a problem for me, but this is a bad tax which will have a counterproductive effect. Mr Šemeta, please try again and take a new approach.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the vagaries of scheduling mean that today, we are discussing this tax at the same time as an informal European Council summit on growth is about to take place concerning all the issues relating to recovery in Europe. I actually think that this is no coincidence and that the tax is not only a fair contribution from a sector that was largely responsible for the current crisis, but also an own resource of the European Union, a resource, a revenue stream to finance this much-heralded recovery, which is something we all so earnestly desire.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore think that this own resource and the battle for own resources are of paramount importance. We must not separate the issue of the financial transaction tax from that of own resources. We need this own resource, and maybe others for that matter, to fund the recovery projects.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this proposal was harmful from the beginning, and, as so often happens, Parliament wants to make it worse. The sanction of invalidating transactions upon which the financial transaction tax has not been paid will undermine the rule of law. It would represent the superiority of fiscal interests over the real economy. Contrary to what is intended, the financial transaction tax will affect not only the most speculative practices, but the entire financial market, which also supplies what is known as the real economy, whereby the latter needs money now like never before. Numerous European politicians continue to propose new taxes to overcome the crisis: carbon taxes, environmental taxes, energy taxes, and finally, the financial transaction tax and the coordination of income taxes. This is the worst possible solution. Today, Europe needs competitiveness, and new taxes will kill this competitiveness.</p>

The income generated should be used to help families and businesses, that is, the real economy, which has been severely affected by a crisis caused, first and foremost, by the world of finance.</p>
      <p sl="it">Nevertheless, for it to be truly effective, this tax must be applied at a global level, because otherwise, it would not be difficult to circumvent and would create potential competitive disadvantages for European markets. An even worse scenario would be if European countries were to apply it in a disorganised manner, with no common agreement. The United Kingdom has already made its intentions clear.</p>
      <p sl="it">Doing things haphazardly therefore, could become an own goal for Europe: something to avoid at all costs. We must therefore either reach a unanimous consensus, or this measure will become virtually useless, with most of its potential benefits disappearing.</p>

      <p sl="en">I believe that the financial sector must bear its part in bringing about debt reduction and supporting growth in the economy. However, what has not been recognised here is that the root of the problem is a common currency, with no flexibility for weaker economies, and an explosion of debt, condemning young people to the hopelessness of unemployment and leading to a democratic deficit in Europe, with a move away from the centre towards political extremes.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, with regard to the taxation of financial transactions, I think that we should be realistic and avoid making declarations of principle. We need to create a truly effective instrument that achieves its objective. Personally, I support the idea of the financial transaction tax (FFT) as well as the structure set out by the Commission. I agree that the private sector, too, must help pay for the crisis that it caused.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the last few years, we have seen the States intervene in the private sector, precisely to resolve critical situations caused by unbridled speculation and the lack of supervision. However, we need to ensure that this tax is not passed on to end users, as so often happens.</p>
      <p sl="it">A further doubt concerns the effects on the financing of sovereign debt stemming from the inclusion of securities in the scope of the tax. Although the issuing of sovereign debt instruments is exempt from tax, the reduction of liquidity on the secondary market resulting from the introduction of the tax will affect the price of securities in auctions on the primary market, thereby leading to a rise in the interest tax payable to investors by the State. This effect will harm States with a high public debt.</p>
      <p sl="it">The levying of this tax at EU level – or only at EU level – must be a first step, but the final objective must remain the introduction of a global tax to stabilise the markets and prevent speculation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the UK, my own Member State, two-thirds of the public back a ‘Robin Hood tax’ on the financial services sector. Why? Because the financial services sector is largely undertaxed: it enjoys an EUR 18 billion per annum VAT exemption. It should pay a fairer rate of tax, particularly since its return to profitability, and it continues to pay out large bonuses.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, we prefer a global financial transaction tax, but we have been prepared, unlike the UK Government, to engage constructively in the debate for an EU FTT. It is clear that it has to be workable, it has to be effective, it has to be simple to collect and it has to minimise tax avoidance.</p>
      <p sl="en">A well-designed FTT could help tackle speculation, and it could help stabilise the economy away from short-term profit towards serving the real economy. It would raise money to meet global development and poverty challenges and climate change commitments. It could raise revenue to meet our national priorities for investing in our economic future and youth employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be a bonus if an FTT could tackle the kind of hedge fund activity which last week saw a US tax-exile hedge fund manager in the Cayman Islands paid EUR 400 million from the bailout cash we paid to the Greek Government to pay its bondholders. Frankly, if J.P. Morgan can carelessly afford to lose EUR 2 billion – even maybe EUR 7 billion by recent estimates – they can afford to pay an FTT.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to be clear, though. Tax policy requires unanimity between all EU Member States, and the EU does not have tax-raising powers to allocate resources for an FTT. We will continue to campaign for the global FTT and to engage in this, but we will not vote for an FTT that is prioritised for own resources.</p>

I hope that this will be taken into account in the trialogues.</p>

The general argument that wealthy banks that make money from people’s savings should be in solidarity with their clients appears, at first glance, to be plausible. When applying this idea, however, several complications arise. Our financial experts are unable to agree on the items that should be properly included in the tax base, and all questions as to what consequences the introduction of a new tax on pension funds, foreign exchange transactions, and also high-frequency trading may have are justified. In addition to the complications arising from the definition of the tax base, the issue of the geographical scope of its application remains unresolved. It is clear from the attitudes of our major trading partners that at a global level, it shall remain so, nor shall we come to an agreement on the tax being applied throughout the European Union. Then one has to ask whether or not to leave the decision on the use of this tax purely to the Member States and surrender the disputed profits to the EU budget.</p>

We now have a basis of assessment including exchange transactions, derivatives, equities and bonds traded on the secondary market. Like the Commissioner, we want the financial transaction tax to be imposed on pension funds and undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), which, unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wants to exclude. We also have two tax rates, including a lower rate for derivatives, which seems paradoxical given that we want to combat speculation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would have liked the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to apply itself to defining the arrangements for a financial transaction tax more precisely than it has done in the last few months. That would have enabled it to avoid a fundamental contradiction, which has been detrimental to the text as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How is it possible to start from a laudable intention, which is to curb financial speculation, considered so harmful, only to end up punishing the financial instruments aimed at collecting savings in the long term? That, however, is what the Podimata report is leading to at the moment by taxing undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) in the same way as other financial institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This treatment calls for two basic remarks to be made. The first is that the text’s rapporteur seems to be aware of the problem of coherence, as pension funds were finally excluded from the scope of the proposed directive. If that is the case, however, the reasoning must be carried through to its logical conclusion, since the vast majority of pension funds invest in collective investment funds. Therefore, I have to say to my fellow Members, ‘More effort is needed, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to adopt a coherent approach’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly – and this is the most serious point – to treat the different financial institutions equally in fact amounts to introducing intolerable inequality. Investment funds are, by their very nature, constantly required to carry out transactions on their portfolio. That is why they exist. To tax each transaction in the same way as high-frequency trading is to introduce cascading taxes that are so disadvantageous that the European funds industry would be condemned in the face of competition from third countries, which are already rejoicing. I do not think we can condone this. I therefore ask you to support the February amendment concerning this exemption.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the financial transaction tax should act as a way of controlling and disincentivising excessively risky speculative activities in the financial sector. It is aimed at reducing speculation and increasing healthy competition, within the single market, and at generating revenue. The Podimata report has attempted to bring the Commission’s initial proposal closer to the UK’s well-known system of stamp duty, thereby making it more attractive to reluctant Member States. It is to be hoped that the Council will also get the message.</p>
      <p sl="pt">While, in the Commission’s proposal, the tax would apply to transactions made by financial institutions based within the EU, the idea now is that transactions involving European assets will also be taxed, even when conducted by non-Europeans. This measure will expand the revenue base and reduce leakage. It is to be hoped that the revenue from the tax will be considered a source of own resources for the EU and its Member States, thereby reducing taxes in the Member States, but this remains undecided.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I should like to finish, Mr President, by congratulating the rapporteur on the quality of her work. I hope that this symbolic document …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there are a number of reasons for Parliament to vote against the financial transaction tax. Firstly, Sweden tried this in the 1980s and it failed. It undermined Swedish financial markets and the City of London gained. It also caused more speculation, and all the experience shows that it did not help. Also, this was at a time when the financial markets were less global and less mobile. Now, the opposite is true.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, even the Commission recognises that the financial transaction tax will lead to less growth. The discussion is about how much less growth, but it will give less growth, which is contrary to what Europe needs today. We need more growth and we need reforms that support economic growth and dynamic financial markets in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, the financial transaction tax is not providing us with new money. It will be paid by customers – those who are going to invest and those who trust in their future pension schemes. It will be paid by all of us, because there are no taxes paid by anyone apart from the citizens of Europe. This tax will not help in the Europe of today, so we should vote ‘no’.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, we still have a long way to go, but today we may have taken an important step towards finally introducing and levying a tax on financial transactions.</p>
      <p sl="it">I understand the prudence, the caution, the need to do things gradually expressed by Mr Šemeta and the technical issues rightly raised by Ms Vestager. Precisely for this reason, though, I hope that Parliament will express a clear, political will, with a broad majority, in order to encourage and drive forward the initiatives necessary to address the unresolved problems, especially at Council level.</p>
      <p sl="it">We all want to closely examine the impact of this tax, but it is not right to stir up unfounded fears which could even lead to contradictory and counterproductive choices. I refer, for example, to the rationale behind the proposed exemptions. If we are careful to reduce the impact of the tax, it is important to have as broad a tax base as possible, with a low rate, and not to attempt to extend the exemptions ad infinitum.</p>
      <p sl="it">To those who are concerned about the consequences for small investors, I would point out the progressive nature of the tax, so those who carry out several transactions are affected more, and it is clear that the competent authorities must, in any case, ensure that there are no attempts to offload the possible costs onto end users. I therefore hope that Parliament will vote in favour of this tax by a large majority.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all the problems relating to the details that we could talk about, and which we will be talking about, in the further legislative procedure, we should not lose sight of one thing: financial markets cannot function according to a model in which, when everything is going well, the banks take the profits, and then, when something goes wrong, taxpayers have to pick up the tab. That is why it makes sense for there also to be a tax on financial transactions. It also makes sense for this to be done in a cross-border arrangement. In Europe – or at least in the euro area – this would not result in distortions; rather, it would make a lasting contribution to bringing about a stable financial market which generates what financial markets are actually there for, namely, to provide enterprises with access to capital, to allow savers to save or put something aside for their old age, and so that the financial markets can once again do the job for which they were once created, which is to provide added value for the real economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Everything that drove us into the financial crisis consisted of products that added no value for the real economy. That is why it makes sense to have a tax that can be used to help ensure that this is severely penalised, that sanctions are taken, that steers us towards a situation in which capital goes back to doing its job. That is why I am advocating that we adopt this proposal today with a broad majority.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the financial crisis has caused a significant deterioration in public finances. The contribution made by the financial services sector to alleviate this deterioration is one of the commitments made at the G20 summit held in Pittsburgh in September 2009. Without that contribution, there will be no fair way out of the crisis: this is the ‘polluter pays’ principle.</p>
      <p sl="es">A tax of this nature should be part of an agenda for growth and employment in Europe. It has the potential to generate EUR 60 billion per year, which will help to stabilise public accounts, deter speculative investments and the excesses of the financial system, and promote investment in the real economy.</p>
      <p sl="es">From a broader perspective, taxes are the price of civilisation. All those who participate in and benefit from it should pay those taxes. The financial sector must also shoulder its fiscal responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="es">The tax on financial transactions will correct the anomaly that, under current EU legislation, financial services are not subject to indirect taxation. This exemption only makes sense in order to avoid double taxation for transactions directly linked to the real economy, such as payment services or credit, but not for trading in purely financial products.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should now remove that privilege and prevent the tax burden from falling on the rest of the industry and on citizens who are not consumers of financial products and services.</p>
      <p sl="es">Since the resolution of March 2010, in the Guerrero report, which included one of my own amendments, this has been the European Parliament’s position, with the aim of establishing a real international tax that contributes to the Millennium Development Goals and overall development.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I, too, should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Ms Podimata, the shadow rapporteurs and everyone else for their amendments and contributions to the report before us today. I trust that this report will be a positive contribution by the European Parliament to the fight against speculation and in addressing the question of the supervision and resolution of the financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, it would be helpful if broad agreement could be reached within the framework of the coordination of tax and budgetary policies and if this tax could be integrated into that, in order to prevent distortions in the single market even though, as we all know, such agreement is difficult to reach.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, we must press on with our efforts within the framework of the international community, because we also need to protect our financial sector. It is a Union objective that I consider extremely important. We also need to consider how we can ensure that we do not undermine the much-discussed growth which the Union so desperately needs at present; that is why I support the amendment exempting investment funds and pension funds.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, a word about resources. It has always been my understanding that this tax is linked to resources and their availability. I believe that this is an opportunity for the Union to acquire a source of own resources and to utilise this tax to give growth in Europe the kick start that it needs. This is a moment of creation and we must make use of it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I hope that we shall give very broad support to the report in the vote today.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see many colleagues concerned with the effect of the financial transaction tax on taxpayers and I absolutely agree. Everybody is concerned with that, but I would like to ask you to look at the balance; for example, what the taxpayers are paying for consolidating the financial system, directly through increasing the capital of the banks or indirectly through the European Stability Fund mechanism, the IMF or other mechanisms. Thousands of billions are going to consolidate the financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the financial transaction tax is introduced, this burden on the taxpayers will be alleviated – not entirely but at least partially – and it is very important to note that, if part of it goes to the European budget, it does not mean that this is going to be an additional tax for the European budget. That would mean that the national contributions will be decreased, which, at the end of the day, would bring the entire revenue from the financial transaction tax to the national budgets. Think about that. This is going to be its real interest to the taxpayers.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I can but welcome the report tabled before us, because it states clearly, at last, that financial transactions have been undertaxed compared with other types of transactions, and also because we propose a real, tangible solution in this crisis-ridden economic situation. This is the first step of European crisis management that will not be implemented merely at the level of international fiscal agreements, but will also have a practical impact.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I regret that this new European tax cannot be implemented globally, and perhaps not even throughout the entire EU. Even so, however, it will provide the European economy with considerable revenues. Enhanced cooperation is a useful tool that can help ensure that financial transactions are conducted in a regulated and more traceable manner, thus eliminating the risk of the financial sectors once again becoming entirely detached from the real economy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">A further merit of the report is that it very correctly goes on the assumption that the financial sector – which, through its speculative conduct that set its own short-term goals above all else, was one of the main agents of the crisis – did not assist in crisis management, and would have preferred to benefit from the crisis, if you will. The report addresses this contradiction, and excludes in a professional manner transactions that had not attracted a transaction tax, thereby improving transparency and reducing the risk of tax evasion and tax fraud. I therefore recommend that this report be adopted.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial transaction tax gives us an instrument that allows us to distribute the burden of this crisis fairly in future. It is an instrument that makes it possible that even those who have hitherto refused to pay taxes, or who have paid very little in taxes, namely big business and the major banks, will have to pay taxes again. It is also an instrument that creates growth precisely where it is urgently needed: in the real economy, not in the financial sector. That is why I believe this House will do the right thing in the vote today.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I should like to mention one aspect that I am very unhappy with, and that is what is going on in the Council. As far as I am concerned, what is currently going on in the Council is scandalous, where Mr Cameron and his friends – who are ever fewer in number – are managing to get their policies, designed to suit multi-millionaires and big business, adopted throughout Europe. Let us give Mr Cameron and his friends in the Council the right answer here today with a European Parliament vote in favour of a financial transaction tax.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Podimata, ladies and gentlemen, today’s report once again underpins the European Parliament’s leading role in the introduction of a financial transaction tax. With this report, the European Parliament is supporting the proposals and the leading role that the Commission is taking in the implementation of this concept. Like the previous speaker, I would like to say that at present, the Council is blocking a Europe-wide introduction of the financial transaction tax; that at present, the Council is blocking the introduction of a financial transaction tax across the euro area; and that therefore, at the moment, the Council is making the introduction of a financial transaction tax unrealistic. If only nine Member States are in favour, then the transaction tax could become a competitive disadvantage.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to end the blockade. We want to stick to our goal. For us, the financial transaction tax is a regulatory measure, and because it is a regulatory measure, I submitted an amendment for off-exchange financial transactions to be taxed at a higher rate than exchange transactions.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to use the financial transaction tax to increase the budgetary policy scope of the European Union so that we can enhance growth, employment and investment across Europe. I would urge you to vote in favour.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, today, before the vote on Ms Podimata’s report, is the time to speak plainly. A financial transaction tax is unavoidable. It is at the core of our exit strategy from the crisis. I emphasise that as the third Austrian in a row to speak in favour of the financial transaction tax. High-risk, poorly thought out financial speculation was one of the reasons why the huge financial, economic and now social crisis came about – if not its very cause. Banks are having to be rescued on a daily basis. The whole of Europe has been plunged into a deep crisis. Now, not sometime in the distant future, is the time to make the financial sector, which has lost touch with reality, shoulder its share of the responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">We pay taxes on everything imaginable: on labour, on energy. It is, in fact, absurd that the financial transaction tax has not yet been introduced. I expect the financial transaction tax to result in greater stability in the financial markets, a reduction in short-term speculation and, above all, greater focus on the real economy and the financing thereof.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, as has already been emphasised in this debate, the introduction of a financial transaction tax would only make sense if it at least had a European dimension, though it really ought to have a global dimension. For that reason, it is natural that the Commission, with the support of this House, wants to make it a European tax.</p>
      <p sl="nl">So the next logical step would be that this tax forms part of Europe’s domestic income, in order to give the budget a firmer footing, as is the case with any normal budget.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On several occasions, members here have emphasised that this tax should contribute to growth.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Well, the introduction of the financial transaction tax as the Union’s own income – which, in order to be domestic income, should meet all the criteria laid down by the Lamassoure report and the Commission – would support the European budget; and the European budget is a growth budget. As a result, it would be a tool for growth and, at the same time, lighten the load of national budgets, since it would lead to a reduction in national contributions to the EU budget. Consequently, we have here a typical instrument that can simultaneously support the dual objective of fiscal consolidation and growth and employment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I welcome this debate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Each week, we hear in various quarters political leaders launching such a project as if it were their own personal invention and a revolutionary idea. The fact is that five years have passed since this Parliament first voted in favour of it. There have been other votes since then. One year has passed since the Commission submitted a specific, complete project – thank you, Commissioner Šemeta – and a group of experts from the 27 governments has been working on it for six months.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us be under no illusions as to the nature of this tax. It is an indirect tax, like VAT. It does not therefore punish the financial operators. It will be paid by their customers. However, the tax base will be so broad and the tax rate so low that it will, in fact, be uncollectable. If it is well designed in terms of its practical details, it will not have significant transaction relocation effects either.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us be under no illusions either as to its purpose, which is twofold: to finance common European objectives and to ease the burden on national budgets. While it is true that the unanimity of the EU27 will be difficult to obtain, if an agreement is found to establish an identical tax in a significant number of Member States, its natural appropriation should be to the EU budget. Those Member States that choose this appropriation should be able to reduce their national contribution to the Community budget accordingly. They will thus have the necessary flexibility to reduce their own deficit and their debt, and too bad for the rest!</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, it has been established that irresponsible behaviour within the financial sector has contributed to the crisis we find ourselves in today. Consequently, the sector must pay part of the price for all this. Despite this, however, I do not believe that a tax introduced on financial transactions is the best way forward, primarily because the bulk of the tax costs will probably be passed on to the consumer and, moreover, I think it would be dangerous for Europe to believe that establishing regulatory standards in the European Union will encourage the rest of the world to follow our lead. In the current economic climate, we should be very proud of the fact that our financial services industry is so competitive. In light of this, I feel that we should pay attention to whether we should introduce policies or taxes that threaten this competitiveness. I confess that I do not have faith in the Commission’s impact assessments, as they are far from being consistent with one another. Initially, it was indicated that there would be a significant reduction in GDP, but then, once this came under fire, the Commission adjusted its assessments to depict the very opposite. This is why I will not be supporting the introduction of the financial transaction tax solely in Europe and I invite my colleagues in the European Parliament to do the same.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for a very diverse, broad debate. It shows quite clearly that the work put into the treatment of the Commission’s proposal for a transaction tax is important and is considered by Parliament to be of high priority. I am talking here about the work of both the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur, as well as all the work put in by Parliament’s various committees. This is a matter that goes back to the Council. As I said in my introduction, we hope it will be on the agenda at the June Council.</p>
      <p sl="da">There is one thing that I think is very pivotal in today’s debate, and that is the broad agreement there has been concerning the need for a sound, well-functioning financial sector. It is crucial for growth that enterprises have access to capital, and it is crucial that we have a financial sector that is not only dull enough to support sound products, but that is also sufficiently willing to take risks so that we can ensure that enterprises that create jobs can get the credit they need. I would therefore like to pay tribute to the work that the Council and Parliament have done jointly with the Commission as regards regulation of the financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="da">By way of an initial result, based naturally on the work of other presidencies, we have already completed a joint piece of work aimed at putting trading in derivatives in an entirely new light. I think it is very important that we realise what a milestone the proposal is. Secondly, there are the recent Council resolutions, for which trialogues have yet to take place in respect of achieving better and greater autonomy for the credit rating agencies, obtaining more information on the basis of credit ratings, and achieving a real and genuine debate concerning what credit assessments are based on. Most recently, I also hope that Parliament appreciates the proposal for project bonds – and I am sure that is the case, from what I have heard in the debate here today.</p>
      <p sl="da">Last, but certainly not least, I would like to mention the trialogue on capital requirements that will commence shortly. A huge amount of work has been done based on the Commission’s proposal, which heightens the requirements as regards the amount of capital, the quality of the capital, the liquidity available, management performed and the way it is ensured that financial enterprises are – if I can put it like this – in a good state before they start paying out bonuses and dividends.</p>
      <p sl="da">I feel that, in the light of the debate here today on enhanced cooperation, agreement by the 27 Member States and the functioning of the internal market, it is very important that the proposals I have just mentioned are adopted unanimously in the Council, even though a qualified majority might have been sufficient for these proposals. This is because it reflects the fact that in Council, too, there is a common agenda based on securing an improved, better regulated financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="da">The debate on a financial transaction tax thus supplements a substantial, heavyweight agenda dealing with regulation. A great many questions have been asked today, both by Members who support the proposed transaction tax and by Members who are against it: how will it work, who will actually pay the tax, should anybody be exempted from paying the tax, can we distinguish between speculative and non-speculative transactions, and if we do not succeed in getting unanimity in the Council, what advantages and disadvantages will enhanced cooperation have? As many Members have mentioned, achieving unanimity in the Council is a particularly long shot and, according to Members that support a transaction tax, implementing this within the context of enhanced cooperation will be problematic because of the internal market aspect.</p>
      <p sl="da">Last, but naturally not least, there is debate concerning how great any revenues might be, and what they should be used for. We will continue to work on this in the Council. We have taken particularly thorough notes from the debate today and naturally, Parliament’s proposals and vote will form part of our future work. As I mentioned, we are taking a two-track approach. We will continue to investigate the Commission’s proposals, and the debate today will form a valuable part of that investigation, but we will also continue our work on discussing alternatives to a financial transaction tax. As I mentioned in my introduction, the countries tax the financial sector in various ways – whether through stamp duty, as has been mentioned several times today, or whether through activity-based taxes such as other countries have – for example, in the form of a payroll tax.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, I should like to express my thanks for a very diverse and very inspiring debate. Your work and input will provide the Council with a further basis for its continued work, and will also guide us on the road ahead.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is said that there are two certainties in life: death and taxes. While death comes to all mortals, it seems that tax is evaded by some – especially financial institutions – while political leaders cannot agree how to tax them. There is an element here of Nero fiddling while Rome burns. The financial institutions are gaining, while politicians dither. The key element for the European Union is to bring pressure on the G20 to introduce this tax on a global scale, so that no country will gain at the expense of another. Failing that, the only other option is to introduce the tax on a Europe-wide, 27-State basis. We should look at that as a pilot project, maybe for two or three years, to see if the forecasts of flight of finance and transaction relocation really transpire. I have my doubts, because of the small amounts involved – 0.1% or 0.01%.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, one of the reasons why introducing the European financial transaction tax as soon as possible is particularly important is that it would make it clear to European citizens that the EU is not passing the burdens of the crisis on to them, but rather on to the financial sector. The European-level transaction tax is not intended to apply to the population, but to high-value business transactions and speculative operations. It would ensure a more equitable distribution of the burdens of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="hu">By contrast, the Hungarian Government is planning to impose further austerity measures on the population under the pretext of the transaction tax. This transaction tax, however, has nothing in common with the one we are discussing here. This new tax, which will take effect next year, will be charged on retail transactions, including cash withdrawals and payments, bank transfers and bank card purchases. This is unacceptable! The EU transaction tax applies to the financial sector, to Member State and international oligarchs.</p>

We need to take courage and stop letting ourselves be ruled by fear of the financial system. The financial transaction tax is a political signal that has long been hoped for by the public, who are suffering from the crisis, in order to start down a path that will call a halt to the banks’ risk-taking behaviour. The financial sector was responsible for the crisis and we hope that this tax will help to limit speculation. This tax will help to increase the EU’s investment capacity and will create jobs. It will provide greater transparency and control, and will penalise speculative investment. There is a current example of the latter in my country: 100 000 people have been affected by banks’ speculation on a product called preferential shares, which have hit people who invested their money, the fruits of their labour, and cannot get it back.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, today, Parliament can send a strong signal to the Council to introduce a financial transaction tax. In particular, it can send a tangible message to citizens and businesses who are asking us what we are doing to address the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">Talking in practical terms, a financial transaction tax will produce a revenue of almost EUR 60 billion which will be earmarked for development, employment and curbing the tax burden on citizens. It would, however, also send a message of fairness because, as called for by our citizens, the financial sector, too, must pay its fair share to meet the costs of the economic crisis; it must absolutely do its part. I would like to thank Ms Podimata for her work.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, with today’s, vote, the European Parliament can send a very strong signal both to the Council and to the representatives of the Member States who reject this important step, but, in particular, to our citizens, as to date it has been the citizens of the European Union Member States who have been made to foot the bill for the debts of the banking sector. The introduction of a financial transaction tax may be important when addressing the consequences of the crisis not only in the Member States but also for the general budget of the European Union. The method by which a tax thus collected will be distributed between the common budget will therefore be very important, as will the method by which the contributions made by the EU’s Member States will be reduced. However, I believe that by introducing this system, we could gain almost EUR 57 billion per annum, and the system would also enhance the functioning of the single market. It also eliminates distortion of competition and will discourage financial institutions from risky and speculative activities.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the global crisis has spread rapidly and mercilessly to the real economies, having an enormous impact on employment. Seeking to improve this situation, governments throughout Europe have only been able to maintain balance through significant austerity measures.</p>
      <p sl="hu">One of the major causes of the crisis, the financial sector, received sizeable state subsidies, yet we can see that it did not contribute sufficiently to sharing the costs of the crisis. In light of this, the introduction of the financial transaction tax has grown into one of the most important issues today. It has the ability to regulate the massively increased number of financial transactions, as well as speculative transactions, which have become greatly detached from the real economy. It could generate approximately EUR 57 billion in revenues, which could contribute significantly to the stabilisation of the markets and the equitable sharing of burdens.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I believe that we should support the global introduction of a tax on financial transactions. The European Union is the largest financial market in the world today, and for this reason it is our responsibility, too, to take the first steps in this direction.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, since the late 1990s, at least, we have been advocating a financial transaction tax on the stock exchange. We consider this a vital instrument for combating financial speculation, although it does not go far enough: other, braver measures are also crucial, including an end to tax havens and the more speculative financial products.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, this is an important step. Nevertheless, we are concerned to note that the proposal under discussion gives favourable treatment to derivatives and other structured products; the very ones on which there is most speculation. The lowest tax in the proposal is applied to them: 0.01%.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Moreover, we consider it essential that revenue from this tax be used to combat poverty, rather than channelled into replacing national contributions to the EU budget, which would remain insufficient, without contributing to the much-vaunted goal of strengthening funds for convergence and social cohesion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, Minister, I want to thank you for your strong support for an EU FTT, which is an important signal to the Member States. Discussions in Council continue, and I would like to thank the Danish Presidency for keeping up the momentum in the technical analysis and the negotiations process.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the informal Ecofin Council in March 2012, ministers agreed that work should continue on the Commission’s proposal. On this basis, options which could gather a higher level of support in the short term should be explored. I welcome the Presidency’s intention to have an orientation debate at the 22 June Ecofin.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, I will continue to defend the broad-based FTT at EU level. This is what we need for fair taxation, a level playing field in the single market and to meet global challenges such as climate change and development.</p>
      <p sl="en">We heard a lot of arguments in favour of an FTT at EU level, and it is right. We also heard some concerns on specific points. The further technical work by Member States’ experts will bring clarity and solutions and, of course, the Commission will contribute to this work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me emphasise one general point. The FTT will help to rebuild the relationship between the financial sector and the ordinary citizen, which has been greatly damaged in recent years. In helping to restore consumer confidence, and pointing the financial sector more towards the real economy, the FTT can become an important contributor to our growth agenda.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-109-000" speaker_id="39317" name="Anni Podimata" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly in order to be consistent in our position, let me remind you that in Europe today, there are already nine countries that have a form of FTT in place, including the most thriving financial centres in this continent. These jurisdictions are still major financial centres despite these taxes. That clearly means that a carefully designed FTT does not lead to relocation of financial institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, some colleagues expressed fears about the negative effects of a financial transaction tax on growth, enterprises and households. The truth is that enterprises and households are suffering right now as a result of the financial crisis, caused by the financial sector because of high VAT levels and high taxes on labour.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding exemptions, I fully agree with Commissioner Šemeta that exemptions create distortions and room for loopholes. I would like to remind you that in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we reached a compromise provisionally exempting pension funds until the review of this directive. We did this in the spirit of compromise – a compromise which I regret is not yet in place – despite the fact that the FTT would have minimal impact on conservative funds. This compromise can better secure the pensions of Europeans by incentivising them to follow prudent investment strategies.</p>
      <p sl="en">But if we were to suggest further exemptions on investment projects with risky investment policies, that would not be in line with what we want to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I would like to urge you to endorse by a large majority the report for a common system on an EU financial transaction tax. This would send a strong political message to the Council – especially today since there is the informal summit of the European Council on growth – and confirm that this House has been, and remains, consistent with the major policies and approaches that it has defended from the very beginning of this crisis.</p>

      <p sl="de">The resolution before us sends out a clear signal and supports the conviction that the social democrats have had for a long time that the crisis can only be overcome if the financial sector is put in its place.</p>
      <p sl="de">To avoid the excesses of the banks in 2008 from being repeated in the future, we need to rigorously pursue two goals. Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, it must not be possible for banks to operate in such a short-sighted and reckless manner in the future. Secondly, we must invest more in the real economy in order to stem the power of the financial sector in today’s economy. Both of these things can be achieved by the planned tax. Even the extremely low tax rates of 0.01% and 0.1% would provide the Member States with additional resources of up to EUR 100 billion. That EUR 100 billion could relieve the burden on severely stretched budgets and be used to invest in lasting growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am confident that you will all use your votes to give this proposal the necessary emphasis, and I call on all the Member States not to block the Commission’s proposal in the Council. However, should such a common EU-wide solution fail due to a handful of naysayers, then the remaining Member States must set a good example by pushing ahead via the process of enhanced cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">There are at least two aspects to this discussion on a common system of financial transaction tax: the first aspect, relating to the tax itself, along with its technical features and policy implications, and the second aspect, relating to where the revenue collected by the tax will go. According to Commission forecasts, this revenue could amount to EUR 57 billion. There is much to recommend the tax itself. As an instrument for dispensing a certain amount of tax justice and for combating financial speculation, it is necessary, albeit insufficient on its own; other measures, such as an end to tax havens and the more speculative financial products, are also needed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although we agree with the general form of the agreement, this proposal has provoked some reservations and disagreement, for instance, in relation to the more favourable treatment given to derivatives and other structured products, where evidence shows that speculation is most intense. Management of the revenue from the tax is inextricably bound up in the previous discussion, although it goes beyond the scope of this directive. We completely oppose the Commission’s proposal to channel any revenue into the EU budget, with a corresponding cut in direct contributions from the Member States. This will benefit the large countries most of all, jeopardising the redistributive function of the budget even more.</p>

      <p sl="pl">This debate in the European Parliament is extremely significant, since we are talking about an annual amount exceeding EUR 50 billion which would supplement the EU’s budget. This would allow for a gradual reduction of the burden on national budgets. It is worth emphasising the fact that a financial transaction tax meets most of the criteria laid down by Parliament for a source of own resources, among others, sufficient revenues, stability, visibility and simplicity, low operating costs and efficient allocation of resources. I therefore believe that amounts generated through this tax should be treated wholly or at least to a significant extent as own resources. This would require the introduction of this tax in all Member States and effective coordination mechanisms.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The financial sector was one of the major causes of the financial crisis. Citizens of all countries have had to foot the bill in order to save the financial sector and overcome the repercussions of the crisis. In the EU, we are combating this crisis, the result of which has been an increase in direct and indirect taxation and a significant reduction in salaries and pensions. At the same time, the financial sector is the only sector still largely exempt from taxation on its activities and transactions.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It cannot continue to function in such a way whereby someone benefits in both good times and bad, and the people will always have to bear the costs.</p>
      <p sl="sk">What we want to implement is actually an indirect tax, so that nobody is punished and our citizens will not be affected. Saying that, the tax is so low that the concerns raised here are not justified. Nine countries in Europe have already introduced some kind of financial transaction tax and the result has not led to financial leakage.</p>
      <p sl="sk">High-frequency trading has no productive effect and seriously disrupts market prices and the functioning of our economies. The role of the financial sector is to support the real economy, sustainable growth, employment and productive investment, not speculation and risk. In higher income countries, the FTT project may lead to higher growth in their economies and establish the basis for a mechanism for the elimination of further crises.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The global economic and financial crisis has seriously affected the economies and public finances of the Member States. There is no doubt that the financial sector had an important part to play in causing the economic crisis; however, the costs of the rescue programmes have been borne by central budgets, or, in other words, European taxpayers. There is a broad consensus in Europe and in the international arena that the financial sector should participate to a greater extent in the cost of rescue programmes. Fiscal intervention is also justified by the relatively low taxation of the financial sector compared to other sectors of the economy. The Commission’s proposal for a directive on a common financial transaction tax gives concrete form to these considerations. The European Union is thus the first in the G20 group to put forward a constructive regulatory proposal in this area. I think that the proposals tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are useful. As well as the rule of location, it is worth noting the introduction of an additional criterion of issuance in defining a transaction subject to taxation, the exemption from taxation of pension funds, and the establishment of preferential rates for trade in regulated markets. However, I think the amendment submitted during the plenary session regarding the exclusion of investment funds from taxation is detrimental. In my opinion, this proposal distorts the idea of a financial transaction tax, since it excludes a large group of financial institutions from taxation and thus reduces the effectiveness of the regulation.</p>

      <p sl="de">It has taken a long time to get to the point where speculators are to be made to make a solidarity contribution to pay for the consequences of the crisis. It was precisely this risky business, detached from the real economy, which led us into the depths of the economic and financial crisis. The financial transaction tax should now put a brake on such short-term speculation, which has no added value of any kind for the real economy. Quite rightly, a broad majority of EU citizens are speaking out in favour of a financial transaction tax. In order to be efficient, the tax should be applied as widely as possible. This applies both to the nature of the transaction – currency speculators must also be included – and to the number of Member States. I hope that a broad majority will vote in favour, and that Parliament will hold its own against the various financial lobbies and financial markets.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The Podimata report on a common system for taxing financial transactions has been a major success for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, for whom this tax represents a key instrument for responding to the crisis. The approved resolution at last provides a concrete and fair response to the financial sector, which has so far not been affected by any regulation in spite of the fact that it is directly responsible for the crisis. The tax rates of 0.1% for shares and bonds and 0.01% for derivatives, of which the majority of European citizens are in favour, provide Europe with an effective instrument of control and a tool in tackling tax evasion. The tax will be applied on the basis of the residence and issuance principles to financial institutions and non-European securities. I am critical of the exemption of pension funds, because they truly are tigers of the financial markets, which, since they carry out speculative, high-risk transactions, should be subject to the same control.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by David Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament on the detailed provisions governing the exercise of the European Parliament’s right of inquiry and repealing Decision 95/167/EC, Euratom, ECSC of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission (2009/2212(INI)) (A7-0352/2011).</p>

    <intervention id="3-118-000" speaker_id="1403" name="David Martin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I shall begin with some ‘thank yous’, firstly to the secretariat of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO), and, in particular, Tamás Lukácsi, for his assistance in drafting this report. I would also like to thank Commissioner Šefčovič and Minister Wammen from the Danish Presidency for their willingness to engage at an early stage in this process. Their contributions in the AFCO committee and to me personally have been very welcome, and I look forward to working further with both of them in order to reach an agreement which is satisfactory to all the European institutions. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for the very cooperative atmosphere in which we have negotiated this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an ambitious report and a very timely one since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. Back in 1995, when I was the rapporteur for this Parliament on the Maastricht Treaty, we successfully advocated elevating Parliament’s ability to hold a committee of inquiry to a Treaty-based function. Since then, the powers of the committee have not changed. Committees of inquiry are a tool for Parliament to investigate allegations of maladministration in the implementation of EU law. In their investigations, committees can speak to individuals involved and request documents to see if there have been any breaches of law or elements of corruption in the administration of the law.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like firstly to outline the importance of this role for Parliament in exercising its supervisory powers, before getting to the substance of the report and to the procedure. There have been three committees of inquiry in the history of this Parliament: one on the Community Transit Regime, one on bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and, more recently, one on Equitable Life, the UK life assurance company. The Equitable Life inquiry concluded that Parliament lacked the ability to get to the truth because we could not speak to the people involved, we could not ensure access to documents and there were no consequences for false testimony. It is perhaps not surprising that the last inquiry committee struggled to uncover the truth.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have gained significant new powers in the European Parliament over the last two decades, but our role in democratic scrutiny now needs to be brought into the 21st century. Since the Lisbon Treaty, Parliament is on an equal footing with the Council in its role as a legislator, and has significant powers of budgetary control, but in the area of democratic scrutiny, we lack the tools to uncover the truth.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the same way that most national parliaments have the tools at their disposal to uncover fraudulent implementation of national law, it is the European Parliament’s responsibility to investigate maladministration of EU law on behalf of European citizens. Fundamentally, a committee of inquiry tries to uncover the truth about the past. As that great philosopher Bob Dylan said: ‘Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through’.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not an easy task to inquire into the past and uncover the truth and, without the ability to access documents and individuals, Parliament cannot perform this democratic duty effectively. It is a role which Parliament takes seriously and has not used frivolously. With only three committees in the lifetime of the Parliament, there should be no concerns that this tool will be overused.</p>
      <p sl="en">So why are we reforming the rules now? Firstly, because a much-needed update to the rules has been pending since the conclusion of the Equitable Life inquiry and the recommendations that it made. Secondly, because the Lisbon Treaty has elevated the rules on committees of inquiry into a regulation. In fact, under Article 226 of the Lisbon Treaty, Parliament has the unusual role of policy initiator. We are acting here in what is usually the Commission’s role, and my report is the policy proposal to which the Council and Commission must give their consent.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are three important elements of a European Parliament committee of inquiry which are addressed in my proposed reforms. The first is the ability to speak directly to the individuals involved in the issue. A major problem identified in the Equitable Life inquiry was the inability to request specific individuals. Instead, in many cases, the institutions in question would send a spokesman. I think it is vital that, when we are looking into decisions which were taken, we are able to speak directly to those who were involved, or to the experts on a particular issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second issue is access to documents and the ability of a committee of inquiry to see documents which are directly related to the inquiry. Thirdly, the ability of a committee of inquiry to visit the Member State and to see for itself the context of the investigation is vital.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now we know from past inquiries that without any form of sanction for refusal to testify, for false testimony or for bribery, the committee lacks teeth and can lack legitimacy. What we are proposing in this report is to give the European Parliament the same basis for sanctions that exists in many Member States, and my report was based on very detailed studies of national parliaments’ committees of inquiry.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is also important to note that, of course, Parliament is not a court. Any sanctions for false testimony or bribery would have to be enacted by the Member States under an agreement reached in this reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the final conclusions of a committee of inquiry, however, the remit is simple: to uncover the truth. We do not hand down sanctions, we do not hand down sentences, we do not take any legal action. That would be for others, based on our recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I look forward to working with the other institutions and with my colleagues in finding a satisfactory conclusion to this report and I am optimistic that the three institutions can agree.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, the right of inquiry is an important feature of the European Parliament’s supervisory powers, allowing it to set up committees of inquiry to investigate alleged maladministration in the implementation of Union law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst the Lisbon Treaty has not materially changed the specific subject matter covered by Parliament’s right of inquiry, it has introduced changes in the procedure for establishing the detailed provisions governing the exercise of that right. Such provisions shall now be determined by Parliament, acting on its own initiative after obtaining the consent of the Council and the Commission. The Presidency fully respects Parliament’s right of initiative on this matter and has therefore closely followed the work of Mr Martin’s report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Likewise, the Presidency has worked hard within the Council to be ready to begin formal trialogue negotiations with Parliament. During the exchange of views I had on this topic with the Constitutional Affairs Committee (AFCO) in January, I indicated that, coming from a country with a tradition of transparency and strong parliamentary scrutiny, I will approach this matter with an open mind and a willingness to find a reasonable compromise.</p>
      <p sl="en">The contacts that have taken place between the rapporteur and the Presidency following the vote in AFCO on the Martin report have provided an excellent opportunity to discuss the matter further and to improve our respective understanding of each other’s viewpoint. I would like to thank Mr Martin for his willingness to listen to the Council’s concerns and for the constructive dialogue which he entered into with the Presidency. There is no reason to hide the fact that this matter is sensitive for all the institutions concerned. However, I am confident that the contacts which the Presidency had with Mr Martin will provide a good basis for further interinstitutional contacts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Without entering into much detail on the draft report, I would like to highlight two points which are of particular importance to the Council. Firstly, the Council believes that the fundamentally political nature of Parliament’s right of inquiry should be reflected in the proposed new rules. This is crucial in order to avoid any interference with court proceedings. It also means that committees of inquiry cannot be vested with prerogatives of a quasi-judicial nature.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the principle of attribution of competences, which is also enshrined in the Treaties, has to be fully respected. This implies that, in the framework of their investigations, the committees of inquiry should avoid any overlap with the competences of other institutions or of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, Vice-President of the Commission, I look forward to further contact with Mr Martin and with Parliament’s negotiating team on this issue, and let me assure you that the Presidency will do its utmost to reach a compromise which will be acceptable to all three institutions and will allow Parliament to exercise its right of inquiry in the most efficient possible way.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Lisbon Treaty included many innovations for the European Parliament, one of which is Parliament’s new right of initiative to set the ground rules for committees of inquiry. This clearly puts democracy in the driving seat and we should all applaud that.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is now our joint responsibility to implement this new provision as soon as possible, in constructive cooperation between the three institutions, with common sense and in full respect of the letter and the spirit of Article 226 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has always defended the need for strong parliamentary oversight. Therefore, nearly a year ago, we engaged in the first discussions on Mr Martin’s draft report. I very much appreciated his cooperative spirit and good collaboration with the Presidency and Minister Wammen. At that time, we drew your rapporteur’s attention to some of the problematic elements of the initial draft, but only a few of our concerns have been reflected in the outcome of the final vote in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. Likewise, the Hungarian Presidency and now the Danish Presidency have also expressed certain concerns and I very much welcome your rapporteur’s openness to taking some of these on board.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome Parliament’s readiness to seek a constructive solution, which is clearly reflected by the set of compromise amendments Mr Martin tabled with a view to today’s vote, which try to accommodate some of the main concerns previously expressed by the Council and the Commission. But it is probably no secret that there are still some key elements to be discussed before the necessary consent of the Commission, foreseen by Article 226, can be given.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me mention some of the important elements for the Commission. We believe that the scope of the future regulation should remain the same as in the current decision. Indeed, as Article 226 states, the European Parliament may only set up committees of inquiry in the course of its duties and, pursuant to Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union, it shall act within the limits conferred on it in the Treaties. The Commission explicitly welcomes your compromise amendments in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also not forget that changes in Article 226 concern only the procedure and the type of act, not the mandate of a committee of inquiry, and that committees of inquiry are a fundamentally political rather than legal tool, at Parliament’s disposal for the exercise of political control. This is why I believe further discussions will be necessary also on the investigative tools proposed in the Parliament draft, which still appear rather excessive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, let me also mention Article 17 of the draft regulation, which concerns the hearing of officials and other servants of the EU and of Member States. Your compromise amendments address some of our key concerns as regards the issue of ‘freedom to testify’ and we can accept the inclusion of a ‘comply or explain’ procedure, but a certain perplexity still remains on our side as regards the different treatment of national and EU officials that you propose, which in our view, cannot be objectively justified.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against this background, the Commission welcomes your intention to vote today only on the report, including some additional amendments, but not on the legislative resolution. This gives the three institutions the chance to engage in constructive trilateral discussions after the vote, so as to agree on a text to which the Council and Commission could easily give their consent according to Article 226, after Parliament has voted on the legislative resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">I very much look forward to working with you and with the Council in order to achieve an early and successful conclusion on this important file.</p>

The work of the committee of inquiry into the Equitable Life Assurance Society crisis brought to light some surprising substantive facts, but it also showed that the instrument we have can definitely be improved. That is why this dossier is an important step forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">Allow me to mention very briefly the five points that my group feels are important. Firstly, we understand that the Commission and the Council have concerns if there is reason, because of well-understood interests, for officials and ministers not to testify. The decision on this cannot be taken in an autocratic manner, however; it must be justified and declared.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, it cannot be left to the discretion of the person being heard to decide whether to appear in public or in camera. Thirdly, anyone who gives evidence must, of course, tell the truth. Fourthly, we expect the Member States to impose sanctions on those who do not tell the truth that are at least as severe as those imposed on people who do not tell the truth before equivalent national institutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fifthly, and this is what my group’s Amendment 31 is concerned with, it is important that at the end of the work of a committee of inquiry, a minority conclusion must also stand. I very much regret that this has been declared inadmissible by the President or his administration, and I do not consider this decision to be correct.</p>
      <p sl="de">One final word: both the Council and the Commission have expressed their pleasure at Parliament’s readiness to compromise. I would be pleased if, at the end of the day, this pleasure at a readiness to compromise could be shared by all sides.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Martin’s report paves the way to the full implementation of the Treaties’ provision governing the right of inquiry, essential for carrying out one of Parliament’s fundamental duties: political control.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Treaty of Lisbon introduced a special legislative procedure, and we therefore hope that during negotiations, both the institutions – Council and Commission – will uphold the spirit of this rule which explicitly entrusts the power of initiative and regulatory power to Parliament, and limits the role of the Council and Commission to a mere expression of consent.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Martin’s report draws on the previous experiences of temporary committees of inquiry which have shown the limitations of this instrument, and proposes significant innovations. Informal talks with the Danish Presidency and with the Commission have resulted in satisfactory compromise proposals which meet some of the requests of the Member States and the Commission, but which do not limit Parliament’s right to hold to account EU and national institutions for the correct implementation of EU legislation, and to identify possible instances of maladministration.</p>
      <p sl="it">Certain wording could be better clarified, but it is vital not to compromise on one point: the committees of inquiry must have access to documents and persons. This has nothing to do with judicial duties but, precisely, it concerns the full implementation of the political right clearly enshrined in the Treaties: the right of political control.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Martin for his excellent levels of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU needs good governance, and transparent and democratic administration. That means Parliament having a right of access to documents relating to legislation. This is what is being negotiated right now, and things do not look good, because the Commission and the Council oppose it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Now, however, we are considering another aspect of the matter, which is what powers Parliament has to supervise administration by means of the committee of inquiry. This is about political scrutiny, not judicial scrutiny, and that difference needs to be kept in mind, but Parliament must definitely have the right to undertake political scrutiny of this kind. I do not think that this means that national and EU civil servants have to be accorded equal status, which is the view that was taken by the Commissioner. I am not in favour of national civil servants having the same role here in Parliament that you commissioners do, for example. However, nor do you go along to national parliaments to be questioned by committees of inquiry in the same way that national civil servants do. That is the small difference to which I am referring.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is nevertheless important that Parliament has a robust role in the supervision of the various institutions. Only in this way can we strengthen people’s confidence in the work of this European Union, and there is a lot to do in that area. As this committee of inquiry now exists and its role is being strengthened, I nevertheless hope that it will be used rarely, as has been the case hitherto, and with discretion, and only in very important cases.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, democracy needs procedures, and procedures can only work as well as the rules on which they are based. In the case of the right of inquiry, these rules are completely inadequate, as experience to date has shown – in the case of the committee of inquiry into the crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, for example. That is why we need once and for all a functioning right of inquiry. Where there are grievances, misconduct and scandals, we need to investigate these, to bring matters into the light. We must replace cheap sensationalism and suspicion with clarity and truth; likewise, where there is concealment and obfuscation. That is our task, and we do it in the interests of and on behalf of our citizens. We need to have sight of all the relevant documents. We need to be able to hear all the relevant witnesses and persons concerned, including on the spot, and any failure to appear or refusal to testify or false testimony must have serious and effective consequences.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to touch on one more point that unfortunately is not being voted on today. Experience has shown that, in a committee of inquiry, not all parties are always equally keen to shed light on matters. That is regrettable, because in fact, whatever national interests or considerations or party political interests or considerations may be at stake, everyone should be equally keen to bring matters to light. Experience shows, however, that occasionally, a minority is much more ready and much more clearly prepared to reveal the facts than the majority. That is why it is compellingly necessary to have the option of minority conclusions in committees of inquiry.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, scrutiny by this Parliament is important. Our job is not only to pass legislation – something which we do rather too much of – but also to ensure that taxpayers’ money is spent wisely, both by the Commission and by the Member States. My predecessor in the South-West of England was Neil Parish, now the Member of Parliament for Tiverton and Honiton. He was instrumental in setting up the parliamentary inquiry into the foot-and-mouth outbreak in the UK in 2001. That inquiry revealed how incompetently the last Labour Government handled that crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">This reform shows how inquiries should be undertaken. It contains some good parts but goes too far in granting powers to this Parliament. For example, it grants Parliament the power to summons individuals and the power to sanction those who refuse to attend. The Treaties do not grant us these powers and, in my view, we would be overreaching ourselves by approving this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not support the provisions relating to officials of national governments. Civil servants have a duty to provide their best advice to ministers and, having done so, to carry out those ministerial decisions. This proposal risks undermining that trust and subverting ministerial accountability, which is rightly judged by national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="en">If these proposals are to achieve anything, it should be to introduce greater accountability to the European institutions. It is here that Parliament should concentrate its efforts by bringing the bureaucrats in Brussels under democratic oversight and control.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when our citizens are increasingly losing confidence in the European Union and the application of the law practised by its policies in many areas, Mr Martin’s own-initiative report can only be welcomed, and I would like to expressly lend my group’s support to this own-initiative report. It concerns taking further practical steps to assert the right explicitly laid down in Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Parliament’s task of exercising political control. I therefore do not agree with the previous speaker that we should not expand the right of inquiry or the rights of the European Parliament in this way, for how can and should Article 226 intervene in practice, in concrete terms, if it becomes necessary to set up temporary committees of inquiry in order to uncover and put a stop to, and I quote:</p>
      <p sl="de">‘alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Union law’.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need a permanent inquiry procedure that functions in real terms, is transparent and creates transparency.</p>
      <p sl="de">Inquiry proceedings do indeed have an important role to play in a parliamentary democracy. They allow parliaments to examine the facts independently and autonomously where they consider this necessary in order to perform their constitutional task of representing citizens. I believe this to be urgently necessary, particularly in the situation which the European Union finds itself at present.</p>

The European Parliament should indeed have the right to question EU officials, from the humblest right up to people like Mr Barroso who are not famed for their humility.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, there is no reason for this right of inquiry to extend to Member States. That is, and should be, the function of Member States’ parliaments. The committee would be able to call specific civil servants from Member States to give evidence and even obtain judicial assistance. Civil servants must at least have the right conferred by the rapporteur’s own Amendment 18 to withhold information that they would be able to withhold from their own Member State’s inquiries. Furthermore, civil servants must be protected from the dilemma of being given contradictory instructions about whether they should conceal or reveal information.</p>

Investigators on the spot request documents; here, officials from EU institutions and Member States ask national authorities for assistance – and, yes, there are sanctions. These are not, Mr Fox, European Union sanctions; they are applied in accordance with national procedures by national authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are not dogmatic. For example, in the course of negotiations, we dropped language which would have given the impression that committees of inquiry behave like a court. We recognise the possibility of authorisation for a given official to appear before the committee being denied by his superior, but in such cases, the official should come before the committee and explain the reasons.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the right of inquiry is one of the standard rights of the various democratic parliaments around the world. The concern that legislators should obtain a true picture of the situation arises from the need for a proper legislative response to the social reality. The scope of the right of inquiry naturally relates to the political significance of the parliament in question and the European Parliament will gradually mature, a process to which the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty contributed significantly. Thanks to this right, the European Union has become more democratic as the institutional balance has shifted towards the European Parliament which directly represents the rights of European Union citizens. In my opinion, the expected draft regulation therefore seems appropriate in view of the new status of the European Parliament and the rights arising from the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">The figures speak for themselves: since 2009, there has been a sharp decrease in catches in all our seas. We therefore need to act swiftly in order to prevent the stock from disappearing completely. A telling example of the seriousness of the situation is the reduction in the average size of tuna fish, a phenomenon which is strikingly obvious in the Adriatic Sea, my region.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must urgently set up closed areas and sanctuaries for bluefin tuna where fishing is banned to allow stocks to recover. We need to step up controls, since illegal fishing in all European seas is still too widespread and too frequent.</p>
      <p sl="it">The envisaged measures, such as the seizure of illegal vessels and gear, must go hand in hand with effective, efficient controls, carried out by an appropriate number of employees. Lastly, it is essential to raise the minimum weight of tuna fish that may be caught, currently just 30 kilograms, and ban fishing during the spawning season. In order to save bluefin tuna we can, and must, do more.</p>

Of course, that also requires bilateral international agreements, which are not that easy to implement. I would therefore like to ask Parliament and the competent committee to reconsider once more whether we should not create sanctuaries. We have experience of this on land, where we have created reserves for animals worthy of protection or species requiring total protection. We need to do something similar in our waters and oceans.</p>

Whilst it is imperative that we move towards sustainable fisheries, we must pay heed to the lessons which can be learnt from recovery plans applied elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I might quote from the Commission’s own Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries in their evaluation of the recovery plan for cod, overall, STECF concludes that the plan is not delivering reduced fishing mortality and, additionally, in many areas does not have stakeholders’ support. A plan with stakeholders’ support is more likely to succeed because the stakeholder actions are needed to contribute to its success. Support of the plan also should, in theory, lead to their acceptance of responsibility to fulfil their obligations. These lessons are equally applicable to bluefin tuna.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I, too, voted in favour of the Romeva i Rueda report. After indiscriminate depletion of bluefin stocks over many years, the species mercifully has recovered its numbers now. This view has been corroborated by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, a respected authority on tuna stocks, which has recommended a strict management plan for bluefin tuna stocks in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean seas, areas of particular commercial fishing activity.</p>
      <p sl="en">I maintain that fishing of all species must be conducted sustainably, for example, by using pole-and-line methods which allow caught juvenile fish to be returned immediately to the sea, enabling them to spawn, as opposed to these huge industrial trawling nets which indiscriminately catch all fish and also additional by-catches of sharks and turtles, etc. This is shocking, and leads to severe depletion of the stocks, calling into question long-term species sustainability and marine conservation.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, I would like to refer to the report on the proposal for a Council directive on a common system of financial transaction tax. This report favours the establishment of a financial transaction tax that will burden the financial sector with new taxes. I voted against this report because the introduction of a financial transaction tax goes against the interests of the countries and of the Maltese and Gozitan workers. This tax will lead to a loss of jobs in the Maltese financial sector at a time when our economy is weak. This is an important sector for Malta since it represents 15% of GDP and employs around 6 000 people. In addition, this tax will eat away at the sector’s competitiveness, have a negative impact on GDP and reduce the volume of financial operations due to the delocalisation of financial transactions. With a tax such as this one, financial activities and transactions will end up taking place outside of Malta, in countries that do not have this tax obligation, making it cheaper. Aside from this, it is the consumer who will ultimately end up shouldering the burden of the financial transaction tax.</p>

It is also rare to hear such well-versed and wise words from the socialist side of the Chamber, so I was pleased to hear it. Europe is in a severe economic crisis. Everyone is talking about growth, everyone is talking about creating jobs, and what does a huge majority of the European Parliament do? They withdraw venture capital from Europe, thereby making it more expensive to borrow money and thus more expensive and more difficult for enterprises to create jobs. I do not consider that to be a particularly good remedy. All right, then: all of you who voted in favour of this, perhaps you would now like to go home to your respective countries and convince your governments that they can simply implement a transaction tax, if it is as wonderful as some people are making it out to be. Just let the rest of us carry on without it. I can tell you that it will not be passed with Danish votes at any rate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today, I voted against this report on a European tax on financial transactions because I consider that the text proposed failed one fundamental test – namely, to ensure that an EU financial transaction tax (FTT) would be paid by financial institutions and bankers but not by ordinary citizens. The text today does not include the necessary safeguards to ensure that the price of an FTT would not be passed on to ordinary people through reduced returns in their pensions, increased home or car insurance or higher prices for manufactured goods.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that the tax which is proposed today can lead only to a hidden tax on the real economy: the so-called Robin Hood tax has turned into the Sheriff of Nottingham tax. Moreover, the prospects of seeing an FTT implemented at EU level with 27 Member States involved, let alone at global level, are extremely unlikely. A European FTT without London involved in the system cannot be a serious exercise which delivers what we want – namely, to make financial institutions, bankers and speculators contribute more in return for the huge cost to taxpayers of bailing them out. The tax will simply not deliver.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I voted against this proposal today even though I am fundamentally in favour of such a tax. It is simply that I feel that without a simultaneous reduction in the Member States’ contributions in the event that the revenue remains with the EU as own resources, and without the simultaneous introduction of rules for the financial markets and strict supervision of the financial markets, there is little point in such a transaction tax. In the final event, it would only become a burden on our citizens. The citizens will have to pay it. It is not enough; it does not allow us to really regulate the financial markets and does nothing to avert a future crisis or to overcome the current crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">There would have been a point to it had we drawn the right conclusions, which would be to introduce strict rules for the financial markets, actually to accompany such rules with effective supervision and to implement them. Unfortunately, that is not the case. In my view, the Commission has only done half its job.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, it is obvious why the EU is trying to progress beyond the current situation, where 85% of its revenues come from the Member States. In my opinion, however, the financial transaction tax is not the right system for securing the Union’s own resources. We must first and foremost identify savings in budget expenditure, something which the European Conservatives and Reformists Group points out every year in the discussions on granting discharge. In my opinion, the financial transaction tax will make banking services more expensive, provoking an anti-EU backlash among European citizens and encouraging them to focus on financial transactions that are not as yet taxed. The result will be that many transactions start to be made outside the EU. I also believe that tax levels should not be identical across the EU, and that Member States should have the power to set these levels. For these reasons in particular, I was unable to back the report and I voted against.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, there is a very clear division in this Chamber on the issue of whether a financial transaction tax should be introduced in Europe. In my opinion, this tax should definitely be introduced. We need to stimulate the European financial sector so that it can bear at least part of the cost of getting through the current crisis, since it actively contributed to it. The hardships of overcoming the crisis rest largely on taxpayers and consumers today, which is grossly unfair.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a further weighty reason in favour of taxing transactions between financial institutions. This is the need for the European Union to generate significantly more funds, but also – which, in my view, is very important – its own funds, which could be allocated to a greater extent to investments and job creation. In other words, I support this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="es">We talk a great deal about expenditure, but I see that certain Member States have very little interest in tackling issues at European level, such as financial transactions and tax fraud, a matter that is particularly scandalous and was denounced by Mr Rehn yesterday. The resistance shown by Member States deprives us of billions of euro every year that could be used to stimulate the productive economy and the real economy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, may I remind you that we are being consistent on this issue. In 2002, just before Spain took over the Presidency of the Council, the Basque parliament adopted a proposal made by my party requesting that the ‘Tobin tax’, as it was then called, should be promoted in the Presidency’s work programme. They took no notice whatsoever. Ten years after our proposal, I am pleased that we are moving in that direction, although there is still room for improvement.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I voted in favour of this motion; in other words, for a transaction tax. I would like to start with a correction: we are talking here about trading in derivatives and shares. That means we are not talking about the normal bank charges that citizens have to pay. We should keep it in mind that we are talking here about a tax rate of 0.01% for derivatives and 0.1% for shares. The real economy can only dream of such tax rates. Perhaps we should swap sometime and say that the stock exchange can have the taxes on the real economy and we will have the taxes on derivatives and shares for the real economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, I would like to stress once again that there is also a political dimension to this. The global financial crisis was not triggered by the real economy; rather, it is a result of stock market speculation, and it is an essential aspect and an act of justice for the stock market to finally share in dealing with this crisis. For me, then, the tax is more or less an act of major global justice.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report acknowledges that there is a lack of international agreement but states that the EU should go ahead anyway. However, if the EU does go it alone, we may find that, as in Sweden in the 1980s, the vast majority of our traders in bonds, equities and derivatives will relocate outside of the EU. This is unlikely to promote the growth that we all desire. The City of London plays host to a comparatively large financial services sector which is already subject to stamp duty at national level, therefore contributing to the prosperity of the EU as a whole. It would be disproportionate to request the City of London to pay in addition an EU-wide FTT, putting it at a comparative disadvantage internationally.

However, a common system of taxation risks having a negative impact on the EU’s development and competitiveness at a global level, and also places a disproportionate burden on the financial sector of individual countries.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I voted in favour of this report since it sets out many of the concerns that we in the Lega Nord have been voicing for a long time. Perhaps we were the only ones to realise the damage that the growing Chinese economy would do to our businesses and workers. Nevertheless, when we talk about applying duties to Chinese goods, we are considered backward and anti-development. The tragic results of this liberalism are, however, clear to all, and I in particular am well aware of them as I am from Prato, the city with the highest number of Chinese people in Italy.</p>
      <p sl="it">In Italy we say: ‘better late than never’, but I am not sure that Europe has truly realised that it has almost reached the point of no return. Just think, some people still see China as a potential lifeline. It would be interesting to find out how much of Europe’s public debt is in China’s hands. This might be a key to understanding why the EU is weak and to at least trying to avoid making these tragic mistakes in the future.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, according to the data at our disposal, it would appear that we cannot talk about a Europe-China imbalance. However, there is an imbalance – and several fellow Members have already spoken about it – which we are sometimes afraid to mention, which is not only the imbalance in trade. It is the social dumping and environmental imbalance which characterises the production of some of these Chinese goods; it is the violation of human rights, the exploitation of workers, the unfair competition and the lack of reciprocity which results in the European markets being flooded with Chinese goods – sometimes without controls with the goods often being counterfeit – while our businesses find it far from easy to enter the Chinese market. I believe that these issues need more attentive and strategic consideration.</p>

I am fully behind maintaining and developing further good relations with a state that will soon become the world’s most powerful economy, provided that we address the imbalances of the current relationship.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are a number of points, therefore, that I would like to support within this report. Restrictions on rare earth exports, of which China accounts for 97% of world production, must be remedied. I welcome the call for China to accede to the multilateral agreement on government procurement so that European firms have the same market access as Chinese firms.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Chinese authorities should also do more to protect intellectual property, so as to encourage, not discourage, European investors. It is regrettable that in 2010, 85% of all goods seized at the EU’s external borders for infringing intellectual rights originated in China. I must, however, point out that, whilst supporting the report as a whole, I do not support full reciprocity in trade relations with major emerging economies such as China.</p>

This is because, if there is one thing we must admit, it is that the European Union has a certain paradoxical type of dependency on China, by which I mean the public debt situation. I believe that the European Union is obliged, as a matter of urgency, to assess how much of Europe’s public debt is held by China and initiate new negotiations with China because relations are governed by an old agreement dating from 1985.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the solution is a strategic partnership with China. At the same time, this report allows us to ask a further two questions: why have we ourselves failed in Africa and Latin America, while China is starting to have success, and what solutions are available so that we can try to restore this imbalance in the European Union’s favour because we need to acknowledge that an emerging power and traditional power cannot be reconciled at the moment?</p>

Of course we tend to use this; it is the latest bogeyman that we talk to our children about. Of course we must heed these warnings and we must fight back.</p>

      <p sl="en">A number of weeks ago, the Chinese Vice-President spent three days in Ireland. He was extremely interested in our farming methodology. A week later, the Irish Prime Minister, Enda Kenny, visited China. What is obvious is that there is a huge potential food export market for EU farmers under the new common agricultural policy: a population in China of 1.3 billion people and growing.

      <p sl="en">China, sadly, does not do enough in terms of fighting piracy, stopping the production of counterfeit goods or improving labour rights, animal welfare and, most importantly, human rights. But that is another issue.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, China already determines the state of the global economy. It regularly achieves growth of 10%, and will be the strongest economy in the world by the middle of this century. Policies in relation to Beijing thus need to be based on a carefully developed strategy, looking many years ahead. As China’s largest trade partner at present and the main recipient of Chinese products, the European Union must create trade relations based on an equal partnership, which will bring benefits to both parties.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report takes a range of factors into account which will help to achieve this objective. The most important of these is the call for the abolition of trade barriers as regards access to the Chinese market. Poor protection of intellectual property rights is also a problem, making it difficult to invest in Chinese enterprises that offer advanced technologies. Chinese policies on raw materials, which clearly discriminate against European counterparties, also cause problems for this sector. In the hope of consistently strengthening the EU’s position in relations with Beijing, I support this report.</p>

There are barriers to trade, and those must also be discussed and removed. And there are also other problems, especially in relation to scarce minerals. The Chinese control 97% of the world’s scarce minerals. Their currency is undervalued and that creates an imbalance in their favour and gives them an illegal advantage in trade affairs. All these issues must be discussed with them. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reach a new investment agreement with China, in particular, one that is based on reciprocity.

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I have now listened to a whole raft of people who are all in agreement that what we need is to be treated fairly by the Chinese. I do not suppose anybody in this Parliament would disagree with that. What surprises me, when I hear so many honourable Members standing up and talking about reciprocity, is that people think that the word reciprocity is the key thing in this regard. The problem is that when drawing up agreements with other trading partners, you have to be very careful that you are not preparing the way for a trade war, and that is what reciprocity does. It is the first step towards a trade war, and that certainly does not lead to more open markets or greater access to China or more growth.</p>
      <p sl="da">What we need in Europe is a realistic view of what the Chinese can do and want to do. We must not be naïve, of course. We have to set requirements, and this report is also an expression of that. However, I would warn against using the word reciprocity as a basis in this context. It is the first step towards a trade war – in other words, it is protectionism, which is the opposite of what I imagine most Members of this Parliament would want. We must have a level playing field, as I described in my opinion on this report that I drafted for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. We must not take reciprocity as a basis; what we need is a level playing field.</p>

      <p sl="en">This report has provided an interesting insight into a fundamental division in this Parliament. There are those who believe that this Parliament should promote itself as some kind of higher level chamber of inquiry for European citizens. Indeed, the Lisbon Treaty – a sordid deal stitched up by the European elite without consulting the citizens in many cases, particularly in my own Member State – calls for just such a development.

Stocks of Atlantic bluefin tuna have been drastically reduced and urgent action is required to protect them. In this context, ICCAT agreed a new recommendation. The changes include a reduction in the Total Allowable Catch and a strengthening of the control measures used to implement the recovery plan, specifically those relating to caging and transfer operations. This is very relevant for the European Union because, despite major investment in fishing management measures, many problems still remain with regard to historical overfishing. Given that the ICCAT recommendation has already been adopted at international level, there is limited scope for amending the text of the transposition.

As tuna is a much sought-after species, it is vital that there be legislation regulating the catch that does not jeopardise existing stocks of this species. Moreover, illegal fishing is a serious threat to its recovery. Although the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas has a recovery plan with measures that have been in force since July 2011, the fact is that these have not yet been transposed into EU law, and this is undermining the credibility of the EU. I understand, however, that the restrictions should apply to everyone, and not only to European fishermen. I voted for this report because it combines the economic consequences of reducing catches with combating illegal fishing and the need to ensure the maintenance of the species in future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The main objective of this report is to transpose into EU law the amendments set out by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), a multilateral organisation for the management of tuna fisheries, in its multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna stocks. The rapporteur highlights the difficulty of establishing a management plan for the bluefin tuna fishery. He also states that the difficulty of establishing a management plan for the bluefin tuna fishery may be related to the ICCAT’s lack of financial, administrative and technological resources for controlling fishing. It is worth noting that ‘the ICCAT recovery plan is less ambitious than EU domestic legislation’. Concerns have been raised about the lack of up-to-date statistical data regarding bluefin tuna stocks and the validity of existing data. The rapporteur supports the Commission proposal, with the amendments it has introduced. We would reassert the principle that decisions on the management of living marine resources should be based on scientific knowledge and that this should be supported by data that is as concrete as possible. This report took that concern on board, hence our vote in favour. We would, however, highlight the rapporteur’s own caveats relating to the aforementioned issues; it is important that these be addressed in the future.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In November 2010, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) amended its multiannual recovery plan for the eastern stock of bluefin tuna. As the EU is a contracting party to ICCAT, it is obliged to transpose those amendments into EU law. The history of management of the bluefin tuna fishery is long and complicated. Though the stock has been fished for millennia, the problems began in earnest in the 1990s when the practice of caging bluefin in order to fatten them up for the Japanese market was introduced. The fishery for the eastern bluefin is the most tightly regulated fishery in the EU and probably among the most regulated in the world. The fishery is an unusual one in some ways. What makes the fishery unusual is the extraordinary price that the fish obtain on the market and the degree of concentration of the market in one country, Japan. This led to the dominant role in the fishery played by the combined purse seining/tuna fattening operations. I believe that extensive management and control measures in the recovery plan are needed, as well as the detailed catch documentation scheme for monitoring international trade. ICCAT members, in many cases, simply do not have the means to control the fishery. In many cases, they also lack the political will. The result is the annual amendments to both the recovery plan and the catch documentation scheme. In addition, the ICCAT recovery plan is less ambitious than EU domestic legislation.</p>

It is regrettable, however, that the European Parliament did not succeed in adopting more ambitious measures to address the plight of this iconic endangered species. The new legislation, which I certainly could not vote against, is only the bare minimum, but it will at least make it possible to enforce existing international standards. Although the European Union has just complied with the commitments made within the framework of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), we are still far from taking the necessary measures. Measures should have been taken, for example, to close zones to fishing, especially during the spawning season. In addition, stricter measures should have been adopted concerning illegal fishing and overfishing in particular, in order to fill certain gaps, which are currently exacerbating the problem of the over-exploitation of fish stocks. It may not be too late, and the EU will once again have the opportunity to enforce more stringent regulations this November.</p>

The Community has been a contracting party to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) since 1997, and its recommendations are binding. However, in 2010, ICCAT adopted a recommendation modifying the recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. This plan provides for strengthening measures to reduce fishing capacity and for reinforcing control measures. Because of the high price that bluefin tuna obtains on the market, illegal activities in the industry have increased. The speedy implementation of recommendations must therefore encourage better stock management in order to ensure that stocks recover.</p>

We are calling for appropriate transition processes during the conversion of those European fishing fleets which must be progressively decommissioned in proportion to the reduction in the TAC and the fishing season. Indeed, the measures focus on reducing the size of the fishing fleets, but also on extending the closed seasons for purse seines and tightening up controls, including those relating to the transfer of tuna from nets to cages.

This falls far below what scientists believe is necessary to give the bluefin stock a fighting chance of recovery. In that sense, this represents a missed opportunity for the EU to take meaningful steps to prevent the demise of bluefin. If the EU wants to get serious about saving bluefin, this means closing areas to fishing – particularly during the breeding season – as well as adopting more stringent measures to close some of the loopholes, which exacerbate the over-exploitation of the stock.

Personally, I voted in favour of the report since I support the decisions on the recovery plan adopted in ICCAT. This plan is considered to be a useful management instrument.

      <p sl="pt">At its annual meeting in 2010, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) adopted a recommendation amending its multiannual recovery plan for the eastern stock of bluefin tuna. This plan is aimed at strengthening measures to reduce fishing capacity and reinforce measures for monitoring catches. This proposal for a regulation seeks to transpose this recommendation by the ICCAT, to which the EU is a contracting party, into EU law.

      <p sl="en">Overfishing of bluefin tuna and illegal catches have led to stocks decreasing significantly; this is why there is a need for a renewed effort to preserve the species in Europe. I voted in favour of measures aiming to further reduce fishing quotas and strengthen controls over bluefin tuna fishing in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Some 56% of all legally captured bluefin tuna comes from EU waters. The main countries fishing it are Spain, France and Italy, and the main importer is Japan. In this resolution, which I voted in favour of, Parliament aims to tighten rules protecting EU bluefin tuna stocks, along the lines proposed by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The proposals include reducing the allowable quotas and establishing sanctuaries, calling for some zones in the Mediterranean to be declared closed areas or sanctuaries for bluefin tuna. These proposals are vital in helping to rebuild the tuna population.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of the amendments to the multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. In recent years, there has been a noticeable decrease in numbers of this type of fish. Steps should therefore be taken aimed at rebuilding these stocks, by 2019 with zero catch and by 2022 with current catch. In order to do so, it is necessary to reduce the Total Allowable Catch from 13 500 to 12 900 tonnes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I fully support the amendments aimed at increasing control, extending the closed season for purse seines in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, banning joint fishing operations with non EU-flagged vessels and strengthening measures to reduce fishing capacity. To this end, it is necessary to maintain a detailed documentation system intended to limit profits from illegal, unreported and unregulated tuna fishing.

      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament took up the issue of double-hull vessels following several accidents involving cruise ships in recent months. My French colleague, Dominique Riquet, of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) produced the report on the recasting of the regulation on the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull requirements, the primary aim of which was to incorporate new international rules established by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) into a regulation dating from 2002. Furthermore, as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I could only support this report, which is also a tool to fight pollution. The regulation on double-hull vessels prevents the contents of cargo tanks from being discharged into the sea and causing major oil pollution following a collision or grounding.

Millions of barrels of oil are transported across the oceans every day. Indeed, the sea remains the main ‘highway’ for large oil tankers.

We all remember the environmental disasters caused by oil slicks following oil tanker accidents such as those involving the Erika in 1999 and the Prestige in 2002.

The accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for current single-hull oil tankers is extremely important for ensuring that the maritime and coastal environment is adequately protected. The risk of a disaster weighs especially heavily on closed seas such as the Mediterranean: owing to its specific geographical nature, in the event of a spill, its ecosystem would be irreversibly contaminated.</p>

      <p sl="it">Oil spills in seas owing to oil tanker accidents happen too frequently. The environmental damage which lasts for decades, linked to the lack, in many ships, of a double hull which would prevent crude oil leaking out, is today unacceptable. It is therefore vital for all oil tankers which still have a single hull to be fitted with a double hull or equivalent design intended to eliminate or minimise an oil leak in the event of an accident. I therefore voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="et">The accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers is a very important topic. Oil spills caused by accidents involving oil tankers, notably the cases involving the Erika in 1999 and the Prestige in 2002, are far-reaching environmental catastrophes that have disastrous consequences for marine fauna and flora. Two accidents involving oil tankers have already taken place this year in Europe, and although these did not cause great environmental damage, they nonetheless once again demonstrate that a relatively large number of accidents take place involving the abovementioned ships, and thus it is necessary to guarantee the safety of the environment, the ships and their crews.</p>
      <p sl="et">By adopting this regulation, we will reduce the danger of accidental oil spills in European bodies of water through the phasing-in of double hulls. In single-hull vessels, the oil in the cargo tank is only separated from the seawater by the hull and a wall of sheet metal. The double-wall design protects cargo tanks in the event of an accident, thereby reducing the danger of pollution. Based on the above considerations, I supported the adoption of this report.</p>

An effective means of avoiding this risk is to surround the cargo tanks with a second inner plate at a sufficient distance from the outer shell.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Oil slicks due to oil tanker accidents, such as those involving the Erika in 1999 and the Prestige in 2002, result in the destruction of marine and coastal biodiversity and are justification enough for the accelerated phasing-in of design requirements for oil tankers. The aim of this regulation, recast by the Commission, is to avoid any possibility of crude oil spills through the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull design requirements for single-hull oil tankers. However, I support the rapporteur’s opinion on the delegation of powers to the Commission.

According to projections from the European Commission, this FTT could generate up to EUR 57 billion. In these times of crisis, might this not be an excellent opportunity for the financial sector to contribute to steering Europe towards recovery, to restore its reputation and to regain citizens’ confidence? Finally, contrary to what the French socialists would have us believe, the idea of an FTT was put forward by Nicolas Sarkozy at both national level (and it will apply in France from 1 August) and EU level.

Fair taxation alternatives are therefore needed that do not punish citizens even more.

That is a huge amount considering the austerity measures our countries are now facing. Consumer spending and business investment are already under great pressure. The financial transaction tax costs a lot of money and will cost us jobs and growth, too, which is exactly why the tax burden should not be allowed to increase unnecessarily. And the last thing we need is a European tax, the revenue from which would partly go to the European Union, which is ultimately a bill that our citizens and businesses would have to pick up.

An FTT is, by definition, a feature of the single market. A European legal framework for such an FTT pursues a dual objective: one of fairness, insofar as financial transactions remain largely untaxed, and one of harmonisation, because there needs to be one single European approach towards the taxation of financial transactions, with rates that are, if not identical across the EU, then at least comparable and established on the basis of a common minimum. The FTT is also intimately linked to the objective of unleashing the full potential of the single market in order to regain growth in Europe and thus provide an opportunity to reach the goals set out by the Europe 2020 strategy. Investments in the single market are needed, and they should proceed from a European source of funding. Therefore, an FTT, the revenue of which accrues to the general budget of the European Union, contributes to raising the monies required for consistent European investments in its own economic progress. However, the FTT must raise sufficient revenue in order to fulfil its role as a political tool in overcoming the crisis and must not dissuade the operation of such investment vehicles, which the EU needs in order to ensure economic development and fair earnings for retired citizens.</p>

I see the main problem as being that the financial transaction tax will be limited to the EU and will not have a global dimension. Capital will therefore have the option of flight and it will undoubtedly make use of this. I understand that some European politicians are unsettled by the financial ping-pong going on over their heads, but the introduction of a European tax that will be easy to run away from is no solution. Capital behaves, in short, like a timid beast, scurrying off at the slightest whiff of any tax risk. The expected EUR 55 billion revenues from the transaction tax are, in my view, chimerical.

The only purpose of the tax is to give Brussels its own source of income, while hammering national economies – weakening their independence. It is a shrewd way of moving money, and thus power, to the centre, paving the way for a federalised super-state. The very fact that the European Union feels it can give itself tax-raising powers without recourse to any sort of democratic vote is frankly horrifying. It is very easy to sell such a tax to the public as taking money from greedy bankers. But that is a profligate lie. Banks themselves cannot be ‘taxed’. The FTT would affect wages after making raising capital more expensive. Less money means smaller pay, not for the bankers, but for everyday workers. It would affect pensions, mortgages – all financial services. The FTT would impact upon everyone, affecting overall GDP, taking money from Member States while Brussels builds its own reserves. The FTT would increase volatility, not reduce it. It would disproportionately target the UK, destroy competitiveness and do unforetold damage to the City of London – something I am sure Brussels would delight in.</p>

I am certainly convinced that it would introduce a means of making the internal market grow and become more stable, restricting distortions of competition and the risks of double taxation where national taxes are not coordinated. It would also make a significant contribution to combating financial speculation, which is the main cause of the current crisis. Thirdly, I most certainly agree that there is a need for the European Union to find a way to collect own resources so that it can function more freely.</p>

The FTT should also be used to finance global goods, such as development and climate change. There are important issues for Ireland that need to be addressed but I do think the European Parliament does set out some good solutions in this regard, particularly on the issuance and ownership principles.

Instead, in some ways, with productive sectors now weakened by the period we have gone through, it seems even more serious and now might become structural within economic systems. On the other hand, even the repeated and numerous recurrences of the original causes of the crisis demonstrate that the ‘market’ is not an abstract entity that can regulate itself efficiently, as experts in the new welfare economy would still have us believe, but that it is, instead, a system managed by a few individuals worldwide who, often unscrupulously, attack financial markets, productive systems and institutions with the hope of profiting from their weakening or even from their failure. The actions taken by each individual country are not enough to address this global crisis. What we need are decisions made at an equal level. The financial transaction tax would be useful in mitigating the devastating effects of raider activity, especially if it were adopted globally and if it did not impact on national bonds or pension funds.

The FTT may improve the level of security for financial activities, stop the deviations resulting from financial speculation and, at the same time, increase the financial sector’s contribution to the economic recovery of the Union, which has so far only been loaded onto people’s backs through austerity measures and excessive taxation. I also positively welcome the derogation granted by the proposal to pension funds which would see the tax waived on their transactions. Pension funds constitute, in fact, a very delicate field, differing by their very nature from the financial sector’s other activities: they deserved to have special treatment. I believe that the FTT will be able to grant the EU the necessary stability and resilience in financial activities, producing more certainty for investors, protecting the system from speculators and granting the EU new resources to be redirected to the real economy of our countries.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The financial sector pays too little tax. It has a tax advantage because it is exempt from VAT. According to the European Commission, this amounts to between 0.11% and 0.17% of GDP. The result is an uneven distribution of resources. The risk capital which should end up in other sectors is instead used by financial companies in a way which is less beneficial to society.</p>
      <p sl="sv">There are still many question marks over this tax, but it is reasonable to regard it as one of the alternatives which should be included in the ongoing debate on how the undertaxation of the financial sector can be rectified.</p>
      <p sl="sv">If a transaction tax has to be introduced, this must happen at a global level. We should not dismiss the possibility of the EU taking the lead, but in this case, any move of this kind should be seen primarily as a step on the road towards a global tax.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We are all aware that the current economic and financial crisis, which is taking a long time to disappear, had its origins in the financial sector. This was an unregulated sector that bankrupted thousands of businesses and put millions of people out of work. Given that the crisis was started by the financial economy, it is only fair that this sector should pay for a part of the crisis, rather than leaving that to the public, as is the case at present. This report by Ms Podimata focuses on the proposal for a Council directive on a common system of financial transaction tax (FTT) and amending Directive 2008/7/EC. I voted for this proposal because it improves transparency and relieves the burden on the public by requiring a fair contribution from the financial sector. I hope that the FTT will be adopted at the next EU Council of finance ministers in July.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In general, we support the proposal to create a financial transaction tax; we have long been advocating it. Whether as an instrument that provides a certain amount of tax justice or as a tool for combating financial speculation, it is necessary, albeit insufficient on its own. However, we do have some reservations about, and disagree with, certain specific aspects of this proposal. Although these reservations and disagreements had no bearing on how we voted, they may strongly influence our position in the later stages of this debate, for example, in relation to managing the revenue to be collected with this tax. That issue falls outside the scope of this directive, but that did not stop the majority in Parliament from including it; that is unacceptable. We consider the principle of revenue from the tax replacing part of the national contributions to the EU budget, thereby reducing the Member States’ direct contributions, completely unacceptable. This principle will result in continued penury budgets, while relieving the burden on richer countries with higher GNI, including those with bigger transactions markets, thus undermining the redistributive function of the budget and, with it, the – never realised – principle of economic and social cohesion. We also disagree with the relatively favourable treatment given to derivatives, which are more prone to speculation.</p>

      <p sl="it">As we all know, the global financial crisis, which started in 2008, has had terrible consequences and repercussions, affecting the real economy almost immediately. The discrepancy between consumer demand and supply has had devastating effects on employment too, thus giving rise to serious problems on the labour market. Europe needs greater convergence, solidarity and responsibility to combat the crisis. Among the various measures to be taken is the reinforcement of the single market’s stability through the introduction of innovative strategies, designed to achieve growth that is not just economic, but also social. I think that fiscal consolidation through the introduction of a common system of taxation for financial transactions could have positive effects on the single market, and for that reason, I voted for Ms Podimata’s report. There could be several positive effects. However, I would argue that precisely because of the now highly globalised nature of the financial sector and its services, a further shift should be made, by promoting the introduction of a worldwide financial transaction tax: firstly, the full 27 Member States and then the G20 should demonstrate cohesion in seeking this objective.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The European Commission has proposed the establishment of a financial transaction tax at an EU level. The European Union is caught up in an economic crisis and there is a need to find effective tools to combat it. The very introduction of a financial transaction tax is one of the effective tools to overcome the crisis. The tax should be levied on all financial transactions between financial institutions, of which at least one is located in an EU Member State. It is abundantly clear that the financial sector, which has, until now, been subject to low taxation because of the exemption of the majority of most financial services from VAT, simply must contribute a much fairer share. The new system of financial transaction tax levied on financial institutions will affect the costs associated with the crisis and will prevent the collapse of the internal financial transactions market. By implementing the system, we would generate approximately EUR 57 billion a year, the revenues being divided between the EU and the Member States, and part of the proceeds would become a source of the EU’s own revenues. This would reduce the national contributions to the EU budget. The system will additionally strengthen the functioning of the single market. It will eliminate distortion of competition, it will discourage financial institutions, discourage risky and speculative financial operations and will supplement regulatory measures aimed at preventing future crises. I believe that the financial sector must contribute fairly to overcoming the crisis in Europe.</p>

Even though there would be some advantages to introducing a tax on financial transactions in the EU – for example, the income that would be generated for the Union – it would not be a flawless system. It could be bank customers who would end up paying for it, and there could be an increase in costs for ordinary companies which are not involved in financial services but which use financial instruments.</p>
      <p sl="ga">On top of that, if such a tax were introduced and if it were not applied worldwide – or even to all Member States of the EU27 – that could have an impact on the financial services sector, in Ireland in particular, and some activities or companies could be moved abroad as a result of it and there could be a significant loss of jobs.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Until there is a plan for a universal tax on financial transactions, on a European or global level, a plan that would ensure that the cost would not be borne by the customers of public banks, such a tax could hinder the EU’s economic recovery and put a further burden on the members of the Union.</p>

Many speakers said this morning that businesses would find it more difficult to access the necessary financing.</p>

Similarly, I am sceptical as to whether this signal will be heard, given the tenor of this morning’s debates and the status of the issue in the Council. However, devolving all or part of this tax, were it to see the light of day, to the EU budget is totally unacceptable, as is giving the Commission the opportunity to adopt delegated acts in this area. The possibility that this tax, however structured, will not apply to the European Union as a whole, in particular to the United Kingdom, is absurd. Above all, no one raised the main problem: the free and unfettered movement of capital at EU and global level, the source of financialisation, speculation and ‘short-termism’, which undermine the global economy.

      <p sl="en">For far too long, banks took excessive risks without any proper supervision. Financial institutions played a major role in causing the global economic crisis, but it has been ordinary citizens – as opposed to the banks’ handsomely remunerated executives – who have borne the cost. Therefore, in addition to strengthening regulatory oversight, we should ensure that the financial sector contributes its fair share to the exchequer. Although the initiative clearly has some merits, I have a number of concerns that mean that I cannot vote for this proposal as it stands. Firstly, it is not being implemented globally, or even on an EU27 basis. This could mean that financial institutions could simply move from a jurisdiction where the tax applies to one where it does not. In Malta, as in some other Member States, the financial sector contributes substantially to national GDP and employment. Implementing the FTT would be a risk at a time when we can ill afford to lose jobs or deter investment. Furthermore, although the tax will be levied on banks and financial institutions, it is important that we ensure that this does not result in extra charges for ordinary bank users or pensioners.</p>

Yet we cannot manage to get the banks and speculators to contribute even a small part of these costs via a financial transaction tax. If we do not succeed in this, then there is something wrong with our democracy. It gives the impression that big banks and players in the financial markets have greater influence over policies and our legislation than do our citizens. If this is the impression given, then we need to fundamentally rethink our system of democracy and change our democratic institutions and procedures. Democracy means government of the people, by the people, for the people.

First of all, the financial sector is largely exempted from taxation of its activities and transactions. This, in itself, is a problem and needs to be rectified – it is a sector like any other and should contribute its share of taxation. Furthermore, the huge increase in financial transactions – many of them highly speculative and short-term in nature – clearly indicates that the trading does not serve the needs of the real economy and that its purpose is to generate massive profits for bondholders and investors. The imposition of an FTT should curb some of these high-frequency transactions, which often destabilise markets and have no productive outcomes whatsoever. Unfortunately, I missed some of the early votes on the report, but I intended to support Amendments 15, 52d and 36.

The necessity for bailout schemes through public funds for the rescue of ‘too big to fail’ financial institutions has adversely affected public finances significantly and led to further economic recession at a global and European level. The debate on a financial transaction tax (FTT) stems from the desire to ensure that the financial sector contributes to covering the costs of the crisis and that it is taxed in a fair way vis-à-vis other sectors in the future. It is necessary to disincentivise excessively risky activities by financial institutions and, at the same time, to complement regulatory measures aimed at avoiding future crises and to generate additional revenue for general budgets, inter alia, as a contribution to fiscal consolidation, in order to stimulate growth and create jobs, or for specific policy purposes, such as development aid and fighting climate change.

The directive provides for a tax on financial transactions involving all kinds of securities, such as shares, bonds and derivatives in regulated and unregulated markets. The directive does not apply to transactions in primary (national central bank) markets. The intention is to apply the tax in accordance with the residence principle, that is, the tax would be borne by the counterparty located in the European Union, and also in accordance with the issuance principle, that is, the tax would be borne by an issuer of securities located in the EU. This gives grounds for concern that more and more transactions will take place outside the EU in order to avoid the tax. Those transactions that cannot be relocated beyond the boundaries of the EU, such as the purchase of certain company shares on stock exchanges, will become more expensive. We must not forget that right now, a part of EU countries’ economies is endangered, and we must strive to revive growth and confidence.

On the other hand, financial services will have good incentives to move outside the EU.

In my opinion, however, the transaction tax proposal may bring in considerable resources, but, at the same time, they will pass into banking services via other channels and will fail to reduce the volume of speculative transactions.

With this text, Parliament expressed its determination to support the application of the financial transaction tax (FTT) at EU level, the ultimate objective being an international FTT. On the same day as the informal European Council summit on growth is taking place in Brussels, we, as Members of this House, wanted to send out a strong message to the Council calling for the introduction of such a tax. The introduction of the FTT could generate up to EUR 57 billion (depending on the rate and the tax base) if the tax were implemented in all the Member States. I also welcome the proposal in the report which, in the event that no agreement amongst the EU27 is found, would allow Member States willing to implement the FTT to advance by formally requesting enhanced cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I welcome the result of the vote on the report on a common financial transaction tax. A result of 487 votes in favour and 152 against says a lot. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has, for several years, lobbied for the adoption of a tax imposed on speculators and big stock market players who ‘placed their bets’ on the current economic, financial and confidence crisis. I voted in favour, in the belief that in this way, we will obtain new sources of funding for European projects to support growth, create new jobs and rekindle trust in the European project. Parliament and the Commission have passed the test, and the Council should give serious thought to the position it has taken to date. The Danish Presidency breathed fresh life into the Council. It should be noted that the myths surrounding this tax have been allayed, and the citizens and the economy can only benefit, at no extra cost.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I voted in favour of the Podimata report in the final vote. I support the idea of a tax on financial transactions as a way of making financial institutions share the costs of the economic crisis, for example, through a Tobin tax, the revenue of which would be used as a development aid and to combat climate change. The big problem with this report is that it suggests that the revenue from the tax should go to the EU; this is unacceptable. Taxation is a competence of the Member States and it should remain so. The revenue from any tax whatsoever on financial transactions should go to Member States themselves.</p>

      <p sl="de">The players concerned must share effectively in the costs of the financial crisis, which amount to billions of euro, instead of continuing to make taxpayers bear the burden. Our citizens expect clear rules that will put speculators and profiteers in their place. A financial transaction tax (FTT) of 0.1% on shares and bonds, and 0.01% on derivatives, is likely to result in additional tax revenues of nearly EUR 60 billion. In the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, and now in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) were vehemently in favour of the FTT by a large majority. It goes without saying that it should not affect pension funds or company old-age provision. It should definitely also apply in non-euro Member States – and ideally globally. In response to the concern that more financial transactions would be shifted to Asia or to tax havens, I would counter that corporate financing is also available via loans and other products; more than 90% is neither listed on a stock exchange, nor hedged using securities. It is worth considering the idea put forward by finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble, which was to introduce a ‘stamp duty plus’ as a compromise, in order to restrict high-frequency trading and to impose duty on derivatives. Despite some concerns, I feel it is essential that the FTT be introduced – as an important basis for investments that promote growth, and as a clear signal for the necessary fight against exploitation.</p>

For more than a decade, we in the Izquierda Unida party have supported the Tobin tax proposal, which consisted of an international-level tax on financial transactions, the revenue from which should be spent on international cooperation and combating poverty in the developing world. Unfortunately, what the European Commission is proposing is a far cry from that. The allocation of the funds raised is left entirely open. It fails to guarantee that they will be spent on international cooperation and, what is more, the Members of the European Parliament have voted against the proposal tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left to earmark part of the revenue for social cohesion, protecting public services and creating employment. I have always considered it vital to create a tax on flows of capital as a fundamental instrument for combating financial speculation.

This is, moreover, the fourth time during this legislative term that, on behalf of the Reformist Movement, we have supported the implementation of such a tax instrument. This decision, which has been nurtured since 2008, has a double objective: to correct the abuses of the financial markets and to gather in financial resources intended for common European objectives (general EU budgets and specific policy purposes, such as development aid). We do not under-estimate the difficulties associated with the implementation of this tax at EU level. Moreover, it is essential that the political decision to introduce it is preceded by precise rules on the base, rates and scope of the tax. It is clearly necessary to ensure that small investors and pensioners are not penalised by any additional tax. More generally, the introduction of an FTT gives Member States the opportunity to reduce their national contribution to the EU budget by up to 50% and to rethink a system of finance that has become obsolete. All that is needed is for an ‘avant-garde’ of Member States to assume its responsibilities and set a good example.</p>

      <p sl="de">As one of the main triggers for the financial crisis, the financial sector – which has received huge public subsidies – is not bearing an appropriate share of the costs of the crisis. In the past decade, there has been an increase in short-term transactions and highly speculative transactions in particular. A particular feature of the transformation of the financial sector has been its detachment from the real economy. It is no longer concerned with providing the real economy with the financing it needs, but occupies itself instead with purely virtual financial procedures that can have a destructive effect on market prices and national economies. The financial transaction tax is intended to make dangerous, speculative, highly leveraged transactions unattractive, thereby reducing the likelihood of future crises. As the largest financial market in the world, the EU now wishes to introduce a financial transaction tax. In the long term, it can only be successful if its effect is tailored to the globalisation of the financial sector by means of international agreements. Provided the EU actually succeeds in preventing avoidance of the tax and we avoid transactions shifting to market places outside the jurisdiction of the EU, then I am in favour of the introduction of a financial transaction tax. However, this must not be abused in order to introduce an EU levy by the back door, so that the Union can avoid austerity measures. All the revenue from the financial transaction tax must go into the national budgets.</p>

First, it is a means of combating financial speculation, in particular, in cases of high-frequency trading, and it represents enormous added value in these times of increasing financialisation of the global economy. Second, the FTT can and must function as one of the EU’s own financial resources, thereby strengthening the firepower of the EU budget and reducing national contributions. These are currently a burden on national budgets, which are under intense pressure from fiscal consolidation programmes. In short, this is an important contribution to strengthening the financial and budgetary integration of the EU.</p>

The main danger would be a reduction in the liquidity of the markets, which is already low, with access to credit thus made harder. Credit is necessary for the survival and development of our enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized ones.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the other hand, if this tax is applied properly, it could be an instrument to raise funds without always hitting the usual suspects, namely, those who already have to bear a very heavy tax burden, and who have been overwhelmed by a crisis for which others are certainly responsible. Some of those responsible are certainly the people who used finance ruthlessly, for purely speculative ends. Therefore, although in general, I support the objectives of this proposal, I still have various concerns about the method of application, and it is for that reason that I decided to abstain from the final vote on this report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The global economic and financial crisis has seriously affected the economies and public finances of the Member States. There is no doubt that the financial sector had an important part to play in causing the economic crisis; however, the costs of the rescue programmes have been borne by central budgets or, in other words, European taxpayers. There is a broad consensus in Europe and in the international arena that the financial sector should take greater responsibility, in view of the costs of overcoming the crisis and the current tax burden on this sector, which is relatively low compared to other sectors. The Commission’s proposal for a directive on a common system of financial transaction tax gives concrete form to these considerations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union is thus the first in the G20 group to put forward a constructive regulatory proposal in this area. The proposals tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are useful and introduce the additional criterion of issuance (financial transactions are subject to taxation whenever an instrument is issued by a legal person registered within the EU) when identifying which financial transactions are subject to taxation, as well as excluding pension funds from the scope of this taxation (which means that the cost of long-term saving does not increase). However, I oppose the exclusion of investment funds from taxation.

It was precisely such risky business, detached from the real economy, which led us into the heart of the economic and financial crisis. The financial transaction tax should now put a brake on such short-term speculation, which has no added value of any kind for the real economy. Quite rightly, a broad majority of EU citizens are speaking out in favour of a financial transaction tax. In order to be efficient, the tax should be applied as widely as possible, and this applies both to the nature of the transaction – currency speculators must also be included – and to the number of Member States. I hope that a broad majority will vote in favour, and that Parliament will hold its own against the various financial lobbies and financial markets.

These funds should then be invested to stimulate growth, inter alia, by creating new jobs. This involves a new model to combat the economic crisis, and it is highly desirable that the EU should adopt this model.

      <p sl="et">I consider the introduction of a common European financial transaction tax to be extremely important in the search for additional funds to revive the economy and guarantee the sustainability of the European Union. The introduction of this tax is completely fair and necessary when we consider that the financial sector, which was one of the main causes of the financial crisis, has obtained significant state support in order to overcome the impact of the crisis, but has not contributed sufficiently to this itself. As a liberal, I believe it is important that equal rules should apply to all in a free market economy. The present tax exemption for financial transactions is not fair when we consider that we need to pay for various other services.</p>
      <p sl="et">In order to overcome the financial crisis, the European Union needs extensive financing in order to implement and finance the agreed economic programmes concretely, and the introduction of such a tax is one fair way of achieving that. The fear that introducing such a tax would frighten the banking sector away from Europe is unjustified, as is proven by the experiences of a number of different countries, notably Brazil, one of the largest countries in the world, where banks have remained loyal to their customers.</p>

Investors will consider long-term investments rather than the pursuit of short-term benefits that only last a day. The predicted annual revenue of EUR 100 billion will enable countries hit by the crisis to invest in job creation, innovations and will stimulate the progress of the green economy. Of course, it would be logical to introduce such a tax at global or at least EU level. The unwillingness of several countries to regulate speculative manoeuvres should not hold all EU Member States hostage.

The report puts forward strong arguments in favour of the application of the FTT at EU level. I am therefore in favour of this proposal.

On the other hand, the text calls for the tax to be better designed to ensure that more operators are subject to it and that tax avoidance is a low-return venture. Furthermore, the text leaves open the question of the allocation of the financial resources generated by the FTT, leaving open the possibility for the development of the least developed countries to be financed, at least with part of the revenue from this tax.

It is a moot point whether a tax on financial activities – which the IMF supports – would work better than the Commission’s proposal, but I think that the FTT proposal is a missed opportunity. We risk being saddled with a tax which could be economically damaging.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted for the proposal for a directive to introduce a financial transaction tax in Europe. This is because, within the framework of the proposals for the EU’s new own resources, the European executive wishes to achieve an improved capacity to generate own fiscal revenue. The Commission intends two thirds of the total revenue from the financial transaction tax to be allocated to the EU budget. The Commission’s proposal has a triple goal which I thought should be endorsed: generating new tax revenue from the financial sector; combating the speculation based on high-frequency financial exchanges (millions of financial orders in a few seconds, managed by suppliers or owners which do not have liquidity, but just manage the orders); and improving the internal market, by avoiding distortions in competition and the risks of double taxation arising from the uncoordinated application of national taxes. I think that the proposal, launched by this Parliament, is necessary in order to prevent the recurrence of a crisis such as the one in 2008. For these reasons, I voted for the report, fully supporting the aims of the Commission’s proposal.</p>

For years, we have behaved as if we have had little courage and determination to make a firm decision so that the financial crisis did not also become a social crisis. The fact that twenty-five million people are now unemployed puts the social dimension on a knife-edge. People have high expectations that finally, after so many promises of growth and employment, the resources will be in place to meet those expectations. Redevelopment of the financial sector has taken away a substantial amount of public funds, which are then lacking in education, health and in social systems. I supported the directive because it is high time to send a signal to our citizens that we are interested in generating resources that affect employment and growth. A tax on financial transactions and the expected income of EUR 57 billion would undoubtedly create a good starting point for growth in the euro area, allowing businesses to access capital and entrepreneurs to access loans.</p>

Furthermore, I take the view that part of the revenue generated by the FTT within the European Union should be used as own resources of the EU budget.

State intervention in certain financial institutions, as a last resort, has entailed the use of large sums from public funds. For this reason, and owing to the implementation of serious austerity measures that are affecting the daily lives of EU citizens, I agree that the financial sector should contribute to the costs of this crisis. The main objectives of applying a financial transaction tax are as follows: to make the financial sector pay the cost of the crisis like other sectors; to disincentivise excessively risky speculative activities and reorient the sector towards investment that will bear fruit in the long term; to complement regulatory measures aimed at avoiding future crises; and, finally, to generate additional revenue for the EU’s own resources or associated policies and public goods, in particular, development aid and combating climate change. However, in order for this to have a knock-on effect, it must be implemented in as many countries as possible. The EU should therefore take the lead in applying this tax in the Member States in order to create a progressive overall dynamic.</p>

We gather, unfortunately, that the debates in the Council are not as harmonious as we might like them to be. This shows, once again, that the unanimity rule complicates decision making in the EU and so it remains difficult to look for tax instruments that help the single market and the EU as a whole move forward or those that improve the quality of transactions in the financial markets. Still, I remain hopeful that the Council will assume responsibility for both this FTT dossier and the one relating to CCCTB (the proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base), for which I had the honour of being rapporteur.

In order to prevent distortions that may be caused by measures adopted unilaterally by Member States, bearing in mind the extremely high mobility of most of the relevant financial transactions, and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, it is important that the basic features of the FTT applied in Member States are harmonised and that this directive is implemented at EU level.</p>

To be effective and exemplary, this measure must initially be applied at European level before we can convince our international partners. Our British friends must understand that such a tax could also benefit them without, however, destroying the competitiveness of the City of London.

First, the lowest level of taxation is applied to derivatives and other structured products, which are subject to a higher level of speculation. Second, we are completely against the possibility that revenue from this tax will be used to replace national contributions to the EU budget, as this will not strengthen it, but will merely result in relieving the budgets of countries with major national contributions, which are the very countries that benefit most from the internal market and the liberalisation of the markets. Moreover, we believe that it would be fairer if the bulk of the revenue came from the Member States with which these products are primarily associated, irrespective of where the institutions concerned are domiciled for tax purposes.

However, we cannot ignore the fact that the main reason for this imbalance is that European business cannot currently invest in China under the same conditions that Chinese investors enjoy in Europe. Moreover, it is worth noting that trade barriers still hinder access to Chinese markets, that there is a lack of equality in relation to public procurement, that there is a lack of intellectual property protection which deters European investors specialising in new technologies, and that the Chinese authorities impose restrictions on the country’s raw materials. In view of this, I will support greater economic cooperation between the EU and China only on condition that European businesses can operate under the same conditions in the Chinese market that Chinese investors enjoy in Europe.

Growing Chinese imports have been crucial for the recent economic performance of export-oriented EU Member States like Germany.

      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, it is necessary to rebalance access to China’s internal market to bring it into line with that of the EU, which is much more open and transparent.

      <p sl="it">The globalisation of the economy has led to the need to step up economic cooperation between the EU and other areas of the world. This aim needs to be pursued not only through various fundamental principles that make trade balances sustainable, although these are, of course important, but, above all, through support for the EU’s production systems, to make them more competitive on the world stage. It is therefore necessary for both the principle of legal and economic/financial reciprocity and the anti-dumping principle to always be an integral part of economic agreements, with particular reference to the fiscal and social security dimensions, so that a correct approach may be taken based on the comparative and competitive advantages of enterprises and production systems. In addition, it is necessary for the principle of reciprocity to permeate access to Chinese public procurement. Finally, the EU ought to take a more farsighted and attentive approach to investments in developing countries, made also by competing countries, such as China, in order to better evaluate the impact of these interventions in political, economic, social and environmental terms. I believe that the report we have adopted seeks to achieve these objectives.</p>

It is now necessary for the European Union and China to develop a new partnership based on reciprocal rules, balanced trade and transparent trade relations.

It encourages China to open up its markets more widely to European businesses and to accede to the multilateral Agreement on Public Procurement. The report also advocates tempering the Chinese system of joint ventures and strategic technology transfers. It proposes stepping up EU-China customs cooperation to combat counterfeiting. Finally, it recommends that the EU should make more effective use of the trade defence instruments available to it, if need be, in particular, to defend intellectual property rights. Moreover, all that would be in vain if the EU refused to implement a concerted production and reindustrialisation policy as well as a research and innovation policy commensurate with the new global challenges.

Therefore, given its role and its significant global impact, such practices create serious imbalances in the economic system, and for this reason have to be taken into consideration and dealt with carefully. This report, by calling on the Commission to negotiate an ambitious and balanced EU-China investment agreement, able to create a better environment for EU investors in China, and to improve the transparency regarding governance of Chinese companies which invest within the EU, will represent an important starting point for an improved and more trustful trade relation with China, which most certainly is a crucial partner for the European Union and its Member States.</p>

Its economic growth and, consequently, its GDP are the largest in the world. Although it is in the interests of both parties, EU-China trade is proving rather unbalanced, with the scales tilting in China’s favour. While there is great potential for European exports to China, the reality is that the cost of factors of production, not least labour, means that there is no comparison between the two. Moreover, we cannot consider China a market economy. It does not respect workers’ rights or copyright, and it has no concern for the environment. For these reasons, China’s accession to the World Trade Organisation has been delayed.

Among other things, it criticises Chinese export subsidies, but refrains from doing the same when it comes to the EU. As we said during the debate, this is a vision and path that we unequivocally reject. Obviously, we therefore voted against this report. We cannot gloss over the serious consequences of free trade, neither can we gloss over the fact that the EU’s common trade policy has been an extremely important instrument for the Member States, in particular, those with the weakest economies, in helping them defend their trade interests. The offensive interests of the strongest economies and big business have now been given prominence, making it impossible for the weakest economies to safeguard their interests and weakening their specific productive sectors.

I consider it essential to adjust the bilateral trade relations between the EU and China to the current economic situation. The trade imbalance between these two regions is unacceptable. The shift of production of numerous types of consumer goods to China has resulted in job losses, drastic price reductions, and therefore relatively low inflation. After China joined the WTO in 2011, it was supposed to comply with the rules relating to the liberalisation of its trade and the opening of its markets, but the results have been less than satisfactory. The Chinese Government’s interventionist industrial policies, a system of rules that is ambiguous in its application, the inadequate protection of intellectual property, and other non-tariff and technical barriers are hindering the efforts of European companies to access the Chinese market. It is more than necessary to restore fair competition and ensure a level playing field for all. I firmly believe that it is necessary to negotiate a new, balanced trade agreement that will provide a more favourable environment for European investors and guarantee transparency in the governance of Chinese companies that invest within the EU.

At the same time, there is a considerable imbalance in this trading relationship, in favour of China: in 2010, the trade deficit amounted to EUR 168.8 billion (compared to EUR 49 billion in 2000) and foreign investment by the EU in China amounted to EUR 4.9 billion, while foreign investment by China in the EU in the same year amounted to EUR 0.9 billion. We should not forget the difficulties encountered by European enterprises in trying to access the Chinese market, mainly due to the lack of transparency in national rules and the protectionist policy of the Chinese Government. This policy leads to large-scale dumping caused by the enormous subsidies provided by the Chinese Government to national enterprises. The report that has been adopted on the one hand analyses the reasons for the imbalance and, on the other, puts forward a set of proposals to improve the current situation, from the application of the principle of reciprocity to the public procurement market (so as to ensure that the Chinese procurement market is opened up to a greater degree) to the protection of intellectual property rights.</p>

The opening up of trade has definitely been more beneficial to China, whose share in global trade reached EUR 395 billion in 2010, while foreign investment by the EU in China in the same year amounted to only EUR 4.9 billion. In striving to align trade relations with China, the EU must defend the model of a social market economy, require reciprocity and protect the interests of Europeans, as well as promoting concepts of development, democracy and human rights in relation to our partner.</p>

In a situation where 85% of counterfeit goods detained at EU borders come from China, it is hard to talk about competitiveness and respect for laws. This state of affairs must change if we are to be considered equal trade partners.

The main question which we need to focus on is: ‘Is China obviously practising unfair competition against the EU?’ The social and economic growth which this country has enjoyed in recent years is linked to business, especially exports to Member States. In view of this rate of growth, it is paramount for Europe to maintain an open dialogue with China and raise the issue again of the restrictions preventing entry to the Chinese market because the need to cooperate is vitally important to both partners, and China must not ignore this truth. One problem whose scope has not decreased relates to all the counterfeit goods which arrive in the EU. The quality of these products is inferior as they are fakes of well-known brands and consumers can be easily misled.

The controversial ACT will not contribute to a solution in this regard, since China did not even participate in the negotiations.

According to the text adopted, however, China has increased unfair practices and obstacles to restrict access by foreign firms to its market. These include unfair trade strategies, customs fees, a lowering of the yuan’s exchange rate and the absence of intellectual property law. In view of these restrictions, and in order to limit conduct of this kind, Brussels ought to urge Beijing to make use of the procedure for settling business disputes proposed by the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The EU should also promote cooperation with developing countries in order to step up the fight against counterfeiting.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The rhetoric that has been coming out of Beijing in recent years clearly indicates that China is truly worried about the negative economic developments in Europe, which are most visible in the debt crisis. The Chinese economy is primarily focused on exports, and it is the European Union that is the largest trading power and top destination for Chinese exports. China is the EU’s second largest trading partner, immediately after the United States of America. It logically follows that China needs economic growth in its trading partners in order to support its own economic development. Unfortunately, European companies still cannot invest in China under the same conditions as those that apply to Chinese investments in Europe. Despite China’s progress in reducing trade barriers to facilitate access to the Chinese market, many obstacles remain, as evidenced by a report from the EU Chamber of Commerce in China. The report shows that fully 43% of directors of European companies in China believe that the measures adopted by the Chinese Government discriminate against them. Europe and China need each other. In this spirit, a new phase of trade relations between the EU and China must be launched, which will be based on a partnership of equals and will be characterised by mutual benefits and joint development. This is the principle of reciprocity, which Europeans have long been demanding.</p>

However, after almost 30 years of partnership, there is still a significant imbalance in trade relations between the EU and China. The list of these disharmonies shows worrying signs: access to Chinese public procurement is limited for foreign enterprises, protection of intellectual property is weak, there are systematic restrictions on the exportation of Chinese rare earths to European industries and, finally, the undervaluation and non-convertibility of the yuan pose a serious problem. Reciprocity, the cornerstone of the agreement, seems no longer, or insufficiently, present in trade relations. European enterprises are currently unable to invest in China under conditions similar to those governing Chinese investors in Europe. My vote in favour of the report by Ms de Sarnez lends support to the proposals made to rebalance EU-Chinese relations.

In the face of the crisis we are going through, establishing fairer relations with China is a major challenge for our enterprises. I therefore support the report by Marielle de Sarnez without reservation. The text has three essential elements. Firstly, it calls on the Commission rapidly to develop a European instrument to ensure reciprocity as regards openness in public procurement markets. This would appear to me to be fundamental. Secondly, it calls for the setting up of a body entrusted with the ex ante evaluation of foreign strategic investment in order to obtain a clear picture of businesses operating and investing in the territory of the EU. This is an idea that I fully support. Finally, the rapporteur stresses that we will only succeed in meeting this challenge if we implement a concerted production and reindustrialisation policy and a research and innovation policy commensurate with the new global challenges.

Following the country’s increasing development and its accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), alongside the significant benefits, China’s new trade responsibilities involve greater obligations in playing an active, positive role in the world economic system, including within the context of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group. European companies are very aware of the complexity and opaque nature of the Chinese system of regulation and legislation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Ten years after China’s accession to the WTO, this factor raises various questions regarding European companies’ ability to access the market and, in the long term, the very attractiveness of the Chinese market, which is simultaneously perceived as strategic and difficult to penetrate.

In many ways, that market constitutes a valuable source of investment and development opportunities.

Several problems hinder European investment in China, including: entry barriers and protectionism; limited access to public procurement due to complex bureaucracy, a lack of transparency and competition, and rules that run counter to international legislation; intellectual property rights violations; protectionist measures in European involvement in technology companies; restrictions on the export of rare raw materials; and the overvaluation of the renminbi, allowing China to increase its investment in Europe and buy advanced technologies and European sovereign debt. In order for there to be a real partnership, the principle of reciprocity needs to be accepted and implemented by both parties. These conditions of access and the implementation of international standards should be included in the strengthening of the 1985 cooperation agreement. Moreover, I consider greater coordination between the Member States vital, so that bilateral agreements do not weaken the position that the EU needs to take in order to tackle these problems.</p>

We ask the Commission and Member States to cooperate more closely with third countries on copyright issues and licensing.

China’s failure to respect intellectual property rights is extremely discouraging for European investors, and there are no signs of any positive development in this area. On the contrary, the types and numbers of counterfeit goods are rising in world trade, most of which originate from China. Dumping, including through devaluing the yuan and subsidising production with the aim of deriving trade benefits, is a practice widely used by China to seize global markets and edge out other participants. Our trade deficit with China has trebled in the last 10 years and is continuing to grow. This is clearly a source of concern, and serious measures need to be adopted both at European level and by individual Member States. China is the second largest economy in the world.

The modest work done by the committees of inquiry reveals, as well as caution on the part of Members and Parliament, which we do not doubt, an essentially impotent framework.

The final power of decision ― regardless of the powers conferred on the committees of inquiry to perform their duties ― ultimately belongs to Parliament. The conclusions of the committees of inquiry could thus be submitted in the form of a final report to Parliament. It would then be up to Parliament to take up one or more of the recommendations contained in the final report, such as deciding to publish the report, putting forward a legislative initiative, referring the matter to the competent Union or national authorities, referring the matter to the Ombudsman or taking any other appropriate action, according to the specific circumstances.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Treaty of Lisbon granted Parliament greater powers. In the wake of this extension of its powers, Parliament now has the opportunity to adopt a regulation that seeks to establish the proceedings of committees of inquiry, strengthening their potential scope for action and the means at their disposal to carry out their tasks in a dignified, rigorous and effective way, as already happens in other parliaments. This type of committee must always be mindful of the respondents’ right of appeal. On this subject, I recall some rather unedifying incidents which have occurred in the hearings of candidates for the position of Commissioner, in which they were subjected to inappropriate behaviour by certain Members, who put the statements made to abusive use. I therefore hope the desired extension of the scope of these committees will go hand in hand with the responsible use of this instrument, which we hope will be fair and useful.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report seeks to establish conditions for strengthening the exercise of Parliament’s right of inquiry. The Treaty of Lisbon enhanced Parliament’s powers and reduced the competences of the sovereign national institutions. Parliament’s enhanced right of inquiry neither strengthens its legitimacy nor ensures the integrity with which it should be associated. The investigation of ‘alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Community law’ by Parliament, an institution whose numbers reveal the extent to which it is dominated by the major powers, is doomed from the outset to serve the interests of those same powers. We cannot support strengthening Parliament’s power of ‘investigation’, in other words, of interference, forcing sovereign states to submit documents, summoning witnesses, and hearing officials and other EU and Member State civil servants. Citizens and Member States are obliged to grant Parliament access to documents that it deems ‘pertinent’, while Parliament is able to decide on appropriate sanctions to be applied by the Member States. Although the report is in favour of the separation of the political and judicial powers, there is obvious confusion and that does not make Parliament more democratic.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The right of inquiry is an important feature of Parliament’s supervisory powers. This right is exercised in many different ways by democratic parliaments throughout the world. In the majority of the EU Member States, the setting up of committees of inquiry is envisaged and regulated by the constitution, by law or by decree. Currently, the Treaty of Lisbon has modified the institutional balance of the EU and strengthened the political stature of Parliament. Article 14 TEU expressly stipulates that Parliament exercises political control. The Treaty also changed the procedure for determining the provisions governing the exercise of the right of inquiry. Whereas, in the past, it was a shared decision between the three main European institutions, the Treaty of Lisbon explicitly gives the right of initiative to the European Parliament. Nevertheless, it still has to obtain formal consent from the Council and from the Commission. As the European Parliament is not a court, it has no power in itself to impose penalties on individual citizens. Nevertheless, when all the Member States adopted the Treaty of Lisbon, they also agreed to give it the right to investigate contraventions and maladministration in the implementation of Union law. I believe that this should bind them to oblige their own administrative systems to give assistance to any possible EP committees of inquiry. I also consider it to be correct that the final power of decision, regardless of the powers conferred on the committees of inquiry to perform their duties, ultimately rests with Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">However, this is an important step towards taking us beyond the 1995 decision, which has so far enabled the European Parliament to set up three committees of inquiry. These new powers will therefore lie, in particular, in a committee of inquiry being able to carry out any type of investigation and to obtain assistance from national authorities, if need be, so as to ensure that its conclusions are based exclusively on factual evidence. The introduction of the rule requiring Member States to sanction non-compliance with this regulation is also a step in the right direction.</p>

The Treaty of Lisbon created conditions for a renewed and enhanced institutional balance within the Union, allowing its institutions to function more efficiently, openly and democratically. In this context, the European Parliament’s functions in relation to political control were reinforced and extended. Therefore, in accordance with both national parliamentary practice and the requirements under the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (hereinafter ‘the Treaties’), the European Parliament’s committees of inquiry should be reinforced and should be granted specific, genuine and clearly delimited powers which are more in line with its political stature and competences, while respecting the principle of proportionality as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. The powers of the committees of inquiry, which are exceptional instruments of political control, should be without prejudice to the responsibilities of other institutions. It should be noted that the doctrine of the separation of powers should be respected, according to which, in order to prevent power from being abused, the legislature (parliament), the executive (government) and the judiciary (the law courts) should be separate from one another.</p>

Substantive differences in the new regulation include, for instance, the Commission’s right to request that the parliaments of Member States cooperate with them, the right to perform all manner of investigations (on-site investigation, the demanding of documents, etc.), and the new regulation also designates those who are required to compensate costs. The formation of European Parliament investigative committees and the use of the funds designated in the new regulation to provide compensation for illegal or unjust situations or to investigate alleged violations or incidents of maladministration will help fulfil Parliament’s powers of oversight (it is important to note that Parliament does, however, lack the right to enforce punishment in this area), which will also guarantee that the European Union institutions function more democratically.</p>

It reflects a high degree of consensus in the international community. It is also significant that this initiative came from the African Union (AU).

The EU calls on the parties to implement it without qualification or delay. The EU welcomes South Sudan’s withdrawal of its forces from the Abyei area and calls on the government of Sudan to do so too. Both parties must also stop supporting rebels and proxy forces in each other’s territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">The parties now have three months to reach agreement on all outstanding issues. If they fail to do so, the UN, the AU and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) will present detailed proposals for a settlement. In the event of non-compliance, the Security Council has threatened to impose non-military sanctions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The road map also addresses the conflict in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile State, which is linked to the current tensions between Sudan and South Sudan. The government of Sudan must allow immediate humanitarian access to all civilians affected by the conflict.</p>
      <p sl="en">We believe that an inclusive political settlement is needed to resolve this conflict. The EU would urge the government of Sudan and the Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) in the north to comply with the requirement in the Security Council resolution to reach a negotiated settlement. The EU thinks that progress on inclusive governance and democratic reform is needed in both Sudan and South Sudan to allow the root causes of internal conflicts to be addressed. The national constitutional review process in both countries is an important opportunity in this respect, provided the process is fully inclusive.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the north, we remain seriously concerned about the detention of human rights defenders, journalists, opposition politicians and peaceful student protestors. One of the basic principles of the comprehensive peace agreement was the establishment of democratic governance, based on respect for diversity and basic freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the south, the human rights situation is also of concern. We welcome the recent visit of the UN Human Rights High Commissioner, Navi Pillay, to South Sudan to help the government address these challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU remains committed to the concept of two viable states. We were pleased that President Salva Kiir, when he visited Brussels in March, informed us of his government’s wish to accede to the EU-ACP Partnership Agreement, the Cotonou Agreement. This will provide us with a framework for future development cooperation. As partners, we can establish a dialogue on the issues which are the core principles of this partnership: democracy, the rule of law, and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has mobilised substantial development assistance for South Sudan in the form of ‘special funds’ from the European Development Fund to a total of EUR 285 million. We will support South Sudan’s development agenda and nation-building efforts through support for rural development and agriculture, health and education, as well as the rule of law and democratic governance. The EU is also planning to deploy a Common Security and Defence Policy mission to increase security at Juba International Airport.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the north, we find the government’s decision not to ratify the revised Cotonou Agreement of 2005 regrettable. Nevertheless, the EU has made development funds available to assist the most vulnerable populations in conflict-affected areas such as Darfur, eastern Sudan, Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. This is in addition to our substantial humanitarian assistance programme. We also support democratisation, human rights and grassroots inter-community dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must not forget the conflict in Darfur, where the situation is still of great concern. Although there have been some voluntary returns, some 1.7 million internally displaced people are still living in camps, and there has been fresh displacement. The joint UN/AU peacekeeping mission, UNAMID, still faces restrictions on its freedom of movement imposed by the government of Sudan. Humanitarian access to much of the Jebel Mara region remains blocked. We welcome the Doha document on peace in Darfur as a positive first step towards reaching a comprehensive and inclusive peace settlement, but it needs to be fully implemented. The Council of the European Union has repeatedly recalled the government of Sudan’s obligation to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1593.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation in Sudan and South Sudan remains one of great concern. I have made clear that the EU continues to promote all efforts to bring peace and stability to both countries. We remain committed to supporting the emergence of two viable states living in peaceful coexistence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Council for the presentation made this afternoon. This is a very worrying situation. This is a country that has been devastated over a prolonged period of time by violence in one shape or another, and it was presumed that the secession of South Sudan would at least produce some agreed route to peace and stability in that region. People are suffering, people are hungry, and people are displaced, despite the fact that this is a region with the potential for very profitable oil exports.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very difficult to deal with the situation but, at the present time, we have to try to contain it. We have to deal, in particular, with the humanitarian crisis there. I would ask us to ensure – especially in those refugee camps outside Sudan where people are gathering – that there is sufficient support and supplies for those people, and that we do everything possible to provide for their security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Events in the region of Sudan and South Sudan are an indication of the sort of thing that can happen when there is secession or when there is no stability. Many of us here celebrate the Arab Spring, but in fact, we are not sure what is going to follow it, and good governance simply has not been the tradition in many of the countries concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is time that we worked with the African Union, in terms of training and supplies and resources, to try to get them to build their capacity to make this region a stable region. The European Union cannot do everything. The United Nations cannot do everything. When these problems arise, they are very costly – costly not only in terms of lives, and in terms of disruption for people, including in regions like this where people perhaps depend on oil and exports, but also in terms of the humanitarian aid we are going to be required to supply. It is costly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why can the resources not be found early on to invest with the African Union in trying to ensure that they are equipped to prevent this sort of situation, to develop good governance, and to enable them to be the first port of call when such events do take place?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the European Union has done a great deal for Sudan and South Sudan. It heavily funded South Sudan’s access to independence by supporting the 2005 comprehensive peace agreement. It was either that or war. We were well aware of that. At the time, problems had not yet been solved. Not a single problem had been solved: neither citizenship, nor currency, nor the question of debt, nor, above all, the question of the distribution of oil between the two countries, Sudan and South Sudan. Now it is exploding in our face! However, what has been exploding in our face and worrying me far more for a year is China because, at international level, it controls the entire oil industry, from extraction to refinery operations, and it is buying the oil. One would say that, all of a sudden, the European Union, which has done so much, has, somehow, disappeared from the scene. It is somewhat embarrassing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome UN Security Council Resolution 2046, which is a huge step forward and which we are going to be able to follow. However, I have three wishes. The first is that the European Parliament, finally, will 1) follow up election observation missions in a country such as this which, it was clear, was going to be fragile, 2) send missions, 3) provide follow up and 4) receive the South Sudanese here. My second wish is that the European Union, which is doing so much, which has done so much, and which is continuing to do a great deal thanks, in particular, to our special representative, will enjoy excellent visibility in everyone’s eyes. Then, I would like the position of the European Union, which is a balanced position between the North and the South, to remain in place, in spite of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. Finally, I would like priority to be given to the humanitarian emergency, especially in relation to the Blue Nile State and Southern Kordofan. What is happening there is unimaginable, and we have not succeeded, so far, in gaining access to these regions, which are suffering tragedies on a daily basis.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, apart from the attention the conflict between Sudan and South Sudan deserves, my personal interest in seeking a solution is explained by the fact that I was one of the signatories to the comprehensive peace agreement concluded in 2005 in Nairobi, which I signed on behalf of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The problems we are experiencing today were well known long before South Sudan gained independence and even when the agreement was signed five years ago. It is also recognised that there is no military solution to this conflict. What has changed is the scale of the conflict. Since South Sudan gained independence, this is no longer an intra-state dispute between two parties within a single state, but an international conflict. It is therefore international law which must provide the solutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would therefore like to pay tribute to the European External Action Service, which did all it could do. That is to say, it focused its efforts on settling this matter in a way that would respect international law, while devoting all the instruments contained in its multiple tool box to the search for a solution to this conflict.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Following the various mediation attempts by the African Union, following the communiqués of the African Union Peace and Security Council, and following UN Security Council Resolution 2046, the markers along the way to a political settlement are now known. Consequently, the efforts of the African institutions are beginning to demonstrate their usefulness. The European Union has supported the capacity of Africa to take ownership of its own security interests since the early 2010s. Today, the European Union also remains an indispensable partner of the two countries resulting from the separation of Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union, the principal humanitarian actor, the principal actor in development, the principal actor in the political dialogue with the Sudanese and the South Sudanese, holds one of the keys to the solution to the current conflict. One of the keys but not the only one. The EU is thus addressing one of the underlying causes of this desperate situation – poverty, extreme poverty – which undermines the foundations of any sustainable stability. The South Sudanese, as well as their partners in the North, are, however, jointly responsible for finding a solution to the conflict. They must rise to the occasion. It is not sufficient simply to have a state; it is also necessary to be able to manage it. The presence of the EU is much greater than its visibility. There is no solution, then, no alternative; the only possibility is a return to the conflict during which two million people were left to ‘snuff it’ – pardon the expression – against a background of general indifference, over a period of ten years.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I have been listening to my colleagues and the representative of the Council and what they said gives me an indefinable feeling. I have a feeling that they are preaching to the converted. I have not yet heard anyone with whom I disagree, either from the Council or among my colleagues, and I have to conclude that we are all truly at our wits’ end over the situation in Sudan and South Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Obviously, I welcome the fact that the UN Security Council has unanimously approved the road map for peace between Sudan and South Sudan and the fact that South Sudan has now promised to withdraw its troops from Abyei. But what good will this do us at the moment?</p>
      <p sl="nl">I fear that we are going to end up in a lengthy process that we could perhaps compare to that existing between Eritrea and Ethiopia: a border conflict that flares up time and time again and in which both countries – allow me to compare Eritrea to South Sudan here and Ethiopia to Sudan, all inadequacies of this comparison aside – are using the border dispute as an excuse to do nothing about health care for their own people, about social services, famine, education or about anything that their people need so desperately.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The rainy season is coming to South Sudan and, as a result, 60% of the country will become impenetrable. The roads will cease to be passable and, during that period, food stocks for the people will have to be sufficient. We can talk about the road map, we can talk about a lengthy process, but how do we manage to get some food out to these people right away?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Another sign that makes me think that South Sudan is not ready for the job of providing a decent future for its own people is the fact that it has stopped selling oil. I can well understand the underlying reason, but if you allow your money to dry up and if you are not able to do your own shopping any more, what does that say about you? What becomes more important for you then? Your people that need to be fed or the border dispute with Sudan? It seems to me that our task in this is to ensure that South Sudan starts behaving decently again and that it finds a market for its oil.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Sudanese conflict has attracted the world’s attention for years. Following the establishment of an independent South Sudan, this is no longer a civil war, and any action by either side now has the features of an international conflict. If the South Sudanese army were also to gain the support of the Ugandan army, we could be dealing with a regional armed conflict.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The current actions by the international community in relation to the two Sudanese states are, in many ways, incomprehensible. South Sudan is trying to achieve the objectives of the UN resolution, as evidenced by the decision to withdraw troops from the disputed Heglig territory and its declaration of willingness to engage in talks. Meanwhile, the world is officially condemning the violent actions of the government in Khartoum, while failing to take any decisions, such as what sanctions should be imposed. There is no coherent strategy dealing with the refugee problem, which threatens to become a humanitarian disaster. Neither is there any appropriate response to the flourishing arms trade. The regular rearming of the Sudanese forces by China, Russia and Belorussia, as reported by witnesses, deserves special condemnation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">More than half a million citizens of South Sudan living in the northern border provinces have no regulated legal status. In view of the ethnic cleansing which is still ongoing, this is a very dangerous situation. To date, no plan for free movement in the border zone has been implemented. This fact alone highlights the need for a new border demarcation in some sections.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The accusation and indictment of President Bashir for genocide by the International Criminal Court is reason enough for the West, including European countries, to toughen up its policies in relation to Khartoum. The oil business cannot be a shield against, or obstacle to, the proper functioning of international cooperation and the prevention of ethnic discrimination. I would call on both parties to cease offensive actions and start constructive talks, and I would also appeal to international institutions and to Baroness Ashton to participate actively in working on a solution to this border dispute.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the latest reports from the war zone in the Nuba mountains are downright depressing. The area has virtually been cut off from the outside world for months now, held in a stranglehold of the Sudanese armed forces. Enduring great hardship, the civilian population is trying to survive in mountain caves. Meanwhile, there are also large numbers of Nuba refugees at the Juba reception centre in South Sudan. The image of this fledgling state is just as bleak; just read the internal report by the World Bank. Certainly, it talks very frankly about an extraordinary situation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Why, too, has the independent South Sudan been such a huge disappointment to its international friends and financial supporters in this respect? The answer is as simple as it is disconcerting: the irresponsible behaviour of the totally incompetent state leadership under President Salva Kiir. The complete shutdown of oil production since January 2012 (which had accounted for 98% of government revenue), in conjunction with nepotism and widespread corruption, backs up this heart-breaking conclusion. Already, approximately half of the South Sudanese live below the poverty line and the forecast for 2013 is for an increase to as much as 83%.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The question I would like to put to the European Union, and thus also to my own Dutch Government, who will soon visit the region, is this: are his European supporters finally going to send a clear warning to President Salva Kiir?

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ‘yet another war over oil’: that could be the heading for an intervention on the current conflict in Sudan. Once again, the civilian population of both countries are enduring indescribable suffering. All violent attacks and assaults are naturally to be condemned, and naturally we must call for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, that does not absolve us from talking about the causes, or from looking back critically at whether the EU’s clear commitment to the splitting off of South Sudan was responsible given the current circumstances. There will be no quick solution; that much is certain. It is also certain, however, that the problems cannot be resolved by means of armed conflict. Right now, it is essential that we maintain the arms embargo that in fact exists, in order to prevent further escalations.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to remind you that in 2004, the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) imposed an embargo on arms supplies to Sudan and, in 2011, also to South Sudan, but this was unilaterally relaxed in November 2011 to support security sector reform in South Sudan. However difficult it may be, we need to push for diplomatic negotiations. If the international community wants to help end the conflict, it must do so in the role of a neutral mediator, not led by its own interests. The role that the EU has played has not been neutral.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very concerned as to whether there will be more such scenarios in future, whether we will see more natural resource-rich regions of Africa splitting off and a spiralling of state disintegration. The foreign policy instrument of state building must not be allowed to be an instrument of such a development. Using access to reserves of natural resources to guide us in our foreign policy activities will bring not peace, but rather death and misery.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is well known that Sudan has been fought over almost without interruption since the end of colonial times. As well as the major disputes of north versus south, there are continual armed inter-ethnic and internecine disputes. Smaller conflicts over water or land rights, cattle theft, rape and kidnap escalate all too easily in Sudan. Peace talks will certainly not be easy in this country, where entire generations have grown up without basic services, with violence the only way they know to resolve conflicts; where a word given today is generally already broken the next day. Even if the African Union special envoy succeeds in getting peace talks resumed, the military status in the border area will undoubtedly remain a stumbling block. Even should a peaceful solution succeed, there will remain enormous potential for conflict.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why it is all the more important to restore basic services as a measure to accompany peace. In the long term, the country’s oil wealth needs to be utilised to achieve a fair distribution of power and resources and to drive forward the process of democratisation. However, I believe that the EU aid granted for this should also serve European interests. Following the Chinese model, development aid could be linked to supplies of natural resources. The huge reserves of crude oil in Southern Sudan could play an important role in Europe’s oil supply in the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards EU aid to South Sudan, the problem of illegal migration into the Union must not be disregarded either. That is why I feel that appropriate readmission agreements should be negotiated.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, relations between Sudan and South Sudan are deteriorating. We are all concerned about the worsening of the security and humanitarian situation in the region. A road map has, admittedly, been approved, which is a welcome step forward. However, I cannot help thinking that the measures taken to date are far too timid. It has to be recognised that the Sudanese army is still dropping bombs and taking other military action. The security and humanitarian situation of the civilian population is getting worse and causing massive population displacement. The humanitarian assistance of the UN agencies has been blocked. I could go on …</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, the scale of the emergency calls for the implementation of specific negotiation initiatives as well as a clear timeframe which would guide the progress of the process. It is important that the first meeting of the Joint Political and Security Mechanism is held as soon as possible so that priorities to foster peace and security can be identified and an action and work plan established.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, this same emergency must inspire the work of international partners, which must undertake to support the efforts made by both sides. I believe that activating the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism and sending international observers are vital aspects of international action which must guarantee that the decisions taken are actually implemented.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union, the United Nations and the African Union must work closely in this direction and give substance to their commitment by fulfilling their role as partner in a practical way and therefore having the courage to address the issue of sanctions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the European Union needs to be more proactive in seeking a peaceful resolution of tensions. The EU should carry out regular monitoring – otherwise why send election observation missions? – and not just act on an ad hoc basis when a major crisis requires it.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, almost a year after the independence of South Sudan, the violence of the relationship between Sudan and South Sudan has worsened, as some of us predicted. Accusations, attacks and retaliation are impeding the resolution of outstanding issues, particularly the sharing of oil resources, the constitutional status of Abyei and the demilitarisation of the border areas. The European Union, which invested so much in peacefully resolving the conflict by separating the two states, now has an obligation to engage immediately in implementing the road map for the cessation of hostilities adopted by the African Union, with the support of the United Nations Security Council. Following up on the electoral missions in the north and south must not cease to be one of the European Union’s objectives, nor must the surrender of President Omar al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court. Democratic change in the north of Sudan depends on that.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The excellent work of the High Representative must be duly consolidated by a Herculean effort to build the capacities of South Sudan’s government.

      <p sl="it">‘Walk on your own two legs, walk for a long time, find water and share it’, goes an old saying from the region, but this certainly does not reflect reality. Today, at the most, people walk for a long time but, if they have not stepped on a mine first, water is not easy to find until the rainy season. In fact, it is not easy to help Juba, just as it is not easy to put pressure on Khartoum.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I believe that action by the Commission, the European External Action Service and the European Union ought to be based on certain fundamental principles. Above all, we must keep attention focused on this crisis, so that it does not risk becoming a forgotten crisis, one of those points on the agenda that is shelved and deprived of the attention of the media and the international community.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, we must insist on full application of Security Council Resolution 2046, which is a key element. Thirdly, we must not be unprepared for what may happen in Khartoum, keeping in mind the fact that Sadiq al-Mahdi, former Sudanese prime minister, evoked the prospect of an Arab Spring in Sudan, in view of the failures both of the administration and of President al-Bashir himself. Let us therefore remain vigilant, to avoid a recurrence of what happened in North Africa.</p>
      <p sl="it">Fourthly, as we are the main donor to South Sudan, we should have more say in the application of laws in Juba. Currently, uniformed soldiers in South Sudan are appropriating land in an arbitrary fashion. The Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement must re-establish its credibility as far as citizens are concerned, which will be quite difficult without a minimum legal system that is effective and independent. This ought to be the European Union’s first priority.</p>
      <p sl="it">Without delay, I will finish with a final point, to which we have already drawn attention: the creation for South Sudan of a transparent fund to collect the proceeds of oil resources, as happened in Timor.

Another tragic result is that in the Blue Nile region, controlled by the Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement, Sudan is blocking humanitarian aid destined for 200 000 people.</p>
      <p sl="it">As well as providing humanitarian aid, I would like to see Europe conducting a policy that is more committed to supporting the African Union, and not so much in opposition to the Chinese presence or influence in the area, but in order to strengthen pan-African politics and ensure that Africa belongs, a little more, to Africans.

Major oil reserves guaranteed a decent national income. South Sudan also benefits from foreign aid – in 2011, the total foreign aid declared was USD 700 million.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, less than a year later, the prospects for South Sudan no longer look so promising. Why? I think we need a good understanding of the background to events. There is practically no tax system in South Sudan. Taxes are collected in theory, but in practice, the system does not work, which is why income from sales of crude oil represents 97% of the state budget.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The problem is that South Sudanese oil must be transported via the only pipeline, which leads through Sudanese territory to the city of Port Sudan. Recent enemies can hardly be expected to cooperate easily. Accusations and complaints have been made by both parties. What is more, South Sudan has long preferred another solution for transporting oil – through Kenya to Mombasa. In December 2011, a preliminary agreement was signed for the construction of a new pipeline. The problem is that President Kiir shut down the northern pipeline one month later, which did not impress the Sudanese. It seems to me that this region will not be stabilised until the issues of oil and oil transport have been resolved.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the new Republic of South Sudan has only been in existence for ten months, but it has already been at war with its northern neighbour for eight months. More than 150 000 people have been displaced. The fighting and shelling are incessant along the border, and these two countries, which have everything they need to prosper, are squandering their resources in a hopeless conflict, which simply adds tension in a region of Africa where there is already no shortage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is time that Khartoum and Juba complied with the resolutions of the African Union and the United Nations, put an end to hostilities and resumed negotiations without conditions. The two new countries undertook before their international mentors to resolve outstanding issues: the demarcation of the 20% of the border remaining to be drawn, the status of the South Sudanese residing in the North and of the Sudanese residing in the South and, above all, the sharing of oil reserves. It is in the interests of both the North, thanks to transit, and the South, which has 70% of reserves, to conclude an agreement that would benefit them both.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, neither should count on the silence of the international community in the face of the humanitarian drama which is being played out. If dialogue between Khartoum and Juba is not resumed quickly, the United Nations will have to exert pressure and impose sanctions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I note that, in this matter, China decided to assume its responsibilities. So much the better! However, it is necessary – it is essential – that the European Union continues to assert its position and its political presence. Our balanced position is the right one. Let us assert it with greater force and clarity and, above all – and I address these words to the European External Action Service (EEAS), but it has heard them already – let us not forget the conflict and drama of Darfur.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the failure to date of efforts to bring peace to the two Sudanese States and, in particular, the failure of the recent peace agreement, does not augur well in terms of preventing a resumption of the conflict that has lasted for decades now and the continuing decimation of the two countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">The two countries depend on each other economically and thus need to find ways to cooperate. The two States therefore need to stop stirring up and supporting the other side’s enemies, as this is hampering the peace process. The weakening of Sudan, due to the fact that it is now dependent on South Sudan, may weaken relations between that country and its African neighbours and, possibly, strengthen relations with Arab and Islamic countries and boost Islamic powers. Particular attention must be paid to that issue.</p>
      <p sl="el">The economic situation in Sudan has palpably deteriorated over 2012, as the oil flow has stopped. Thus, the economy is expected to shrink by 9.4% this year and inflation is expected to rocket to 19% in 2012 and to keep rising.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Union needs to take account of these worrying dimensions and the High Representative needs to act accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, let me begin by condemning the bombings against the northern part of South Sudan, which were carried out on Monday and Tuesday by Sudan. My immediate thought was that the information which arrived Monday would not be confirmed, but I have seen that the information has been confirmed and, in this case, I believe that we can describe it as a new act of provocation from Sudan. In my view, it is an appalling act which actually comes just a few days after Thabo Mbeki had announced that the leaders of both states had expressed their desire to return to the negotiating table.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In my view, the recent attacks confirm that Sudan is using stalling tactics. I also believe that President al-Bashir is probably reluctant at the moment to negotiate the road map for ending the conflict. This is why I am encouraging the African Union’s negotiator and the team he is leading to speed up the negotiations with Sudan and work towards preventing the escalation of a new war in the Sudanese region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I will conclude by commending the temporary UN force in Abyei for their peacekeeping efforts in the area. I hope that this force’s mandate, which expired yesterday, will be extended in view of the deteriorating situation in the region. I call on the United Nations to increase the number of soldiers and police officers in the force in order to be able to respond to a crisis which I, for one, feel is imminent.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, South Sudan, which, following the longest war in contemporary Africa, won the right to secede, has, for many years, been regarded as the world’s epicentre of misery and misfortune. Although the new state meant that a tragic chapter in its history was closed, a new chapter has now been opened, which does not appear to be any easier at all, since it rests on an old source of conflict, namely, the unequal access to natural resources in the north and the south.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Media reports tell us that in recent weeks, there have been several skirmishes along the border between Sudan and South Sudan. Armies conduct military operations in the disputed areas, and their tragic consequences affect the civilian population. According to UN representatives, referring to statements by the South Sudan’s Humanitarian Aid Commission, fighting has already forced over 500 000 persons in the Heglig region to abandon their homes, most refugees finding shelter in the bush. The current conflict was easy to predict, so why could it not be avoided? Why do the same patterns have to be repeated in different parts of the world? Why is it that a great surge and desire for freedom is often followed by victory for bloodthirsty greed? We have still not learned this lesson. I will end with the words of Thomas Jefferson: ‘the price of freedom is eternal vigilance’.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, rarely is the international community as unanimous on how to encourage peace as it has been in the context of the conflict between Sudan and South Sudan. The African Union has taken a significant first step in the form of a road map, which the United Nations Security Council adopted unanimously in its resolution. As for the EU, the Foreign Affairs Council, the President of the European Council and Baroness Ashton have all urged the relevant parties to commit to this road map towards peace.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The UN resolution is basically a means for persuading the parties to set up a 10 kilometre-long demilitarised border zone, to establish a Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism there, and to initiate unconditional peace talks. Sudan’s leaders, however, seem to be dallying, and are always imposing new conditions for the commencement of peace negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is obviously only a first step. In the longer term, we have to determine where the border lies, decide on the distribution of income from oil, and resolve ethnic disputes. However, the most urgent course of action is to help ordinary people. More than half of the population of South Sudan, some 4.7 million, are suffering from a food shortage. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs fears that South Sudan could drift into even greater poverty. Another problem is the poor infrastructure, which makes it difficult to get humanitarian aid into the country. The continuous arrival of refugees from north to south is placing a further burden on this new, fragile country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, what we are observing today is how a long-term internal conflict has expanded into a full-blown international conflict that is about to explode. But I am encouraged by the active role played by the EU’s leaders and its External Action Service in putting pressure on both governments to stick to the 2 May 2012 road map and come to a peaceful settlement.</p>
      <p sl="en">What the EU should do is address much more actively Chinese activity in the region, because it is not a great stabilising influence. It is good news that the Security Council has recently extended its mission in the region by six months.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we need today is for the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism – which should deploy international observers to monitor developments on the ground – to be up and running. We also need to address the humanitarian situation: almost 400 000 South Sudanese have managed to return to Sudan after independence, thanks to the help of the many frontline partners. We now need to ensure that their basic needs for food, water and medication will be provided for. The EU should provide more meaningful support to the efforts provided by the UN and humanitarian organisations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, unfortunately, it had to be assumed that the existing conflicts would not be resolved overnight following the independence of South Sudan, and not only where the final decision on where the border goes is concerned. A man such as Omar al-Bashir, who has exercised his rule for many years in all parts of his country in the way with which we are familiar, is continuing as before in the part of the country remaining to him as regards human rights, and I doubt that he has a genuine interest in the stabilisation of Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="de">We, as the EU, undoubtedly can and must help with the clearly still existing gross shortcomings in Sudan’s governance. I hope that by doing so, we can prevent Sudan turning into a new Eritrea, as one of the previous speakers feared.</p>
      <p sl="de">The international community must now act together. The World Security Council resolution provides the legal and political framework. The permanent members of the Security Council have a particular responsibility for its implementation since they have special interests and influence in Khartoum; I am talking, for example, about China and Russia. All those responsible in the north and the south must guarantee access to humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU must work closely with the African Union to bring about the resumption of peace talks. My basic stance is that, wherever possible, we must promote African solutions for African conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the case of oil, however, it is clear that the north and south are mutually dependent. One cannot do without the other. The buyers of the oil should realise that they will only gain access to the oil if they make proposals to Khartoum and Juba that reflect the interests of both. To this extent, it would be desirable for the EU to coordinate its actions with, for example, China. I feel sure that the EU would not prevent this from happening.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, following the referendum and the secession of South Sudan, relations between the two countries are far from normal. International observers have, for some time, been following the growing conflict between Sudan and South Sudan regarding the oil-rich border region. Guerrilla fighting is ongoing in the border areas. Issues relating to oil transit fees, border demarcation and the legal status of people living in the border areas have still not been resolved.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As an observer of the 2011 referendum on the division of Sudan, I would like to express my deep regret at the current situation. People have been persecuted and killed, often brutally, in this conflict, and tens of thousands of people have already had to leave their homes and flee. According to the UN Refugee Agency, there are over 150 000 people in refugee camps.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The international community, which monitored the referendum process and the creation of a new state, should strive ceaselessly for a peaceful end to the present dispute, in accordance with the road map which was adopted, and should look for solutions that will convince the governments of both countries to begin peace negotiation. The European Union, which upholds the values of peace, democracy and human rights, must make every effort to achieve actual peace, and not just peace on paper.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the ECR Group is deeply concerned about the risk of war breaking out between Sudan and Africa’s newest State, South Sudan. We, as a group, fully support efforts by the ex-President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, to mediate via the African Union and bring the parties to the negotiating table – namely President Salva Kiir and President al-Bashir. But they must exercise maximum restraint to avoid precipitating a bloody war, particularly in the areas which are legally disputed territories like Abyei and Heglig.</p>

It is worth noting that the EU supported the division of Sudan and the creation of South Sudan. The EU has spent, and continues to spend, hundreds of millions of euro on humanitarian aid. Nevertheless, the conflict continues, and it is a cruel conflict. This was previously a conflict with terrible consequences, with hundreds of thousands of victims within a single country, and now the conflict is an international one. This raises the question as to whether the EU should continue to play an active role, and whether it should do so as an independent entity. I believe that the EU should continue to play an active role. However, I think that much greater emphasis should be placed on UN support, and especially on African Union support. If peacemaking troops are deployed, they should be mainly from the armies of African countries.</p>

The EU must continue to be involved, as specified by the UN-approved road map, in the efforts to defuse the situation. Further measures are also required to provide assistance to the population. Hundreds of thousands of people are already suffering the consequences of the crisis between the two countries. For instance, the number of refugees has doubled at the Yida camp in the last two months.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should mention, in particular, the situation in the Nuba mountain region where the Sudanese regime does not allow any access, even for delivering humanitarian aid.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, our support for the creation of a new independent state in the south of Sudan is bringing the first unwanted consequences of the independence of this country. Border demarcation disputes also affect the oil area around Heglig, and the Secretary-General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, has described as illegal the attempt made by South Sudanese troops to take control of the disputed areas and called for the forces to withdraw from the region. Although the South Sudanese Government withdrew its troops from the area, the President of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, threatened to close the transit pipeline through which South Sudanese oil flows to Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast. The South Sudanese Government does not have any other routes for transporting oil, and it is therefore completely dependent on the generosity of its northern partner and neighbour. In this situation, it is incomprehensible that the leaders of the two countries cannot find a common peaceful settlement of the dispute, and that they are exacerbating the misery and suffering of the citizens of their countries through military conflicts that resolve nothing. Therefore, we must help them and insist more strongly that the regimes in Khartoum and Juba resolve their disputes at the negotiating table and in accordance with international law.</p>

Unfortunately, the organisation Médecins Sans Frontières has had to put its activities in North Darfur on hold, despite having been highly successful in its activities there since 1985. The country’s own population is unjustifiably bearing the brunt of resentment against western aid – or to put it bluntly, against Christian aid. Radical Islamism in the north, shaky administration in the south, proxy wars by so-called tribal warriors and finally, the egotistical interests of various countries such as China in the exploitation of its natural resources, are keeping peace from this tormented region. The conclusion is therefore clear and should be that Europe must take on an active, leading role in this region.</p>

Of course, now that South Sudan is independent, it is no longer strictly a civil war, but there is no doubt that the conflict is a product and continuation of earlier civil conflicts. One causal factor is the legacy of colonists who drew arbitrary lines on maps that ignored the ethnic, religious and linguistic populations, either splitting them up or corralling them together with incompatible populations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The southern Abantu and Nilotic peoples have little in common with the Arab and Nubian populations of the North.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I notice broad agreement on the grave nature of the situation in Sudan and South Sudan. The human suffering is appalling and the lack of sufficient political will on both sides to resolve the outstanding issues must be addressed.

I also support the possible sanctions mentioned in the resolution adopted on 2 May 2012 by the Security Council, if the parties concerned do not comply with the road map. Both sides must end the armed activity in the Abyei region, the oil crisis needs to be resolved, and consensus must be reached on issues of citizenship. It is excellent that the parties concerned have succeeded in working together to establish an airlift between Sudan and South Sudan, allowing many people to return to their home districts before the rainy season begins. There has also been progress in matters of citizenship. I hope that we will soon see the same sort of progress made in the oil crisis and with regard to Abyei. It is also absolutely crucial that humanitarian workers can access the Abyei region via Sudan, because at the moment, this is only possible from South Sudan, nor should we forget that there are still hundreds of thousands of refugees in the area. Regardless of which Sudan Abyei decides it will join in the forthcoming referendum, the humanitarian needs of civilians must be guaranteed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity today, on behalf of High Representative/Vice-President Ashton, to discuss the situation in Guinea-Bissau, and I welcome the attention that the European Parliament is giving to it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current crisis in Guinea-Bissau clearly reveals once more an attempt by the military to get involved in civilian affairs and gain control of the political affairs of the country. The country remains one of the poorest in the world, ravaged by drug trafficking, and its problems directly affect Europe through the drug trade. The way to a solution is to persuade the military to step aside and to reform the army. Only then can the country be ruled by civilians legitimated by free and fair elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU strongly condemned the military coup in Guinea-Bissau on 12 April 2012. We called for the immediate re-establishment of the legitimate government and for the completion of the presidential elections in compliance with the law.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the adoption on 18 May of UNSC Resolution 2048/2012 on Guinea-Bissau, imposing individual sanctions on coup leaders and demanding the immediate restoration of the constitutional order, including a democratic electoral process, the return of the military to barracks and their withdrawal from political affairs. The UN Security Council also underlined that those responsible for the human rights violations must be held accountable, and that any lasting solution to instability in Guinea-Bissau should ensure that those responsible for politically-motivated assassinations, other serious crimes and breaches of constitutional order are brought to justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">We reiterate our strong condemnation of the coup, and encourage all stakeholders to work within the framework of Security Council Resolution 2048 with a view to agreeing on an inclusive road map with agreed benchmarks and a calendar for the return to constitutional order, the implementation of security sector reform, fighting against impunity, combating drug trafficking and the removal of any army grip on power. We stand ready to actively support mediation efforts in the current crisis towards the identification of an inclusive transitional arrangement.</p>
      <p sl="en">We renew our call for the immediate release of all illegally detained persons and for the immediate suspension of the Military Command’s prohibition on persons, including members of the former government, leaving the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has already adopted sanctions against six members of the Military Command and is ready to extend the list to other persons, military and political, who are de facto governing the country and may be responsible for human rights violations and abuses, including arbitrary detentions, ill-treatment during detention and violent repression of peaceful demonstrations, as well as looting and mismanagement of public funds. We already suspended most of our aid last year, and the primary condition for its resumption is local agreement to reform the security sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also concerned about the deteriorating human situation and the constant risk of violence. Moreover, we are concerned about the possibility of arrangements that would allow the current leaders of the armed forces to continue to threaten or control the civil powers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Democratic stability in Guinea-Bissau requires the removal of the threat represented by the armed forces, and the reform of the security sector remains an urgent necessity. Those responsible for anti-constitutional behaviour or crimes must be held to account; any agreement must be inclusive and democratic; the military must not be allowed, in any case, to dictate who does or does not participate in politics. We are monitoring the latest political and security-related developments in this light.</p>
      <p sl="en">The international community needs to stand united. In this regard, the High Representative has encouraged ECOWAS and the AU to bring the concerned partners of the international community together to mobilise coherent political and financial support for the road map for a return to constitutional order and security sector reform. To this end, a contact group of the international community could usefully be launched.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Wammen, I would like to begin by saying that it is regrettable that Baroness Ashton, the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative, is not present at a debate of this importance. In any case, it is a pleasure to work once again with the President-in-Office of the Council, who has made a statement here that I would like to review in full.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the first place, I would like to extend some words of comfort and solidarity to the people of Guinea-Bissau, which has been systematically slaughtered due to democratic and political instability, and to serious insecurity. As though the poverty surrounding them were not enough, they have been constantly hit by these evils.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Moreover, I would like to add that, during its Presidency, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has been following this issue from the very beginning. It is therefore regrettable that it has taken Parliament a month to manage to hold a debate on this matter. This is due to the invisibility of the Guinean people and the issue of Guinea-Bissau. The reason for this invisibility is that, unlike other issues of similar severity, the economic interests of the major EU, US and global powers are not at stake here, so they do not feel compelled to discuss the situation of the Guinean people.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, I would say that, if an external reason is needed and if the poverty and political instability in this country is not enough for us to urge global humanitarian and political action, at the very least, the drug trafficking situation ravaging Guinea-Bissau, with a direct impact on the peoples of Europe and the US, should be reason enough for us to engage with this situation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why I am asking the EU to take a more robust stance. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2048/2012 and the decisions by the EU, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) and the African Union are undoubtedly positive, although those of the Economic Community of West African States are perhaps not. However, resolutions are not enough: action is needed. We must be firm and more effective when it comes to states that have the capacity to intervene in Guinea-Bissau. We are obliged to take such action. I also believe that at this moment, the EU is responding well in terms of its principles, but it is not providing an adequate response in terms of practical tools for operating on the ground. I would like to ask the Council and the Commission for such tools.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I shall begin by expressing my solidarity with the people of Guinea-Bissau, who set such an example to the world, me included, in their fight against colonial oppression. The EU has made an error in withdrawing aid and, in particular, in recalling its mission to support the reform of the security sector, which was put in place in response to the political killings in 2010. That was the time to increase the scale and mandate of that mission, as some of us suggested. As the President-in-Office of the Council has said, there is a need to send the military back to the barracks in Guinea-Bissau and ensure that they are clearly subject to civil democratic power. If not, Guinea-Bissau will not be able to restore constitutional order or security for its citizens and the region as a whole, neither will it be able to strengthen its state and social structures in order to prevent itself from being exploited by drug-trafficking networks or other types of organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To this end, the EU must ensure the practical – not merely rhetorical – implementation of Resolution 2048/2012 of the United Nations Security Council, which identifies the leaders of the coup d’état and imposes sanctions on them. The resolution also demands the restoration of the legitimate authorities, namely, the government headed by Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Júnior, who has been forced to leave the country, and interim President Raimundo Pereira.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In doing so, the EU must first issue a serious and unequivocal warning to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and all of its members that are partners of the EU under the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP), as these countries are legally bound by the democratic obligations and respect for human rights enshrined in the Cotonou Agreement. This warning should make clear that it is unacceptable that ECOWAS should endorse conditions in Guinea-Bissau and Mali that are providing succour for the leaders of the coup d’état and allowing them to make a false transition that is clearly in violation of the democratic constitutional order.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The EU cannot continue neglecting Guinea-Bissau, which is also one of our ACP partners. It is vital that the EU improve its links with more regional stakeholders under the auspices of the UN, ECOWAS, the African Union and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), in order to implement a rescue operation for a country on the verge of becoming another failed state, ravaged by extreme poverty, poor governance and the disruption of its human and natural resources. Military support for the return of the legitimate prime minister should also be provided.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Following this, we need a concerted policy involving immediate protection for the people of Guinea-Bissau from an imminent humanitarian disaster, and subsequently providing support for a programme of action against the causes of the problems undermining the country and Guinean society, from poverty to under-development and the lack of governance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The interests of the EU itself are also at stake, as the security of Guinea-Bissau has an impact on our own security, given that it is located in a region where drug trafficking is linked to the terrorism of Boko Haram and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, a month ago, our High Representative, Baroness Ashton, was here, and I voiced my regret, indeed my protest, at the fact that she was very quick to defend the oil company Repsol, while saying nothing about Guinea-Bissau. Back then, she promised me that she would take the appropriate measures, and that she would be attentive to the plight of Guinea-Bissau. One month later, we see that Baroness Ashton is not present at this debate on Guinea-Bissau. This is regrettable, and once again confirms what my fellow Member, Mr Rangel, has already described as the invisibility of the problem of Guinea-Bissau, which owes much to the region in which it is located. Above all, we are faced with a people that does not want a failed state, has done everything to prevent it, and has to contend with two forces constantly seeking to make the country a failed state: the military and drug trafficking. Indeed, these two forces are interconnected. Much more can be done for Guinea-Bissau, and the country’s problems can be solved.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The deposed President and Prime Minister of Guinea-Bissau are now in Portugal seeking support in order to make the military give up power and ensure the resumption of the democratic process. The United Nations resolutions, in particular Resolution 2048, are correct in their analysis of what needs to be done. I also fully subscribe to what our own European External Action Service has said in this debate. Actions, not words, are the only way to tackle this problem. Why is the EU not doing more, for instance, by requesting a high-level bilateral meeting with the Economic Community of West African States, which has taken an attitude of acceptance, thereby legitimising a coup d’état, accepting the installation of a transitional president and a series of measures that are simply unacceptable?</p>
      <p sl="pt">The only acceptable solution is to implement the UN resolution and to send a stabilisation and peacekeeping force, with the consent of the Guinean people. This would allow the legitimate rulers of the country to return, and would provide the EU with an opportunity to try to remedy some of its mistakes, in particular, by withdrawing its mission to Guinea-Bissau, which was in place precisely in order to help the transition and the civilisation, in the strict sense of the word, of the military forces within the country. Without such efforts, Guinea-Bissau will never know the peace, stability and prosperity that it needs and desires so desperately, and for which its people have been working so hard.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, ever since independence from Portugal in the 1970s after a bloody war, the small, impoverished West African country of Guinea-Bissau has remained in a state of almost constant conflict between the civilian and military authorities, with a spate of political assassinations.</p>
      <p sl="en">My group, the ECR, condemns the latest actions of the military last month, when a coup derailed the presidential elections and installed a military junta. The regional organisation ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) must be commended for its robust leadership in responding to this crisis. A combination of security-building measures, involving 600 regional peacekeeping troops, and hard-hitting pragmatic negotiations with threats of economic sanctions, has reportedly now broken the deadlock, and hopefully stabilised the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have heard reports recently that the military junta is stepping down and handing power back to a civilian and interim government, with the prospect of free and fair elections taking place in the future. This state of affairs, if it is true, is to be welcomed. The EU should demand that the interim government make significant reform of the political system its top priority.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must not forget that a stable, law-abiding, democratic Guinea-Bissau is very much in the West’s interests. The country is, sadly, a key intermediary for drug shipments between South America – mainly the Colombian cocaine cartels – and Europe. Therefore, to continue the fight against illegal drugs, which blight the lives of so many of our citizens and fuel organised criminality, the international community must continue to observe closely and apply pressure, particularly economic pressure, on Guinea-Bissau to act responsibly and appropriately and cease to be a failed state or, worse still, a ‘narco state’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The country must, with the support of the African Union, the United Nations and the EU, move forward with determination to ensure democratic and civil rights for all its citizens. I would like to agree with my colleague, Rui Tavares, and ask why – as Baroness Ashton cannot, unfortunately, be here – Nick Westcott, the EEAS managing director for Africa and a regional expert, could not have been here in her place to listen to this debate.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the debate that we are having here today concerns what happened on 12 April 2012, when a group of soldiers seized power in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau by force, detained the Prime Minister and President, and transferred power to a national council that has no legitimate democratic representation whatsoever.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Guinea-Bissau is a state in grave danger: it is extremely fragile, and it needs support in order to be able to move towards legality and legitimacy. There have been protests by the international community, but most of them have not even been heard, and they have had absolutely no effect on the rebels. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that a situation like this has arisen in Guinea-Bissau, and if we restrict ourselves to merely pointing out the invisibility of the situation, it will certainly not be the last. For this reason, we must make this issue visible, in particular, here in Parliament, and we cannot limit ourselves to speeches. I have had the opportunity to work on a draft resolution within my group. I am aware that other political groups have done the same thing, and it is high time that these texts were voted on, so that Parliament has a very clear voice in this situation, which is extremely serious. We cannot restrict ourselves to speeches. It is time to act, and I call on the High Representative to lead the action on this issue, although she is not here at present.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We must be very clear about the path that needs to be taken, namely, the path of supporting the legitimate and legal authorities of Guinea-Bissau, along with investment in security, defence and combating drug trafficking in the region and the country concerned. This is the path that needs to be taken, and I sincerely hope that the leaders of the Council will reiterate this at the end of this debate, along with pointing out the paths that need to be taken in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on 12 April, the world received some not very surprising news from the African continent. Since 1998, the military in Guinea-Bissau have managed four coups d’état, all in the name of stability and security. The results are exactly the contrary of the stated goals. The country, the region and the whole continent are less stable and less secure, and prone to more poverty, unrest and violence. This vicious cycle must be stopped and reversed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Guinea-Bissau needs outside help. The Economic Community of West African States, the United Nations, the African Union and the European Union must and should help. Stabilisation of the country must be a priority. Effective rule of law, improved education and social cohesion will stimulate more investment and growth. That is the path all stakeholders must pursue. If Guinea-Bissau’s military really care about their citizens, they should provide a leading role. If not, the international community must impose sufficient pressure to achieve the necessary changes. Baroness Ashton’s statement of 23 April strongly condemning this coup d’état is one of the first steps in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, coups d’état generally damage the development of low-income countries and make the lives of their inhabitants more difficult. The situation in Guinea-Bissau is distinctive, however, since the coup was carried out just before the second round of presidential elections, and the ruling party’s candidate had won 49% of votes in the first round.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This coup has also had a very adverse effect on major sectors of the economy. The cashew nut trade, which accounts for 80% of Guinea-Bissau’s exports, has suffered the most. Harvesting of cashew nuts began in mid-April, i.e. precisely at the time of the coup. Growers are being offered such low prices that most of them are not yet selling and are instead waiting for market conditions to improve, while anyone who can is trying to reach Senegal in order to sell products there.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is important because the cashew nut harvest governs the lives of thousands of families in Guinea-Bissau. As a result of the coup, many different institutions, from banks to various investments that are in progress, are not operating normally. Another distinctive feature is that members of the opposition parties are acting in the transitional government, with the approval of the army. In the view of many observers, this shows that there was collusion between the army and the opposition prior to the coup, making a return to democracy very difficult.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we strongly condemn the military coup d’état in Guinea-Bissau. The way out of the current situation can only be acceptable if it restores and respects the constitutional framework of the country and guarantees that the Guinean people will be able freely to decide their own destiny, without external interference or imposition. This requires the unequivocal recognition of the institutions, authorities and legitimate Guinean representatives at the time of the coup d’état, along with the resumption of the electoral process for the President of the Republic that was under way at that time. There is also a need for unequivocal rejection of any decisions that do not respect these conditions and instead seek to implement and impose the aims of the military coup d’état as a fait accompli. All Guinean citizens detained as a result of the military coup d’état need to be released immediately and unconditionally, and there needs to be a robust denunciation of measures aimed at suppressing and persecuting those who hold positions in sovereign bodies, the leaders and activists of the Africa Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), and the citizens of Guinea-Bissau who have spoken out against the military coup d’état.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This coup d’état and the fact that the situation is being dragged out are not unrelated to disputes between foreign interests that run counter to the interests of the Guinean people. We wish to express our complete solidarity with the Guinean people, and call for urgent measures to be taken in order to meet their needs. The situation in the country has deteriorated alarmingly since the coup d’état and we are receiving repeated requests for help everyday, as the country lacks food, medicines, medical and surgical equipment, drinking water and fuel.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This situation cannot be ignored, in particular, by those who had some hand in the difficult situation in the country, even before the coup d’état. The difficult economic and social situation that the country is experiencing is also a reflection of the failure of IMF and World Bank programmes, as well as EU policies for the region, which have found their way into the so-called economic partnership agreements. What is therefore required is genuine help and cooperation that looks at the problems, difficulties and needs of the country and respects the right of the Guinean people to decide their fate in a free and sovereign way.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, Guinea-Bissau has been affected for many years by instability against a background of corruption, drug trafficking and violence, and the military coup which has disrupted the electoral process has made the situation worse. For the time being, the main priority is to prevent violence. This is why the signing of a national agreement on resolving the political crisis and transferring power to civilians is a positive development. However, the ultimate aim must still be to restore the constitutional regime and initiate a genuine transition to democracy. The solidarity of the international community is vital to this end.</p>

Even the High Representative can be in only one place at a time, and today she is in Baghdad, leading the negotiations with Iran on the issue of its nuclear programme. As for Mr Nick Westcott, the head of the European External Action Service’s African department, he cannot be present here today because he is on a mission to Niger, Burkina Faso and Mauritania.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Guinea-Bissau, your comments confirm that, in line with the principle of respect for democracy and the rule of law, which inspires the external action of the EU, the immediate priorities in Guinea-Bissau should consist of the restoration of constitutional order, the release of all illegally detained persons and the resumption of the democratic electoral process. Exactly how this is to be done remains unclear, and there are still grounds to fear that a compromise may not resolve the underlying issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), as a key regional leader, should continue its mediation efforts aimed at bringing a speedy end to the unsustainable situation in the country. This has to be done in greater synergy with the UN, the African Union, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries and other international partners in order to ensure that the stabilisation strategy effectively addresses critical issues, including the implementation of security sector reform, the fight against impunity, the fight against drug trafficking and the promotion of social and economic development.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, since the declaration of independence in 1973, Guinea-Bissau has been tormented with political instability. Bearing in mind that the country has witnessed massacres, assassinations, a civil war and a number of military coups, I am disappointed that once again, any hope for political progress has been spoiled by another coup d’état. The ALDE Group endorses the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council meeting condemning the coup. Following the negotiations led by the Economic Community of West African States, the putschists have finally agreed to a 12-month transition to civilian rule. Nevertheless, the targeted sanctions that the EU imposed on the military junta led by General Antonio Indjai should not be lifted before the legitimate government is re-established, the democratic electoral process is completed and constitutional order is restored. The EU must take measures to prevent senior military figures from taking advantage of the situation and increasing and benefiting from drug trafficking during the transition period. We also welcome the deployment of ECOWAS peacekeeping troops and hope that the reported looting and human rights abuses by the military will be brought to an end and that a gradual transition will be allowed to take place without bloodshed.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would like to begin with a few figures that those present here can probably conceive of, but a lot of people outside cannot. We will have 9 billion people on the planet in 2050, that in 15 years’ time, we will see a doubling to 3 billion of the number of people with a median income, that we need a planet and a half to meet the needs of our consumers and soon enough we will need three planets – and we simply do not have them. Commodity prices have risen by 150% in the past 10 years, in an economy that is addicted to cheap raw materials. This is costing our economy billions, no, hundreds of billions a year extra.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Therefore, what we need in Europe is an action plan, a concrete action plan to address this. The Commission’s road map, for which I would like to warmly congratulate Commissioner Potočnik, is an excellent start. The Commission’s analysis and approach are very good. However, what I find still to be missing is a greater degree of urgency and robustness, and that is precisely what we, as Parliament, are now making clear. You can see that not only in the content of the report, but in its structure too, where we have set six key priorities in the Committee on the Environment. I would now like to run through all the six priorities.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, it is very important that we agree with industry a joint action plan on business to enable Europe to use raw materials more efficiently. We need to do that together, because infrastructure needs to be adapted, regulations must be simplified and adapted, but businesses, too, need to realise that they have a lot to do to produce more efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The second key priority is that we really need to move towards a single recycling and reuse market. It must be made easier to export waste containing valuable raw materials across borders. That is linked to tax incentives for the use of secondary raw materials. Secondary raw materials should ultimately be cheaper than their primary counterparts and we need tax incentives for that, too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The third key priority is the promotion of research and development. We need to develop alternatives and we need to help the recycling industry to professionalise even further.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fourth, we need to extend the Ecodesign Directive. It is currently only focused on energy, but we must also ensure easier recovery of raw materials in products and that begins as early as the design stage.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fifth, we need to integrate the term, the idea of ‘resource efficiency’, into other policy areas; in the field of agriculture, where we need to deal more efficiently with water, in fisheries, etc.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The sixth key priority is that Europe should develop clear environmental indicators and, as far as this Parliament is concerned, this should be based on the concept of footprints. Measurement is knowledge and that is essential.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the more I have worked on this issue, the more I have realised that this is not primarily an environmental agenda. This is an economic agenda. We need to deal more efficiently with raw materials in order to keep our economy afloat in the future. I have already mentioned the extra hundreds of billions of euro that the increase in the price of raw materials is going to cost industry every year.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is the real agenda and I am, therefore, surprised that the Council – which is unfortunately not attending this debate – is not playing ball. In other words, I am surprised that the Council is not showing enough ambition to rally Europe-wide support for this action plan so that we can progress towards much more efficient management of raw materials.</p>

    <intervention id="3-413-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="False" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Gerbrandy on this report, which recognises the high level of ambition needed to achieve the transformation to a resource-efficient Europe. It reaffirms the political importance of the resource efficiency agenda and the urgency of the need to take action in order to respond to the economic and environmental challenges we face.</p>
      <p sl="en">Resource constraints are a real global trend that we must certainly address. The economic crisis has demonstrated the need for urgent changes in the economy and the need to consider our growth model. Without new policies, we will put even more pressure on the environment, we will not deliver on our climate change targets, and we will expose our economy and well-being to systemic risks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sustainable resource use is the condition for the long-term resilience and competitiveness of our economies. Resource efficiency is also a promising source of growth and jobs, which offers multiple benefits and opportunities for business and policy making in the short, medium and also long term.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has laid out its vision for the path to sustainable growth and competitiveness in the long-term strategies under the Europe 2020 resource efficiency flagship initiative, ranging from energy to transport to climate, water and biodiversity. We have integrated resource efficiency into our proposals for cohesion, for research, for development, and for agricultural and fisheries policies. I hope that the outcomes of the legislative process will match the ambition you show today so that we can address the scale of the resource challenges we really face.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the road map to a resource efficient Europe, we have put on the table a coherent framework to achieve the 2050 vision of sustainability. The Commission has proposed a set of 2020 milestones and concrete actions to start the process of transformation. Resource efficiency policies are approached from three angles, and I am glad to see from your report that you share this view of the priorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, we highlight the need to provide the horizontal conditions for transformation of the economy. We address consumption and production, emphasise the importance of measures such as ecodesign, and highlight the importance of research and innovation, and the crucial need to phase out inefficient subsidies and shift to environmental taxation. Turning waste into a valuable resource is key to boosting the resource productivity of the EU economy and also enhancing growth. Full implementation of EU waste legislation alone would save EUR 72 billion a year, increase the annual turnover of the EU waste management and recycling sector by EUR 42 billion, and create over 400 000 jobs by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the nature target. We should try to ensure that our natural capital and the ecosystem services this provides are used efficiently in the short and long term, as they are the foundation of our economy and our quality of life. This reflects the broad definition of resources that the Commission seeks to promote.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we target the economic sectors that are responsible for the greatest share of environmental impacts – namely food, buildings and mobility. I am glad to see that you also put these as a first priority in your report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Governance is the key element of the strategy because resource efficiency is an integration agenda and EU Member States have a key role to play in bringing about the necessary changes. Integration of resource efficiency into the European Semester will ensure that Member States are moving along a sustainable path. We will also launch a process to define the appropriate targets with solid, effective and science-based indicators with a view to agreeing on a lead indicator, a dashboard and thematic indicators by 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Naturally, we also need the full implementation of European Union environmental legislation, coupled with actions at international level to ensure a level global playing field. As always, the commitment of all stakeholders is fundamental to the success of any programme. We need to mobilise actors at all levels, and in all relevant sectors, to do their part. I count, of course, on your support for this. I will be following today’s debate with very keen interest.</p>

      <p sl="it">As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I can only welcome the inclusion in the text adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of many of the suggestions made in our report from the Committee on International Trade.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is no doubt that, in the context of the EU’s external dimension, trade in environmental goods and services is an instrument of particular significance for economic and social development. In particular, the opening up of the markets to highly energy-efficient goods and services plays a role in Europe’s conscientious growth in terms of exports, the creation of new jobs related to the spread of new green technologies, and innovation and competitiveness for businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="it">In our opinion, we have reaffirmed the importance of some essential elements in future European bilateral, multilateral and regional agreements: the reduction or removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in environmental goods and services; the inclusion of a section on sustainability; the inclusion of tariff preferences for environmental goods and services produced within the Generalised System of Preferences; not to mention the simplification of procedures.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union must maintain its global leadership in protecting the environment and promoting, through trade, the use of green goods, services and technologies in third countries for truly sustainable global growth.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must, Commissioner, particularly in relation to third countries, encourage the conclusion of trade agreements consistent with the proposed energy efficiency measures, thus ensuring deliberate, smart growth within the European Union.</p>

We need innovative business models, research and innovation, a market for the reuse of resources, an extended Ecodesign Directive and faster implementation of the Waste Framework Directive.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the statement from the industry committee, we also discussed the fact that we need to develop and strengthen the different types of interaction between the Member States and the EU.

The Committee on Regional Development also called for greater investment in infrastructure for renewable energy projects and I am pleased to say that the new regulations for cohesion policy do indeed take this into account.</p>

That is why it is only right that we also look at it from the perspective of the competitiveness of our society and our industry. That is why I believe that it is necessary for us to conduct this broad debate without, at the same time, calling for legislation. I am even sure that we can settle a great deal by making agreements, in that we will be drawing industry’s attention to how much more efficient we need to be.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moderation was tried by Ludwig Erhard in Germany, my father tried it with me, I have tried it with my children, but it does not work. We have to find another way, and that way is efficiency. Once upon a time, I had a car that had fuel consumption of 12 litres per 100 kilometres; then I had one with fuel consumption of seven litres; now our fuel consumption is three litres. That is precisely the road that we must go down.</p>
      <p sl="de">Was there actually anything wrong with our fathers’ metaphor for efficiency, about how it meant managing the forest well? You only take as much wood from the forest as will grow again each year. If we can take this even half to heart, then we will have made progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I am very grateful to Mr Gerbrandy, who is an excellent and pleasant person to work with. We have laid a good foundation. Now and again, my friends on the other side of the House go a bit far. Do we really want to ban people from eating meat? Do you really expect us to write an eco-audit on every bill? What are people to do if they split the bill? Let us take a deep breath, then, and delete a few things.</p>
      <p sl="de">The indicator approach is absolutely right, but that, too, is a process that cannot be done overnight. Mr Gerbrandy, we will try to work together to remove what is nonsense and to highlight the good aspects.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur Gerbrandy, I once had a beautiful orange kettle, made in the Netherlands. At one point, a part got broken and I was not able to get it repaired. The part was not available but, apart from that, the kettle was actually still quite good. However, because we live in a throwaway society, it was ultimately cheaper to buy a new kettle – a less beautiful one, mind you. It does not have to be that way. We need to change that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is good that we are once again discussing the fact that the Earth is finite and so are its resources, because nothing has changed, as the Club of Rome said in its famous 1972 report ‘Limits to growth’. It is now 2012, forty years down the line, and the situation is still the same, as indeed it will be in forty years’ time. To put it simply, it really is time that we started doing something about this, something concrete.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the past two years, we have presented at least two strategies on this issue: the commodity strategy and, now, the efficient use of resources. Therefore, it is vital that we start to integrate this into our society, but not in a way that says people have to put on another jumper in winter or that they should consume less. We need to do it in a way that will appeal to everyone and that will ultimately lead to the efficiency that we are all talking about.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Highly specific proposals include new business models which are aimed, among other things, at repair and not replacement every time, and which are aimed at the use of secondary raw materials. Besides, it is often new models that seem to set the trend, not new technology. And so we really have to focus on that. We need better and clearer labelling, and not with five different labels: one for fair trade and the other for energy efficiency. What I want is to be able to see in a single glance what kind of a product this is. We also need better handling of recyclable materials, so that they do not end up in landfill or incinerators.</p>
      <p sl="nl">From the abstract to the concrete: Europe’s environmental footprint now covers ten football pitches and, before long, with all the people who will be in the world in 2050, we will have only one football pitch for everything we need – our energy, our food and our resources. As a result, we need to move very fast. Allow me to give you just one example: in 2006, fertiliser cost USD 200 and now it costs USD 600. That is three times as much in six years. The urgency seems to be very clear to me. We have to do something. Now. Not only for the environment, but also for the economy.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis in the European Union confronts us with problems such as high unemployment, debt and economic recession, which we need to resolve immediately.</p>
      <p sl="bg">At the same time, there are also other issues which are not noticeable at first glance, but which need to be resolved just as quickly, such as the efficient use of resources in our society.</p>
      <p sl="bg">In the coming years, the world’s middle-class population will reach 3 billion. It is encouraging for us to see that developing countries, too, are reaping the benefits of their labour during the globalisation process, but at the same time, we should not forget about our planet’s limited resources.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We must start living within this planet’s means by rethinking our habits, our current production system and the excessive consumption of resources. This will be the only way to guarantee us sustainable growth.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Sustainable growth can only be achieved by devising an alternative programme of innovation to focus on using the resources that we already have in the most efficient way possible. This is of paramount importance if we want to resolve the problem of resource supply security for Europe, as well as the problem of the shortage of resources globally, which will grow steadily worse in the future.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Global problems need global solutions and the European Union’s efforts in this area must not remain in isolation. The Rio +20 conference is approaching and Europe needs to take responsibility as a global leader by promoting its efficiency programme.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Mr Gerbrandy, thank you for the report. I have examined a number of annual reports of various multinationals. AkzoNobel, a large multinational, states in its annual report that the higher price of commodities has cost them EUR 1 billion in profits. Thus, EUR 1 billion less profit due to higher commodity prices. In DSM’s annual report, the company states explicitly that one of the big problems it is facing is the rising cost of raw materials and the higher prices, which they have been able to pass on to consumers so far, is also a major problem for DSM. Unilever’s annual report is the same: higher commodity prices last year cost them EUR 2.5 billion in profits. This is another multinational indicating that the challenge of the future is: how are we going to deal with the increasing scarcity of our natural resources?</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is the agenda. It is not only a green agenda, it is also an economic agenda. Does this then mean that companies are very busy working on it at the moment? Research shows that in the Netherlands, only one in five companies are working on a strategy on how to deal with higher raw material prices. Only one in five! To put it simply, companies are still too unaware of the need to really start looking properly at how we deal with our natural resources. That is the bottom line.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With this in mind, we welcome the Commission’s programme, which addresses the appropriate issues: but how do we tackle this challenge? By shifting the burden from labour to raw materials, by looking at the question of whether we are able to set tax levels properly, by implementing existing regulations, for example, the Waste Directive, by integrating this agenda into other policy areas, such as the agricultural policy that we have in Europe, and by working on good targets and indicators. We have good policies and a good agenda, but this is now coming down to really taking action. Action is going to be of crucial importance right now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This green, more efficient economy could be the way out of the current economic crisis, but then we really need to take it seriously. How are we going to look at the waste sector, for example? That will be crucial. How are we going to look at our agricultural policy? The efficient handling of nutrients such as phosphate is not included in agricultural reform at the moment. This is a great disadvantage in the current situation. We are now going to have to look at this issue because ultimately, what matters is that we make efficient use of our resources, because that is our future green economy. And that is the only economy we, as Europe, should head towards.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Gerbrandy for his report. We all share the aim, surely, of conserving resources and using them effectively.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The report includes several points, however, that are very hard for me to accept, or which are totally unacceptable. These ‘red rags’ in the report include the calls to introduce further taxation at European level and dual taxation, and there is even talk of an environmental tax and a tax on natural resources. During a time of protracted economic crisis, I consider this disastrous for Europe, to say the very least. Extending the Ecodesign Directive, I am afraid, will also lead to more bureaucracy rather than actual benefits for Europe and her citizens.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In terms of the other details I would like to mention, I consider the sections on recycling and composting to be highly praiseworthy. We are all, surely, in favour of Europe moving away from dumping waste in landfills. I agree very much with this, and I support the proposal. I would like to ask everyone to agree on striking out the comments on halting waste incineration, as this would be rather counterproductive in the current situation. For the reasons mentioned, I personally will not be able to support this report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, this report is yet another declaration of intent that is difficult to achieve, especially at a time of economic crisis such as the one we are experiencing. The main topics addressed by Parliament relate almost exclusively to environmental issues.</p>
      <p sl="it">Acting always and only at EU level can only impoverish our enterprises and our citizens, to the sole and exclusive benefit of third countries. Overly strict and burdensome regulations lead to the relocation of enterprises to third countries with easier tax burdens, costs, rules and controls. The relocation of these enterprises also entails a worsening of emissions into the atmosphere as they are no longer subject to the strict limits imposed in Europe. Our citizens thus lose out twice: they lose jobs and emissions into the atmosphere increase. For Europe, losing further competitiveness means postponing our exit from the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">For these reasons, we voted against the report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. If some major amendments are adopted during the vote in plenary, thereby improving some of the most controversial points, and given that there are some positive aspects to this measure, we may change our vote to an abstention. Otherwise, we shall vote against it.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, today, we are debating Mr Gerbrandy’s report on resource efficiency. Mr Gerbrandy has used well-turned words and phrases but, as usual, he has said nothing at all. He is talking about a paradigm shift, a recycling economy and, from a lifecycle perspective, he wants to push resource efficiency towards a more ambitious agenda.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I have no idea in which direction Mr Gerbrandy wants to push this agenda, but one thing is clear: this is going to make money for his environment friends. A lot of money, and we call that political clientelism, pure and simple. Plus, he is talking about a landfill tax, a waste hierarchy and a European external policy on waste, including waste acquis. Does that mean Baroness Ashton will soon personally start monitoring how Member States manage their waste? It cannot get more crazy than this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Let me make it clear that the Dutch Party for Freedom (PPV) is in favour of rational use of raw materials, but every right-thinking person has long been in favour of that. That is why we do not need Mr Gerbrandy’s idiotic proposals. What should we do with this nonsensical report? Suddenly, it came to me. Mr Gerbrandy is talking about a strict end-of-waste criterion. Well, this report by him will surely meet that criterion. I am now going to push it in the direction of waste recycling and add it to this cylindrical archive. Duly noted.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gerbrandy, as well as our shadow rapporteur, Karl-Heinz Florenz, who I believe have drawn up an excellent report. Nonetheless, allow me to take you on a little trip back into history, to show you the factors that led to the great rise of Europe in recent centuries – because we do, after all, want to remain highly successful. What are the core elements, so to speak? I believe it was precisely this famous increase in efficiency, and that includes resource efficiency. In around 1400, China needed to farm an area of around half a hectare to feed one person; in Europe, the area required was nearly ten times this. Nonetheless, we succeeded in far outstripping these Asian countries. What were the driving factors?</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, there was the competition that prevailed between the various countries and between the various systems here in Europe; inherent in this is a certain small scale structure and a battle of one against another.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, there is the knowledge that we developed here in Europe, which we did by taking a rational approach to things and attempting to master nature, by investigating the laws of nature and using them accordingly in our economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, in Europe, we created ownership structures, a political institution of ownership, which also encouraged personal responsibility – personal responsibility in the sense that people feel responsible and, so to speak, also use what they have to contribute to the public good.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, incentives – and in this case it has mainly been prices that have provided the necessary incentives. The proposal that is currently on the table, however, mainly targets this price gap, this price system, and attempts to achieve an internalisation of external costs through various measures. That makes sense, but that is also what is difficult about it, because naturally, we need an overall political and socio-political consensus here if we want to artificially influence prices that form the market. That, I believe, is the great challenge.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fifthly, of course, there are regulations, and in this regard, I have to say that creating regulations makes sense. It is just that I feel that at European level, we should concentrate primarily on implementation and to a lesser extent on new regulations, so that we do not overshoot the target as a result of too much red tape.</p>

      <p sl="pl">… thanks to the ease of obtaining energy. At the same time, sources of energy and raw materials have been depleted. Our societies’ consumption and prosperity have increased significantly. However, the continued growth of the world’s population with the current consumption model will give rise to a number of challenges. This involves not only the now widely-advertised problems of climate change, but also problems which need to be resolved rationally on the basis of efficient resource use and a different consumption model in order to allow the world’s inhabitants to develop harmoniously.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a global trend in countries with economies based on raw materials to expand processing of raw materials and to shift to higher value added production. Hence, China prefers to process lanthanide elements at home, and the current Russian slogan ‘raw materials for modernisation’ is now out of date.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The relocation of energy-intensive industries will impoverish Europe yet further. So what should we do to use available mineral resources, water, the forest, soil and even air more efficiently? Firstly, we must use raw materials more efficiently and support innovation in the fields of substitute materials and technologies and recycling, as already mentioned. Secondly, own resources should be used and managed effectively in the interest of local communities, who should benefit from their natural resources. Thirdly, economic and fiscal instruments and a protective tariff policy should be established in the European Union in order to increase the competitiveness of its Member States. Finally, and fourthly, the Commission should pay attention to the harmful effects of multinational corporations and the economic protectionism practised by some members of the WTO.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mr Gerbrandy for the sound piece of work that he has presented here. I can also support much of what is in the report. I consider it a good thing that we are making the effort to say that we have to overcome the obstacles in the internal market when it comes to removing barriers to the exploitation of resources and the exchange of resources. I also feel, however, that a lot of things that have been said here are not quite correct. I feel I must briefly mention these.</p>
      <p sl="de">Jan, the price of copper is not going up because copper is becoming more scarce, neither are the costs of raw materials at AkzoNobel and Unilever going up because the raw materials are becoming scarcer. Instead, it is because we are printing so much money, and because a lot of money is looking for safe investments and increasingly it does not find these in government bonds – which is why much of it is ending up in the commodity markets. That is one reason why prices of raw materials are rising; not so much because we are about to completely run out of some raw materials and they will no longer be available. I think we need to look more carefully at the causes here. It generally has little to do with a scarcity of resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two things in the report that I find hard to stomach and that I consider to be sending out completely the wrong signals. The first is the call to extend the scope of the Ecodesign Directive. We should stick with the principle that we will find the best solutions through competition and not by political edict – we have already heard the term ‘eco-diktat’ used in this context. The second point is that we in Europe, which is no longer growing and is facing catastrophic developments, should call for new taxes in order to manage our resources.</p>

I would simply remind you that the central bank – this has nothing to do with this debate, but I have been asked the question so I must answer it – printed EUR 1 billion in the months of December and February in order to ease liquidity bottlenecks in the countries of southern Europe. In my opinion, it is apparent that we are on the way to losing price stability. I also think that this policy risks exacerbating the situation in the commodity markets, because a lot of money is flowing into precious metals and commodities there, since some investors see them as safe havens or want to make speculative transactions there too.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would sincerely like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gerbrandy, for his excellent work. Improving resource efficiency – in other words, creating well-being by using natural resources less – is simply vital if we want industrial societies to be able to continue to exist.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is a welcome move by Mr Potočnik, European Commissioner for the Environment, that he has made the issue a special area of his work, and the Commission’s road map is also a welcome development. Rather less appealing is the fact that, for more than two years, no concrete proposal on the issue has been forthcoming from the Commission. For example, no progress whatsoever has been made in extending to the EU as a whole the practice of charging a deposit to improve the recycling of metal beverage packaging. This works very well, at least in my country.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Most of the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety deals with the call for clear and measurable indicators and sectoral targets. We all now know that these are needed if something is actually going to happen. If targets are only very general, they will remain mere words. It is important to be able to reduce the use of natural resources, especially virgin natural resources, in absolute terms. It is not enough to cut the consumption of natural resources in proportion to the volume of production if, at the same time, overall consumption of natural resources still increases.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Many measures are required, and one of these is improved recycling. It is contradictory and irrational to make a lot of political speeches in which people express their concern about the availability of rare earths, even though, at the same time, we recycle less than 1% of them. For example, one tonne of recycled electronic equipment may contain 15 times more gold than a tonne of standard gold ore. A tonne of recycled mobile phones might therefore save 15 tonnes of gold ore, and many other ores besides.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The other side of the coin of the wasteful use of natural resources is the mining boom, something that is also evident in my country, and which will soon make the landscape look like Swiss cheese, especially in the north. Unfortunately, some mines have become notorious for causing emissions in the environment that are many times, or even many hundreds of times, greater than their authorised values. Everything that we can do to improve resource efficiency and step up recycling will also reduce all the environmental harm associated with mining.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, in recent times, the European Parliament has approved a number of reports aimed at improving the efficiency of resource consumption throughout our part of the world, including by minimising food waste. These are sensible initiatives that will enhance cooperation in Europe as we move towards more sustainable development, including better utilisation of our shared resources. However, why should the EU decide how the Member States become more resource-efficient? This report contains requirements concerning common transition to tax and waste systems as well as requirements concerning the use of public funding. In my view, tax and waste systems fall within the competence of the Member States and should not be dictated in an EU report; instead, they should be tailored to local, regional and national circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="da">The report calls for subsidies in the EU to be phased out. That is a good idea. At the same time, however, it calls for additional spending and sets a number of requirements, which is why I cannot vote in favour of the report. Yet the report also contains good proposals, including the call for best practice as regards available scientific data in order to speed up the transition to a resource-efficient economy. I am therefore also unable to vote against it, and in the end I am going to abstain. I share the vision of a resource-efficient Europe, but it needs to happen with fewer state subsidies and by tidying up existing regulations. I would also like to see the report comment on exports of EU waste to third countries, including plastic waste that should stay in the EU for reprocessing so as to create local jobs and reduce imports of raw materials.</p>

I agree that we must radically improve the use of secondary materials and create the right incentives for reducing and recycling waste. We must make resource efficiency and sustainability a top priority in innovation programmes, both at European and at national level. Only by consuming in a more sustainable manner, reducing waste and improving the collection and sorting of waste can we contribute to our own well-being and that of our planet. A more efficient use of waste is an integral part of the green economy. The EU should use its political and economic strength to pull other parts of the world in the same direction. In order to ensure our own well-being and give future generations the possibility to enjoy the same benefits, we must use resources within our boundaries.</p>

The open economy is growing and new, above all, sustainable jobs can be created by a resource-efficient economy. We need to deal with some areas to which we have not devoted sufficient attention in the past, such as the growing global population and the accompanying increasing food consumption, as well as sustainable management of our ecosystems.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore support the calls for sustainable and resource-efficient management of food consumption, natural resources and materials.

      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, our economy and our industry in Europe depend on resources and raw materials, the prices of which are become increasingly unstable and access to which is becoming uncertain in a context of fierce international competition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These include, for example, rare earths, which are necessary for many new technologies, and of which China holds almost all the mining potential. In order to protect not only our industrial competitiveness but also our environment, it is imperative that we learn how to be less dependent on these resources by developing innovation and recycling.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union must move towards a real circular economy, in which extending the life cycle of materials would be a priority, from the product design stage right through to the re-use and recycling of waste. With a view to efficiency, recovering energy from waste must also be promoted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must also turn to the sustainable exploitation of resources, the potential of which is still too often underestimated. I should like to emphasise the importance of the natural capital represented by forest resources. Timber is a renewable energy source and an ideal, healthy and natural building material.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Faced with the dynamism of emerging powers, we must adopt a more proactive and more imaginative attitude in the use of resources so that we can return to growth. The European Union must encourage its enterprises to create more innovative and more sustainable products. It must also exert an influence on the behaviour of consumers by empowering them. I therefore support the experiments in progress on the environmental impact labelling of products, the aim of which is to give Europeans credible information on the environmental impact of their consumption choices.</p>

During the second half of 2010, 44 million people were forced into poverty due to the rise in food prices. These events are not only caused by the shortage of resources, but also by their inefficient distribution or by speculation on the commodities markets.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Against this background, the European Union must work on devising a global system for using and distributing global resources. This is why I call on the European executive to pursue the inclusion of environmental standards and the fair trade principle on the agenda of the World Trade Organisation. Continuing the efforts to reduce and eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers preventing the trade in green goods and services also marks an important step towards greater resource efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I would like to remind you that speculation on raw materials has a direct impact on the lives of millions of people, causing poverty and hunger. This is why I think that an urgent ban on this practice is an absolute must.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, before anything else, I wish to thank Mr Gerbrandy for an excellent report, and, in the main, I definitely agree with what he has to say.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am especially pleased that the importance of recycling and the re-use of materials lies right at the heart of this report. If we look at the recycling of waste in Europe at present, there are still countries in which 100% of household waste ends up as landfill, and in that sense we in Europe all have a lot to do in this area.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is also excellent that the report devotes attention to the recycling of food waste. If we think about the food chain and its resource efficiency, this is a particularly crucial issue.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Mr Gerbrandy’s report also highlights the role of renewable natural resources, such as forests, in resource efficiency. I would say that the use of forests, in particular, including the promotion of timber construction and wood products, is of major importance when we discuss the recycling of natural resources.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Gerbrandy, ladies and gentlemen, let me express my sincere thanks to Mr Gerbrandy for this report. The message that this debate and our resolution should send out to the public, to the economy and to the Member States is that there is great cooperation between the Commission, particularly Mr Potočnik, and this Parliament on the matter of resource efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think we have all known the key facts for a long time. We know that – in relative terms – Europe is more dependent on imported resources than other regions. We know that we could become much more economically dynamic if we could forge ahead with resource efficiency. We know – the Commission has repeatedly told us all – that we could create up to 3 million jobs by taking resource efficiency seriously. The crucial point is whether this knowledge will result in action. That depends on governance, and it depends on the Commission and Parliament, but also, in particular, on the Member States and the economy and other players working together sensibly. If we are honest, that is where we get stuck.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not know if my list is too incomplete, but so far I have found four Member States that have resource efficiency plans that can be taken even half seriously: the Netherlands since 2010, Austria in January, Germany and, most recently, in March, the United Kingdom. Only one Member State, and that is Germany, has so far discussed it at cabinet level at all. That is not exactly a strong showing. The Member States have hardly covered themselves in glory in the Environment Council, where, in part, they blocked the Commission’s proposals.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us then be ambitious, and let us say clearly – I would like to repeat this message – trust yourselves to lead, or at least set an example, or else get out of our way.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, currently, the average EU citizen generates about six tonnes of waste. This is clearly unacceptable and I support measures to encourage more recycling and reusing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, we have come a long way. In the UK, 40% of household waste is recycled, compared to 11% ten years ago. The rapporteur has made some useful suggestions, but his report contains some impractical recommendations such as the general ban on landfill waste. The rapporteur wants all Member States to introduce a landfill tax. This House needs to learn that taxation is not the solution to every problem. I believe our resources should be managed in an environmentally sound manner. However, we need to set realistic targets with a gradual transition away from landfill. These decisions, more importantly, need to be made at Member State level.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to draw the House’s attention to the provision which talks about cutting greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 95% compared to 1990 levels. It is entirely right to propose rational consumption and restrained use of the earth’s resources, including energy, but these proposals cannot be made in isolation from economic and social realities. My country, Poland, has made enormous sacrifices and borne enormous costs as a result of cutting carbon dioxide emissions. I believe that our work and the measures we take should take this into account, since the economic crisis which we are experiencing calls for growth, but growth cannot be achieved in opposition to rational grounds and arguments. This also leads to social problems which could prevent any growth in the future. The evidence tells us that we should not be naive in a situation where the global powers with the highest carbon dioxide emissions, namely the USA, China and India, are not following in our footsteps.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, what we are discussing – the connection between environmental protection and economic growth – is certainly a central issue, on which there is a broad consensus at all levels. More efficient use of resources is essential. It is absolutely our duty to ensure a form of development that meets the needs of present generations, but without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I am firmly convinced that what is needed is to promote a culture. For that reason, I am concerned about some rather too dirigiste aspects that already stood out in the Commission proposal and are overly accentuated by the work of the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="it">Many points have already been mentioned; I am worried, for example, about shifting the burden of taxation away from labour to the environment. I believe that, in the absence of a comprehensive impact assessment, not least at a macro-economic level, such a measure could merely aggravate the already heavy tax burden on European taxpayers. The rapporteur, Mr Florenz, has already talked about eating habits. I do not believe it is our duty to tell our citizens whether or not to eat animal protein, but I find it significant that the European Parliament has come out against food wastage, given that some 20% of food is disposed of as refuse. It is therefore my hope that a truly more constructive and realistic approach will be taken.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe it is our duty, first and foremost, to support proposals aiming to facilitate access by small and medium-sized enterprises to innovative technologies, with an emphasis on research and innovation. However, we must also work with the help of the productive sector: clear and reliable indicators on resource efficiency are absolutely essential, and they should be based not only on economic assessments but also on precise scientific knowledge.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, on the subject of timeframes: where I come from, in Italy, there is a saying: ‘The hasty cat gave birth to blind kittens’. Let us make sure we do not go too fast!</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – Mr President, Ms Gardini, simply so that I understand you correctly: if, as the Commission proposes, the taxation of labour is reduced and this is replaced with taxation of resources, how then does this increase the burden on citizens? That is what I did not understand. My second question to you is: if it is a fact that labour productivity has risen much faster than resource productivity, why are we inhibiting our economy instead of pushing forward with resource productivity?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, shadow rapporteur, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. That is what you could say about resource conservation. Everyone wants to move in the right direction, but how do we get there? Voluntary measures – as we have seen time and time again, in the automotive industry, in other areas – have been a resounding failure. Resource efficiency and the conservation of resources are an element of foreign policy, security policy, health policy, environmental policy, economic policy, agricultural policy – they affect all areas. Looking at the empty Council benches, I can only say that I am astonished that the Council is not here today, but perhaps things will take a bit longer, because they are missing something today – namely, the presentation and debate on a very, very good report by Mr Gerbrandy. This topic is by no means dealt with yet, and this matter will decide whether Europe lives in prosperity in future and what our environment in Europe will look like. It is now a matter of finding the instruments.</p>
      <p sl="de">The internalisation of external costs – there is no way around it: this principle must be introduced. Anyone who pollutes water or air must pay for it. At the moment, we pay for it via our health insurance or through other areas – we are paying for it with our taxes, Ms Gardini. This has to be internalised, and here we need to be courageous for once, because only then will we deal with the future challenges that we face.</p>
      <p sl="de">A growing world population – not in Europe, we will get smaller in the future – is a huge challenge, and therefore this report that Mr Gerbrandy has produced is a good starting point for considering new political strategies, and that applies to the Commission, too. We have to think in terms of life cycles – instead of simply regulating what comes out of the exhaust, we also need to look at the factory where the car is manufactured. Is that sustainable, does it conserve resources? We must think in terms of complete cycles and be courageous about this and not stick with the status quo – because if we do, we will pay very, very dearly for it.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Gerbrandy on an excellent report. The transition to a resource-efficient economy is inevitable and necessary. In 2050, the global population will reach 9 billion people and each of them will strive for a better life. As indicated by the Commission, at the current rate of resource use, in 2050, the equivalent of two Earths will be needed to sustain the world’s population.</p>
      <p sl="it">The case for ensuring each and every European policy is resource-efficient is therefore also economic. Member States must remove all obstacles to the market in waste recycling and reuse and provide economic incentives to promote innovative technologies for the collection and separation of waste. It is right to get to zero waste by banning landfill and phasing out the incineration of recyclables.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have to agree on indicators for resource use in economic activity, in other words, our footprint on the planet, our water footprint, our materials footprint and our carbon footprint. These indicators have to be used to promote legislative initiatives for sustainable development and less use of resources.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, a balanced raw materials policy should be based on at least three pillars – the first of which is efficiency, the second recycling, and the third the sustainable use of resources. Unfortunately, the report presented to us does not respect this balance, and is tilted in one direction. It is strongly biased in favour of efficiency. Even worse, it wants to use taxation instruments to shape the European Union’s raw materials policy. Not only special taxes on raw materials are being proposed, but also special changes to the VAT system.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These instruments will obviously affect the competitiveness of our industry. We cannot agree to the European Commission being encouraged to work on solutions involving the taxation of raw materials. The proposed total ban on landfilling waste is similarly ideological and divorced from technological and industrial reality. This report is inconsistent with the findings of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, with the opinions of the European Commission and industry recommendations, and therefore will not be supported by our group.</p>

    <intervention id="3-447-000" speaker_id="96753" name="Jolanta Emilia Hibner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work. I feel obliged to highlight several new provisions which have compelled me to propose certain necessary amendments. We all agree on the need to use our resources sparingly and rationally. However, all measures must be focused on strengthening Europe’s industry and its economic growth. The development of green public procurement is necessary and requires further work, but in times of crisis, it cannot involve additional administrative costs. It is acceptable to introduce a legal ban on landfills, but there must be an indication of the maximum recyclable share of waste which may be used as raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is bad timing to introduce additional financial burdens in the form of an environmental tax during a crisis. Accordingly, we should postpone its introduction until better times. The proposal to reduce animal protein intake and the resulting transformation of our agriculture into a fruit and vegetable paradise gives rise to similar concerns. The introduction of new legal provisions must also be based on the technical and technological solutions available, and the proposal to bring residual waste close to zero is, in my view, an idealistic approach which does not translate into real life.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to add a few words about the call for environmental information relating to mass consumer goods. I say yes to consumer information, but information which is clear and necessary, and does not create chaos. In my view, the report contains a range of very important observations, but it fails to cover a number of important issues relating to the current crisis in Europe. We must wait and see how work progresses and what possibilities there will be for creating new working conditions for current generations.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, resource efficiency is essentially about becoming better at doing more with less. It also opens up opportunities for new jobs and new growth, in other words, long-term sustainable growth which is climate-friendly and environmentally sound and which, for this very reason, is in the process of becoming an important competitive factor.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This report deals primarily with investments in innovation and research. For example, the report states that subsidies for businesses which harm the environment must come to an end. This is a very good proposal and it does not come a day too soon. It forms a sound basis for a change in course, new investments and new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The work on the European Parliament’s raw materials strategy also made it clear that resource efficiency has a direct link to security of supply. European industry is dependent on metals, minerals and other raw materials. Developing ideas such as urban mining also involves establishing new industries. Most importantly, however, we are helping existing industries to access the raw materials they need. This is all about making careful use of resources. We need to use the assets that we have in an intelligent way. Therefore, this report makes an important contribution to the ongoing discussion and to future action. At the same time, it is clear that we need a more in-depth debate on the consequences of the tax shift or, in other words, the redistribution of tax from work to the environment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, last year, my group welcomed both the Commission road map and December’s Council conclusions on resource efficiency, and we were broadly supportive of the decision to draw up this own-initiative report, despite reservations on the number of own-initiative reports being drafted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. So I pay tribute to the efforts of the rapporteur but, yet again, I find that the report offers only a lengthy and at times disjointed catalogue of demands and not a clear and definitive, achievable strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">In a report which attempts to list absolutely everything anyone thought of, there are inevitably many areas I cannot agree with, amongst them environmental taxation, the implication that agriculture has only negative impacts, and the lack of clear and agreed definitions for so many concepts such as harmful environmental subsidies.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, as it says in the resolution that we are dealing with, the challenges that are facing our planet with respect to natural resources are very clear. That is why long-term measures and planning are important, and the Commission has rightly made the efficient use of natural resources a key component of the Europe 2020 strategy. The worldwide increase in the population, the fact that the number of middle-class consumers has almost doubled, and the growing need for food production are bringing about a situation that has to be resolved in a sustainable way and as soon as possible. Europe is no exception, and the resolution we have to vote on tomorrow is a timely one for us.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Using natural resources as efficiently as possible will increase the EU’s competitiveness and help preserve the environment and biodiversity, and it will have an important role in the transition to a low carbon industry. We must, however, be prudent when we decide on the measures that will ensure that our natural resources are used as sustainably, and also as efficiently, as possible. For this reason, I do not support the need for new legislative initiatives, as proposed in the report. On the contrary, we should now be effectively implementing the laws and legislative acts that exist.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The danger is, and this has already happened in our policy on climate change, that we will create a legislative jungle, where overlap will make the achievement of the goal itself not just impossible, but also expensive. The resolution also goes too far in proposing practical measures on the ‘one size fits all’ principle. For example, local circumstances need to be taken into account in matters of waste. Incineration may, in some situations, be necessary, and even useful, from the perspective of energy supply. Similarly, the proposals to raise environmental taxation or to introduce new taxes do not apply everywhere, and those countries that are rich in natural resources will not be keen on them.</p>

That has annoyed me ever since I joined the European Parliament. However, I will use my time for the subject in hand.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Potočnik, you quite rightly described the 2050 energy road map as a great transformation for our economy and society, for production and consumption. For this great transformation, you need all the players, and at all levels. I think it is good that you are establishing a platform for resource efficiency in Brussels. We ought to have the same thing at the level of the Member States and the regions, right down to municipalities. My question is this: do you have a plan for this?</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Bütikofer rightly asked about resource efficiency plans. That is the same subject. For climate protection, we have the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). Naturally, we also need resource efficiency plans here. Do you intend to present this to the Member States?</p>
      <p sl="de">Then, of course, you will need all the other portfolios. I will simply mention the finance ministers – this has already been mentioned: the phasing out of environmentally harmful subsidies, the incorporation of external costs into our tax system. How can we win over the finance ministers and, not least, the ministers for economic affairs? We need new business models that reward sustainability and not the consumption of resources. For that, we need to think about something new with the ministers for economic affairs.</p>

I have just said myself that technology is not always the deciding factor and that, sometimes, new business models, might be. Can you imagine that a new model might be a lease model, for example, where you no longer buy products and instead hire them and, in that way, create a service-based society where ownership of the product remains with the producer and where it also returns to the producer?

The manufacturer produces something, does not deal with the waste, the product goes to the consumer and perhaps also ends up being thrown away. That is no longer acceptable. We need a new business model in which the manufacturer is responsible – from production through to recovery, to recycling. Then, I believe, there will be new designs for products. There are new responsibilities for recirculation. That is the direction we must move in.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, we can think up and envisage lots of things, but the fact is that the world’s population is growing; energy, soil, water and food are becoming more and more scarce; and the world has to change. We have to manage our scarce resources taking into account the entire life cycle, from the extraction of the raw materials, through transport, assembly and consumption, to recycling or then disposal. It has to become more sustainable and more efficient, and resource efficiency is an important part of our strategy for economic growth and for the creation of jobs in the years ahead.</p>
      <p sl="de">The individual political aims of the strategy must, however, also be coherent in themselves. The often heard call for valuable agricultural land to be set aside is not compatible with resource conservation and sustainable usage, and neither is the sealing of surfaces. Already today, farmers are talking of areas being eaten away.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, it is irresponsible to stop the production of food in our climatically favoured regions. Sustainable agriculture in Europe is making an important contribution to resolving the great challenges of the 21st century. It serves to secure the world’s food supply and provides renewable raw materials, while at the same time maintaining our cultural landscape that has been created by generations, as well as biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="de">The strategy itself must meet efficiency requirements. This includes, above all, not constantly seeking out more calculations, more requirements, but instead using and implementing the existing laws and regulations better and more effectively. Labour, as a resource, must also be used efficiently and prudently. Drawing up ever new statistics based on ever new indicators results in more bureaucracy, ties up labour and, in the end, costs energy and money – and that is not efficient.</p>

In other words, I do not understand why they cannot come on board in this area, because I feel that our main task here is to take on a dual responsibility: responsibility for the generation that is alive here and now, but also for future generations. We can only do that if we are careful with these types of energy, these recyclables, these resources.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that the present energy road map indicates a great many opportunities where we cannot just increase economic performance in Europe, as indicated in the heading, but also ensure a sustainable quality of life. What I cannot understand at all is the panic and fear that is the constant response when such taxes are mentioned. As far as I am concerned, taxes contribute to quality of life. In German, at least, the word for taxes incorporates the word for steering. In other words, taxes allow me to quite deliberately steer things in such a way as to fulfil our political mandate – namely, to create quality of life for the people throughout Europe, in all regions. Taxes are instruments that I can use to help funds to be used where they are needed. As we have already heard today: according to the polluter pays principle. However, taxes must also be fair. That is a crucial factor for me, and I believe we need to thank Mr Gerbrandy today for his report.

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, approximately 24.8 million people in Europe are currently unemployed. Of these, as many as 5.5 million are young people, so the question arises as to whether this is the right topic for us to be debating.</p>
      <p sl="sl">It is, in my opinion, because it is very much tied up with the health of the economy. The economy must have raw materials at a time when it needs them and at a price that will allow it to be competitive. At the present moment, because our continent is not exactly rich in raw materials, we need to be all the more rational about managing them.</p>
      <p sl="sl">But what does rational use of raw materials mean? In my opinion, no proposal in this report which would result in us eating less, driving less, making less or increasing taxes is acceptable. The only solution is efficient use of raw materials and we need to view such efficient use as an opportunity, as an opportunity for developing new industries, starting up new businesses and creating new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="sl">These proposals were made years ago and, tomorrow, the European Parliament will adopt its opinion after several months’ deliberation on this initiative. I am flagging this up because we have recently heard voices suggesting that we have only been talking about saving the economy and that we have forgotten about recovery. No, we have not; it has just been pushed to the margins of the media.</p>
      <p sl="sl">At the moment, we do not need another new treaty in order to provide an impetus to the economy. People do not need it. To give an impetus to the economy, we need to start implementing the promises we have made as soon as possible. We also need to draw up a multiannual European budget in proportion to our needs and our substantive policies and priorities.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Finally, sending out a message to people that a low budget is a good budget is not a good idea. It should be high enough to enable us to implement development policies. Some good measures have already been included in this report, such as implementation of legislation, the setting up of robust, clear and measurable indicators and incentives designed to promote research and technological innovation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, it is not that simple or easy to identify the response to the challenges which our society is facing in terms of resource efficiency. This is why I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteur and all those who helped finalise this report. What is important now is that we know specifically what we have to do and know where we want to be, but we still have to galvanise ourselves into achieving our proposed targets within a reasonable time.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There is still a great deal to do at national and local level. If we simply take the management of urban waste in Member States, the situation varies greatly. There are Member States which have completely stopped dumping urban waste in landfills, such as Germany and the Netherlands, countries which have a very high rate for recycling municipal waste, such as Belgium or Sweden, or countries which have a fairly low recycling rate, as is the case with Romania. On this point, I would like to add that the new Romanian Government has also included among its priorities the adoption of a strategy and national plan for waste management.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is clear to see what an important role national and local administrators play in accepting the new guidelines from the European agenda, as well as in devising methods and procedures for implementing the necessary changes in the shortest time possible. It is vital for us to have the general public on our side and that more and more people are proactive. I believe in sustainable consumption and in the importance of recycling and reducing waste to a minimum. This is the right direction in which we ought to be heading.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, the European Commission has given us a sound basis for a good report. I congratulate the rapporteur and the Commissioner for their efforts and for soldiering on in the right direction. We obviously share the belief that we cannot rely on sustained growth without a transition to a more efficient use of natural resources.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Among the sound general guidelines, I welcome primarily an integrated and planned approach, which necessarily concerns legislators, producers, managers, educational institutions and civil society. I am particularly pleased with the call for the setting up of a system of indicators for an efficient use of natural resources. Without them, we would not be able to measure the progress of our efforts.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I also support the plan to integrate resource efficiency targets into the European Semester on economic policy coordination. Equally, I support the plan to abolish all environmentally harmful subsidies.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I firmly believe that efficient use of natural resources will not only mean a more responsible attitude to nature, but that it will also bring new jobs, new technologies and new impetuses for development.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I welcome the readiness to remove barriers to the functioning of the European recycling market.</p>
      <p sl="sl">This is the first time we have spoken in a report in favour of cutting down the intake of animal protein. This is not only about reducing land use, but also about reducing the harmful effects of animal protein on health.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, we have before us a report by Mr Gerbrandy, whom I should congratulate. Together with the road map, these may be the two best examples that show us the path we should and want to take in Parliament, and in the Commission as well, it seems.</p>
      <p sl="es">That path, however, is full of obstacles that are sometimes referred to as ‘crises’, or ‘austerity’, and at other times even as ‘subsidiarity’ – which is also being used as an obstacle – or ‘impossible taxation’.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should be clear on this. With this report, we are saying ‘enough is enough’; we have to learn from our mistakes, and there should be no more talk of obstacles. The best way to achieve what we want – sustainable development – is to be more efficient, to make better use of resources and not plunder them as we have done so far.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, if we really do want an EU based on sustainable development, we call on the Presidency and the Commissioner to do the following: apply the taxes that are being suggested here; establish corrective measures to prevent the impact of austerity from bringing higher prices and food crises which, as always, hit the poor hardest; consider reduced VAT rates for secondary materials, because every little helps when it comes to reaching our goal of 100% recycling; help change the model by shifting the tax burden from the income derived from work to the income from speculative capital and to those activities that are less sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="es">In short, we are calling for them to be proactive, committed and demanding. Some Member States are cutting back on research, renewable energies and health care, as Spain is doing, which is slowing down the Europe 2020 agenda.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Potočnik, you should demand more from them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, one of the most important things for Europe in the future is to remain economically competitive. That will improve the quality of life for our citizens and make us more powerful and more influential on the world stage. As of now, we are too dependent on imports of resources and we need to look at what we have ourselves and develop it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, we should try to eliminate the huge amount of waste that takes place from households right across the spectrum. I think the conditions are there now to really work on this. I know that from my own country, coming through the primary school into the secondary school, they have things such as the green flag. Students are coming through now who have an appreciation of the environment and climate change and are willing to play their part in recycling. I think now is the time to really home in on this and make ourselves more efficient in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Agriculture obviously is a huge area. Particularly, we need to develop a very strongly resourced CAP to ensure that we have security of food supply and also that everything is done in as environmentally friendly a way as possible. Energy, of course, is essential. While people will have reservations about certain types of energy, particularly coal because it is highly polluting, nevertheless we need to keep an open mind, particularly on shale gas, and also develop bio-energy – wave, wind and tidal, which all have potential that we can develop hugely.</p>
      <p sl="en">That brings me to the importance of research. Horizon 2020 gives us the opportunity to do research into these areas and become world leaders in them, utilising the natural resources we have in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I just want to mention the blue economy. A few weeks ago, we had a demonstration in Brussels outlining the vast potential offered by the sea in creating all sorts of energy resources in terms already mentioned – wave, tidal and wind – but also in terms of foodstuffs and other areas as well.</p>

It is, moreover, logical, given that European citizens consume, on average, sixteen tonnes of goods, of which six tonnes end up in the rubbish bin. The cost is enormous.</p>
      <p sl="el">I know that many colleagues react to these ideas, but I do not know why. We are faced with the problem of a huge economic crisis which we cannot resolve simply – if at all – by reducing low wages and pensions. We must stop importing products and goods that end up in the rubbish bin. Therefore, Commissioner, please continue with your initiative even more pro-actively, with binding targets.</p>

      <p sl="en">To avoid this, I think this Commission proposal for a resource-efficient Europe is a good start, but we definitely need to move forward. We need broad definitions of resources so that all ecosystem services are included. We need better integration of resource efficiency into our growth strategies. We need indicators in our budgets both at EU and national levels. We also need to include, as proposed, a compulsory element as a growth strategy in the European Semester and in macro-economic indicators. We need to abolish environmentally harmful subsidies and, yes, we need an effective ecodesign directive that has rules on the resource-use footprint, recyclability and a resource-efficiency index. It is crucial to have all products included. I would like to encourage the Commission to act boldly on this and to have this growth discussion included also.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, based on the excellent material prepared by the Commission, we are discussing a very good report right now. In the context of resource efficiency, I would primarily like to point out the matter of water and waste management.</p>
      <p sl="hu">2012 is also the year of water policy review. The EU has an enormous deficit in the field of water management and water recycling compared, for example, to Israel, and I therefore find it very important that we take steps to settle the water-related problems of the Mediterranean region or Central Europe and the area between the Rivers Danube and Tisza, for that matter.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As far as waste management is concerned, I agree with those who argue that depositing recyclable waste should be banned altogether. It is unfortunate that my home country, Hungary, is going against European efforts in the field of waste management. Our right-wing government has entirely abolished the country’s previous waste management system, and unfortunately, the Commission has therefore launched an infringement procedure against Hungary.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, the hard work has been done, because we could liken the situation of resources in Europe to someone who has developed a chronic disease. This individual has to change his or her way of life completely. Some are able to do so and they even reach an above-average age, while others surrender to the dictates of pleasure and give in to the disease, which quickly takes its toll in the form of decreased well-being and a shorter lifespan.</p>
      <p sl="sl">It is hard, and yet essential, to understand that we need to create more in times of crisis, that we need to increase growth while at the same time expending fewer resources. Sustainable economic growth will be more possible in real terms in times of crisis than at a time of plenty. History teaches us that times of plenty actually inhibit creativity.</p>
      <p sl="sl">It is important to assess the measurable and understandable effects that every European, man or woman, can achieve by changing their lifestyles. This is also the biggest opportunity for us, politicians, to engage the whole of society, and it throws the doors wide open for researchers and innovators.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Europe is a prime location for a hub of research activity because of its companies, knowledge, well-developed markets and, in particular, its ability to cope with complexity. Integration, innovation and rational use of resources will reduce our dependence and create new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, our economy is in constant crisis, and natural resources are shrinking, which is why the European Union now faces the challenge of providing access to critical resources and their continuous supply. It is time to rethink our habits, because a more sensible use of resources not only helps to protect the environment, but also helps to save money and to reduce costs in industry. The idea is to do more with less. It is impossible to continue to use our current resource management model.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As a result of these changes, increasing the efficiency of resource use is a key issue for ensuring economic growth and more jobs in Europe. It will create broad economic opportunities as well as improving productivity, reducing costs and contributing to competitiveness. I am pleased that the report focuses on stimulating the development of technological innovation, boosting employment in the quickly developing green energy sector, and supporting trade in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, I believe that an ambitious plan is not sufficient, and I welcome and support Mr Gerbrandy’s opinion that bureaucracy should be reduced. I believe that no new legislation should be created, but instead that the existing legislation should be used effectively. It is equally important to set goals which are realistic for all Member States. Standards which are too high and which would be impossible for certain Member States to fulfil would mean the strategy no longer had the advantage of being feasible, which would be to the detriment of its guiding purpose. Our future depends on how we use resources now, and we thus need a balanced and well-conceived strategy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, in order to overcome the current economic crisis, we need to look for new resources that we can use to guarantee development and progress. We need an ambitious agenda for future growth, providing a higher quality of life. However, the task of stimulating economic performance needs to be based on using resources sensibly and efficiently as they are not limitless. We already know that mineral resources are non-renewable, not to mention that water, soil or air are not infinite either.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are already consuming globally more resources than the Earth can produce, with the industrialised countries, including European states, having the highest per capita consumption rate of resources. In this context, I should stress the importance not only of recycling and reuse, but also of information campaigns to change people’s behaviour.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in recent years, we have seen many crises which have made us aware of the scale of possible problems arising in relation to the availability of resources and their guaranteed and uninterrupted supply. Rapidly increasing food prices or difficulties in accessing rare earth metals are just some examples which have affected the European economy. The problem of the efficient use of resources is one of the key challenges faced by the EU in the near future. It is high time to take the necessary action – most certainly not the establishment of yet more discussion committees, which do not help us to achieve our objectives, but only create yet more unrealised strategies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this situation, we need real initiatives and projects, and I would add: more responsible ones than some of those recommended in the report. With the advantages gained from being forerunners in the rational use of resources, we will be able not only to become more independent of external suppliers, but also to maintain our economic position in the global arena.</p>

I would especially like to highlight the idea of permanent materials in contrast with that of raw materials, and the innovative solutions that are being put forward to impose economic penalties on producers and users for improper use of those raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to waste, I welcome the goal of reducing our waste production and processing waste better, because this will mean formulating concrete, feasible, realistic plans that focus on making better use of recyclable materials and disposing more efficiently of what cannot be used.</p>
      <p sl="es">This means a great deal more than just collecting and transporting. It means promoting a convenient classification system that encourages users, and supporting technologies that create value and innovation out of re-use. It also involves putting an end to landfill. That has to be our future, keeping incineration only for what cannot be re-used.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, industrialised societies are based on the consumption of enormous amounts of energy and mineral resources, which are increasingly scarce. Today, there are strategies for many of these resources, whereby their management should be guided by an overriding wish to safeguard the public interest, taking into account the needs of present and future populations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is indeed an urgent need to reduce consumption, reuse products, recycle and ensure that resources are used efficiently, but processes for doing so cannot be left at the mercy of the markets and their expectations of profitability, as some seem to think. The sustainable and efficient use of resources requires a fundamental change in the current models of production and consumption. For example, we should call into question free trade and the unsustainable flow of energy and materials with which it is associated. There needs to be a focus on local production and consumption, with short supply chains and public transport. It is not worth trying to paint a system green when it has already been shown to be unsustainable.</p>

Perhaps, when we try to appeal to citizens, as the Commissioner suggested, when we try to mobilise them, we need to use less words and make it a little bit friendlier for people. When one reads some of this report, it would paralyse rather than mobilise but I accept your very good intentions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular, around the issues of dietary change and land use, I agree absolutely with paragraph 56 about reducing imported land use. To do that, we need to produce more using less resources within the European Union. I think paragraph 57 is very reasonable on improving consumer awareness, but I am afraid that paragraph 52 is less so. I think perhaps we would be better off using fewer words as they did in the 1700s and encouraging all of us – as our parents used to – to ‘waste not, want not’.</p>

      <p sl="ro">However, Member States have different potentials in terms of energy resources. They need to focus on their domestic energy potential. Natural gas will play an important role in the EU’s energy mix, given the new extraction procedures available.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, energy efficiency is subject to the EU’s ability to connect these markets.

Everyone knows that Europe does not have enough natural resources and that it has to manage them much better.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I should say that this has been the first real plenary debate at which I have been present. I very much appreciated it and found it encouraging.</p>
      <p sl="en">While I would like to respond on many of the matters you have discussed – innovation, waterways, agriculture, fisheries, public awareness, indicators, targets, trade integration, ecodesign, food, and so on – I would need too much time. Obviously, the things we are discussing are complex. However, although I am Commissioner for the Environment, allow me to focus briefly on concerns which were raised by some of your colleagues in connection with the economy and the current situation, and why it is so important that the ideas in the Gerbrandy report are supported.</p>
      <p sl="en">To start with the 20th century, that century actually represents the resource-intensive model. The population increased fourfold, economic output increased many, many more times, and the use of any resource you could pick up increased by approximately the same factor. So, in fact, resource prices at that time, if measured by the composite index and with the exception of world wars and the oil crisis, were constantly falling. The recognition that resources are finite was absolutely not present in that model, in which, to some extent, we are still living.</p>
      <p sl="en">This situation is, in many ways, changing. The population is growing. Not only will we reach nine billion in 2050 but, more importantly, as the McKinsey report says, in 2030, we can expect three billion more citizens to be raised from poverty to middle-class consumption. They will have every right to that, but they will not be able to get there if we continue with the model developed in the 20th century.</p>
      <p sl="en">What does that mean for Europe? Europe is extremely import-dependent. Over the past decade and more, the prices of many resources have been going up. That trend is expected by a majority of companies to continue in the next five years – at 85% – and the volatility of those prices is huge. So today, the European business sector is refocusing from labour productivity to resource productivity because that is the area in which businesses see the real opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">In many cases, it is already recognised that energy and raw materials are critical. As for other resources – apart from water and land perhaps – it is not yet recognised in many cases that they are finite. These resources will be the focus of attention for our societies and businesses in the future. Nature is not yet so much in the picture, but it will come. That is the change which we are facing.</p>
      <p sl="en">How is this connected to the story which we are all living through – the story of crisis and of the absolute need for growth and new jobs? As Olli Rehn said in his speech a day ago, if we had a silver bullet, we would already have fired it, but we do not have it so we have to work consistently and patiently. There are some areas in which Europe is strong and in which it could become even stronger. One such area is talent: the knowledge economy, research and innovation. The other major area is resource efficiency. Why? Because using less water, less energy and less raw materials, and producing products which can be reused and recycled makes economic sense. That is the trend which is currently very much present in the economy and in business. So ultimately, we are talking about economic resilience and environmental resilience at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also really appreciate your highlighting the question of urgency and the need for implementation. These are matters to which we also try to draw attention when we talk about economic governance – the so-called semester story. Here too, we emphasise those issues that point in the direction of resource efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="en">As was rightly mentioned by one of your colleagues, taxes are not to be feared. We are proposing no more and no less than the shift of taxation away from labour – and in Europe we have high labour costs – in the direction of, for example, landfill taxation, which makes more sense. The removal of environmentally harmful taxes makes all the more sense at a time when we are trying to tap all the reserves in our public finances. This is not something which we can afford to ignore today. In our discussions with Member States, we know that we bear a responsibility and we are advising them. And, by the way, in the Council conclusions of March 2011, they supported our ideas.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the rest, we are working hard on the implementation of the road map. This year, we will focus heavily on water. We will launch the resource efficiency transition platform within a few days – some of you will be participating in this – and it will bring real political impetus and direction. It will rightly be an important part of the Seventh Environmental Action Programme and, of course, the urgency of implementation is the core consideration.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will be discussing these issues at the Rio+20 conference in just a few days’ time. The conference will not, of course, be about resource efficiency, but rather about the green economy. However, it is the same story. It will not be about Europe, but about global commitments and the world as a whole, because we all understand that these things are necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, if everything was all right with brown growth, we would not be discussing green growth today, but brown growth has inherent limits which are recognised today by the business sector. We, as politicians, should recognise them too. When we talk about green growth, we are actually talking about how to design future growth capable of bringing greater well-being and more benefits to society than brown growth is bringing today. I am not trying to paint a catastrophe scenario because that will not happen: we are intelligent societies and an intelligent species. But a sustainable future, my friends, is simply not a choice. It is inevitable.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, let me begin by expressing my thanks to my colleagues for the wide-ranging support they have shown for my report. It is enormously pleasing to hear. I have listened very carefully and have noticed a very broad consensus around the ultimate goal: more efficient use of resources. However, we do not always agree about the way forward, particularly when it comes to the pace at which we need to go about it.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would just like to say the following on that subject: the speed at which we can afford to move is not determined by us. It is not us in Europe who determine it, but the pace of the world around us. And let us be honest: that pace is so fast that we simply cannot afford not to be very ambitious with this agenda from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There has been some criticism on ecodesign. On that score, I have the following to say: the text we are debating today and on which we will be voting tomorrow is not a legislative one. This is a political text, a political text about the main direction of our future policy. It does not therefore go into detail about how an Ecodesign Directive should be applied, but it does talk about the fact that, when designing our products, we need to take into account that we are able to recover the raw materials contained in them. That is the point. So, this is not a legislative text.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I think the most important thing about this report is that we as Parliament have sent out a very strong political message by which we also support the Commission to continue down the path it has chosen.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We support the Commission in not just continuing down that path, but also in doing so with an agenda that is much more ambitious than the one put forward by Mr Potočnik. An agenda that is about implementation and legislation. It appears from today’s debate that this is a matter of either/or; but it is not, it is about both of those things. We have to get better at implementation, but we also need to move towards new legislation.</p>

Let this be a very strong signal from the European Parliament and the Commission to Member States that we have an ambitious agenda and that we want to move forward, not simply because we think that it is a good idea, but because it is desperately needed for the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Just as financial markets will not wait for our leaders to get ready to save the euro, the world will not wait for us to decide to manage our raw materials more efficiently. We have to do that now, today, not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The only path towards growth and employment in Europe is one based on a resource-efficient Europe, as this will make it more competitive and result in new sources of growth and jobs in various sectors of activity, at a time when these are not being sufficiently exploited within the EU. Moreover, this will result in greater cost savings due to more efficient management of resources, commercialisation and innovative processes over their life cycle. We should follow this path in order to support a Europe that is increasingly efficient and competitive at global level. The EU must make better use of its resources in order to benefit the environment and future economic growth. We have set out ambitious plans to tackle this issue, and it is now up to the Member States to take up the challenge and fight for resource efficiency. The implementation of these plans will mean significant economic growth, job creation and protection of the environment. The Member States should adopt the ‘polluter pays’ principle for taxation, thereby providing an incentive for the protection of the environment and technological innovation. This would also allow cuts to other taxes, including labour taxes. The inefficient and wasteful use of resources should be subject to higher penalties in order to help boost competitiveness, while preserving the environment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The initiative to encourage resource efficiency is included in the Europe 2020 strategy and is one of the principles which will form the basis for the EU measures in the areas of climate change, energy, transport, raw materials, agriculture, fishing, biodiversity and regional development. I should mention that the ever-increasing demand for, and over-exploitation of, natural resources lead to environmental degradation, more rapid climate change, and the destruction of the planet’s finite natural assets, including biodiversity loss.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should stress the importance of research, development and innovation for speeding up the transformation to a resource-efficient Europe. I think that switching the economy to a resource-efficient path will bring about an increase in competitiveness and productivity, and provide new sources of growth and jobs.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I have read the report with interest. However, I would like to point out a few important factors which should be considered in the debate on raw materials in the European Union. I believe that our primary consideration should be to change the current model of production. We should therefore develop three selected areas under this model where raw materials should be reused; namely, food, housing and mobility. The European Commission should set up special working groups in these areas. It is also important for the European recycling system to have resource utilisation rates based on four basic indices, namely land, water, materials and carbon footprint. This would allow a more harmonised and efficient use of resources. Another important issue is to maintain prices for emissions trading, environmental resources and ecosystem services at the level required by states with a lower level of economic development because prices which are too high can mean that low-income social groups are deprived of raw materials. SMEs are a further key issue, since as part of their research and innovation programmes, they can raise funds for the rational use of resources, inter alia, by means of research into new substitute materials.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Growth in global demand is placing more pressure on the environment and igniting competition for resources. Key natural resources such as raw materials, metals, energy, biodiversity and water are being used to support economic growth as if they were inexhaustible. This is unsustainable in the long term, and the EU will probably face serious challenges in securing access to, and the uninterrupted supply of, key resources. More fuels are imported into the EU than into China, and more minerals than into the US. Targets in the areas of biodiversity or energy efficiency are not being met. Reducing dependency on imported resources and making effective use of domestic resources must therefore be a clear political priority, not only from the perspective of the environment, but also with regard to competitiveness and the creation of growth and employment. The current economic, financial and environmental situation only confirms that Europe urgently needs new sources of economic growth. I would therefore like to call again on the EU Member States not to reject binding targets in the area of energy efficiency. The mandatory savings are a big opportunity for restarting the EU economy. I am also in favour of extending the scope of the Ecodesign Directive to products that are not related to energy consumption, to measures for reducing food waste and to the abolition of all subsidies that have a harmful effect on the environment.</p>

      <p sl="en">The need for action on resource efficiency is becoming increasingly urgent as the global population grows and our resources are depleted. One aspect which is particularly important and which deserves special attention is the relationship between water use, food production and food waste. Up to 80% of the water we take from the ground is for agriculture, yet we throw away up to one third of our food. The amount of water and energy which fuels this level of waste is shocking. We know that food waste is produced throughout the supply chain, at producer and retail level, as well as at consumer level. We need urgent action to tackle food waste at all levels. We can invest in all the irrigation technology and green energy we want, but there seems little point if it just produces food which rots on the supermarket shelf or ends up in the kitchen bin.</p>

      <p sl="en">The current economic difficulties are putting an enormous strain on the EU’s limited resources, which is consequently stifling our ability to grow. However, I do not believe that a move towards environmental taxes, particularly an EU tax, is the answer as suggested in the report on a resource-efficient Europe. Similarly, the proposal to strengthen the EU’s waste acquis is not logical as this will merely put more unnecessary pressure on national governments, causing them to shift their focus away from the growth that the EU needs right now. We ought to have a greater focus on research, development and innovation if we are to be true competitors against the rising economic powers of Brazil, Russia, India and China. We need to compete by encouraging our SMEs and removing the obstacles they face, such as accessing credit, and helping them to increase their trade both in Europe and globally. We need to recognise that if we are to achieve the goals of the EU 2020 strategy of a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy, we need to take a global perspective when formulating all policy.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Legislation on resource efficiency in the EU is definitely one of the most important initiatives whose implementation we must support in a systematic, targeted way. There is a long list of rare resources and materials which our countries do not have. This makes us extremely dependent on imports, which threatens not only the development but also the very existence of high-tech sectors that are vitally important to the economy’s competitiveness and to maintaining the high social standard enjoyed by European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The solution is for us to use efficiently the resources we have. This is why I welcome the texts promoting the recycling of waste as an untapped resource of our own, which, in many countries, is simply dumped in landfills, while money is poured into foreign economies for the delivery of the same materials. The need for imports will obviously remain. This is why long-term, mutually beneficial cooperation is needed with resource-rich countries, which requires the EU to draft and adhere to priority policies.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Resource efficiency is a fundamental issue for sustainable growth in the EU. It is a pity that only four countries in the EU currently have national resource-efficiency plans. This situation needs to change quickly. However, I do not accept that the issue should be resolved through new taxes and endless new laws and red tape.</p>

      <p sl="nl">We cannot ignore it any more: apart from an economic, financial and climate crisis, we are heading full-speed towards a commodity crisis. Abundant and inexpensive commodities that we are used to and around which we have organised our consumer society are rapidly becoming scarcer and more expensive.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am therefore very pleased with Mr Gerbrandy’s report, which focuses really sharply on the problems and which maps the routes forward to fight this crisis tooth and nail. In particular, I support wholeheartedly the proposals that call for a better functioning single market with a view to encouraging reuse and recycling, dismantling environmentally damaging subsidies and setting up price instruments so that, in the manufacture of new products, we can make the use of recycled materials more advantageous, for the making of firm agreements, for setting up measurable parameters for resource efficiency and for an ambitious revision of the Ecodesign Directive.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is the only way that Europe will manage raw materials more efficiently. It is good for the environment, but it is also vitally important for the survival of our economy, an economy that urgently needs to be adjusted in order to become more sustainable.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Pervenche Berès, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Youth opportunities initiative (O-000106/2012) – (B7-0113/2012) (2012/2617(RSP)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-489-000" speaker_id="1985" name="Pervenche Berès" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wanted to ask this question, and it did not know at the time that, on the very day on which we were to debate it, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) would bring out global youth unemployment figures, with 75 million young people unemployed and a red card for the European Union, within which 7.5 million young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are currently neither in a job nor in education or training.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union comes bottom of the class worldwide. Yet, when I look at the challenges facing the European Union, throughout the world, here and elsewhere, all day long, we say that Europe must meet the challenge of innovation, that it is innovation, that it is – a phrase I do not like – our human capital which will enable us to win the battle of globalisation. Yet, if that is the diagnosis we are making, how can we leave outside the labour market and exclude an entire generation? It is the whole question of the social impact of this crisis, which is not taken into account, which is neglected, which is regarded as a secondary issue. We are taking a collective risk, the consequences of which we are already seeing in a number of countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Commission therefore set up eight Action Teams in eight of our Member States – Italy, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Latvia, Spain, Lithuania and Slovakia – so that the European Union could mobilise its actions and its teams in these countries in order to meet this challenge in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our questions to you, Commissioner, are therefore as follows. What are your conclusions? What proposals are you making? Where do you stand on this? We will support you whenever useful proposals are made to address this issue. However, we cannot accept the fact that youth unemployment rose from 14.7% in 2008 to 22.1% in 2011 and that, in many of our countries – as we know – almost half of young people are outside the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need what we have defined together as the goals of the EU 2020 strategy, which, it seems to me, has not aged a bit from that point of view, to be followed by actions. Yet, in this strategy – need I remind you – we said that we wanted early school leaving to be reduced to 10% of young people. We said that 40% of 30-34 year-olds would be required to have a qualifying diploma. What is happening in this regard? The proposals are on the table. I have taken note of the conclusions of the Council of 11 May 2012 with regard to strengthening the creative potential and innovation of young people. There is an urgent need for the EU to work towards this end.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When the European Parliament, in particular, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, has examined the report by Jutta Steinruck on the EU programme for social change and innovation, it will submit proposals to you to enable us to finance a Youth Guarantee so that young people, when they leave the school system or when they lose their job, are no more than four months without work, without a training proposal or without an apprenticeship proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those are the elements we want to discuss with you, Commissioner. We are convinced that this issue is a challenge for this generation of young people, the objective being to prevent them from becoming the excluded of tomorrow. However, it is also a challenge for our entire society, for the benefit of which we must take action. Commissioner, I know that, in this regard, we can count on your vigilance and the fact that you are a force for bringing forward proposals. This is a good opportunity to debate these elements and to make forward-looking proposals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in order to address the excessively high, and sometimes even dramatic, levels of youth unemployment in the European Union, the Commission adopted its Youth opportunities initiative last December and this has been endorsed by the European Council. It calls on the Member States to take action in four main areas: preventing early school leaving; developing skills that are relevant to the labour market; helping young people gain their first work experience and on-the-job training; and helping them to access the labour market and get a job.</p>
      <p sl="en">Implementing the initiative may involve three avenues: where possible, reallocating Structural Fund resources; designing effective policy through the European Semester; and taking action at EU level via other initiatives such as a Quality Framework for Traineeships and a Youth Guarantee.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has engaged with the 15 Member States whose youth unemployment rates are above the EU average. It sent eight Action Teams to the Member States with the highest youth unemployment and held bilateral talks with the other seven. The aim was to see what measures should be taken and how the EU funds available could be refocused. This is a pilot exercise involving the Structural Funds, which are subject to shared management. As you know, that means the individual Member States are responsible for using the amounts allocated to them. Overall programming took place at the beginning of the current period and the allocations to the Member States cannot be altered.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the current tight budget situation, EU funds can nevertheless help hugely by supporting national policy efforts. At the end of last year, of the EUR 347 billion in Structural Fund resources for the current programming period, about EUR 82 billion had not been set aside for specific projects, and around EUR 40 billion was still available for the eight Action Team Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Youth employment is a high priority for European Social Fund spending in most Member States. That is why the Action Teams looked at stepping up programmes and measures that are performing well to give young people additional support quickly, and reduce or abandon programmes that are performing less well. The results are encouraging. About EUR 7.3 billion has been reallocated so far. This should benefit at least 450 000 people.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has agreed on practical follow-up with the eight individual Action Team Member States. President Barroso will present the detailed results to the Heads of State or Government at an informal dinner tonight (23 May) in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="en">Likewise, we are now finalising the operational conclusions of bilateral meetings with the seven other Member States involved. Naturally, the Commission is ready to assist other Member States as well in altering the allocation of EU funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the past few weeks, the Commission has been looking at Member States’ national reform programmes under the European Semester. At the end of May, the Commission will put forward proposals for country-specific recommendations. A large number of Member States will receive recommendations on youth employment and related issues, such as education.</p>
      <p sl="en">This year, I will be presenting two other initiatives that are very close to the concerns of this House. These are the quality framework for traineeships and the policy framework for Youth Guarantees. They will provide practical policy guidance for smooth school-to-work transitions and the fair treatment of young people. In December, the Commission will be presenting a comprehensive report on the results of the Youth Initiative one year after it was launched. This will be an opportunity to discuss it with you as well and I will be glad to report to the House.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem of youth unemployment will not disappear overnight and only if we address it with resolve. That is why we made it one of the key priorities for the future Structural Funds programmes. The European Social Fund in particular will be an important instrument for Member States to support schemes to tackle this problem.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are not empty words; Europe is at risk of having a lost generation if we do not act now. We must not close our eyes to the fact that people who have been looking for a job for a long time without success and are trying to plan their lives lose vision and hope for the future. This is happening to precisely those young people who represent the future competitiveness of this continent. I therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, who has put across the essential aspects in very succinct and precise terms. I should like to highlight one thing that also illuminates the fact that there is no time to lose. Whether or not an economic recovery is on its way, structural reforms must take place, because it is still about installing models that have been a success on this continent, such as apprenticeships. Of course, that takes time. The statistics tell a clear story.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to highlight the youth guarantee, but also the permanent qualification of people in lifelong learning which begins in youth, and here, the service sector and the green economy in particular represent a hope for the future and provide potential.</p>
      <p sl="de">We, in politics, bear the responsibility. Let us therefore create a visible added value for our citizens by taking political action. This is a top priority project. Europe must act. We must act. The Commission must act. However, the Member States must also act together with their social partners – and they must do so now.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, the members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament are grateful to you for helping to raise awareness of this major problem among your colleagues in the Commission and Council.</p>
      <p sl="es">As you know, this is a terribly important problem. There are times when it is a genuine tragedy, certainly for those young people who are no longer living but merely surviving, because their hopes and personal projects have been shattered, as have their capability and dream of having a future and becoming citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Ms Berès said, we should not, therefore, be talking so much about the market or about supply and demand. This is a question of fundamental rights that are being violated, not temporarily but structurally, paving the way for a tragedy with unprecedented consequences, not least for our society. It is estimated that the 5.5 million young people who are not working or studying are costing us over EUR 100 billion, which is 10 times the amount it would cost us to establish a proper programme offering them training and employment opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why, Commissioner, I believe that for the countries that your Action Teams have visited, where there is an unmanageable problem, this is no time for words; rather, it is time for action. The future of those young people is our future, and their lack of a future is going to result in the lack of a future for us, as well.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, time for action does not mean talking about words, programmes and recommendations but rather about specific means, instruments and measures. There are eight countries that have no capacity. We have to give them capacity by removing all the budgetary restrictions they currently face. They cannot even access EU programmes because they cannot cofinance them.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have three specific questions, Commissioner. Do those Member States, or does the Commission, intend to reallocate the EUR 22 billion to those Member States facing the greatest difficulties? Can the Commission adjust the cofinancing rate? Lastly, can there be any new financing instruments for those who have no means and who are losing, through austerity measures, the limited means they still have?</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent motion and for the excellent work that you have done.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In Europe right now, there are, in fact, millions of young people who have finished school and, with faith in the future, are beginning to look for employment. While they were studying, many of them were certainly very self-confident, but that self-confidence often starts to wilt when they start job-hunting. Of course, there has always been the belief that there is enough work out there, but nowadays the situation has actually changed. All too familiar are the stories in which young school-leavers send dozens of job applications off to various places, only to receive the answer from some of them that they are, for example, too well-educated for the job, while others – workplaces offering jobs that correspond to the qualifications they hold – might say that the applicants do not have enough work experience, even though they are well qualified.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Perhaps the biggest paradox of all concerns what is being asked of young people today. On the one hand, they are required, within a short period of time, to obtain an education, gain work experience, and perhaps even start a family in the meantime. This is asking far too much at this stage and in society as it is today. On the other hand, we have to remember that the challenges of the labour market have also changed. We no longer do the same job throughout our career: people might have an average of ten jobs in their lifetime and, there again, this poses challenges for educational services and lifelong learning.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is very important that we now take concrete action to discover the key to solving this problem of youth unemployment. The Commissioner mentioned the Structural Funds and the unused Structural Funds, which, in fact, currently amount to EUR 82 billion. It is very important that more use can be made of these – from both the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) – for major concrete measures to reduce youth unemployment. On the other hand, the ball is also largely in the Member States’ court, obviously.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We also need other concrete measures, and I am pleased that the Commissioner also mentioned these. For example, the Youth Guarantee is one such concrete measure that I really hope will be promoted.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This problem of youth unemployment has been spoken about at European level very much and very frequently, but merely stating the problem and complaining about it are now no longer enough. We really have to find the instruments that will actually enable us to develop social structures in such a way that young people can enter the world of work more quickly than before. In addition to social measures, every one of us, of course, will need to be active and genuinely willing to achieve this.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I hardly know where to start. I am extremely, extremely upset that my own generation is possibly the first generation in Europe that will not have a better standard of living than their parents, the first that will not experience Europe as offering progress and opportunities. It really makes me very upset, and I am frustrated at the fact that during the time we have been standing here, throughout all the debates that we have had as a Parliament and with you as Commissioner, youth unemployment has only moved in one direction, and that is up.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, let me try to be a bit more constructive. I would like to start by expressing my thanks for the Commission’s initiatives – both the Youth opportunities initiative and the employment package that you came up with in April. They are the right sort of initiatives. However, I must say two things in this connection. The first is that I do not quite believe that the solutions we are presenting are up to the challenges. The second is that I think we really have to move on from the paper and on to the budgets, because otherwise, young people will not notice us making any difference. To give just one example: this week, you presented ‘Your First EURES Job’. This is a brilliant initiative, but it only affects 5 000 young Europeans, and there are 5.5 million looking for a job. We simply have to find a way to scale it up. We have to make some really extraordinary efforts very soon.</p>
      <p sl="da">I have three questions for the Commissioner. I hope that you will have an opportunity to answer them, either now or later. The first concerns the youth guarantee. I am very pleased that you presented this in your paper. Thank you for that. What are you expecting the Member States to deliver, Commissioner? Are they going to deliver on this and implement it before the end of 2012? Secondly, Commissioner, where do you see young people being given a place in the discussion on growth that is currently going on in Europe? Will young people have a place in a new investment pact, if it comes off at top level between the Heads of State or Government? Thirdly and lastly, Commissioner, if you would like to be part of thinking right outside the box as regards youth unemployment, then I think this House would be happy to join you in trying to make an extraordinary effort for this generation, which right now has very few prospects.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Where we disagree is in the solutions to this problem. I am afraid that declarations, programmes and initiatives are not enough. We must take decisive steps towards a real solution. I therefore have some questions for the Commissioner. Will the Commission propose further liberalisation and the breaking down of legal and administrative barriers to worker mobility in the EU? Is the Commission ready to support deregulation and greater flexibility in employment relations? Is the Commission working on a modernisation of the EURES system? Does the Commission support a reform of education systems aimed at balancing supply and demand on labour markets?</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, there is absolutely no question that the economic recession has increased general and youth unemployment, both in the European Union and my own country, Lithuania. In the European Union, as my colleague previously mentioned, almost 5.5 million young people are unemployed. Many young people are not exploiting their learning potential and are failing to acquire the skills required by employers. The 7 million figure was also mentioned – the number of 15-24 year-olds who are not in education, employment or training. In Lithuania, one in three young people are unemployed. This is a very complex and serious situation. As my colleague said, these countries need to be assisted financially. Yes, there needs to be assistance, but I believe that the European Commission and the European institutions should monitor such funds very strictly so that money intended to get young people into work is used efficiently to create as many jobs as possible. In order to really change the situation rather than massage figures, we need to improve the conditions for creating jobs, create an attractive business environment, and fundamentally change the tax system – this would encourage business initiatives to create jobs. Austerity measures on their own are not enough to solve the problems today. Initiatives and investment in economic growth, job creation and, above all, our future – young people – are very important.</p>

Between 2008 and 2011, the number of unemployed young people rose by 26.5%, according to the International Labour Organisation. It is this development that necessitates urgent measures, for we are not only cutting off an entire generation from the labour market – we are cutting off an entire generation from a future worth living. If we allow our young people to feel completely useless, it is no wonder that young people are turning away from this EU because they have no reasonable prospect of work or life opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would really urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the measures decided on to counter this are initiated. I can see some things being done, but please ensure that the many years’ of mental doldrums are not now replaced by a flurry of activity. When I read that the Commission is starting a programme under which young people will now be given financial assistance if they apply for a job abroad, then we are starting a migration circus that will not solve the problem. On the contrary, it will be counterproductive; because technicians, doctors, engineers and care workers will then be poached by the richer countries that are not in this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this crisis, which is the cause of this development, what we need are offensive measures; namely, the phasing out of this lunatic austerity that is stifling Europe’s economy. We need a targeted growth policy, we need a strengthening of domestic purchasing power, and public investments in education, research and alternative energies. That would be the right approach. Combined with European subsidies, it would then be possible actually to develop an integrated concept that creates some prospects for the lives of young people.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one final comment to make, and that is that this youth unemployment cannot be reconciled with the nonsense about wanting to raise the retirement age to 70. We need a different policy here that allows young people access to the labour market. That is what I am urgently calling for.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the ever-growing figure of youth unemployment results from the selfishness of today’s politicians abandoning tomorrow’s prospects. In the UK, there has been a 43% increase in the number of young people aged 18 to 24 who have not had a job for more than two years. It would seem that some have given up on looking for work and are becoming increasingly detached from society.</p>
      <p sl="en">The youth unemployment crisis can be beaten only if job creation for young people becomes a key priority in policy making and private sector investment picks up significantly. My concern is that the EU is far too rigid in its general approach to law making to be of any real assistance to our young people. Yes, you might point to this scheme or that scheme, but the bureaucracy to apply for support is so disproportionate to the assistance required that it becomes self-defeating.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UK needs to offer tax breaks and other incentives to businesses hiring young people and offering more entrepreneurship programmes to help kick-start careers. EU, you are part of the problem, not the solution.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, more than 7.5 million people between the ages of 15 and 24 in the EU are not in employment, education or training. What is more, youth unemployment is growing. We must not allow a lost generation to emerge.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the hearing of the Youth opportunities initiative in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in March, the aims were clear: to give young people sufficient qualifications, to provide them with access to education and training, and to significantly reduce the school drop-out rate. We also need this to be joined up with three of the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy, Commissioner: firstly, improving education systems through the Youth on the Move project; secondly, the agenda for new skills and jobs, promotion of labour mobility and lifelong learning; and thirdly, the European platform against poverty, in order to prevent this exclusion at an early stage. Municipalities, regions and Member States should be supported at EU level in their fight against youth unemployment through inclusion in the Lifelong Learning, Youth on the Move and Progress programmes.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the European Social Fund must take priority. When it comes down to it, it is about developing personal skills in order to lead young people out of uneducated environments, in order to initiate apprenticeship programmes and allow young people to be integrated into the labour market. In my report on solidarity between the generations, I called for the often-mentioned European youth initiative. After four months’ unemployment, all young people should be offered a job – an apprenticeship or further training – because people have to be both willing and able to work.</p>
      <p sl="de">Once and for all, let us coordinate these initiatives better at EU and Member State level. Let us mobilise resources that have not been paid out. Let us put the European Semester into practice, so that national economic policies can be better coordinated. Our young people are worth these efforts and much more.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, to be honest, I have a feeling of despair, almost frustration, that I must share with someone. Allow me to do so with you this evening.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is the third or fourth debate we have held recently in this House on the situation of youth unemployment across Europe. We have had debate after debate, while youth unemployment rates are rocketing, reaching almost 50% of the active population in some Member States; many young people are left with no form of social or unemployment protection; and the situation is shifting from worrying to unsustainable, and from unsustainable to tragic. Yet the Commission presents itself once again in Parliament as if it were a mere political commentator or just another analyst rather than the true executive body of the Union that it is and, moreover, that we need.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, governing means establishing priorities and taking the initiative, with the aim of achieving a purpose or goal, and the Commission is failing to do that. Governing does not mean simply restructuring funds, nor even announcing it so as to look good to the public, but instead presenting an ambitious, long-term, fast-acting strategy that can put an end to youth unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Governing does not mean resigning oneself to a rate of youth unemployment that is above 20% and being satisfied with a pilot project of EUR 4 million, which is derisory given the scale of the problem we are facing.</p>
      <p sl="es">Governing does not mean giving in to pressure from the College of Commissioners or other Member States in the Council that are trying to convince us that we shall only emerge from this financial crisis and this new wave of recession by giving up salaries, employment rights or compensation, and that a precarious future is the only thing that lies ahead for this generation.</p>
      <p sl="es">If it were true, Commissioner, that it is only through precarity that we can regain competitiveness and that just by being more precarious we can become more competitive, then Zimbabwe would be the most competitive country, and it is not. Sweden, Finland and Denmark are instead, and they are characterised precisely by their exemplary model of relations and a model of guaranteed employment rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">Madam President, employment is far more than just a citizen’s right; it is a tool by which people are connected with the system, and an instrument for social integration. Therefore, the more unemployment there is, the greater people’s political disaffection, and that is why, Commissioner, it is of no use to me whatsoever to hear you talking about matters of competence to avoid doing anything about youth unemployment. What is more, Commissioner, when it was necessary to make a loose interpretation of the Treaties in order to create the European Financial Stability Fund, for example, you did so, and when the Treaties had to be revised in order to fulfil or meet the crazed demands of a particular Member State as regards austerity, we also did so.</p>
      <p sl="es">This, then, is the point I am trying to make. You have, for example, the youth employment guarantee, which needs no explanation. You should fight to increase its budget; use the European Social Fund as an instrument if necessary; design a cofinanced and supportive implementing mechanism that provides greater help to countries with the highest levels of unemployment; put pressure on the worst affected countries to make further changes to the policy of social suffocation; and remember that behind every statistic there is a person suffering.</p>
      <p sl="es">Then you may think as I do, that deciding who holds responsibility is the least important thing, because for all our citizens, particularly young people, we are the ones who are entirely responsible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I certainly welcome the Youth opportunities initiative. It offers some good suggestions in its call for Member States to implement measures to tackle youth unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is important to recognise that some Member States are already taking quite considerable action. Certainly we in the UK are acutely aware of the problems we have with youth unemployment. What we have done recently – and it is very recently, I admit – is to include measures to tackle youth unemployment in our growth plan. We recognise that short-term job creation, based on subsidised loans and other public borrowing, is not a sustainable long-term solution, so we have made sure that our support measures are available to unemployed young people and are flexible, targeted and based on individuals’ reasons for unemployment, their level of experience and their level of education, because we want to make sure that we provide the right support for the right person.</p>
      <p sl="en">How can we ensure that this European initiative is complementary to the national schemes already put in place by Member States and is not overly prescriptive? In terms of funding, the Youth opportunities initiative appears to have a very small set of funding streams, available through the European Social Fund and under the heading of social innovation, for example. I want to know if the Commission envisages a means of boosting the funds available, through mechanisms such as the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, in which there are proposals to include a Youth Initiative axis, although these seem to be rather dependent on new funding being found.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am concerned about excessive bureaucracy in any initiative of this kind, especially when many of the measures need to be accessed directly by young and potentially disadvantaged people or, in the case of apprenticeships, by small businesses. Can we expect these mechanisms to be coupled with existing Member State programmes, or to be accessible through some sort of one-stop shop with clear guidance and information for users?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I do not believe that spending more taxpayers’ money will solve the growing problem of youth unemployment. Nor are grand plans and schemes, like the EU Youth opportunities initiative, the answer, for these have nothing to offer.</p>
      <p sl="en">To tackle a problem resulting from its own policies, the EU is proposing another expensive Commission programme. Rather, we should stop taking money from small businesses in particular, and remove the red tape burden from SMEs, which are the employers of half the workforce. That will free their businesses up and allow them to employ young people, reducing unemployment. We should reduce taxes on big business in return for them taking on young people in apprenticeships and training. With this kind of stimulus, they will prosper as their trainees, becoming more productive in years to come, plough their skills back in.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like the Commission to clarify certain aspects of the proposal on the redeployment of uncommitted structural funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In a letter I received from your colleague, Commissioner Johannes Hahn, he said that the Commission had chosen to target eight Member States that were particularly affected by youth unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The question I would like to ask you is simple. Does that mean that only those eight Member States identified by the Commission will be beneficiaries of this measure? Does that mean that the remaining Member States will be deprived of the benefit of this measure? Does that also mean that, since France does not seem to be one of those eight Member States, the French outermost regions will, in fact, be deprived of these redeployments, at a time when they are the regions with the highest rate of youth unemployment? On the island of Réunion, for example, the rate of unemployment among young people under 25 is 60%.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My proposal is therefore simple: I call on the Commission to consider taking into account the specific situation of the French outermost regions so that they can become eligible for positive measures to combat youth unemployment.</p>

No, it is not the complete answer; nothing ever is. But it would be a jolly good start if small businesses in particular were freed of much of this red tape so they could get on with the job of doing what they are doing and then, because they have got more capital to spend, employ young people and help youth unemployment.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, none of us doubts the problems and hazards faced by young people in the European employment market. The unemployment rate among people under 25 has increased continuously since 2008 and, at the end of 2011, it was double that for all people of working age. One in five people in the EU cannot currently find a job, and more than 7.5 million of them are not only not earning, but are also not in training of any kind; what is more, in certain countries, the level of unemployment among young people has risen to an alarming 50%.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This situation is the result not only of the economic and financial crisis, but also of a lack of prospects and opportunities for young people to develop and acquire basic skills, allowing them to compete in the labour market. For many years, our educational system has failed to accomplish its task, and is still based on curricula which do not in any way reflect the requirements of the labour market. In addition, at the start of their lives as independent adults, young people face problems accessing traineeships and internships, loans and stable jobs which would allow them to develop and invest in their future. This situation means that many Member States, and Europe as a whole, are at risk of brain drain, which can be deadly not only to our economy, but also to science and culture. We believe that the initiatives taken by the European Commission for the benefit of young people, such as the Youth opportunities initiative, are important in this context. It is important, however, that in the forest of actions and programmes which have taken shape recently, we do not lose sight of the objective, which is to make space for young people in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Structural reforms in the labour market, as well as social investments in education, training, traineeships and internships, may prove very helpful in this situation. They will equip young persons with the basic skills needed in the labour market and with tools which help them to adjust proactively and flexibly to changing social and economic conditions. In this context, efficient use of the new EU financial perspectives is particularly important, as is the efficient allocation of funds under the European Social Fund.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Commissioner, our young people are the most important investment of our lives. Let us take care of them with the utmost concern and responsibility.</p>

    <intervention id="3-509-000" speaker_id="96831" name="Jutta Steinruck" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, many of the previous speakers have already mentioned that we are on the way to losing a generation of young people. I think that we all also agree that it is high time that something was done. Initial proposals were made in January this year or in December, so we have already wasted a couple of years with nothing but declarations of intent and a failure to tackle things in concrete terms; instead, responsibilities have been shifted to and fro at European level. I hope that is now in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">Single-minded austerity is destroying the jobs of our young people. Growth creates jobs and training places, including for the young people of Europe, and also saves the costs of future social expenditure. What we need now is a rescue package for young people, for young Europeans, that is given just as much priority as was the rescue package for the banks. We found it easy to spend EUR 800 billion on rescuing the banks. It was right, and it was important, but we have to do it just as vehemently for something that will be much more important to us in the future, or at least equally as important.</p>
      <p sl="de">Alternatively, what about the EUR 82 billion that has not been spent from the Structural Funds? As the previous speaker has already said, we need to call off the money. That would give us EUR 15 000 to spend on each unemployed young person in Europe, if that would simplify things. Moreover, as the previous speaker mentioned, we also have to use the Structural Funds for this in the future. Together with my shadow rapporteurs, I have started initiatives for my report on the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, so that we very specifically allocate funding for a youth initiative. I hope, then, that I will also have the support of this Parliament, of the Commission and also of the Council in getting this funding, since everyone says that it is so important, and that this will also be anchored today in the other funds. This money could be very well used for the future of us all.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Commissioner, we face a very serious problem: that of youth unemployment in the European Union. It has to be said that we have dealt with it in a very slapdash, very unsatisfactory way. We have lost sight of the big picture, and I suspect that this is still the case. Here, we use fancy words, but in some sense, the realities of the situation have become unclear, and we are too far away from the everyday facts and the true level of youth unemployment – the gap is too wide.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Of course, we do have a lot of studies on the subject. We have a lot of reports on this issue, and they are constantly being produced, but it seems to me that, at the moment, there are more writers of reports than readers of them, let alone those that would implement their findings, and these are just the kind of people that we need. I might say that the most appalling experience a person can have is that of being on the outside, and today a significant number of European young people – 5.5 million – feel that they are outside this system, the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We are speaking here in this House, but I suspect that when we go outside the building, we will say that that is all very well, but Europe needs labour migration desperately, and we have to raise the age of retirement. By doing this, we seem to be seeking a solution to a contemporary problem while at the same time forgetting that young people are at risk of being excluded. That will cost us dear, and our future rests on the shoulders of the young and of children. That is why we need to reflect. It is true that it is an investment and that it takes money and effort, but we must do it – invest in the young and their education – so that there are real prospects and hope for the future in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Soon, we here in this House will be voting on the budget. That is one definite area where we can show whether we are investing more in research and development, innovation and education, or whether we are taking funding away from them, in the belief that the growth areas that would benefit our young people and employment should continue to be left alone.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In this connection, I hope that the debate that we are having here today is not just a conversation – a bit of a chat – but that a real change in direction can take place at EU level, that we will actually start paying attention to our young people. I hope that something tangible will start to appear in what we do there at grassroots level, so that no longer is any one life, any one young person, excluded, forced to remain on the outside, but that young people can experience what it is to live a full and secure life in the European Union and its Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his attendance, and also my colleague, Pervenche Berès, for bringing this question forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that young people are suffering disproportionately from the crisis that is facing Europe. Youth unemployment has really dramatic effects. It reduces career opportunities and it reduces earning power but, most importantly, it excludes young people from playing their role in society, and it is soul-destroying. As a result of youth unemployment in Ireland, which is at unprecedented levels, young talented people are leaving the country in droves, and they and their heartbroken families are aware of the reality that they are not taking a year out to travel, but are in fact emigrating to make new lives abroad.</p>
      <p sl="en">Youth unemployment has serious economic consequences. It deprives society of the skills of young people who would, if they were able, put their talents and capabilities to good use. No society can be vibrant and dynamic, let alone competitive, if over 20% of its youth workforce is inactive. In March 2012, Eurostat put the Irish youth unemployment rate at over 30% – more than 73 000 people. Ireland’s rate is the fifth highest in the EU. In December 2011, the European NEETs (Not in Education, Employment or Training) survey put the economic cost, in terms of lost earnings and social transfers, at 2.1% of Ireland’s GDP. This was the highest figure for any EU Member State. But youth unemployment also has dramatic social consequences and, as previous speakers have pointed out, we risk the possibility of having a ‘lost generation’ of people who are completely disengaged.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, I want to ask particularly about the Youth Guarantee. I do not believe that the EUR 4 million that has been set aside is sufficient, and I think we need to do more. I also want to question you about more flexibility in the Structural Funds, particularly in relation to financing, and finally to ask you, Commissioner, whether, on your study visits to the eight countries concerned, you have seen effective use of European Social Fund (ESF) funding, and what recommendations you are making to redirect some ESF funding.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, many of us have said this time and again, but it is necessary to repeat it: the situation of young Europeans is disastrous. Young people are unfairly paying a heavy cost for the crisis. Young people are increasingly turning away from the European project. It is unacceptable to talk of a sacrificed generation, of a generation abandoned to unemployment and precarious contracts. The fact is that a Europe that invests in its young people is a Europe that will return to growth, a Europe that will offer fresh hope to a generation – hope in the European model, in the values of solidarity. It is a Europe that fights against social exclusion and poverty. Let us therefore work together to make this Youth Guarantee system viable and a reality throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, a number of ways of funding such a guarantee have been mentioned, with the European Social Fund (ESF), via the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, with or through other initiatives mentioned by my fellow Members.

It is this gap that we have to close; this is the effort we have to make.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this regard, I propose two questions and two corresponding suggestions. The first is this. Can we bring in a constraint, even a legally binding one, such that in the coming years or months, every euro spent must be on policies for youth employment, thus creating the conditions for a true European platform/plan for youth employment? Let us not forget that the resources at our disposal are very limited.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Young people’s sense of redundancy provides fertile soil for the dissemination of radical ideas, and is the cause of a great many personal tragedies. We have urgent practical tasks ahead of us; we must make use of the opportunities provided by the internal market to ensure that young people can be truly mobile, but must do so without causing countries with better labour market conditions to drain highly qualified youths away from countries with less favourable circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We must resolve the transition from education to the labour market, and must not draw away funds from education as seen in a great many countries; furthermore, we must pay particular attention to young people belonging to disadvantaged groups, such as the Roma, the disabled or immigrants.

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, Europe’s young people are those hit hardest by the severe financial and economic crisis, even though they are actually not to blame for this, and it is unfair that they are suffering the consequences. The big question at the moment is whether the European Union and Member States can help them in order to prevent a lost generation.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I would like to welcome the initiatives from the European Commission, but they are not enough. Action Teams can only be a temporary, support measure, but do not resolve the problems. The teams left when unemployment reached very high rates in these countries. I wish to ask the Commissioner today what preventive measures will be taken.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The Commission’s decision must be reviewed and countries like Bulgaria, which has the highest youth unemployment growth rate, need to be included, because tomorrow, this rate will pass the 30% mark and the cost will be even higher. This figure has doubled in two years, with well-educated young people increasingly often being left destitute. Inherited unemployment is rising.</p>
      <p sl="bg">It is time for the Commission to table EU legislation aimed at regulating the creation of industry and new jobs, providing reliefs and incentives for businesses which take on young people, and penalising firms which do not pay for traineeships and insurance contributions.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We cannot wait to see the transparent distribution of resources from the Structural Funds to create jobs for young people.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, as you know, work is not only an opportunity for drawing a salary so as to be able to live in dignity; it is also a time when people find fulfilment, growing in terms of psyche and character. Millions of young people today in Europe are being denied this possibility, while economic forecasts show that the problem is likely to increase, turning into a true emergency.</p>
      <p sl="it">Since I believe that the high youth unemployment rate can only be solved through growth policies, we must make funds available in order to grow our economies. In the meantime, however, we need to give these young people some answers.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that in this time of crisis – nay, emergency – we should set ourselves just a few goals, or even consider ourselves to have just one priority: education. We have to help these young people stay longer in school, both in order to increase their knowledge so that they can provide the potential for the future of the European economy, and to help them become well-informed citizens. It is only by increasing their awareness that we can prevent them from becoming a social problem for their communities.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I am pleased that Romania was not targeted by Mr Barroso’s letter, which means that it does not feature among the top eight EU countries with the highest youth unemployment rates. However, my country is also hit hard by this problem. I would like to stress three measures which I have mentioned on several occasions as a means of remedying this situation: re-establishing vocational and technical schools, encouraging young entrepreneurs and reducing the school dropout rate, especially among Roma. I should also emphasise how important apprenticeship schemes and training placements are.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In Romania, the law on apprenticeships was amended in 2011 to increase the chances of young people being taken on. The procedures involved have been simplified and the benefits increased for both employees and employers. Companies employing young people are also enjoying some incentives. Thanks to them, more than 10 000 young people entered the job market last year.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we all agree that the European Union’s biggest problem is not limiting carbon dioxide emissions, or the troubles facing Greece, but youth unemployment. I agree with the Commissioner that this problem will not disappear overnight, but, Commissioner, neither was it created overnight. This process has been ongoing for many years and I am interested to know what we have done during this time. I do not think that young people are eagerly awaiting our discussions and statements about how much unemployment there is, because everybody knows this. They are waiting for action, decisions and the effects of those decisions. What is apparent is the inability of the European Union and governments to resolve this problem and to take swift and effective action.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Initiatives such as the Youth opportunities initiative are very worthwhile, but, Commissioner, for how long will they be implemented and how soon will their effects be visible? Yesterday, we discussed small and medium-sized enterprises. Everyone agreed that their development is the best way to fight unemployment. Many people would like to create micro-enterprises, but do not have the funds to do so, so I would like to ask what action the European Commission will take, and how quickly?</p>

The fact that 7.5 million young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed is frightening. We are not simply at risk of having a lost generation; we already have one in some of the countries of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has failed here, but so, too, have all the countries that are not making measures to combat youth unemployment a priority. Youth unemployment is not a national problem, but a European one; and so we need to act immediately, as well as in the medium and long term. The funding needed is there, after all. We could distribute EUR 10 billion from the unutilised resources of the European Stability Funds (ESF) alone. Further funding could be transferred from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in order to finance and develop a training and employment guarantee for young people.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the shocking fact is that a generation of young people is being called the lost generation, as they are being forced to emigrate from my country. Aside from the human drama and social and economic problems caused by their absence, it will also create a generation gap, with unpredictable consequences for Portugal’s much-needed economic recovery. President Barroso’s concerns have been raised at an opportune moment, but they must be extended to the regions. I am aware that in March, the Azores presented the Portuguese Government with a programme for using proposed instruments to combat the terrible scourge of youth unemployment, which the crisis has brought to the region. We now hope that the Portuguese Government will include these instruments in its national plan with the speed recommended by the President of the Commission, and that Portugal and the other Member States will soon be able to provide the responses that young Europeans so desperately need, and which the European project cannot refuse. I would also ask the Commission whether it has any information as yet about its plans for Portugal.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your explanations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today’s debate is not unrelated to the debates on austerity, growth and the need for plans to stimulate employment in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I believe, Commissioner, that out of political and personal decency, the time has come to say that the EU Member States that are experiencing this situation, and which are the native countries of those who have spoken, are the same Member States that need to replace their production model with another type of model in order to generate employment and put an end to the situation that has been caused in recent years. Therefore, we, too, should do the decent thing. It would be easier for me to indulge in demagoguery, but that is what we have learnt from past measures.</p>
      <p sl="es">As we have to look to the future, I believe that firstly, we should reject and eliminate the expression ‘lost generation’. In my view, the European institutions and the Member States have a responsibility to restore the dignity of young people by any means possible and with the collaboration of the EU, the Member States and the regions.</p>
      <p sl="es">To that end, I would like to ask the Commissioner if he believes that this is compatible, and how effective these pilot programmes will be in precisely those Member States that have been forced by austerity to reduce their budgets for training, innovation and youth employment, and if he believes that these youth policies should be applied transversally, with the collaboration of all the EU Commissioners, in order for them to have a multiplier effect.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the number of young people finding it hard to enter the job market and pursue a career is rising in almost every EU Member State. This is mainly down to the decrease in opportunities for economic development. In states hit hard by the crisis, the youth unemployment rate is dramatically approaching 50%, which requires urgent measures to be adopted by the authorities. It is of paramount importance that the efforts of national players, backed up by support from the Commission, focus on channelling European funds into improving this situation. The way in which we can use the economic potential generated by talented young people will determine Europe’s sustainable development in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that our approach needs to focus on the link between education requirements, young people’s expectations and, in particular, on the needs of the labour market. We must concentrate on preventing young people from dropping out of school and on developing school curricula to match the labour market’s specific needs. The lack of correlation between education systems and the needs and expectations of employers in terms of applicants’ skills is one of the biggest problems.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, once again, everything you have announced to us today is of the utmost importance and we eagerly await the reports by the Action Teams in the eight Member States. We have some facts already, but expect a lot more. Naturally, despite these measures, it would appear – from what my colleagues have said – that we agree that we are not doing enough, because the numbers are getting worse and the situation is not getting any better. We refer, of course, to the risk of a lost generation, because there is a deeply disappointed generation of young people throughout Europe. However, at the same time, our resolutions contain something further; the fact that, in certain sectors, we need manpower from legal immigration, because we do not have the skills in Europe and because we have a serious demographic problem. Perhaps, Commissioner, we should engage in a little self-criticism. Perhaps we should review our policies. How hard can it be to combine the colossal problem of a lost generation of young people, which is a real threat, with unemployment in Spain and Greece of 50% or more, and with equally poor figures in other countries, with what we say on the other hand, about shortfalls in certain sectors? How hard can that be?</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, youth unemployment is undoubtedly one of the scourges of the EU. Average youth unemployment in the EU is 22.4%, although that figure is likely to be much higher in reality. Young people, including those who are highly skilled, are experiencing a tragedy of precariousness, instability and uncertainty about their future. The EU budget must be increased in general, and should prioritise promoting employment, creating jobs and redistributing its resources to countries where this problem is most prevalent. However, let us not deceive ourselves. It is not possible to create jobs unless a clean break is made with the so-called austerity policies supported by the majority in Parliament, through policies of economic governance, the Stability and Growth Pact and the fiscal compact. Reducing wages and pensions, discontinuing public services, privatisation and deregulating labour laws as part of reforms will only lead to an endless spiral of economic recession and unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Those who wish seriously to discuss the problem of youth unemployment cannot also be complacent and support and condone the policies that are destroying jobs every day, thereby shattering the dreams, rights and futures of today’s young people.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I welcome the Commission’s programme, which should help change the high unemployment rate among young people by redirecting unspent resources from the Structural Funds to new projects aiming to increase youth employment. However, I think it is very important also to focus on concrete measures and programmes that the Commission wants to promote. However, financial support intended for an employer to pay the wages of a newly-employed young person can lead to the speculative dismissal of older employees in order to obtain this EU contribution for jobs for young people. I think that support should be provided only when it can unambiguously be proven that it is for newly created jobs for young people that will be sustainable in the long term and that will provide young people with stable employment with prospects for their further professional growth. It should not be an exercise in the populist spending of taxpayers’ money, but a matter-of-fact resolution of a serious problem.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, rising youth unemployment is the absolute scandal of our times. Youth unemployment not only means being unable to earn a living; it also destroys opportunities to develop. Above all, however, it undermines the credibility of the democratic system. For this reason, it is also cynical, as is repeated like a mantra by the neoclassical school, to make young people solely responsible for finding jobs. The continual rise in youth unemployment must be combated by political means and put at the heart of European policy. I can only wonder why so little attention has been paid to this problem until now, and I also find it hard to comprehend that there are substantial resources in the European funds that could be utilised at any time.</p>
      <p sl="de">The significance of the problem, however, means that additional funding is also required. Above all, young people should be given clear prospects by us giving them an employment guarantee. This can be financed and, in any event, is cheaper than unemployment.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, we really need economic growth to help young people, but recently, I have been amazed at how often the word ‘growth’ in political parlance means the same as recovery. Obviously, that cannot be the solution: that is not real growth. Increasing public finances is living off the future, living at the expense of precisely these young people, and borrowing from them and from their future. That is why we need genuine growth.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need to focus attention, for example, on the importance of the fact that unpaid work experience for the young should once again be a real gateway to proper employment, that contacts between the education system and the labour market should be improved, that more attention should be paid to informal training, and that special help should be given to young people who are particularly vulnerable, such as young mothers, those representing minorities, immigrants and the disabled.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am therefore very pleased that the President of the Commission has adopted a robust position on youth unemployment, and it is good that Mr Barroso’s letter to the eight Member States that are suffering the worst has produced a result.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, in the current situation, we cannot ignore the fact that the youth unemployment rate is approaching 50%. The support which we would like to offer on behalf of the European institutions must materialise without delay. The criteria which employers require nowadays are almost impossible to meet in terms of the applicants’ abilities and the criteria which they need to fulfil. I am referring here to the point that some employers expect graduates to be perhaps 25 years old with 10 years’ professional experience.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This situation is not possible, which is why a European regulation is required. Even those who have not obtained a degree in higher education can be accommodated in the various programmes specially tailored for young people.

This is why I call for programmes specially reserved for young people so that they can enter employment, thereby providing a solution to the unemployment problem.</p>

This is tantamount to a waste of the money Member States have invested in education and sounds an alarm bell for us to adapt the curriculum urgently to the needs of the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To be able to achieve the targets set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, we need to allocate considerable funds to provide young people with practical training and to lifelong learning programmes. I think that we can tackle the problem of youth unemployment by increasing the level of cofinancing for the Structural Funds. Another important area we need to focus on is to involve young people in research and innovation for promoting technological development so that we become more competitive economically at a global level.</p>

The real problem is not a lack of preparation for the labour market, but the fact that companies are unable to hire new workers. The reason is the low competitiveness of a growing number of European companies. In many cases, this has to do with rising costs, which result from a combination of high taxes, Europe’s unilateral commitment to reducing CO2 production and, above all, high social claims by employees, which are not balanced by productivity. Everyone wants German pay, German hospitals and German pensions, but no one is concerned that they are not achieving German productivity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am afraid that the two-minute time limit I was given is very short. I will do my best to answer as fully as possible, especially for those who have stayed until the end of the discussion, but I am afraid that I will need a little more time.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I am very grateful to those who noticed that in my introduction, I spoke about action: many actions which we have already taken and to which we are already committed. I can give a more detailed reply on three areas and also some more information than was given in the introduction, starting with the Youth Guarantee.</p>
      <p sl="en">You probably know that this is not the first time the Commission has launched a discussion on the Member States and the Youth Guarantee. Thanks to Ms Turunen and others in this House, we included the Youth Guarantee in the Europe 2020 flagship initiative and we immediately launched a debate. To be very frank with you, it bounced back from the Member States because there was a lot of complacency that the recovery would resolve all the problems automatically. Now we have relaunched it and, thanks to the Danish Presidency, there has already been a very constructive debate in Council about the Youth Guarantee. In my view, there is an emerging consensus. Of course, we have to discuss many details, but I am very hopeful that we can reach a constructive conclusion on this by the end of this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the funds, they are very important and we have done a lot of work, especially in the eight countries, for reallocation. I gave you a figure in my introduction. It applies not only to the European Social Fund, but also to the Regional Development Fund, because sometimes, there is a need to cross the border between the two.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are some very good projects – that was also a question – which I saw myself, like the one in Tuscany. This is a regionally organised programme which gives a lot of support to young people to start their career, to begin living independently and to receive training. I also discussed with Minister Diamantopoulou a new ESF programme on start-ups in Greece, which is also supported by the ESF and can be launched. In these countries, we have indeed made a lot of progress in implementing the ESF as regards speed and quality. Despite the crisis, this has been possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, I would urge a certain amount of caution. This reallocation of the funds is possible and makes a difference. We can reallocate to more efficient and more effective projects, but this is not a magic solution. It is also important to know that a certain merit and benefit of the Structural Funds is that there is long-term planning with this fund and that the Member States and the regions can rely on these programmes. I am also aware of programmes and new initiatives in other countries. In reply to Mr Alves, from Portugal, I recently received two state secretaries and if you contact my Chef de Cabinet, we can give you much more concrete information about our engagement with Portugal.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, let me come to a third issue which was also the subject of heated debate. This is the employment potential of SMEs or companies in general. In my view, so-called red tape is not the main issue. It is probably a negligible issue if it is an issue at all. The main issue is access to credit. The problem is that the banking system and the financial sector in general has been paralysed and does not properly finance SMEs and sometimes other companies either. That is why we have to do a lot more about banking regulation to ensure that the banks can revive themselves and then they will be able to support the real economy. That is why the microfinance initiative – for which we also thank the Parliament – is so important because it can make a difference in a sector where the standard mainstream financial sector is incapable of supporting micro and small enterprises, especially in disadvantaged and marginalised communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to see a discussion which is focused on the real obstacles, as well as cooperation to eliminate these real obstacles, rather than shadow boxing. I would like to make one more point on more general terms. I very much agree with those who frame the discussion in the context of the general discussion on employment and growth in the European Union today. I think this is extremely important. Why? Because in the countries of the EU where youth unemployment is excessively high – terribly high, particularly in Spain and Greece – there is not just one problem. We discussed many: education and training; school to work policies, or the lack thereof; segmentation of the labour market, which labour market reforms inside the Member States will help to sort out. That is why the reform in Italy is so important, because it will also help the young people. I hope that this reform will be concluded successfully very soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">But it is also very important to notice that we are speaking about a gap between the financially stable countries of the EU and the peripheries, which are under constant financial stress. If you look at the list of the eight countries, we are talking about the so-called periphery of the European Union. The big problem is that, until now, there has been no macro-economic policy in the European Union able to establish cohesion and bridge the gap between the core and the peripheries. These policies, which block the growth potential of the peripheries and keep them in a permanent recession, do not originate from the Commission. These policies – to be very frank with you, Mr Becker – originate from Berlin. Mr Becker, Mr Mann, Ms Steinruck, Mr Händel, you are MEPs, but you also have a right to speak in your national parliaments. Please help the Bundestag and the Chancellor to understand the economics of the European Union and help them in making the right decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">The time has come. The most important meeting is tonight, partly here, but also in Brussels. The time has come to change the macro-economic policies, to allow the peripheral countries and regions of the European Union to regain their growth potential and provide job opportunities for people, and especially for young people who are now excessively affected by unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is my conclusion for today, and I thank you for this extremely important discussion.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I am really pleased that at the end of last year, having published its new communication entitled Youth opportunities initiative, the European Commission began to promote additional coordination and financing instruments for youth employment in the Member States because, as we all know, 5.5 million young people are unemployed, that is, one in five young people under 25 cannot find a job. We all know that the situation is particularly complicated in eight Member States. It is very important to know how the national governments of these countries are managing to address the issue of youth unemployment by using European Social Fund 2007-2013 funds not yet allocated to projects and providing technical assistance to people starting up businesses. We must encourage young people to create new jobs. Another point that I would like to focus on is cooperation. Only by working together can we achieve good results. In order to reduce youth unemployment, we must first send those who do not have a secondary education back to school, and also create the conditions for young people to move from education and studies to the labour market. We must ensure that young people who have completed their studies have the opportunity to obtain work experience which is demanded by the majority of employers. We also have to promote cooperation between the public sector, higher education institutions and business so that young people in higher education acquire knowledge and skills that meet employers’ requirements and market demand. I believe that the measures laid down in the Youth opportunities initiative should help to address these problems.</p>

      <p sl="it">OECD data on youth unemployment in the EU, which stands at around 22%, contrast with the provisions of Article 165(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which sets out a number of actions at European level regarding young people, their education, employment and vocational training. Initiatives for growth, in this sense, are fundamental factors in the coordinated and harmonious development of the EU single market. Intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth are three main objectives for developing an economy based on knowledge and innovation and, at the same time, fostering a high-employment economy delivering social and territorial cohesion. These objectives are pursuable only through effective and efficient use of EU funds, in particular, the Structural Funds, of which EUR 82 billion remains unspent, much of which could be aimed at young people, in particular through small and medium-sized enterprises, thereby contributing to the creation of employment opportunities. I am therefore in favour of a future policy providing opportunities for young people by identifying further and more ambitious funding sources to help them to cope with high youth unemployment. I also consider it essential to allocate significant resources when drawing up the 2014-2020 financial framework, focusing on young people who are not in employment, education or training.</p>

      <p sl="pl">When discussing youth employment, we need, above all, to be aware of the enormous differences between Member States in terms of unemployment rates in the 15-24 age group. While it exceeds 50% in Greece and Spain, it is only around 8% in Germany and Austria, and – which is noteworthy – almost at exactly the same level as the unemployment rate for the whole of society. This shows that unemployment in these countries does not affect young people to a greater extent than other age groups, which is exceptional in some ways. Young people looking for employment whilst still studying, or immediately upon completion of their studies, are not an attractive group for employers in view of their lack of experience, which puts them at a disadvantage in the face of competition from older and, of course, more experienced candidates. There are few young people whose jobs are commensurate with their competences and education, whilst also being permanent jobs with decent pay. We should therefore ensure that young people have as much access as possible to various types of traineeships and work experience while studying, which makes it easier to move later between education and the labour market. Programmes which are already in place such as Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus for entrepreneurs require not only significant funding from the EU budget, but also promotion in the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Youth opportunities initiative is a concrete response to the phenomenon of youth unemployment, which not only remains high in developed countries, but is growing steadily. This is due not only to the crisis and budgetary discipline, but primarily to deep structural problems, including a failure on the part of the labour market and the education system to adapt and be flexible. For many years, we have seen a discrepancy between the financial expectations of our young people and their actual skills, experience and qualifications. We should therefore encourage and support this initiative, which involves the implementation of a series of measures aimed at improving the situation of young people in the labour market. It is time for a realistic and concrete prevention strategy, i.e. greater use of ESF funds, assistance in finding a first job abroad through the Eures system, the establishment of an efficient system of international work experience for school pupils and internships for young entrepreneurs through Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus, and an extension of the European Voluntary Service Programme. In countries where the educational system is coordinated with industry, for example, by means of ongoing programmes of work experience or recruitment obligations incumbent upon civil society institutions, school leavers and graduates are in a better position when looking for a job and the unemployment rate for those under 25 years of age has fallen to a few percent.</p>
