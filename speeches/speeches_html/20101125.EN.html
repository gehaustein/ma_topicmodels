<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mariya Nedelcheva, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Diamandouros, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we can see the mission of the European Ombudsman as involving two objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is the legal objective, which entails ensuring that the European institutions show respect for the fundamental right of good administration. Ensuring respect for this right is the very essence of the Ombudsman’s function. We are now at a key moment in the sense that the Treaty of Lisbon, which now includes the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, makes this right legally binding in Article 41. The Ombudsman therefore now has a legal basis, and one which I would say has been strengthened, to carry out his activities properly.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this objective of full respect for good administration, the Ombudsman must be inflexible when it comes to the institutions. The special reports are a tool which comes into its own here. They allow the Ombudsman to point out cases of blatant bad administration when all means of resolving disputes have been exhausted. The Porsche affair is very significant in this regard. Here, I would like to praise the determination, if I may say so, of Mr Diamandouros, in his efforts to obtain the information that he is completely entitled to request.</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective is moral in nature. For the Ombudsman, it involves promoting a culture of service, which is not explicitly mentioned in the treaties, but which certainly forms part of the commitments that apply to the institutions. In order to ensure that such a culture of service is established, two things are necessary. First of all, the Ombudsman must continue to encourage amicable solutions, as he has already been doing for several years. I will say again that 56% of complaints received are resolved amicably.</p>
<p class="contents">He must then continue his efforts with respect to communication, so that European citizens are informed of their rights, as well as the existing procedures for ensuring that these rights are respected. With regard to this, the introduction of an interactive guide is an important step forward, and I believe that many of our citizens are grateful to you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">So, the summary of the Ombudsman’s activities in 2009 is an entirely positive one, and that is what I tried to reflect in my report. However, I also included a number of recommendations. First, I think it is essential to strengthen links with the national parliaments and national ombudsmen. Taking action in Brussels without making sure that there is a link at national level means that it is much less effective. That is why I am asking the European Ombudsman to give more encouragement to national ombudsmen to hold regular exchanges of views with their national parliaments, modelled on the exchanges held between the European Ombudsman and ourselves in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Network of Ombudsmen is an important tool to this end. I think that sharing information and good practices is essential in this regard. I want to say again here how important it is to introduce a common intranet portal for ombudsmen to exchange all this information.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the citizen must be at the heart of our concerns. Transparency, proximity, good administration, a culture of service – those are the watchwords. This proximity also relates to our institution, however. That is why I would like to praise Mr Diamandouros once again for devoting so much effort to maintaining a constant link with the European Parliament and, in particular, with the Committee on Petitions. As I underlined in my report, I believe that it would be very beneficial for our two institutions and, beyond that, for European citizens if we had more exchanges when the Ombudsman carries out an own-initiative inquiry.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus far, Mr Diamandouros has got down very well to his task of calling the institutions to order when they wander down the tortuous path of opacity and bad administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Diamandouros, I wish you all the best, and I am very much looking forward to reading your annual report for 2010. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Eight months later, the Commission granted access to 16 of 19 letters, refusing – without legal justification – to disclose three letters from Porsche. The environmental organisation took recourse to the European Ombudsman, who prepared a draft recommendation addressed to the Commission a month later, asking it to reply within three months, in accordance with Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission requested five extensions, only to state – in June 2009 – that it was not in a position, a year after the Ombudsman’s draft recommendation, to disclose the correspondence with this particular automobile manufacturer, due to continuing consultations with it. Up to October 2010, the Ombudsman had no information at his disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">This unwarranted delay resulted in a special report to the European Parliament, charging the Commission with refusing to cooperate honestly and in good faith and, at the same time, pointing out the danger in undermining the facility for the two institutions to supervise the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of this special report from the Ombudsman which Parliament is being called upon to pass today, the first on the subject of maladministration, the letters from this particular automobile manufacturer were disclosed, fifteen months after the Ombudsman’s initial request. Between September 2008 and February 2010, the Commission arrived at a decision which had been suggested to it in the Ombudsman’s draft recommendation fifteen months earlier. At the same time, it was proven that that this specific automobile manufacturer had ultimately agreed to the – albeit partial – disclosure of its letters.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from the foregoing that the Commission was, of course, obliged to take account of the relative article of the European Parliament regulation requiring the institutions to refuse access to documents if their disclosure would undermine the protection of the commercial interests of private individuals or legal entities. However, given that the Ombudsman’s office checked the letters and found that they did not contain information that would damage the commercial interests of this particular automobile manufacturer, the Commission should have immediately disclosed at least some of them, in line with the Ombudsman’s suggestion. If, however, it had reservations in interpreting the draft recommendation, it was obliged, in order to justify its decisions, to submit equally strong legal assessments confirming the possibility that the automobile manufacturer in question might take recourse to the courts on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no wish to comment here on the total silence which the automobile manufacturer in question has maintained in response to the Commission’s request. However, I do consider it unacceptable for the supreme executive body of the European Union to use the refusal, a refusal which is almost dismissive of the European institutions on the part of a private company, to decline to respond to such a request as an argument, especially as its letters contain no information which might activate the application of the relevant article of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and give cause to take the Commission to court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here in the European Parliament, we have a process of legislation which, although highly complex, is one of the most transparent when compared to national parliaments. I would point out that I have been a member of a national assembly, so I know what I am talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">This lengthy process involving the governments of the Member States, as well as the European Parliament, produces results that are often only evident once implemented in national legislation. However, if implementation in the various national parliaments does not take place or is inefficient, then we, the Members of this House, Parliament itself, and the European Union as a whole, are faced with a major credibility problem. I consider this a very serious issue. As Members of the European Parliament, we are constantly being confronted by citizens who tell us about the shortcomings of the system. The Commission regularly receives complaints from citizens about how national law is implemented. I would just like to mention a couple of examples: Let us consider the refuse crisis in Naples. This is a recurring problem, which we are witnessing not for the first or second time, but for the third time. Yet we find that the European directives on waste disposal, for example, have not been implemented. The Commission has intervened here, but this intervention has not succeeded in having the principles of waste disposal we in Europe believe to be critically important implemented at national level. Let us consider my own country, Austria. Here, the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive has been poorly implemented. One case, involving the closure of a ski resort, clearly shows that there are enormous problems here. Another example can be found in the area of transport, where it is stipulated that Member States must respect rest time for drivers in traffic management and where controls are required to ensure compliance. The shocking lack of controls in this sector is resulting in an increasing number of accidents due to driver fatigue. In this context, it should be stated that we must avoid frustrating our citizens in their concern to see Community law implemented. They must be given timely information about legislation and they should be able to rely on the fact that the process will take place in a transparent manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as Members of the European Parliament, urgently need a procedure to enable us to receive this feedback from our citizens, while still respecting confidentiality requirements. I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you are prepared to endorse the procedure we propose in our report. This would constitute a significant step forward in the direction of transparency, openness and clarity in the European process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like again to emphasise: if we lose our credibility because we fail to pay sufficient attention to the implementation of Community law in European Member States, this will lead to a credibility problem for the European Union as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nikiforos Diamandouros, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Ombudsman. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for this opportunity to address you. I wish to thank the Committee on Petitions, and especially the chair, Mrs Mazzoni. They continue to offer me valuable support and advice, as evidenced by the excellent reports submitted to this Chamber by Mrs Nedelcheva and Mrs Paliadeli, whom I thank warmly for their kind words.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Ombudsman both work to ensure that citizens and residents of the EU can enjoy their rights to the full, but we do so in different ways. The Ombudsman’s mandate is more limited. I only deal with complaints against EU institutions, whilst you can also examine what Member States are doing. Furthermore, Parliament as a sovereign political body can deal with petitions that request changes in the law, or new laws. In contrast, my role is to help uncover maladministration and to attempt to put it right.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike court rulings, an Ombudsman’s decisions are not legally binding. I can only use the power of persuasion to convince the EU institutions to follow my recommendations, or to achieve friendly solutions which can satisfy both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Where EU institutions refuse to follow my recommendations, it is of fundamental importance that the Ombudsman can turn to Parliament to seek its support, and I am naturally very grateful that Parliament continues to do so, as evidenced by the Nedelcheva and Paliadeli reports.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first annual report presented to you since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. I will continue to work in close cooperation with Parliament in order to further our common goal of providing European citizens with the maximum possible benefits from their rights under the treaty, acting always in accordance with my mandate as an independent and impartial investigator of alleged maladministration – an independence and impartiality which applies equally to the complainant as well as to the institution complained against.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2009, my office closed 318 inquires, 70% of which were completed within one year. 55% were completed within three months. On average, inquiries took nine months to complete, which was well within my standard goal of completing inquiries within one year.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that, in 2009, 56% of all investigations were either settled by the institution or resulted in a friendly solution. This represents a large improvement over 2008, when the percentage was 36%. In 35 cases, I issued a critical remark. This is a significant improvement compared to 2008, when I issued 44 critical remarks, or even 2007, when I issued 55. The sustained reduction is good news, but this is still too many.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, I make efforts to help every complainant who turns to the Ombudsman, even in cases where the complaint is not within my mandate. In 2009, I received a total of 2 392 such complaints, a 6% decline compared to 2008. This decline is encouraging news. Reducing the number of inadmissible complaints has been a long-standing request of Parliament. I attribute this result at least in part to the fact that more citizens are finding the right address to turn to the first time around.</p>
<p class="contents">In January 2009, I launched an interactive guide on my new website, which is accessible in all 23 EU languages. This guide aims to direct complainants to the body best placed to help them, whether it be my own services, the services of national or regional ombudsmen in the Member States, or problem-solving mechanisms such as the cross-border online network Solvit.</p>
<p class="contents">During 2009, the guide was used by more than 26 000 people. It is very important for citizens to be guided to the most appropriate complaint-handling body from the outset and to be spared the frustrations and delays associated with having to identify the right institution on their own.</p>
<p class="contents">This also means that complaints are resolved more promptly and effectively, thus ensuring that citizens can fully enjoy their rights under EU law and also that EU law is properly implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last three years, I have also made strenuous efforts to raise awareness about the services I can offer to businesses, associations, NGOs, regional authorities and other target groups, that is, anybody who is involved in EU projects or programmes and who has direct dealings with the EU administration.</p>
<p class="contents">To further ensure awareness of the Ombudsman’s work, I stepped up cooperation during 2009 with other information and problem-solving networks such as Europe Direct and Solvit. I also intensified my efforts to reach out to potential complainants by organising a range of public events; all these outreach activities, combined with the solid results obtained for complainants, resulted in median coverage of the Ombudsman’s work increasing by 85%.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of enquiries opened, based on complaints received in 2009, rose from 293 to 335. This increase must be at least partly attributed to outreach activities. I have also continued my efforts to improve the quality of information provided to citizens and potential complainants concerning their rights under EU law through the European network of Ombudsmen which greatly helps to facilitate the rapid transfer of complaints to the competent Ombudsman or similar body.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I continued to strive to make certain that EU institutions adopt a citizen-centred approach in all their activities. This is a task that must be tackled in tandem with the institutions. To promote this goal with respect to the Commission, I am in close contact with the Vice-President of the Commission responsible for relations with the Ombudsman, Commissioner Šefčovič, who I thank for his presence here today, and I am grateful for his close cooperation and support to date.</p>
<p class="contents">The most common allegation I examined in 2009 was lack of transparency. This arose in 36% of all enquiries. It is with a certain degree of concern that I note the continuing high percentage of such complaints. An accountable and transparent EU administration is surely key to building citizens’ trust. I also regret the lengthy delays by the Commission in responding to access to document cases. The most outrageous case is dealt with in Mrs Paliadeli’s report which makes clear that Parliament expects substantial improvement from the Commission in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty was the key event of 2009. The treaty makes new promises to citizens concerning fundamental rights, enhanced transparency and greater opportunities for participation in the Union’s policy making. It also makes the Charter of Fundamental Rights, including the right to good administration, legally binding.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform of the Financial Regulation offers an additional excellent opportunity to put the fundamental right to good administration into practice. I believe that the relevant rules should provide guidance to officials as to how they should ensure both sound financial management and good administration. Honourable Members, I developed and recently adopted a strategy to cover the whole period of my mandate. The document containing it was circulated during this past week to your Bureau, the Conference of Presidents and the Committee on Petitions for information.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy is designed to implement the mission statement for my institution which I adopted in 2009 and which reads as follows. ‘The European Ombudsman seeks fair outcomes to complaints against European Union institutions, encourages transparency and promotes an administrative culture of service. He aims to build trust through dialogue, between citizens and the European Union and to foster the highest standards of behaviour in the Union’s institutions’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is within this spirit, Mr President, honourable Members, this spirit of the Commission statement, that I will continue to work in carrying out the mandate which this august body has entrusted me with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maroš Šefčovič, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, please bear with me because I will try to respond to our three rapporteurs and the Ombudsman. I would like to start by thanking Ms Nedelcheva, Ms Paliadeli and Ms Lichtenberger for their reports. It is very clear that we share the same goals: namely, that administration should be efficient and professional and that European law be respected. That is the basis on which we intend to discuss these matters and, I am sure, to seek a positive result.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Diamandouros, I would also like to express my appreciation for his close cooperation with the Commission. I think this is a special day for him because he can see that his work is also very highly appreciated by the European Parliament. I can assure you that the communication between us and between our services is very intense. Hardly a week passes when I do not send a letter of explanation to the Ombudsman and get a response from him. This is how we try to find the right solutions in our work. Of course, there are some outstanding issues on which we are working, but I think that is simply proof of our fruitful communication.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that the Commission welcomes Ms Nedelcheva’s report, which offers a clear and exhaustive overview of the Ombudsman’s activities for the past year. In fact, in the Ombudsman’s report on his 2009 activities, the results of his various inquiries are clearly presented, illustrated with examples and classified into categories according to the nature of the cases of maladministration or the institution concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Diamandouros has already said, in 2009, the Ombudsman recorded a total of 3 098 complaints, as against 3 406 in 2008. This represents a 9% decrease on the year, but we are fully aware that 56% of the inquiries were addressed to the Commission. We are also aware that the most frequent claims for maladministration concern a lack of transparency, including a refusal to provide information, and I am committed to tackling such cases further.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the efforts made by the Ombudsman to further reduce the average length of his inquiries to nine months. The Commission stresses, however, that its own deadlines for internal consultation and for the College of Commissioners to endorse its replies should be taken into consideration by the Ombudsman in his efforts to reduce the time for dealing with a complaint. Each response is confirmed and endorsed by the College, and it takes some time to reach the College.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that the Ombudsman has conducted an intensive information campaign, which has resulted in greater awareness of citizens’ rights and better understanding of his spheres of competence. In this regard, the Ombudsman tends readily to issue press releases, and these are often published at a stage when the Ombudsman has just sent the Commission a draft recommendation, thus leaving no room for the Commission for defence, since its reply is still ongoing.</p>
<p class="contents">In some cases, a friendly solution may be found if the institution offers redress to the complainant. This solution is freely offered, without involving liability issues or setting a legal precedent. If a friendly solution cannot be found, the Ombudsman can make recommendations to resolve the case. If the institution does not accept his recommendations, he can make a special report to Parliament. In 2009, there were no special reports sent to Parliament by the Ombudsman. A special report was sent to Parliament in 2010 regarding a complaint on access to Commission documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations with the Ombudsman have occasionally given rise to differences of opinion. This has been the case with inquiries concerning infringement procedures. The Ombudsman often argues that the Commission has not provided a sufficient explanation of its position, which clearly requires a response from the Commission on the substantive content of its reasoning and comes close to a debate on the merits of the Commission’s line. However, the Commission has tended to respond at great length to the Ombudsman, setting out in detail, and backing up, the interpretations of the law that have been applied, while adding a disclaimer about differences in interpretation of the law and stressing that the final arbiter is the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the developments which have occurred in recent years on the registering and treatment of complaints (the ‘EU Pilot’ project), as confirmed in its annual report on monitoring the application of EU law in 2009, the Commission would like, in the near future, to update its Communication of 23 March 2002 on relations with the complainant in respect of infringements of Community law. I have personally met the Ombudsman and was able to inform him about these developments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of transparency and access to documents, the Commission thoroughly examines all the complaints addressed to it by the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these cases led the Ombudsman to submit in 2010 a special report to Parliament and this is the subject of Ms Paliadeli’s report. I regret that this special report was sent shortly after the Commission had taken a final decision in the case. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that the time taken for reaching this decision was excessive, even if it was due to the failure of the third party to respond to the Commission’s proposal. I would like to stress that the Commission is fully committed to sincerely cooperating with the Ombudsman. There is no question of unwillingness to cooperate on the part of the Commission and certainly no intention to obstruct the Ombudsman’s work in any way. The Commission always strives to cooperate closely with the Ombudsman. However, some requests for access to documents are particularly complex or voluminous and cannot be handled within normal timeframes. The Commission handles around 5 000 access requests per year, of which only 15 to 20 lead to complaints to the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union has made it possible to start thinking about how to achieve a common approach in order to establish an open, effective and independent European administration. The Commission therefore considers that an interinstitutional dialogue is needed before presenting any legislative proposal. A positive outcome here seems possible, and cooperation between the two institutions on the matter should ensure it.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me, Mr President, I will also respond to Ms Lichtenberger because she has made a great effort to be here this morning. I would like to assure her that the Commission attaches great importance to the correct application of EU law and, as you know, this was among the priorities of the Barroso Commission. Already in our communication ‘A Europe of results’, in 2007, the Commission committed itself to improving its working methods to ensure the more efficient pursuit of problems arising in the application of EU law, focusing on the issues which cause the most problems for citizens and businesses. I said in this communication that the annual report represents more of a strategic evaluation of the application of EU law, identifying the main challenges, setting priorities and programming work according to those priorities. The Commission welcomes Parliament’s response to this report. The following remarks pick up on some of the key issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the provision of information on infringements, the Commission is in the process of implementing the new framework agreement with Parliament. It is committed to providing Parliament with the information set out in that agreement. The Commission also looks forward to associating Parliament with its work on the ‘Your Europe’ portal to ensure that citizens know where to go to find the information that they seek.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome Parliament’s recognition of the contribution of the EU Pilot project to a properly functioning, citizen-focused European Union, in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty. This project is designed to ensure that citizens’ concerns and complaints about the application of EU law are followed up, and that is, of course, a major consideration for us. In doing this work, the Commission has to respect the confidentiality to which the Court of Justice has confirmed that the Member States are entitled concerning the investigation of alleged application issues and potential infringement proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, while the Commission provided extensive information in its report adopted in March this year on the functioning of the EU Pilot project, it does not grant access to, or divulge information on, the particular cases being handled under EU Pilot. At the same time, the Commission recognises the importance of ensuring the timely provision to citizens of a full and clear evaluation of the outcome of work done with the Member States in EU Pilot, and it is committed to ensuring that complainants have an opportunity to comment on the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the adoption of the procedural code under Article 298, the Commission understands that a working group has been set up in Parliament to study the potential scope and content of such an initiative. The Commission also considers it appropriate to weigh the outcome of initial work on the overall issue before considering any more specific elements. For the moment, therefore, we reserve our position on all aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also preparing to provide up-to-date information on the resources devoted to the application of EU law. The draft resolution being discussed today covers a wide range of issues and, in its response to the resolution, the Commission will provide additional explanations which would be very difficult to provide today, mainly through lack of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, we are glad to share the common interest in the current application of EU law for the benefit of EU citizens and businesses. The effective application of EU law is one of the cornerstones of the EU, as a well as a key component of smart regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to apologise to the interpreters for speaking so quickly. Thank you very much for your patience, and thanks to all of you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am speaking on behalf of the Chair of the Committee on Petitions, who unfortunately is ill, and I would like to limit my remarks to Mrs Paliadeli’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has often debated and discussed the issue of access to documents and the benefits of transparency and the question of where the line should be drawn between the legitimate rights and interests of the public at large, on the one hand, and the legitimate interests of individuals and companies, on the other. By the way, Mrs Paliadeli, the shoe can also be on the other foot, namely that information is made available to an NGO and a company or individual then seeks to find out exactly what information has been shared. We are not considering the question of who is good or bad here, but simply the issue of timeframes and deadlines. These deadlines must be honoured insofar as they relate to individual citizens and, of course, to the Ombudsman. This is what you might call a fundamental principle of good administration. We would expect the Commission, which has shown such an interest in speeding business up, as the Vice-President has already mentioned, to take a closer look at this issue and to effect an improvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to begin by emphasising that achieving a consensus among all the political groups facilitated the drafting of the report. I must mention that not a single amendment was tabled and I would like, at the same time, to congratulate Mrs Paliadeli for this result.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worrying that the Commission’s uncooperative behaviour towards the Ombudsman may create a significant lack of trust among citizens in the EU’s institutions. The absence of good cooperation jeopardises the ability of the Ombudsman and the European Parliament to supervise the Commission effectively. I also wish to recall the principle of sincere cooperation stipulated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It entails the consolidation of relations in good faith between the EU’s institutions. Unfortunately, the Ombudsman is very often faced with the Commission’s failure to meet deadlines for providing public access to documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Another worrying aspect is that the Ombudsman had to compile a special report as a last resort to persuade the Commission to be more cooperative. Such incidents should no longer be encountered in future. In this respect, I would like to ask the European Commission to make further efforts to cooperate more efficiently with the Ombudsman. It must not be overlooked that any time the Commission is not going to assume such a commitment, Parliament will be able to apply sanctions. The situation revealed in the report creates a systematic problem. It deprives citizens of one of the key benefits which they expect to gain as a result of the basic right to lodge complaints. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, too, would therefore like to be a little more critical today, Mr Vice-President.</p>
<p class="contents">It can generally be said that the Commission does not, on the whole, tell citizens or Parliament enough about how it monitors the implementation of Community law. At the same time, the Treaty on European Union clearly establishes an active role for EU citizens, for example, with the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI). I am also delighted, Mr Vice-President, that you are here with us today in this debate, as I know that you personally are not only competent but you have an extremely close involvement in the ECI.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, however, the annual reports of the European Commission on monitoring the application of EU law in their current form do not provide Parliament or the people with enough information on the state of affairs. The Commission has so far focused too much on the transposition of European law into national law, while greatly neglecting its actual application. A terse reference to formal proceedings in the case of a Member State which has not yet transposed an EU law at the national level does not tell us or our citizens very much. We must and we want to learn more about cases where the Commission investigates imprecise or completely defective transpositions. Only when we are fully informed of such cases will we be able to talk about consistent monitoring of the application of EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all surely know, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has certain duties and powers in respect of the Commission. This includes monitoring and evaluation. We in the European Parliament have a sincere interest in sensibly evaluating the Commission’s progress in fulfilling your tasks, safeguarding agreements and complying with EU law. However, we do not have sufficient access to the information on the basis of which the Commission handles breaches of regulations. This is not a new request, Mr Vice-President.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in February, in the resolution on the revised framework agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission, we asked the Commission, and I quote: ‘to make available to the European Parliament summary details of all proceedings in matters of breaches of regulations on the basis of an official request, if the European Parliament so desires’, end quotation. I would like to make a strong appeal for the Commission to provide this information to us and, through us, to the citizens of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr Vice-President, I have said several times in my speeches that the European Parliament has a sincere interest in assisting the Commission, and even in supporting it against the Council. We are now making a request to you for the Commission to provide the European Parliament in return with the information we are requesting not only for ourselves, but also for the citizens of the Member States of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Citizens come to us because national or local authorities do not comply with EU legislation, for example, with regard to the protection of human health or the environment. We need only consider the many complaints we have received concerning the long-standing waste crisis in Campania, despite a clear ruling by the European Court of Justice, and concerning the freezing of funds. Nothing has really been done to solve this problem. Both the citizens and the protected environment are suffering. This is what we called ‘fortunate Campania’ – oh dear! The Commission must immediately utilise all means at its disposal in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The treaty assigns the Commission a key role. That is, to monitor the Member States’ compliance with EU legislation. In the committee, we therefore pay close attention to how the Commission deals with infringements of the rules. In light of this, I welcome Mrs Lichtenberger’s report. She makes it absolutely clear that it is not good enough simply to send complaints about the Member States’ infringements back to them for them to resolve themselves. They are the ones that the complaints are about. This leaves citizens utterly high and dry.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would like to compliment the European Ombudsman for having carried out a study on his own initiative precisely on the Commission’s new way of dealing with complaints and infringements, particularly the way the Commission records, or perhaps simply does not record, complaints against Member States for disregarding Community law. The Ombudsman also has the competence to give an opinion on the substance of the matter when the Commission is accused of not having followed up on the infringements, even if, in the final instance, it is, of course, the Court that is to decide the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it will constitute progress if we now adopt the proposal in Mrs Nedelcheva’s report to have a proper law on EU administration procedures, which we finally have a basis for in Article 298 of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that the Ombudsman’s annual report shows many signs of improvements, but it is still worrying that over a third of the complaints relate to a lack of transparency and access to documents and information. In this regard, it is disgraceful that both the Commission and several Member States are trying to protect large lobbyists from the citizens by means of something that clearly looks like abuse of the data protection rules.</p>
<p class="contents">One appalling example in this regard is provided by the Ombudsman’s Special Report on Porsche and the correspondence concerning protection of CO<span class="sub">2</span> limits for cars. Does anyone here believe that a small or medium-sized enterprise was consulted by the Commission concerning access to letters, or that the Commission wanted to delay the case for 15 months for the sake of a small enterprise? Of course not! It was because it was Porsche and, of course, perhaps also because it was Mr Verheugen. The Ombudsman’s Special Report tells a longer story and I would like to recommend that everyone reads both Mrs Paliadeli’s excellent report and the Ombudsman’s report itself. It is great entertainment. It will open your eyes time and again. The most serious aspect of this case, however, is the Commission’s lack of loyal cooperation with the Ombudsman. This is an important report. Parliament needs to come up with a clear statement on this matter. I would like to thank the Ombudsman and Mrs Paliadeli. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is comprehensible, concise and to the point. I therefore highly applaud your efforts and the trouble you have gone to, and I would also like to congratulate you personally in this way. However, I would, at the same time, like to state at this point that I see one systemic problem in the activities of the office of the Ombudsman. That problem is public awareness. Let us concede, namely, that the European Union, as an international organisation, is, to a considerable extent, hard to understand, and not only in terms of its grants, but also in the area of its powers, institutions, decision-making processes and adopted policies and legislation. What I mean by this is that it is hard to understand for the ordinary citizen. The same applies logically to the office of the Ombudsman as well. I am quite sure that if we conducted a survey of European citizens regarding the role of the European Ombudsman and his powers and activities, we would unfortunately find that he is perceived as someone far away and, in many cases, people will not even know that he exists. The facts are relatively clear. A great majority of the complaints submitted by my fellow countrymen from the Czech Republic did not fall within the remit of the European Ombudsman. The situation is no different for other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">When we debated the 2008 report in this place, everyone here called for greater public awareness. Extensive information campaigns were proposed, and website launches were considered. However, I myself made a trial attempt to post a complaint on your website yesterday. I have to say that the interactive guide was too complicated and, to tell the truth, incomprehensible to the ordinary citizen. The actual complaint form is similarly complicated. It reminds me a little of the tax return forms in the Czech Republic, which ordinary citizens cannot complete without a tax advisor. To tell the truth, your website discourages citizens from making complaints. I would therefore like to make an appeal for simplification.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing I consider hugely important is to reduce the time needed for handling cases. Ultimately, we know that if someone makes a complaint, it is of the utmost importance from the perspective of trust that the complaint be handled as quickly as possible, and that the complainant receives a response as quickly as possible. Additionally, if a given issue is not within the competence of the body to which the complaint is addressed, the complaint should be referred directly to the national or regional ombudsman that has the relevant powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, too much communication kills off information. Too much information kills off European citizens. In my opinion, it should be a priority of the Ombudsman not only to resolve but also to prevent incorrect bureaucratic procedures. I therefore consider it key for this institution not to be taken advantage of for media campaigns, and for there to be no extension of its powers. After his election, Ombudsman Diamandouros said: ‘I will continue the effort to improve the quality of European Union administration’. I would therefore like to ask in conclusion what systemic problem have you specifically managed to improve, and what do you intend to turn your attention to in the coming year. I wish you every success in finding systemic solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a very descriptive report covering all activities in 2009 and a large proportion of the complaints, which, incidentally, declined by 9% compared with the previous year. More than half of the complaints relate to the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the complaints that have been made to the Ombudsman criticise poor administrative practices, such as a lack of transparency or denying access to documents. We can be satisfied that a large proportion of these complaints are resolved through the Ombudsman’s handling of them, and that we are therefore going in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives for 2010 were summed up in five objectives: openly listening to suggestions in order to identify best practices, working in order to find ways of achieving quicker results, persuading in order to have a better impact on the administrative culture of the institutions, providing timely, useful information that can be accessed quickly and adapting in order to ensure good resource management, efficiency and effectiveness. I believe that the objectives that were set for 2010 are extremely relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with the need to update mechanisms that will enable us to resolve cases involving a lack of transparency and information, which are certainly arising. We have the example of the Paliadeli report, in relation to the case of Porsche, and as Porsche refused, or rather the Commission refused to publish some of the motor company’s letters, Parliament needs to support the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman also needs to rely on the European Parliament in order to acquire better information on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union overturning the Commission’s decision to publish the list of recipients of common agricultural policy aid is very concerning. In other words, that decision goes against the basic principles of transparency, which should govern everything relating to the European budget, and is a direct attack on the right of Europeans to know who their taxes go to. I think that this is bad practice which we should seek to resolve through Parliament through the necessary legislative changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is, of course, the European Ombudsman’s job to ensure that any private individual or legal entity that encounters problems with the institutions of the European Union in terms of abuse of power or any other form of maladministration can take recourse to him.</p>
<p class="contents">Having read the report, I realise that the success of the institution and its officers is due to the fact that: firstly, most – the figure is already 70% – of investigations are completed within one year and over half – in fact 55% – are completed within three months. That illustrates how fast the European Ombudsman and his associates act and how smoothly this institution operates.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in 80% of the cases dealt with, the Ombudsman was able to help the interested party resolve the issue one way or another, either by referring them to the competent body or by advising which body they needed to contact in order to resolve their problem quickly. This proves how efficient this institution is.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not overlook the fact that 84% of petitions were submitted by private individuals and just 16% were submitted by companies or associations. This, too, proves the high regard which European citizens who feel that they have been the victim of maladministration have for the institution and its representatives. I should like to point out that nine of the cases closed in 2009 are examples of best practice. I must say that I personally was especially pleased by the statement in the introduction to the report that the European Ombudsman intends to help ensure that the European Union can give its citizens the benefits promised to them in the Treaty of Lisbon. My congratulations therefore to Mr Diamandouros. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is very important for us here in this House to support the work he does.</p>
<p class="contents">In his opening speech, the Ombudsman rightly pointed out that his success or failure largely depends on the actions of the institutions. If we consider the Porsche case, for example, then the limits of the Ombudsman’s powers and the lack of seriousness with which some institutions regard his recommendations become quite evident.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is also necessary for us to put our own house in order, for example, in the case of the purchase of the Altero-Spinelli building, where there have been some enormous irregularities. The Ombudsman made some clear recommendations and amendments were issued. However, so far, very little progress has actually been made in Parliament. The amendments were rejected. This demonstrates yet again how the House views these recommendations. What I am getting at is that it is very important for us to put our own house in order and to take the recommendations of the Ombudsman seriously, thereby strengthening his position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the issue of transposing EU law into national systems is a very serious problem within the Union. The same regulations are being introduced by various countries at different times which, in certain respects, is, of course, understandable. However, this should not lead to delays that cause a lack of legal surety and, as a consequence, make it impossible for citizens to exercise their rights. As our rapporteur correctly points out, delays in transposition as well as the incorrect application of EU law bring with them real costs and lead to a lack of trust in EU institutions among citizens. For this reason as well, I welcome all of the Commission’s initiatives such as meetings of experts and bilateral dialogue between the Commission and Member States, the aim of which is to resolve these problems as quickly as possible. I am observing with great interest the EU pilot programme, which is supposed to be a tool enabling a rapid response to all cases of incorrect application or adaptation of EU law to national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also emphasise once again the role that national courts play in the practical application and interpretation of EU law. This role will not be correctly performed, however, if appropriate training is not given, meetings are not held and an EU legal culture is not created. With regard to our Parliament – and I address my fellow Members – the law that we create, because we are legislators, must be clear and comprehensible, for only when it is understandable can it be transposed easily into national systems and will there be fewer problems associated with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I rate very highly the work of Professor Diamandouros, who has been the Ombudsman since 2003, as well as his efforts in informing citizens of opportunities available to them to submit complaints about the incorrect functioning of EU administration and his encouragement of citizens to exercise their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking into account the fact that that only 23% of the more than 3 000 complaints registered in 2009 came within the remit of the Ombudsman, he should absolutely continue his activities in the field of information. Due to his limited competences, he is only able to investigate complaints regarding European Union institutions and bodies. However, what is important is that everyone who submits to the Ombudsman a complaint that cannot be accepted on formal grounds receives information as to which authority they should turn to in each given case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to stress that the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon significantly strengthens the democratic legitimacy of the Ombudsman and expands his remit into foreign policy. It should also be noted that the Ombudsman is increasingly undertaking action on his own initiative; for example, regarding delayed payments from the European Union, disability and discrimination. His actions have also led to the creation of the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour. Further good news is the fact that the time required to conduct proceedings has been reduced to nine months.</p>
<p class="contents">The high percentage of cases completed in which the institution that a complaint referred to came to an agreement or the case was resolved to the benefit of the complainant also testifies to the effectiveness of the Ombudsman and his good cooperation with other bodies. This occurred in as many as 56% of cases in 2009. I hope that the Ombudsman, supported by us, Parliament and the other institutions, will continue his work with the same energy and even greater effectiveness than to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Openness, the right of access to information, and the right to good governance are all crucial if the public are to have confidence in the ability of the EU institutions to monitor their rights. It is worrying that year after year, the greatest administrative flaw in the system is the lack of transparency, and even a refusal to part with information and documents. In this respect, the Porsche case is very serious. When the Commission waited 15 months before handing over the documents it was asked for, it was seriously neglecting its duty to cooperate honestly with the Ombudsman. This attitude on the part of the Commission sapped the confidence of our citizens in the Commission and harmed the EU’s public image.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that a Commissioner and the Ombudsman are sitting there quietly next to each other, I think it would be a good idea if they began a confidential and thorough discussion about whether they respect one another’s work and whether they are prepared to cooperate and act in accordance with the EU’s very own basic principles. I do not want to blame any single Commissioner in connection with this, but the Commission should have a genuine debate on the matter, because the EU’s public image is certainly not so good that we can afford more cases like Porsche again in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The rights of our citizens have to be respected by the Commission, the Council, and obviously Parliament too – by all the EU institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, it also touches on a sore point, namely, the area where improvements are needed. The Porsche case has just been mentioned. As a German citizen, I must say that I am thoroughly ashamed of what has gone on here. Here we have a German Commissioner and a German car company and correspondence between them. All correspondence between the Commission and other car manufacturers in Italy, Spain and other countries is published, but not the German correspondence. The Ombudsman has issued not one, not two, but three reprimands and yet no action has been taken. Things urgently need to improve. I would like to emphasise this in the strongest possible terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I would like to say is that when we use the word ‘pilots’, we generally think of a group of professionals who spend their working lives high above the ground. I am not quite sure how the Commission hit upon the idea of referring to its new project on how to handle the complaints of European citizens as a ‘pilot project’ because in essence, it offers nothing new. Citizens first lodge well-justified complaints in their own country. No action gets taken there. Hence, they turn to the Commission. What does the Commission do? It sends the complaint on a return flight to its country of origin and, once again, nothing gets done. I do not believe that this is an adequate way of dealing with the concerns and complaints of our citizens and I would like to take this opportunity to ask Commissioner Šefčovič, who I hold in very high regard, to state that he either intends to abandon this project or to reconsider how we can ensure that the complaints of our citizens are sent to the place where they will actually be dealt with and that citizens will receive justice and redress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is it not possible to limit the almost Byzantine way in which this office functions?

The work is certainly rigorous and of good quality, and I would like to thank him for that. I would like to talk about the issue of quantity, rather than quality, as it is interesting to find out how much the public calls upon these services.</p>
<p class="contents">Apparently there are a few thousand complaints, and of these some are not valid. It is, however, interesting to look at why there are not more complaints. In other words, this is a case of ‘glass half empty or glass half full’. I wonder about the extent to which the overly complex and opaque nature of the European institutions themselves and the legislation on which they are based are at the root of the difficult relationship between members of the public and the institutions. In other words, in order to make a complaint, you need to know your rights, and in order to know your rights you need to know the legislation and the mechanisms required to submit that complaint. Therefore, rather than making suggestions to you, Mr Diamandouros, I would like to ask you, as Ombudsman, to make suggestions to Parliament, as a legislative chamber, on simplifying the legislative processes and, as far as possible, the EU’s institutional mechanisms. There is much talk of transparency and clarity, yet simplicity is also a democratic value that we often forget, as it allows wide public access to the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Diamandouros, at present, I am also part of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which holds votes at the same time. I would like to assure you that I will pay attention to their responses on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the facts disclosed in this trenchant report go beyond the realms of mere negligence and indolence. Rather, it is a reasonable conclusion to draw that this sort of behaviour on the part of the Commission is both quite deliberate and nothing less than a calculated course of conduct designed to thwart the hard work of the Ombudsman and to trash the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">His work is difficult enough without the added problem of a Commission that set out, as the facts here show, to impede at every turn the proper conduct of his office. There was a time when, if such shabby conduct on the part of public servants was revealed, both functionaries and the minister responsible would fall on their swords. Instead, I expect we shall see here an arrogant and overweening Commission doing what it does best, thumbing its nose at the public whilst the guilty ones go unpunished.

Most of the complaints concern the Commission, which is regularly late with its response and thus shakes confidence in EU institutions. We need to increase transparency by optimising the work of the institutions and by means of more extensive communication, while at the same time ensuring that these measures do not increase expenses. The EU has already spent an enormous amount on propaganda and self-advertisement.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the number of complaints will doubtless continue to grow with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the incomplete or delayed implementation of European legislation by Member States. In order to prevent this, expanded and harmonised judicial training must be provided for national judges, practising jurists, public and administrative officials. In addition, we need to inform citizens that infringements of EU law can be challenged before the national courts concerned as well. In the first half of 2011, Hungary will hold the rotating Presidency of the European Union, and thus we, Hungarian MEPs, will be charged with a major task, namely, the transposition of legal harmonisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Taking a concept originally developed in Sweden, ombudsmen have been trying to resolve disputes and problems on an impartial basis for 200 years now. I believe that the idea of an ombudsman derives from a deep human need for the resolution of disputes by peaceful means.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is the fifteenth such report by the Ombudsman for Europe and the seventh by Mr Diamandouros. This is a record to be proud of and I would like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros. When he was elected last year, I expressed the hope that the Ombudsman would do his utmost to ensure that the decision-making process within the EU was more transparent and relevant to its citizens and that we would collaborate effectively with the Committee on Petitions. I think we can safely say that together, we have succeeded in this. I still see room for improvement in the coordination between the functions and tasks of the Ombudsman and those of the Committee on Petitions. We are increasingly in receipt of petitions that touch on aspects of the classic right of petition, as well as elements of the Ombudsman’s duties. I am talking about human rights, property rights and obstacles to economic activity. It is reasonable and appropriate that we should work together in these areas so that we can tackle the Commission together in a positive sense and get the relevant responses within the required timeframe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to welcome the new website with the interactive guidelines that should help ensure that people are made aware of the opportunities available to them to have their voice heard in Europe. I hope that Mr Diamandouros continues to succeed in his good and important work and that he will manage to introduce improvements wherever possible. The Committee on Petitions will also continue to do all it can to promote close cooperation with the Ombudsman in the future in the interests of the citizens of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is the interests of European citizens; the second is reconciliation between European citizens and the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The three reports by the three rapporteurs, which are truly exceptional, and the activities of the European Ombudsman, make me think of Mr Diamandouros, on behalf of the citizens of Europe, as D’Artagnan and the three rapporteurs as the three musketeers safeguarding the interests of the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a real pity that the European Commission is not as involved in this as it should be. For me, the only positive thing about the Commissioner’s position statement today was the speed of his speech. If the European Commission acted at the same speed, we would have had no need for this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important for the European citizens to have trust in the European institutions, to see them in a positive light, and to feel that they are working in their interests. Fifteen month’s delay, as Mrs Paliadeli said in her report – to see three letters from an automobile manufacturer which specialises in fast cars, what an oxymoron. If it were the interests of a single European citizen, rather than of an automobile manufacturer, that were at stake, would the delay have been so long? I wonder.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, I think that we should be honest. We all need to work together, we need to show confidence in what the Commissioner said, to believe that the Commission is prepared to cooperate with the European Ombudsman, and we all need to work for the interests of the citizens of Europe. Let us hope that the Commission acts as quickly as the Commissioner spoke. He certainly gave the interpreters a run for their money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Particularly in cases where the Commission is acting in a matter of a breach caused by the incorrect transposition of EU law, it would be good in future to state at least basic information on the nature and extent of the breach. The European Parliament has already sought better information on proceedings involving breaches, through a formal request in the resolution of 4 February 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard it as a positive signal from the speech of European Commission Vice-President Šefčovič that the Commission intends to review the possibility of introducing procedural rules for investigations, setting out various aspects of the procedure for breaches of the law, including time limits, the right to a hearing, the obligation to provide reasons and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that close cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament can lead to a better and more transparent mechanism for monitoring the application of EU law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am particularly pleased that with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU now oversees compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights as well, primarily by ensuring compliance with the right to good administration. I find the European network of ombudsmen extremely useful, since citizen awareness and the quality of public service in certain Member States, including Romania where I come from, are below the European average. This is also reflected in the report on the Ombudsman’s activities. It is for this reason that I ask the Ombudsman to attempt, in future, to collect the complaints submitted to national ombudsmen on the implementation of European law by Member States, as well, since in most cases, citizens come into contact with European law through their own national authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, since the instruments recently made available by the Treaty of Lisbon grant the citizens legislative initiative, it is now fair to say that Parliament closely identifies with citizens’ demands and expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the effective application of the law depends primarily on how well the Commission performs, with the Ombudsman’s authoritative support.

The role of the European Ombudsman is particularly important for helping citizens to clear up problems that have arisen, and for improving the transparency and accountability of the institutions’ work. The European Ombudsman wants the decisions of the European Union institutions to be accessible to citizens, because citizens must have an opportunity to obtain desired information, so that they can trust the institutions’ ability to defend their rights as regards discrimination, abuse of power by institutions, failure to reply promptly to enquiries and refusal of information. The Commission is receiving numerous complaints about maladministration. Therefore, it is important for the Commission to take action to ensure that requests to access documents receive swift responses, because the proper application of European Union legislation has a direct impact on the daily lives of citizens and the implementation of their rights. Furthermore, inappropriate application of legislation undermines confidence in European Union institutions and leads to additional costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the rapporteur correctly pointed out, the last year of the Ombudsman’s work has seen good management and progress in reducing the number of complaints and a shortening of the procedure for investigating complaints. I think this is also an effect of continuity in holding office. As can be seen, the selection of Mr Diamandouros was a very good decision. The Ombudsman, however, must react quicker to the needs of citizens. For this to be possible, he must cooperate more closely with national ombudsmen. The function of European Ombudsman is a role that changes with time, but it must present a set of constant and universal values. I believe that in his coming year of office he will listen more strenuously to the voices of the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would particularly like to congratulate him on the fact that he has striven to reduce the waiting time for registered procedures because I believe this is the right step towards bringing the European Union institutions closer to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wanted to make was to underline the great importance of interinstitutional cooperation, as my fellow Members also did. I believe that our experience with the Ombudsman, especially the current one, reflects the extent of the cooperation that exists between this Chamber, this Parliament and, in particular, the Committee on Petitions, and the Ombudsman’s bureau.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would like to appeal to the Commissioner present, Mr Šefčovič, to follow our lead, as I believe that in the area of citizens’ complaints, the European Commission is not cooperating with the Parliament as much as the Ombudsman is. We are aware that many citizens complain directly to the European Commission but we do not really have an idea of how many people are complaining to the European Commission, what they are complaining about, and what the ultimate outcome of those complaints is.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we are informed of all complaints that arrive before the Ombudsman, and those that arrive before the Committee on Petitions are known because they are public.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to pass on a message to the citizens. Upon reading the report, it will emerge that, proportionately, the higher number of complaints, coincidentally, originate from Malta and Luxembourg. This is interesting, and I do not think it is simply because the people from Malta and Luxembourg complain rather a lot, but because these citizens are standing up for their rights, and I believe that it is important that they do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the responsibility of all the European institutions to do everything in their power so that citizens are informed of all their means of redress if there are violations of Community law or bad administration by European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to praise the work of my colleague, Mrs Nedelcheva, for her report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2009. The European Commission has been the object of most of the Ombudsman’s criticism, often for a lack of information. The report by my fellow Member, Mrs Paliadeli, whom I would also like to congratulate, is a glaring example.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I would like to thank our European Ombudsman for all the work that has been accomplished, together with his whole team, and for his accessibility and his excellent collaboration with the Committee on Petitions. This is very important. His role represents an important safeguard of respect for the principle of transparency and good administration, and it is there that we will obtain genuine protection for our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is time that our fellow citizens were better informed of the means of redress available to them with regard to the European Commission: namely, the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions. In order to do that, we need an Internet portal, certainly, but we need a common one, as we have already requested from you.

<p class="contents">Much of what I am about to say does not directly impact on the Ombudsman, but I think it needs to be placed on the record. Some of the biggest problems and complaints we get are about our own Member States. Citizens then complain – as Mr Busuttil said – directly to the Commission who, under this pilot scheme, go back to the Member State to try to have the matter resolved when the citizens themselves have failed. That mechanism is not transparent and needs to be looked at. We need a discussion on it in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue which arises relates to property purchases and transactions between citizens in different Member States. We have no remit in this area, but it is a growing concern and we need to address it in some way.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Irish Ombudsman has issued two reports, which our own government have rejected. It is of deep concern that an Ombudsman in any Member State would have their work literally torn up. You are aware of that, Mr Ombudsman. I am glad that you are nodding approvingly.

However, there is not much sign of this in the European Parliament itself. On the contrary, one gets the feeling that bureaucratic paperwork seems to grow by the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Prior to the hearings for the most recent elections, the word transparency was on everyone’s lips. Thanks to the authority of their office and the associated rights, Members of Parliament can have their voices heard. The same cannot be said for the citizens of Europe. That is why they have the European Ombudsman. When more than one third of the investigations by the Ombudsman were cases where there was a lack of transparency and when 56% of all cases were resolved amicably, the importance of the office of the Ombudsman is clearly evident.</p>
<p class="contents">To quote the words of the Ombudsman himself: Citizens have a right to know what the EU and its administration are doing. Perhaps I might expand on this by saying that our citizens also have a right to know how the European Union spends their taxes and where resources are wasted. It is high time that budgetary control was whipped into shape, so that its reports might even be somewhere near as useful as those of the Ombudsman. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maroš Šefčovič, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, in my introductory remarks, I talked too fast, so I will try to correct this. I will not try to impress the Members of Parliament with the speed of my speech but with the commitment which I am very clearly making here that the Commission is very much interested in having the best possible close cooperation with the Ombudsman. I think Mr Diamandouros knows this.</p>
<p class="contents">He knows how closely we cooperate, and I think that the success rate in sorting out the problems of maladministration or other issues that he is investigating is so high because we are cooperating very closely and in a very positive spirit. Of course, sometimes you have cases with which there are additional problems which need more energy to tackle, and this was clearly true of the case to which most of you have referred.</p>
<p class="contents">This was very clearly a situation where the Commission was torn between, on the one hand, the commitment to transparency and the legal obligations stemming from European Court of Justice case-law and, on the other, our commitment to honour professional secrecy. If we wanted to divulge the information – which was very pertinent in this particular case – we needed the agreement of the third party, which we have spent several months trying unsuccessfully to get. Only after we made it very clear that we would publish the information anyway and informed the company that they had ten days to lodge a complaint with the European Court of Justice did we reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">What would have happened if we had not proceeded according to our legal obligations? The complaint would probably have been filed with the European Court of Justice, and maybe we would not have had that information made public even today. So please bear with us sometimes. We are really very committed to transparency, but we must always look for a very fine line among the different commitments that we have to respect in these very complex cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I acknowledge – as I said in my introductory remarks – that this delay was long, and that we should probably have pressed the company more. We should have got their response faster, and I can assure you that the Commission will do its utmost to ensure that we will not replicate this situation in any similar cases – we will not look for ways to drag the process out to 15 months, which was indeed unbearable. I fully agree with Mrs Paliadeli in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the access to information: again, let us just keep the numbers in proportion. We receive around 5 000 requests per year and we have 80 people working on them. Some of the files we have to make accessible are <span class="italic">this</span> thick. Many of them are citizens’ requests, but I can tell you that many of them are questions from very distinguished law firms trying to get additional information on very sensitive competition files. We have to be very careful with this process. I think we are doing a good job in this respect, because of these 5 000 files, only 15 to 20 end up on the Ombudsman’s desk. 85% of these requests are granted access at first request, so you can calculate how many thousand files become accessible every year. We are very serious about this commitment and we will continue to proceed in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning EU transposition and implementation: here, I can assure you that we are seeking very close cooperation with the European Parliament. We are fully aware that appropriate speedy transposition and correct implementation are things that glue the European Union together. They are absolutely essential for the good working of the single market. Therefore, we try to make absolutely sure that, in terms of the implementation and transposition of European law, we are very precise and very strict. If you will allow me to quote, we already agreed in the framework agreement that:</p>
<p class="contents">‘In order to ensure better monitoring of the transposition and application of Union law, the Commission and Parliament shall endeavour to include compulsory correlation tables and a binding time limit for transposition, which, in directives, should not normally exceed a period of 2 years.</p>
<p class="contents">‘In addition to specific reports and the annual report on the application of Union law, the Commission shall make available to Parliament summary information concerning all infringement procedures from the letter of formal notice, including, if so requested by Parliament, on a case-by-case basis and respecting the confidentiality rules, in particular, those acknowledged by the Court of Justice of the European Union, on the issues to which the infringement procedure relates’.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is an additional way in which we can communicate and keep the European Parliament better informed. If I may ask the assistance of the European Parliament in this particular area, I would like to ask you to insist a little bit more on correlation tables where directives are concerned. This is always the Commission’s proposal. We cannot always get it through in the final procedures when the legislator is finalising the negotiations on the Commission’s proposal, but this is possible in Parliament and the Council. The correlation tables make it much easier for the Commission to police the correct application of European law and to find errors and look for corrections.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to Mr Hefner’s question concerning the EU pilot and why it is so named: this is because, when we started with this new project on creating additional possibilities for the Member States to correct their mistakes themselves more quickly, it was an accepted procedure which was started by a few Member States. Now, most of them apply it. We are still in the initial phase. So far, the results are very positive. Of course, when we reach the stage when all Member States are using this tool for better and faster application of European law, I am sure we will look for another name, because it will no longer be a pilot project.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Madam President, I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament and, of course, our Ombudsman, for the very satisfactory cooperation, and for a very good debate and the many new ideas which I heard this morning in the debate. I would just like to remind all of us that, thanks to the Lisbon Treaty, citizens have the right to good administration. The respect of European law is, of course, key to that – to the EU’s level playing field. I am sure that, together with the European Parliament and with the Ombudsman, we will achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">Seeing Madam Durant presiding over our session this morning, I would like to highlight one additional element. This is the fact that we managed to finalise agreement on the joint EU transparency register, which will bring additional light and transparency to lobbying activities and the activities of interest representatives in Brussels. I think this is also a very important contribution to the increased transparency and higher quality of the EU legislative process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nikiforos Diamandouros, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Ombudsman. </span>– Madam President, first of all, I wish to thank very warmly all the Members who took the time to comment on my report. I want to thank them for their warm endorsement of the work of the Ombudsman. I derive a great deal of satisfaction, but also inspiration, from the kind of encouragement I receive from you, and I want to say to you openly that this kind of encouragement also increases the sense of responsibility that I feel is being put on my shoulders for carrying forward efforts to defend the rights of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank you very much for that – for your concerns in relation not only to the annual report, but also of course to the special report – and to thank the two rapporteurs who took the time to prepare excellent reports on my annual report and my special report. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Allow me, too, to thank Mrs Nedelcheva for her comments. I particularly want to say to you, Mrs Nedelcheva, that I have taken note of your comments, which have encouraged me to try to engage in dialogue with my national colleagues on the correct application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that next year, during the next meeting of national ombudsmen in Copenhagen, I will be able to give emphasis to exactly that point. You therefore have my assurance, and I thank you also for your comments concerning the importance of the interactive guide, which has also already been mentioned by your fellow Members from other parties. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, allow me now to focus on some of the remarks by Vice-President Šefčovič. Let me begin with a general remark. I wish to make it clear to this Chamber that Mr Šefčovič has gone out of his way to try and work very closely with the Ombudsman, and I am very grateful to him for what he has done so far.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to make it clear to this Chamber that Mr Šefčovič, upon assuming his duties, in effect – these are my words – reversed the position of his predecessor and publicly acknowledged that, when it came to the Porsche situation, the Commission’s response had been unsatisfactory and regrettable. Therefore, I wish to draw a distinction between the person of the Commissioner and the Commission’s institutional response to this issue, which resulted in my needing – for the first time in 15 years – to feel constrained to submit a report to this body concerning that behaviour. It behoves me to make this distinction concerning the handling of the situation, and again to thank Mr Šefčovič for his efforts in trying to move forward and to be constructive in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, let me say a few more things. Commissioner, I consider the 2002 communication concerning citizens of fundamental importance for the application of good administration of the Union. If, therefore, the Commission is considering changing this communication, I should very much hope that the Commission will see to it that it consults both the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament before actually changing what is an instrument of fundamental importance for the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very much in agreement – and I am glad that you in fact also mentioned this – that the courts are the highest and the only authority which can take decisions on an authoritative interpretation of the law. I am very glad that the Commission also acknowledges that. In terms of draft recommendations, let me just make a small clarification, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">A draft recommendation constitutes a finding of maladministration by the Ombudsman. That does not prevent the institution involved from responding to this particular draft recommendation and rectifying the matter, and I will take that into consideration for closing the case. Therefore, a press release at the point of having found an instance of maladministration is in no way intended to pre-empt or to prevent an institution from being able to respond, and I want you to have my assurance personally on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as concerns the special report, again a clarification. The report was submitted because of the excessive delay. It was not – because I noted your regret – that it was released just after the Commission had released the documents. The two were unrelated. It was the great length of the response that prompted the report, and I was very happy to have had the response as I did. But again, you have adopted a position on that one.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that there will be an effort to try and deal with the delays. What I will say about the delays, Commissioner, is that I expect the Commission to be able to abide by the rules concerning delays that it has itself adopted and is trying to abide by. I will abide by my deadlines in terms of dealing with this kind of situation. I think this will result in a better outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall say two more things. I want to thank Mr Vlasák – I hope I am pronouncing the name correctly, because my Czech is non-existent – for his remarks, because it gives me the opportunity to say that I am actively looking forward to the possibility of making use of the facilities of the Eurobarometer in order to be able to find out more about what citizens think and feel about the Ombudsman and about the handling of complaints. I want to thank him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I will do my best to see how the website can become user-friendly. Let me just assure him that we put it through very many pilot phases and very many target groups, and they all found it very user friendly. More than 46 000 people have used it so far, and they were guided to the right place the first time around. I want to assure him that this is what we are doing in order to be able to combat maladministration and that the interactive guide has very much helped reduce maladministration in the institutions as a response to his question.</p>
<p class="contents">Two more things. Ms Geringer de Oedenberg: it may not be easy to grasp that the vast majority of the complaints, whether to the European Ombudsman or the national ombudsman, do indeed deal with EU law. Therefore, we have the network of ombudsmen that I coordinate in order to be able to send the complaints to the right institution from the very beginning so as to avoid problems. Focusing only on what lies within the ombudsman’s mandate neglects the fact that the network ensures that the bulk of the complaints go to the right national regional ombudsman concerning EU law and that are dealt with there.</p>
<p class="contents">A comment on Mr Migalski’s question. I can assure him that the Ombudsman’s budget was approved by the Council without any change. We are very mindful of the constraints, but we are also encouraged by the fact that the major budgetary institution – not only Parliament – has approved it.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Szegedi’s question, we agree emphatically that the courts of the Member States do not know EU law sufficiently well, and I make a special point in my visits to all the Member States, where I have been many times, of visiting the judiciary to be able to help them move in this particular direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and I will close with this – Mr Sógor also asked for the Ombudsman to be able to receive complaints concerning EU law submitted at national level. Regrettably, this is not in my mandate. I would be violating my mandate if I were to accept this task, and I would also be encroaching on the legal responsibilities and mandate of my colleagues in the Member States if I were to do it. I try to collaborate with them to do it, but I have no authority to receive complaints that concern the application of EU law in the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Madam President, I hope that I have responded to all the comments, and I would like once again to thank all Members for their words of encouragement, and also to congratulate you, Madam President, as the Commissioner has already done, for the important initiative aiming to approve a joint register for Parliament and the Commission. I am convinced that this will be a very important step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will make use of this opportunity to thank my colleagues from the Committee on Petitions, who, through their work, are creating a more tangible link between European citizens and the institutions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Diamandouros, the year 2009 marked the 15th anniversary of the institution of the European Ombudsman. It also marked the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. As a result of your election by the European Parliament, an additional legitimacy has been added to your function. I say ‘added’ because, in fact, the legitimacy of your function originates from all those European citizens who have been able to turn to you and who have been able to find a solution thanks to your interventions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, what is more fascinating about the function of the European Ombudsman is that nothing can ever be taken for granted. The reduction in the number of complaints, the reduction in the time spent on finding a solution, the complaints that have been settled amicably – there are always as many advances as there are needs. Behind these facts, I think that there are two major challenges that we should not lose sight of: obtaining more transparency in the functioning of the institutions, and having a better dialogue between citizens and the institutions both at a European and at a national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you, Mr Diamandouros, and I will conclude by saying that, as a result of your everyday work, we have concrete evidence that it is possible not only to take up these challenges but, above all, to provide adequate and satisfactory answers for citizens. The task is certainly not an easy one, but with the 2009 annual report and with the commitment that you have just made for the Copenhagen meeting, I believe that we are on the right track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is very important for me.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that fifteen months’ delay to its reply and its final decision, successive extensions to the initial deadline and, more importantly, what I consider to be the Commission’s curious decision not to disclose the letter prepared for this particular automobile manufacturer, telling it that it would disclose some of its letters, are serious issues; the decision not to disclose the letter is a very serious issue.</p>
<p class="contents">If, after such a long time – and this is not your fault, Commissioner, you only took over this particular sector recently; if the Commission had decided to disclose the letter which it had prepared for this particular automobile manufacturer to Mr Diamandouros on 18 February, there would probably have been no special report. Mr Diamandouros decided to agree to the successive extensions requested by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I consider that, thanks to this delay, thanks to the Commission’s failure to advise Mr Diamandouros, we were able to have a report which records issues which have both form and substance. I only intend to discuss the substance. However, the Commission must take serious account of the fact – and I am glad that you said it before I did – that any difficulties which you cause the European Ombudsman in his work harms the unity of the European Union, undermines the trust of its citizens in its institutions and damages the public image of its function.</p>
<p class="contents">We want what you said earlier to be a commitment, because we are all jointly responsible. My thanks in particular to Mr Diamandouros because, thanks to this report, he gave us an opportunity to understand in the European Parliament our power to address issues which we consider to be paramount to European cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe his work is very valuable and I am aware how important it is to our citizens because his office has become a key point of contact for them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to come back to what Mr Šefčovič had to say, particularly in relation to the EU pilot project, which has been criticised sharply by a number of Members of Parliament because, as you stated clearly yourself, it offers ‘more possibilities for Member States’ but not for citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we need to take a closer look to see if this is really the case, because what we need is greater transparency. A letter to a complainant stating that we have received his complaint is not enough. We need greater clarity here, more relevance to our citizens, otherwise we are going to have a credibility problem in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, of course we need some meaningful penalties when genuine infringements are encountered. The consequences for Member States, who fail to implement legislation, and who actually even boast about this in their national media, cannot simply be that they merely receive another letter. We need to take things a step further when it comes to the interests of the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is of central importance that the 2002 communication should be revised, particularly in relation to the rights of the complainant. In this context, I would also like to see the rights of Parliament respected. We need a register of the complaints received in order to offer us some feedback for our legislative work. I do not need to know who complained to whom about what.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject matter of the complaint and the consequences of the complaint would provide important feedback for the entire legislature. That is what we need. It is for that reason that I ask you also to take this into account. We need a clear register that provides us with an insight into the main causes for complaint and what is being called for.

With regard to internal market legislation, there is a great deal of progress which can be made, especially in relation to the Services Directive or the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications. This legislation is admittedly technical, which complicates the application process. For this reason, cooperation is vital between EU institutions and national administrations. The internal market information system used for services has proved to be particularly useful. I believe that we would stand to gain by extending its use to other sectors. However, I urge the need for Member States to take transposition seriously and avoid delays as far as possible, which results in the internal market operating with its parameters at suboptimal level. Finally, I urge the need for citizens to be able to resolve their problems relating to the application of European law quickly and at minimum cost. To achieve this, the SOLVIT resources need to be supplemented, along with active promotion of this instrument for solving problems informally. Last but not least, priority must be given to devising alternative methods for settling disputes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was pleased that when examining citizens’ complaints registered with the Ombudsman, the author of the report, Mrs Nedelcheva, devoted special attention to the relation between transparency and good administration. The right to good administration has become legally binding under the terms of the Treaty of Lisbon, and along with that right, it is also important that personal rights are fully respected.</p>
<p class="contents">In a recent discussion with Mr Diamandouros, we debated the delicate balance between institutional transparency and data protection. We specifically addressed the judgment issued in June by the European Court of Justice in the Bavarian Lager case as well, which moved the debates on transparency out of its dead end. This is very significant because it provides guidelines for cases where a real or perceived common interest is in conflict with personal data protection rights. I was very pleased that Mr Diamandouros, too, emphasised the basic principle according to which personal data can only be disclosed with the permission of the persons concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think it important to emphasise that I fully support the efforts aimed at rendering the work of the European Union’s institutions more transparent and establishing a basis for appropriate administrative techniques. According to the annual report, it is precisely the promotion of this aim that lies at the centre of the activities of the European Ombudsman</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall remind you that, in accordance with the office he occupies, Mr Apsītis is tasked with the following duties: 1. To promote compliance with the principle of equality and the prevention of discrimination. In Latvia, this exists in the field of education. 2. To promote the objective review of legal and other issues within reasonable timescales. Latvia has already lost around 10 cases in the European Court on this issue. 3. To ensure the prevention of deficiencies in questions concerning infringements of human rights. Around 300 000 people in Latvia, many of whom have lived in Latvia all their lives, have had their basic civil rights taken away from them. Today in Latvia, the word ‘ombudsman’ makes one smile.

The Commission has drawn up two legislative proposals: two proposals for regulations that are before this House to replace the regulations that are now coming to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since the initial regulations were adopted. There have been significant changes in legislation, especially the 2003 modernisation package, crucial legal judgments have been passed in this area and the Commission has learnt quite a lot from practice, which is also an important aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission opened two rounds of consultations with those concerned, which is good practice in the spirit of legislating well and having public support. The big question now is as follows: what use is it going to make of the responses from those concerned during the consultation? Is it going to take notice of them or are these opinions simply going to be thrown in the bin? In this context, what Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs want to know is essentially six things. What are the suggestions and specific ideas that the stakeholders have put forward that the Commission is going to take into account when it comes to designing and defining these regulations and taking them from ‘the muses to the theatre’?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what does the Commission think about the horizontal agreements that are not covered by the exemption regulations on specialisation or research and development. What did the stakeholders say in this round of consultations? What would be the advantages from the point of view of industry, the real economy and protecting competition, of proposing new regulations to take into account horizontal agreements that are not covered by the two block exemption regulations that we are currently considering? Does the Commission intend to draw up new regulations to cover them? Yes or no? The question is relatively clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The third problem that was debated at length in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is the subject of what is known as ‘patent ambush’, which, as the Commissioner is aware, takes place when one of the stakeholder companies that is participating in establishing standards withholds information on the patents that it holds or the patents that it is planning to register in future. This causes serious damage and inconvenience to those companies that are unaware of that information and commit to acting according to the parameters established.</p>
<p class="contents">The question here is relatively specific as this is a case of distortion of competition and barriers in the internal market, which is the cardinal sin in our institution: does the Commission intend to tackle the problem of ‘patent ambush’ in the framework of the new draft regulations, or otherwise, does it consider that complementary sector-specific legislation would be necessary to avoid abuse of patent rights? Is the Commission committed to ensuring that there is an integrated, consistent legislative framework without internal contradictions between competition rules and sector-specific legislation in the area of intellectual property rights?</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and fifth questions relate to economic governance or, if you prefer, governance of competition. We have learnt that we need to try to converge with other competition authorities and, in this respect, it is important to know to what extent the Commission, in drawing up these regulations, has made use of court decisions and the decisions of national and international authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The last question refers to a subject that is a particularly sensitive one for my committee, and I am sure that Mr Schwab will have something to say about it. It refers to the marketing chain for food products. It seems obvious that there is inequality in conditions among producers, between farmers, on the one hand, and large chains, on the other. Does the Commission intend to do something to guarantee equal, fair treatment for the weaker party in this contract? These are the questions, Commissioner, that I would like to you to answer as fully, clearly and precisely as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Competing companies often work together, for instance, in research and development, production, purchasing, product standardisation and information exchange. As you know, this can be beneficial to consumers and lead to lower prices, more choice and better products. These horizontal agreements – we call them horizontal because the cooperating companies are active at the same level in the supply chain – can allow companies to respond to increasing competitive pressures and a changing market place driven by globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is also a risk that this kind of agreement can lead to serious competition problems, for example, where the parties agree to fix prices, share markets or limit output. The Commission has spent the past two years reviewing the competition guidelines for horizontal agreements, with in-depth assessment and wide consultation. The new rules, which should be adopted by the end of this year, will be much more detailed, user-friendly and clear, providing better guidance on what kinds of cooperation are allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">As always, the Commission has had to strike a careful balance between the needs of different stakeholders. The two main elements of the new competition rules are on standard-setting and information exchange. In the responses to the public consultation, around two-thirds of stakeholders commented on standardisation.</p>
<p class="contents">A well-functioning system for standard-setting is vital for the European economy as a whole and, in particular, for the information and communication technology sector. The horizontal guidelines promote a standard-setting system that is transparent and that leads to predictable costs when licensing intellectual property rights. This requires attempting to find a balance between the sometimes contradictory interests of companies with different business models involved in the standard-setting process. At one end of the spectrum, you have the pure innovator and, at the other, the pure manufacturer, each with different priorities and needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The new rules will make sure both that there are sufficient incentives for further innovation and that the traditional benefits from standardisations are passed on to consumers. In order for standard-setting agreements to avoid having to be assessed under the competition rules and to fall within the so-called safe harbour – meaning where they are presumed to be in line with the competition rules – there are three general conditions that need to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that a standard-setting organisation needs to have a balanced IPR policy, requiring good-faith disclosure of the relevant IPRs, and a commitment to licensing these on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The second is that the process of standard-setting must be open and transparent so that participation is open to all relevant actors. The third is that the standard-setting process must also be transparent in a way that ensures that stakeholders are able to inform themselves of upcoming, ongoing and finalised work.</p>
<p class="contents">You also mentioned patent ambushes. Case experience, both in the EU and in the US, shows that patent ambush can be a real problem by preventing industry from making an informed choice on the potential costs of the technologies chosen in the standard. The Commission approach is to give standard-setting organisations incentives to have clear rules on disclosure of patents. Although this does not completely remove the risk, it does reduce it.</p>
<p class="contents">By contrast, for R&amp;D agreements where there are a limited number of parties – often only two – the public consultation showed that stakeholders considered that there is, in practice, no real problem of patent ambush as the parties have an incentive to bring innovations to market and any potential problems can be solved upfront by contractual means between parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to information exchange, this can be pro-competitive when it enables companies to gather general market data that allow them to serve customers better. However, there are also situations where the exchange of market information can be misused, for instance, when companies use sensitive information to coordinate behaviour. In response to strong stakeholder demand, the guidelines contain a new chapter setting out general principles for competition assessment of information exchange.</p>
<p class="contents">The last question that was raised by Parliament related to the question of purchasing cooperatives. The Commission has consistently believed that joint purchasing groups amongst small retailers can be beneficial for competition, especially vis-à-vis large suppliers. The horizontal guidelines have, since 2000, provided for a positive assessment for this type of cooperation up to certain limits of market share. Following its review process, the Commission is proposing that for purchasing agreements, as long as the market share of participants is 20% or less, it will be presumed to be in line with the competition rules. But the Commission is also aware that international buying alliances among large retailers may have a negative impact on competition, with issues being examined in the context of the Commission’s work on a better functioning food supply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly, we do not like to pay too much as a result of a dishonourable deal between businesses. Competition policy in the European Union has, hitherto, targeted dishonest businesses. The regulation of horizontal cooperation between businesses is one of the ways in which, to my mind, the Commission is successfully solving the problem of competition where businesses cooperate on matters such as research and development, full exploitation of the volume of production, the distribution of common goods and standardisation. The attention to the question of standardisation in the new rules on business cooperation is welcome. It will allow businesses and sectors to make a clear choice with regard to patents that they wish to make use of. Every standard consists of patents registered by inventors and businesses. In order to introduce a standard, it is necessary to know what precise technological solution is being offered and what consideration the patent holder wishes to receive for the use of his patent. That is why we should support a mechanism in which all interested parties in the course of choosing a standard are clearly aware of the advantages and disadvantages of one invention or another and of the price they will pay for using the patent. We like to make informed choices in our day-to-day lives, and so it is only natural that businesses investing significant funds in the development and manufacture of new technologies with high added value should also wish to make such a choice. To my mind, these new rules on horizontal cooperation between businesses will at least partly help businesses not to pay excessively for making use of patents.

There are cooperation agreements between companies competing at the same market level that are competitive and in line with the original source of European Union law.</p>
<p class="contents">For reasons of legal security, given the complexity of the subject and the balances that have to be achieved, businesses need to have tools to determine what horizontal agreements infringe the prohibitions laid down in the treaty and restrict competition.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a critical time, because the guidelines for horizontal agreements are a decade old and the block exemption regulations for specialisation agreements and innovation and development agreements expire at the end of this year. The Union must therefore update these instruments without delay, and cannot afford the luxury of a legislative loophole that generates doubts, uncertainties and paralysis in the activities of our businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">This would be an intolerable curb on our economy and hugely irresponsible in the context of a crisis that requires initiatives to help restart and boost business. Moreover, as the timescale for the review is extended to 31 December 2022, they must equip European industry with measures for dealing with the major changes that are going to take place on the international economic stage in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, the European Union adopted the Europe 2020 strategy, under the Spanish Presidency, which is a firm commitment to an integrative society based on knowledge and innovation. The new legislative framework must promote the development of an intelligent, connected economy that is capable of connecting business networks and taking advantage of the synergies between businesses through agreements promoting standardisation, specialisation, research and development to benefit European consumers, but also agreements that contribute towards joint production, purchase, marketing and promoting cooperatives and business groups, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the Commission in using this package of initiatives to increase efficiency, promote scientific and technical progress, provide benefits to end consumers and, in short, improve the overall competitiveness and sustainable development of our businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will limit myself to two comments which are somewhat more general and political.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in all our countries, the crisis has made people withdraw and has given rise to nationalist and protectionist temptations, and we in Parliament are therefore particularly vigilant when it comes to respect for the internal market and its non-fragmentation. There is a challenge here – I can see some colleagues from the relevant committee are nodding. This is very important, and we know that Commissioner Barnier is working towards this, in support of Mr Monti’s report. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe truly believe in emulation which stimulates innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also realise that European businesses are in a global competition, and that, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises and, above all, for research and development, it is particularly important to build bridges, and we need to ensure that competition does not turn into mutual destruction, to the advantage of businesses in other areas of the world which, in addition, do not always practise very fair competition with respect to their competitors. For us, it is therefore very important that we manage to find a means of avoiding abuses of the patent while allowing competition and, of course, while respecting property rights, as has been mentioned. As is often the case, this involves a very delicate balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to conclude, I want to emphasise very strongly that I agree with what Mr García-Margallo y Marfil said about competition in the area of food products. We have a very strange situation in Europe where we look very thoroughly at competition in certain sectors and much less thoroughly in others. It is clear that the lack of proportion between the number of producers and the number of purchasers poses problems of competition. I am therefore delighted, Commissioner, that you have supported what Mr García-Margallo y Marfil said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the draft from May 2010 contains some important changes, particularly in the areas of standards and the exchange of information, as already discussed. Both of these will bring greater legal certainty and clearer rules for businesses, something that is extremely important for compliance<span class="italic">.</span> We have already heard that compliance in the European internal market is a principle that must be followed by all businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition and innovation are key elements for our economy, which is why it is important to adapt the 2009 rules to our present situation and to introduce effective mechanisms to promote compliance and the implementation of competition law for businesses and public bodies. It is for this reason that the parliamentary question was backed by such a large majority in the Committee, something I welcome very much. I would like to ask something about what you have just said. The fact is that the purchasing agreements of large, international chain stores can be categorised as horizontal cooperation agreements. In last year’s communication on the functioning of the food supply chain in Europe, you were highly critical of the power of demand, but now you seem to view this very positively. You have just said that cooperation among small retailers is something you welcome, provided the purchasing agreements are in the order of up to a 20% share of the market. My question to you is: what is the reason for this change in how you view these horizontal purchasing agreements? What has motivated this change of heart? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much agree with all those who have been calling for fair competition because only fair competition can lead to fair practice and, of course, to real and not fixed prices. This is very important for Europe’s citizens: how to create a conducive environment so we can achieve positive results but prevent the possibility, on the market, of fixed prices.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that we are looking at all possible ways of achieving a solution under which the prices for the patents would not be too high. You know very well from the debate on this issue how very difficult that is. I can tell you that we in the Commission are very unhappy with the delay – we have not been able to find an appropriate solution for the patent for such a long time – because it would definitely create the conditions for a leap forward on how to protect intellectual property rights and on how to improve and make Europe much more competitive when it comes to patent protection on an international level.</p>
<p class="contents">Legal certainty and a new legal framework have been two very important issues on which we have been focusing in preparing our proposals. We have had quite extensive public consultations on this matter. We had 190 submissions and there were stakeholders from industry, law firms, academies and governments, so we think that when it comes to the final outcome, we will have managed to achieve the appropriate balance.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very thankful for the underlining of the importance of EU 2020, because this is exactly why we need to improve and change the framework in which companies operate, looking into how to create positive, conducive environments so that research and development companies and companies involved in innovation can flourish, and into how these could bring additional added value to European economies, and into how to create the conditions for their staying in Europe and not looking for opportunities to manufacture the products somewhere else.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you this was one of the elements on which the Commission, and my colleagues, Commissioners Almunia and Barnier in particular, put particular attention in terms of the Single Market Act. Because with a single market, we now have new opportunities to unlock new potentials, to open new avenues and to create conditions which will be important for really good progress, especially in R&amp;D sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the concrete questions by Mr Schwab, who pointed out certain differences in the Commission approach to this particular issue of small chain suppliers against large chain companies, we came to the conclusion after a very serious review process and our very extensive consultations with the stakeholders, with the Member States, that the approach we are advocating right now corresponded more closely to the current situation, to the present data we had received, and this was the reason why we are suggesting this line forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The failure of last week’s Parliament-Council Conciliation Committee meeting has caused significant concern throughout the European Union. It is regrettable that some do not yet feel they need to adhere to the Treaty of Lisbon. If we are unable to agree on the budget and other related issues by the end of the year, there will be very grave consequences. The creation of the European External Action Service and the three new institutions to monitor European Union financial institutions would be very difficult if there is a lack of funding. A shortage of money would also mean that cohesion policy, one of the most important policies in the European Union, would not be implemented properly, not to mention what would happen to the Europe 2020 strategy and the GALILEO programme. I therefore feel that the constructive and flexible position of the European Parliament demonstrates once again that, faced with the conditions of the financial crisis, the European Parliament really is acting responsibly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I might say that, in many respects, the budget’s content does not reflect the ideals which we in the European Union share. I wish that we could go over many things in detail in a way that would highlight the presence of old debris that is no longer relevant and which would embolden us to use the budget to look at this debris again. Of course, it is also important to ensure that the European Union receives its own funding, thereby enabling it to also carry out the functions that we have together agreed upon and which came our way with the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">When I suggest that there are some issues on which we should adopt a new perspective, we have old debris, such as support for tobacco farming, and so on, which I do not think any longer count among the functions of the European Union today.

Countries do not trade with one another: businesses and individuals do. Yet in this report, and in the EU’s trade policy more widely, we see the Commission’s determination to insert into its commercial agreements all sorts of non-commercial criteria: not only those dealing with human rights, environmental standards and so on, but also, and rather more damagingly, those which insist that other parts of the world form themselves into regional commercial blocs in mimicry of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole point of trade is to swap on the back of differences. There is no purpose in obliging, let us say, the countries of Central America to form a commercial union among themselves in which they are selling one another bananas and coffee and cut flowers. Nor, for that matter, is there much advantage in having in Europe a bloc of similar industrialised economies, where we have cut ourselves off from the growing markets of the rest of the world. It is deleterious to the developing nations and to the Anglosphere, and it is particularly disastrous for my country, which has trapped itself in a cramped and declining regional customs union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to emphasise the role of nuclear energy in the current and future energy mix of the EU, including an implicit recognition of the need to extend the lifetime of existing facilities. The strategy can be regarded as balanced from the perspective of individual sources, even though it does not once mention what is, in my view, the important role of coal when combusted in modernised power plants. It is difficult to see how we can increase EU energy security and independence without coal as a stable primary resource capable of responding flexibly to sudden increases in energy demand. The weak point is the excessively general nature of the report and the absence of accompanying legislation. The specific and practical form of the strategy will also be hugely influenced by the action plan being drawn up for achieving a low carbon economy by 2050, which is due to be published at the beginning of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Energy security is certainly one of the key aspects of that strategy. The EU must foster a common – if not single – energy policy. Europe-wide regulators and institutions should be given a greater role. The European Commission must play a stronger role in efforts to develop alternative energy routes, first of all, from Azerbaijan and Central Asia, and from North Africa and other countries as well. Europe must further invest in LNG terminals and help do the same for its newest members.</p>
<p class="contents">Other measures, such as improving energy efficiency, investing in nuclear energy and creating incentives for renewable energy technologies, are also required. An essential piece in the puzzle is the liberalisation of the internal EU energy market. That is why we should wholeheartedly support the initiative of President Buzek and the former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, to establish a European energy community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The bilateral agreements and projects of some Member States, such as the ‘Nord Stream’ gas pipeline, cause distrust not just environmentally, but also in terms of the overall principle of solidarity. An agreement is reached by two countries, one of which is an EU Member State, but the principle of Member States’ solidarity as laid down in the EU treaties is basically cast aside.

However, I also think that, considering we had major problems getting the EU to speak with one voice at COP 15 in Copenhagen last year, it provides food for thought that we are so divided in Parliament, as was evident in the votes both on the amendments and on the overall resolution. In this connection, I believe that perhaps we could learn a little from the fact that it could perhaps be advantageous to hold back a little on demands for a Tobin tax and other taxes, because this is part of the cause of the divisions in Parliament. Other things being equal, it would have been better if we had cut down on our demands and thus sent our negotiators off with a more unambiguous and broad mandate than has been the case here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Accusing the Union that it is not the leader in ecological policy and putting forward the United States and China as models is hugely inappropriate.

Thus, the EU budget is also used to channel money to the monopoly groups.

The imperialist infighting within the EU does not concern the people; it concerns the fight between the bourgeois classes and parts of capital as to who will get the lion’s share of the booty plundered from grassroots incomes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission and Parliament wanted an increase of around 5% in order to implement new European policies (financial market regulation, common foreign policy, etc.) which have been established in response to the challenges that we are facing. In view of the current budgetary constraints, Parliament ultimately decided to agree to scale back this increase to 2.91%, provided that certain political conditions were met (debate on the granting of own resources to the European Union with a view to ending the horse trading between Member States, budget flexibility and funding for key strategic priorities). As the European Council has rejected these terms, I voted in favour of the new resolution which clearly sets out Parliament’s eminently reasonable, constructive and yet ambitious stance. Whilst I and my fellow Members are willing to tighten our belts together with everyone else in Europe, we do also want to emphasise how important European contributions are in terms of coordinating and supporting the policies pursued by the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty of Lisbon has brought many important changes in various fields and has given the European Parliament new powers. The unsuccessful attempt to reach an agreement with the European Council on the 2011 budget was the European Parliament’s first serious effort to use the powers assigned to it. The European Parliament is ready to come to an agreement as soon as possible so that the EU can begin 2011 with the budget adopted and so that the funding of important areas and projects is not delayed. However, the European Parliament’s requirements must be mentioned in the agreement with the Council and there must be an agreement on certain flexibility mechanisms, allowing proper financing in 2011 and thereafter of the policies stemming from the new competences conferred on the EU by the Treaty of Lisbon and from the Europe 2020 strategy. There must be a commitment by the Commission to present proposals on new own resources for the EU, and there must be an agreement with the Council on the review of the financial structure. Furthermore, there must be an agreement between the three institutions on a method for working together which includes participation by Parliament in the process of negotiating the next multiannual financial framework. The European Parliament must comply with the requirements it has presented. Not only will the establishment of the EU budget in the future depend on them; they will also establish a precedent to expand the influence of the only directly elected institution in European Union governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This would be tantamount to the amendments in the treaty, which form the basis of the functioning of the Union, being infringed by the most democratic forum in the European Community and the only one which is directly elected. The reactions from the European Commission’s leaders create the idea that the Union’s executive has the impression that Parliament does not agree with the budget that has been drafted precisely to show who holds the real power. However, Parliament, which voted in its entirety against the 2011 budget proposed by the Commission, clearly has more important things to do than engage in futile power struggles. In reality, the budget does not take into account the Union’s new powers and does not provide funding for the EU 2020 strategy, which enjoys unanimous agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot be inconsistent when making our own decisions. We cannot devise and approve well-meaning strategies without also providing the financial input for implementing them. Parliament has the right to set the path along which the Union will proceed next year, a right granted by the Treaty of Lisbon. The united action taken by all the parliamentary groups in the European legislative only serves to demonstrate that the budget needs to be reviewed on a much more flexible basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There would be numerous opportunities to make savings, for example, in connection with the two locations for plenary sittings, or by finally whipping the EU’s fight against fraud into shape and fully recovering the funds that have been incorrectly paid out. We also need to consider whether all of the prestige projects really should be continued.

Thus, representatives of the European Parliament are calling for broad budgetary flexibility, but without considering the interests of the countries that are net contributors. It is the net contributors which finance the EU, are responsible for restarting the engine of the economy after the crisis and which are rescuing the countries with large budget deficits, as well as the euro itself. It is therefore justifiable for them to keep to the binding budgetary appropriations, so that the net balance cannot be changed retrospectively on a whim and money thereby wasted. Those who are investing and paying out money must be assured of the greatest possible level of stability. Equally, the critical attitude to EU taxation has nothing to do with an apparent ‘lack of solidarity’. It is simply due to the fact that the majority of Member States are clearly opposed to it and are retaining the ratification by the national parliaments for the sake of subsidiarity. The ‘emancipation of the European Parliament’ that is so often quoted in this context seems to me to be more like a very disturbing emancipation from EU citizens. I therefore voted against this motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Especially for the Member States that had voted against the majority Council position budget in August, this was the absolute red line. Parliament in trialogues on the 2011 budget had taken a step towards being willing to accept this position on payments, after getting assurances concerning extra commitments over and above the ceiling via the flexibility instrument both in Heading 1A (competitiveness) and Heading 4 (external action) so as to be able to cover for reinforced policy priorities in Heading 1A (notably, lifelong learning) and extra needs in Heading 4 (notably Palestine). Also, as regards ITER (unanimity needed in Council), it seemed that a compromise would guarantee an extra 1.4 billion for the years 2012 and 2013 by using unused margins under the different headings from the year 2010 and – but that part was still under discussion, as it was linked to guaranteeing better flexibility mechanisms under the Multiannual Financial Framework Regulation – redeployments from the seventh framework programme for research and development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now that the European Union’s competences have been expanded in the fields of human rights (the Charter of Fundamental Rights is now primary legislation) and sustainable development (one of the five key objectives for Europe 2020), I felt it was important to support the report produced by my colleague Tokia Saïfi, which seeks to ensure that these issues are better reflected in the Union’s trade agreements. Naturally, the report proposes improving cooperation within existing international organisations and the automatic inclusion of clauses on these subjects, but it also introduces new ideas, calling for the creation of a World Environmental Organisation to which cases of environmental dumping could be referred. This proposal is also linked to the notion of establishing a carbon inclusion mechanism to complement the EU’s emissions trading system. This two-pronged approach would enable us to prevent emissions being transferred to third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rather, our future trade strategy should also see it as an additional means to promote European values and interests. Provisions on sustainable development are of benefit to all parties. Moreover, the inclusion of social and environmental standards in trade agreements contributes to regulate globalisation. Choosing to ignore them is a short-sighted and counterproductive approach which not only goes against the principles guiding our external action but will also undermine the European social model. EU bilateral trade relations with third parties are all the more crucial for human rights and social and environmental standards when there is scant prospect of progress within the WTO framework. Nevertheless, we need to keep pushing for the ILO to be granted observer status in, and the right to speak at, the WTO, and a committee on trade and decent work should be created within the WTO. While the inclusion of binding human rights clauses in the EU’s international agreements is an admirable practice, poor monitoring and implementation seems to render them virtually useless, and this has to be seriously addressed in all future agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that 56% of cases were closed having reached an amicable agreement or been solved is fairly positive.

<p class="contents">While I approve the report, however, I think the European Ombudsman himself and the work he does should be more widely publicised, especially in the Member States where he is not immediately recognisable. In fact, it should never be forgotten that a small number of complaints can mean either that people do not notice many irregularities or that they have little confidence in a possible legal solution to their problems.

Thanks to the authority of their office and the rights that come with it, Members of Parliament can have their voices heard. The same cannot be said for the citizens of Europe.

When more than one third of the investigations carried out by the Ombudsman involved cases where there was a lack of transparency and when 56% of all cases were resolved amicably, it only serves to confirm how important the office of the Ombudsman is.

The Commission receives a particularly high number of complaints from citizens concerning maladministration.

If everything is regulated in the EU, for example, the permissible payment deadlines for companies, it seems strange that the Commission, on the other hand, when consulting with a third party, is not in a position to set a deadline for this third party that enables it to meet its own deadlines. If we consider the fact that the Commission has only managed to meet the internal EU deadlines in less than a fifth of cases, this reflects a disregard for good manners. It is nothing short of regrettable when a special report by the Ombudsman is required in order to make public something as simple as access to documents to which EU citizens have a right. To quote the words of the Ombudsman: citizens have a right to know what the EU and its administration are doing. Perhaps I might expand on this by saying that our citizens also have a right to know how the European Union spends its taxes and where resources are wasted.

The European Ombudsman’s decisions are not legally binding, and are therefore based on persuasion and his ability to convince through a reasoned argument and, from time to time, on publicity and the weight of public opinion. The small number of special reports that the European Ombudsman has had to present to Parliament (17 since 1995) is proof of the cooperation that exists between the EU institutions in the vast majority of cases. Part of the context for that cooperation is, however, the power to present a special report to Parliament. Especially when a draft recommendation is being drawn up, the knowledge that the next step could be a special report often helps to encourage the institution or body concerned to change its position. Special reports should therefore only be presented for important issues, when Parliament can help to encourage the institution or body concerned to change its position. As a political body, Parliament has the power to deal with special reports by the European Ombudsman, both in terms of procedure and in terms of focus and actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the scope of the EU acquis and the size of the EU, citizens, civil society interest groups and companies have many questions and doubts. The EU Pilot programme was launched in 2008 so that the law would be understood and applied correctly. According to it, a confidential on-line database was established for communication between Commission services and Member State authorities, to observe how EU law is being implemented and initiate proceedings. I agree with the opinion expressed in the resolution that this initiative is an appropriate response to the need for cooperation between all institutions of the European Union in the interests of a well functioning, citizen-focused system.

In Portugal, there have recently been reports of possible government interference in the field of news, including the replacement of the editor of a daily newspaper and the head of news at a radio station, along with the sudden cancellation of a commercial channel’s news programme and the replacing of its director-general.

In return for broadcasting high quality programmes, these broadcasters have a right to funding from fees. Broadcasting represents the main source of information for citizens. Some public service broadcasters have rather successfully changed their programmes as a result of competition from private broadcasters. The best example of this is the British broadcaster, the BBC. Others, like the Austrian ORF, are not only suffering as a result of falling viewing figures; they also cannot genuinely fulfil the requirement for impartiality and objectivity due to their party political influences. In addition, private broadcasters have started a debate as to whether broadcasting fees are, in fact, legitimate at all, as public service broadcasters also, of course, profit from advertising income.

In some countries, public service broadcasters face ever-increasing political pressure and broadcaster funding is becoming dependent on the goodwill of the political party that has come to power. Elsewhere, business structures are having an ever increasing impact on broadcasters. I agree with the view that culture and the media will always lie within the competence of the Member States. However, I feel that EU institutions could also play a significant role. They could help to exchange examples of good practice and, in certain cases, could also publicise and condemn malpractice. During the economic crisis, public service broadcasters should better exploit the opportunity to obtain soft loans from the European Investment Bank which would help to modernise infrastructure and would raise the level of public service broadcasters, thus helping them to adapt to the challenges of the 21st century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe has now entered the digital age, and the institutions must guarantee balance in the dual system that has been established between private sector and public service broadcasters. The entire system should be based on listening figures for radio and television broadcasters, which are capable of influencing public opinion as a whole. Adjusting EU funding for the public service broadcasting system of Member States is essential because it is directly connected to the democratic, social and cultural needs of every society, as well as to the need to preserve the pluralism of the media and guarantee diversified information and free expression. Since this topic is the responsibility of the national authorities of the individual Member States, the EU hopes that greater incentives will be given to public service broadcasters with the aim of relaunching a service that, in many countries, suffers under the weight of politics and information control, and of preventing imbalance with private sector competition that is, at times, unfair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, equality is not achieved by having women in military organisations or international police forces. Likewise, the security of women, within the meaning of UN resolution 1325, is safeguarded by permanent jobs to prevent conflicts using civilian and peaceful means, not by military intervention. On the contrary, this particular resolution calls for more women to be employed in police and military missions and for the EU to deploy more women officers and soldiers in CSDP missions. Another reason why I voted against the resolution was because the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left deleting these calls and asking for more women to be involved in EUPOL and EUSEC and for a stronger female presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we now need to take stock of the results achieved and carry on in the same direction. The European Union is sensitive enough to take such topics into consideration. In particular, the time has come to go a step further and recognise that women suffer different traumas and also experience certain situations and suffer certain constraints rather more intensely than men do on average. I therefore give this resolution my full support, because anyone who intends to bring peace to conflict zones must first find serenity at a personal level.

Women face countless threats, whether from the practice of barbarous customs that violate their rights in the context of war and conflict, or in the context of poverty and social exclusion. It is therefore crucial that Europe does not forget about women who suffer daily violations of their most basic rights such as life and physical wellbeing, women who are sentenced to death by stoning, women who are denied access to education, women who are forced to flee and live as refugees in order to exercise the liberty that the Charter of Fundamental Rights confers upon us all, and women who are discriminated against purely because of their gender.

Violence against women is on the agenda, and this is particularly dramatic in conflict situations. Studies reveal that women in crisis regions where there are military conflicts are often raped and/or subjected to sexual slavery. It should be a prime objective to punish sexual violence towards women as crimes against humanity, including in war-torn regions of the world. After all – and the Western nations also have a responsibility here – sexual exploitation is unjustifiable and criminal behaviour at any time. The report addresses important issues and I therefore voted in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to advocate more research in order to help ensure the implementation of better solutions and support for measures to enhance biodiversity and mitigate the effects of climate instability. The life of a worker bee is very short and very sensitive to changes in the environment. This has meant that the production of honey has also been affected, not only by the increasingly uncertain length and stability of the seasons, but also by increasing damage from outside sources, such as pesticide use and mites, amongst other things. The current programmes must therefore be strengthened within the framework of the new common agricultural policy so that we can also find more effective solutions at this level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The beekeeping sector, which is an important source of employment and income in rural areas, is also at risk due to the recent increase in bee mortality and bee diseases. I voted for this resolution in which the European Parliament calls on the Commission to fund specific studies to improve the knowledge and understanding of factors that affect bee health. The resolution observes that genetically modified crops or the spread of toxins via pollen may affect bee diseases and bee mortality. Given that grain, fruit and vegetable crops in Europe are dependent on pollination by bees, these crops and agriculture in general face a huge risk of various diseases.

Today, there is an alarming reduction in the numbers of pollinating insects, including honey bees. After all, 84% of the plant species and 76% of food production in Europe are dependent on pollination by bees, the economic importance of which is much greater than the value of the honey produced. Forty percent of the European honey market depends on imports and the previous opening up of the EU market for honey from third countries has placed beekeepers across the EU at a competitive disadvantage. Therefore, we must support the future development of European apiculture, contributing to the preservation of biodiversity. It is important to follow a comprehensive and sustainable approach including such aspects as rural development, climate change and biodiversity, especially by supporting measures to maintain and expand flower pastures. It is also important to support the European apiculture sector in an even wider and coherent manner by using additional instruments in the future CAP, including measures to enhance biodiversity, mitigate the effects of climate change, preserve the heritage of national traditions and cultures which provide employment for many European families, and to safeguard and improve the quality and effective functioning of the market for apiculture products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why the growing number of reports on the decreasing number of bee colonies is very regrettable and requires urgent investigation. This is particularly the case for the agricultural sector, because it is extremely dependent on the useful work of bees. It is unfortunately evident that industrialism and modern life have made it harder for these beneficial bees to survive. Scenarios such as the mass extinction of bees as a result of the Varroa mite, the unexplained exodus of bee colonies in the US and the threat to bees from electro-smog and from incorrectly treated seed are unfortunately not just isolated incidents. It is for this reason that I welcome the fact that Parliament has today agreed to support the beekeeping sector in the future.

With this role in mind, provision has been made to increase annual aid to the sector in Europe from EUR 26 million for 2008-2010 to EUR 32 million for 2011-2013. This funding will be specifically aimed at supporting beekeeping, including through national research projects into new methods to combat the high mortality rate of bees, which has reached alarming levels recently. On the other hand, however, it is important to guarantee fair transparency in aid distribution and guarantee more resources to States that actually need them. I voted in favour of implementing the data survey system by 2012. This is a step in the direction of transparency, to ensure that aid is distributed on the basis of the results of a survey of hives present in the various Member States and not on the basis of estimated data.

We need an ambitious research policy so that we can gain a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms which contribute to the spread of the species, and so that we can obtain the necessary means to preserve them. We cannot accept Chinese honey which is of lower quality and which does not meet our rigorous production criteria as an inevitability, as the only alternative to the shortage of honey that is slowly taking hold in Europe. I regret the fact that my fellow Members in the European Parliament did not vote for all of the amendments that I tabled.

This task is going to be far from easy, especially because the financial contribution, for the environmental targets alone, will reach EUR 58 billion. There will be, in addition to this, the financial contribution for reducing the EU’s growing dependency on external energy resources. Internal and external aspects need to be combined so that the EU is no longer vulnerable in terms of its energy supply and its policies must be adapted accordingly. All the measures intended to ensure that the internal energy market operates properly should be accompanied by active diplomacy, aimed at strengthening cooperation with the main producing, transit and consumer countries.

I would like to emphasise the role of nuclear energy in the current and future energy mix of the EU, including an implicit recognition of the need to extend the lifetime of existing facilities. The strategy can be regarded as balanced from the perspective of individual sources, even though it does not once mention what is, in my view, the important role of coal when combusted in modernised power plants. It is difficult to see how we can increase EU energy security and independence without coal as a stable primary resource capable of responding flexibly to sudden increases in energy demand. The weak point is the excessively general nature of the report and the absence of accompanying legislation. The specific and practical form of the strategy will also be hugely influenced by the action plan being drawn up for achieving a low carbon economy by 2050, which is due to be published at the beginning of next year. In view of the continuing absence of regional markets and market coupling, I consider the aim of creating a unified internal market by 2015 to be highly ambitious, particularly if we take into account the fact that the European Commission does not, as I see it, sufficiently monitor the proper implementation of current European energy legislation in all Member States. The European Commission has also fittingly incorporated the so-called infrastructure package into the energy strategy, which should facilitate the construction of power networks throughout the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Strengthening the competitiveness of the EU, which is so strongly promoted in the report, demonstrably leads to cutbacks in wages and workers’ rights in this specific sector. At the same time, in the midst of an economic crisis, with almost the entire European energy industry (power plants, grids) tending to be privatised, the report makes provision for more money for energy infrastructures, i.e. it indirectly subsidises big business. Finally, I believe that the report’s attempt to link EU energy policy with its objectives to reduce climate change is a purely ostensible link, as any references are vague and do not describe a strong political will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By voting in favour of the resolution, I also wanted to emphasise that energy efficiency should be a priority for the European Union.

The strategy reflects the main challenges – solidarity in the field of energy and security of energy supply. Firstly, the Member States must implement legislation that has already been adopted in the field of energy. Secondly, a single internal energy market must be established, as well as a renewable energy market. Thirdly, trans-European energy infrastructure must be upgraded and modernised. Therefore, the EU must overcome any administrative and financial barriers and EU Member States must reconcile their interests and show solidarity. The same rules must apply to every project, whether it be the Yamal pipeline, or the Nord Stream pipeline. As we know, the EU’s dependence on countries supplying oil and gas is increasing. The Eastern European Member States pay a heavy price for the monopoly – there is no competition, consumer rights are not protected and it is impossible to create a single market. We are dependent on fossil fuels, sources of which are being exhausted, and therefore, it is especially urgent to develop not just renewable energy but to invest in increasing energy efficiency so that we can also mitigate the effects of climate change. A major omission in current EU energy policy is the failure to direct EU funds into an area that still ranks, despite the recession, as one of the top priorities for European governments and citizens. The focus in the field of energy should be on the consumer and the protection of his rights, and the EU must strive to ensure favourable energy prices for consumers and business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore consider this document to be an extremely useful contribution to the efforts to create and implement a common energy strategy that can strengthen Europe in decades to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Forecasts show that dependence on crude oil will be even greater in the future, which is why the energy strategy must have many aspects as well as an international dimension, going beyond the framework of the European Union. In view of the close geographical proximity of Member States with Russia, the European Union should strive to achieve closer cooperation with our eastern neighbours under the right conditions. Our efforts should also be concentrated on achieving the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon and, as a consequence, on creating a single energy market, while at the same time guaranteeing security of energy supply. To achieve these intentions, it is necessary to make investments in network infrastructure, because this would foster integration of regional energy markets, and also to modernise pan-European energy networks. As Mrs Kolarska-Bobińska rightly suggests, the construction of new terminals, able to bring gas from all over the world, would allow new sources of gas imports to be found, particularly from regions which are rich in this resource, such as Central Asia. The President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, and the former head of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, have also suggested making financial assistance available for development of infrastructure, because a modernised and extended energy network is a fundamental requirement for building a consistent energy policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The failure of the Copenhagen Summit, for which we had such high hopes, is still very much in people’s minds, and we all hope that the next chance to advance international cooperation on climate change will not prove another missed opportunity. Unfortunately, I do not think that the resolution adopted in the last plenary session on Thursday is particularly helpful. My colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and I wanted to maintain the target of reducing greenhouse gases by 20% by 2020, which would have given us a good basis for negotiations with the US and China. However, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament succeeded in adopting the unrealistic target of 30%. I do not think that this kind of unilateral approach is good news for the impending negotiations in Cancún, and in my view, it is a pity that the resolution, which I opposed, has been adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the position set out in the resolution that the European Union should take a leading role in the climate negotiations and actively contribute to a more constructive climate conference in Cancún. Only the European Union has approved binding climate change reduction targets and intends to adopt even more ambitious targets.

We need specific and rapid measures, because the assessment is a harsh one: as things stand, our commitments are not likely to minimise damage due to climate change. In short, our governments must do more, and they must do it more quickly. The European Union must play a driving role in the negotiations by speaking with a single voice so that it can carry some weight when dealing with China and the United States. As far as the objectives are concerned, we require more ambition. We must adopt the objective of a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 2020 compared with 1990 levels (paragraph 16). Although it is true that the fight against climate change has been set as one of the major political challenges for a number of years, we have not yet seen the results expected. For example, on the 2020 objectives concerning energy efficiency and the 20% renewable energy rate, the numbers do not add up.

Nonetheless, I voted in favour of it, because I consider that there is an urgent need for fast and coordinated action at international level to combat climate change and that the resolution as a whole still contains numerous positive points and makes an important contribution on the part of the EU to the Cancún conference. The report criticises the lack of preparation for the conference, emphasises the need to reduce emissions by at least 40% and calls on the EU and the Member States to implement the principle of ‘climate justice’. It also highlights the historical responsibility borne by the developed countries and recalls their financial commitment and the objective of Official Development Assistance, with a baseline of 0.7% of GNI. The conservation of biodiversity and the ecosystem is the focal point and the right of access to drinking water and the need to preserve forests and develop a forestation policy are also recognised. Finally, it rightly points out that the potential for energy saving is not being exploited and underlines the need to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, we cannot fail to monitor it closely and with concern. In particular, climate change has caused the worrying rise in sea level, forced migrations, and the fight for access to waterways and more fertile land, as in Sudan, pitting nomadic herdsmen against settled farmers. The EU must actively participate in this global effort and do its best to monitor this problem and seek lasting solutions, which will ideally be able to reconcile scientific and technological progress, and the development of populations with environmental quality and respect for nature. The Cancún climate change conference is an excellent opportunity to pursue this objective in order to establish more ambitious targets and reach a more solid and comprehensive collective commitment to combating the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that such an agreement will only make sense if it is binding on the major global emitters: the US, China and India. The EU has been a leader in combating climate change, and should be encouraged to build on this leadership, although without forgetting the tremendous efforts that our industries have already made to respond to the mandatory reductions in emissions within Europe. It should be noted that the EU is responsible for around 15% of global emissions, and it is estimated that this percentage will fall to 10% in 2030, while the US, China and India are responsible for half of global emissions, with this figure continuing to rise. </p>
<p class="contents">As a result, I cannot agree that the EU should unilaterally limit its CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions by 30%, rather than the target of 20%, if this is not going to be duly matched by other countries, notably the US.

The discussion is still overly focused on reduction targets, to the detriment of ways to achieve them, which discredits the whole debate. There is insistence on a market approach, although market instruments have already shown their ineffectiveness and perversity. It falls short of what is needed in the discussion on the distortions introduced by so-called flexibility mechanisms and the need for their abolition or recasting. There is an obvious misunderstanding of the meaning and serious importance of the principle of a ‘common but differentiated responsibility’ when placing the world’s major historical polluters, such as the US, the biggest global emitter per capita, which is resisting making serious commitments to reduce its emissions, on an equal footing with emerging economies such as China or India, with per capita emissions that are 10 and 4 times lower respectively than those of the US.</p>

It is a major step for me to vote against a report I played a significant role in drafting. However, the motion for a resolution is a ‘green pipe-dream’ that pursues excessive and unrealistic targets. We have succeeded in talking down some of the demands, such as limiting the rise in the average temperature to 1.5 °C. If we had pursued this demand, we would have had to reduce our emissions to zero in the next ten years and strive for negative emissions in the short or long term. We did not manage to prevail in respect of a unilateral rise in EU reduction commitments, despite the fact that this is not helpful to negotiations at present and that we lack investigations as to how specific reductions are to be achieved. We must avoid making such demands, as we risk losing credibility among our partners throughout the world, particularly those who are still unsure about joining with us. Credibility is our chief asset at present. I am convinced that in our efforts to secure this, Europe must speak with one voice.

Some time ago, we committed ourselves to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. However, it seems that we may not achieve the targets set. On the other hand, no targets can be reached until the world’s major polluters join the EU. Therefore, it is irresponsible to set even greater targets until less ambitious targets have been achieved. Furthermore, if we begin to reach higher targets, we will ram ourselves into a corner – as it has to comply with more stringent requirements, EU industry will be unable to compete on a level playing field with industry in countries that do not set such stringent requirements. Therefore, although setting ambitious targets makes us leaders in the fight against climate change, it by no means contributes to the EU’s objective of becoming the world’s most competitive region.

This is a question of responsibility with regard to future generations. The resolution reminds us that in order to be credible, the European Union must not only honour its commitments to provide USD 30 billion of aid to the poorest countries for the period 2010-2012, but also show imagination in order to save the planet.

The reason I did this is that the resolution deals with an extremely important subject – the fact that the EU must demonstrate shrewd political leadership in the climate negotiations. Developing countries are affected particularly badly and therefore, world leaders must do their utmost to ensure that the climate negotiations do not jeopardise the Millennium Development Goals. However, I would like to emphasise in particular that I voted against the wording in the resolution that urges the EU, in the negotiations, to propose a tax rate of 0.01% on financial transactions. This sort of tax is not the right way to go and it will not help the developing countries to combat and adapt to climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider the constant interference by Morocco to be unacceptable. Likewise, the text of the resolution is just a compromise between positions that are based on very different analyses. I therefore wish to state our group’s position in favour of the Sahrawi people, and specifically our condemnation of the provocative and irresponsible way in which the Gdaim Izyk camp was dismantled. We cannot place those who attack, torture and massacre on the same level as those who seek to defend themselves. There needs to be an independent investigation, and freedom of access and movement needs to be given to those responsible for the media and information. The EU, and especially Spain and France, must assume their historical responsibility and demand that Morocco ceases its inhibiting and intransigent attitude, even by freezing the numerous trade agreements and special relationships that exist between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco, and by doing everything possible to ensure that the referendum on self-determination included in numerous United Nations resolutions is held. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament is quite right to express its concerns about how the situation in the region has deteriorated. As the United Nations has pointed out, the parties involved in the conflict need to agree to seek a realistic political solution that is fair, sustainable, acceptable to both sides and in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. However, it is unfortunate that the text was produced before Parliament had access to all of the facts and detailed information about the circumstances that triggered this tragedy, including the exact number of victims. Journalists, independent investigators, observers and political decision makers need to be given time and access to the town of Laâyoune and the refugee camps in order to shed light on the events.

This joint resolution sends out a strong signal from the European Parliament condemning the recent resurgence of violence in Western Sahara. On 8 November, the Sahrawi protest camps were violently broken up, as a result of which there were many deaths on both sides and many of the inhabitants injured. The camps were a sign of the Sahrawi people’s peaceful protest against the repression, marginalisation and plundering of their natural resources (including fish) which they have experienced and the poor conditions in which they have been living under the Moroccan occupation. The resolution calls for an immediate end to the violence and the establishment of an independent inquiry into the events at Gdaim Izyk and Laâyoune. There are calls for the Moroccan authorities to allow journalists, humanitarian organisations, MEPs and independent observers free access to Western Sahara.</p>
<p class="contents">The increased repression of human rights activists and Sahrawi activists by the Moroccan authorities (arbitrary arrests, charges and detention) is very worrying. These events will put a strain on the informal talks between Morocco and the Polisario Front which are scheduled to resume in early November under the auspices of the UN. However, a just and lasting political solution is necessary to improve the situation of the Sahrawi people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The wording of the resolution should have been marked by diplomacy combined with practical and indisputable facts. Instead, this unbalanced text contains a hasty and ill-informed assessment of the situation and, without giving any reasons, dismisses out of hand the independent investigation being conducted by the Moroccan authorities. I am disappointed with this biased statement which was produced in haste – it will hamper the informal negotiations being held at the UN between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front and has generated tension on the ground. We have lost sight of where our priorities should lie, namely seeking a balanced and mutually acceptable agreement between the two parties that will allow the civilian population to see stability and security restored. We must, at all costs, avoid the creation of a new front in the much-contested Sahel region and seek to preserve our strategic partnership with Morocco. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, changes to the electoral system several months prior to the elections, partly switching it back to a majority system, have driven an even bigger wedge between the government and the opposition and have formed the basis for accusations against the government of undemocratic intentions. The resolution also expresses concern at the recent increase in violations of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and restrictions on freedom of the media. I voted for the adoption of the resolution because it calls on Ukraine, which, in the long-term, is aiming for EU Membership, to adopt legislation governing media activities that complies with international standards and underlines the need to strengthen the independence and effectiveness of state institutions. This is the only way to guarantee the functioning of democracy and the rule of law in the country. I support the calls made by the resolution’s authors for Kiev to continue to modernise energy supply infrastructure and to implement projects for the diversification of energy sources alongside EU Member States.

The point is that the new Ukrainian Government is more pragmatic and open to reforms than was expected. Close cooperation with Ukraine is important if there is at least the smallest chance of ensuring stability in the region. In recent years, Ukraine has turned into a political football pitch with a struggle between Russia and the West for influence during the Orange Revolution and the last elections. Whether Ukraine chooses Russia or the West is unimportant. Now, the EU has the opportunity to implement a new policy on Ukraine that would include Russia. My country, Lithuania, also has a role to play here.</p>
<p class="contents">Security and energy are two areas where there will need to be long-term cooperation to fix some of Kiev’s woes.

The states and people of Europe owe a debt of solidarity and support to the great people of Ukraine, who paid an enormous price in the Stalinist period and in the Second World War, through the loss of many millions of lives. The Orange Revolution proved that the people of Ukraine wish to shape their future under democratic conditions where the rule of law is upheld. This is something that should never be forgotten by those in Ukraine who have political, economic and social responsibilities. The management of the recent regional elections and the events before and after the elections in Ukraine give one cause to wonder whether the actions of those with political responsibility in Ukraine really do reflect the principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law.

International trade rules are crucial in combating climate change, but the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement does not make direct reference to climate change, food security or the Millennium Development Goals. I feel that changes in WTO rules are needed to ensure coherence and consistency with the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and multilateral environment agreements (MEAs). This would ensure that all countries adhere to the same standards, because currently, by subsidising energy prices and applying no restriction or no quota on CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, certain countries have a greater competitive advantage and have no incentive to join the multilateral climate change agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is certainly not a single answer to that question, but a significant proportion of the problem is due to the fact that many countries have not yet experienced an environmental transformation of their economies on a large scale and continue to doubt the economic, social and democratic advantages.

The resolution calls for the notion of corporate social responsibility, a concept recognised by the OECD, ILO and United Nations, to be incorporated in the generalised system of preferences. It also invites the Commission to undertake new impact assessments to examine the effect that trade agreements have on European SMEs. Lastly, the resolution states that all new agreements should automatically include a corporate social responsibility clause.

Only then is trade liberalisation regarded as something positive and accepted. By contrast, when it destroys jobs or undermines living conditions, social rights and the environment, it gives rise to very vocal opposition. The common commercial policy cannot therefore be reduced to a set of measures designed to serve only the immediate interests of a few economic actors. The economic and social impact of trade liberalisation varies very substantially from country to country and that impact must be managed and sometimes offset, because liberalisation is a process in which there are always winners and losers. The expansion in international trade is universally beneficial only if certain conditions are met, hence the need to manage the liberalisation of trade, including practical arrangements and the volume of trade, a need which has come to be felt even more strongly as the globalisation process has accelerated. Europe, and the international community as a whole, are thus faced with an imperative: they must incorporate genuine guarantees concerning sustainable development and labour rights into the rules governing international trade. That imperative, which is consistent with the objectives of both the United Nations and the European Union, chimes exactly with public expectations in Europe. Hitherto, the link between trade and corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been tenuous at best. Incorporating CSR principles into the rules governing international trade would enable the EU to exert pressure on undertakings to improve their behaviour and on the States which sign trade agreements with it to comply with labour and environmental standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Competition law has helped to underpin those efforts. Far from seeking to favour large corporate groups, competition policy is actually intended to protect smaller operators from practices that distort competition. Agreements between undertakings – on supporting research programmes, for example – can conceal a restrictive trade practice designed to eliminate a rival. Yet, the dynamism of the European economy is partly linked to that self-same ability to cooperate. Consequently, the European Commission has adopted a pragmatic policy approach. The Commission regularly sets out categories of agreements allowed to circumvent the strict competition rules where this will prove beneficial. The European Commission is involved in wide-ranging consultations now that these regulations are up for review. Overall, the proposed legislation has taken on board the positions expressed by the European Parliament and is in line with our views on the subject. I have therefore voted in favour of the text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission intends to adopt two new block exemption regulations amending the previous ones and certain guidelines so that stakeholders would help to analyse and understand whether their cooperation agreements are in tune with competition rules. There is currently a new set of rules derived from Commission and Court case-law in need of codification. I supported this resolution, in particular, the European Parliament’s aim of ensuring legal certainty for stakeholders. I feel that when establishing guidelines, the EU should take into account the experience of the EU national competition authorities and competition authorities worldwide. I feel that it would be beneficial to begin international negotiations on convergent competition rules worldwide, given that many agreements and practices are covered by different competition regimes, which prevent stakeholders from competing in the market on a level playing field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the situation in every market niche should be examined on a case by case basis in order to carry out a fair evaluation of them in terms of respecting those principles which, if applied mechanically, would end up generating paradoxical and anti-economic situations.

They are normally cooperation activities that do not involve any coordination in competitive behaviour by the market parties, so they have no effect on competitiveness, but promote gains which would otherwise be impossible. For this reason, they are exempt from implementing Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This is especially relevant for the specialisation agreements, and the research and development agreements set out in Regulations (EC) No 2659/2000 and No 2658/2000, which the Commission is now proposing to revise. At a time when Europe needs investment in research and development and should be investing in innovation, it is vital that the legal prerequisites for the creation of the necessary synergies between companies operating in the market are put in place, in compliance with competition law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The picture accompanying the article showed a Christian family sheltering in a church in the capital Baghdad. The family had taken refuge in this house of worship after Islamic terrorists had begun a determined attack on the homes of Christians. The revolting bloodbath of 31 October during a service in the Syriac Catholic cathedral was certainly, therefore, no isolated incident. The Christian minority in Mesopotamia has been exposed to outright religious persecution for years. That is the sad reality in Iraq. Witness the massive exodus of Iraqi Christians. Since 2003, their numbers in Iraq have dropped from 850 000 to 350 000, 115 000 of whom have been internally displaced. What can these courageous ‘hangers-on’ – in quotation marks, because Iraq is where they belong – expect from Europe? After all, this is a Christian minority whose historical roots in Iraq can be traced back to the 1st century AD and include the world’s oldest churches and monasteries. I would plead for three concrete European relief efforts for Iraqi Christians. First of all, support Iraqi Christians who have fled to the Kurdish region to build a new life. Give them a future within their own country. The same is true for the Christian minority in the plain of Nineveh. European aid for vocational training, jobs for young people and loans for new businesses. Secondly, the European institutions should urge the Iraqi Government – and this is a matter of extreme urgency – to drop the statement of the holder’s religion from identity cards, because this omission would significantly increase the personal security of religious minorities, especially Christians. In addition, the existing practice of declaring the holder’s religion on identity cards is currently resulting in discrimination in the job market and in people converting to other religions, amongst other things. Thirdly, at parliamentary level, I would ask our Delegation for Relations with Iraq to show the five Christian members of the Iraqi Parliament our willingness to assist them in word and deed in this precarious period. Anyway, Madam President, Commissioner, I, of course, welcome all parliamentary contacts between Europe and Iraq designed to support this young democracy and I am also very pleased that my fellow member, Mr Mauro, will soon be presenting a report on the European Union and Iraq to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. That is very important. Finally, the Council and the Commission – the Council is not actually represented here, but never mind – I am counting on you continuing to make vigorous efforts to persuade the Iraqi authorities to do what they can to ensure at least the bare survival of Christian communities and churches in the historic land of Mesopotamia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The spectacle of the hanging of Saddam Hussein was not in any way a means of reducing this violence. On the contrary, it has exacerbated tensions in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">You know that the European Union fights incessantly against the death penalty. We believe that by abolishing the death penalty in Europe, we have contributed to making a step forward in the progress of humanity. That is why we find it disgraceful that Tariq Aziz, who worked with Saddam Hussein, and two of his assistants, may be hanged. This is not because of the personality of Tariq Aziz, who, as I knew very well, was, in fact, a remarkable personality who unfortunately participated in a totalitarian system. However, I think – and I say this as a personal opinion – that, especially at the last moment, he made major efforts to try to open up his country.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet it is not the case of Tariq Aziz that is important. We cannot have the hanging of Tariq Aziz on our television screens tomorrow as a symbol of the liberation of Iraq. That is why I am calling on my fellow Members to vote for this resolution, which also includes a section, which I agree with, on the persecution of Christians in Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Pakistan, Asia Bibi has said that, despite her reprieve, as far as the extremists are concerned, she is still a threat. Unfortunately, she will have to emigrate to another country. Christians in Iraq, too, have already fled en masse. They are systemic victims of the extremists. In Iraq, a religious community that has lived there much longer than the extremists have is being driven away in a very brutal fashion. That is why the Christians deserve our support. They must be allowed to remain together, so that they can practise their faith. I therefore call on the Commission to give this issue top priority. Strong European support is badly needed to moderate groups in Iraq. Then, we might be able to prevent Islamic extremists from shutting and locking the church doors in Iraq for good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, we need to continue our fight against capital punishment, as well as our appeals for the capital sentences passed on Tariq Aziz and two other former officers to be revoked. Secondly, every person in Iraq must be allowed to practise their faith in the country, and we condemn any attack on that freedom. We are pleased with those two points, but my group is less pleased with what is missing from the resolution. It appears that the European Parliament refuses to discuss the many human rights abuses in Iraq, for which we, as Member States of the EU, have been partly responsible. Foreign troops have allowed Iraqi security forces to mistreat prisoners, and even torture and murder them. In March this year, the United Kingdom stood convicted of this by the European Court of Human Rights. The recent revelations by Wikileaks have confirmed that these practices have occurred and they are unacceptable. For these reasons, we would have liked to have seen a strong condemnation of these practices committed by both American and European troops. Nor would a reference to the call of Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, for a thorough investigation of, on the one hand, the allegations of illegal abductions and, on the other, of abuse and murder in Iraqi prisons, have been out of place in the resolution. The investigation of the matter recently launched by the United Kingdom should be followed more widely and the Member States who have contributed their forces to the area must hold their people accountable for their misdeeds. The Commission and the Council, too, should insist on this; remaining silent is no longer an option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a man who is already in prison for life. We do not disagree with that, but I do not think that we can discuss and condemn this attempt at execution without, at the same time, mentioning the more than 900 death sentences that have already been carried out by the Iraqi Presidential Council. We are compelled by the obligation to assign equal weight to those who are very well known as to those who are less well known. Obviously, we also agree with the condemnation of Islamic terrorism against Christian communities, but we cannot silence the 30 000 who are being detained without charge in Iraq due to the military occupation, nor can we ignore the way in which this has provoked conflict and problems within Iraqi society. The problem with this resolution is that it takes account of so little. My group therefore has its own resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I would also like, above all, to express the indignation of my group about the sharp deterioration in the situation of those Christians residing in Iraq, and to express our strong feelings about the recent deadly attacks that struck the Christian communities in Iraq, notably, the cowardly hostage taking in the Syriac Cathedral of Baghdad on 31 October, which left 58 dead. We also, of course, want to express our solidarity with the victims and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">On the occasion of this debate, we would like to appeal solemnly and seriously to the Iraqi authorities to do everything to ensure the safety and integrity of the Christians in Iraq; to protect all places of worship in Iraq, to guarantee the religious freedom of the Iraqi Christians, but also that of all religious communities and all religious minorities, and to work on reducing interethnic violence. What is really at stake here is peace, national reconciliation in this country and the defence of our values of liberty and tolerance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, perhaps it is good that we are debating them together, because what we want to say in this resolution is that we want justice in Iraq and justice for Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">We want justice in Iraq because those Christians who have fallen victim to the fundamentalist aims of many of the groups fighting for power are certainly innocent. We want justice for Iraq because the process currently under way to restore stability and democracy to that country does not deserve to have its face scarred by the killing of a man who may be guilty, but who surely does not deserve to be put to death.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the instrument of a resolution may have even more practical effects if we also carry these judgments and topics across into the content of the agreement between the EU and Iraq. This agreement can, in practical terms, stipulate that we impose conditions for there to be economic agreements, and these conditions involve respect for human rights and respect for Iraqi Christians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following that, since 2003 it has suffered terrible violations of human rights, including arrests, abductions and extrajudicial killings under the foreign military occupation. This makes it particularly significant that President Talabani has said that, as he is a socialist and a humanist, he would refuse to sign the execution order for Tariq Aziz. I think that it is crucial that we state in Parliament that we are opposed to the death penalty, regardless of whom the person is and whatever their religion, and that we are not merely striving for the abolition of the death penalty that has been handed down to Tariq Aziz because he is a Christian. Obviously, I and all my fellow Members completely deplore the attacks against the Christian community in Iraq, a community that makes up part of the Iraqi cultural tradition and that the Iraqis, more than anyone, value and know how to preserve. However, we cannot forget that those who have suffered most from the terrorist and sectarian violence in Iraq are, in fact, Muslims, whether they be Shiites, Sunnis or others. It is more important than ever that we, the European Union, apply ourselves to our relations with Iraq and discuss this issue with our colleagues in the Iraqi Parliament, particularly the need to abolish the death penalty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then, hundreds of people have been sentenced to death and many have been executed.</p>
<p class="contents">Bringing perpetrators of human rights violations to justice is crucial for a stable future in any country, and that includes Iraq. Politicians and former politicians should be no exception, as they bear ultimate and often direct responsibility for such violations. It is well known that the human rights violations in Iraq, under the responsibility of Saddam Hussein, Tariq Aziz and the like, assumed grave proportions. Fair trials and due process are indispensable in ensuring reconciliation and taking a constructive step towards a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is a community of values and a unique place in the world, especially when it comes to the death penalty, which we have abolished altogether. In relations with other countries, whether the United States, China, Iran or Iraq, we appeal to them not to deny people the ultimate right – the right to life – as a form of punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">Jalal Talabani has stated that he will not sign the order for Tariq Aziz’s execution, and we welcome that sign. It should be part of a society based on the rule of law, in which the human rights of all citizens are respected, and the EU is ready to help the Iraqi Government develop in that direction and ensure the just accountability of human rights perpetrators.</p>
<p class="contents">The stability of Iraq is fragile and may well be disturbed by state-endorsed executions. Signing and ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as Protocol 13 to the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, would help to solidify Iraq’s stance against human rights violations. It would also be a welcome step towards its inclusion in the international community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This way of seeing and doing things damages the credibility of the European Union in this area, and plays into the hands of those who say that the Europeans have a Western vision of human rights, and that they are seeking once again to impose their model on others.</p>

I would have liked us to denounce the abuses of power committed by the Iraqi forces and by the occupying forces, and also to denounce child soldiers and – especially today, on the International Day of Violence against Women – the violence to which women in Iraq fall victim, in the context of this conflict. I would also have liked us to denounce the way in which the United States has abandoned the Ashraf camp without concerning itself with the hundreds of people who lived there.</p>

One hundred people were taken hostage and 40 died as a result. In recent years, 900 000 Christians have fled Iraq. These events offer a sad illustration of the situation for Christians in Iraq and in the entire Middle East region. These are not isolated incidents, but rather a global trend that is being played out on Europe’s borders, as well as in Egypt and also, occasionally, in Turkey. The EU should be able to exert enough pressure to combat discrimination against Christians. We only have to think of the northern part of Cyprus, where approximately 150 churches have been destroyed or converted into mosques since the Turkish occupation and where only one church remains where the Christian population is permitted to celebrate one mass each year. Remember, this is not Iraq I am talking about, but an island in the Mediterranean on the edge of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it makes sense to introduce a permanent system for monitoring Christian persecution. Concrete actions would have to follow; for example, the consistent inclusion of clauses prohibiting the persecution of Christians in international trade agreements with the EU. We cannot have a situation where we want to do business but are content to turn a blind eye when Christians are persecuted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close with a few words about the former foreign minister, Mr Aziz: Even former members of the Saddam Hussein regime are entitled to the due process of the law. Revenge executions have no place here. Even these former ministers deserve a fair trial. This cannot be accepted, particularly in a young country that aims to become a democratic state. For this reason, I would call on the EU to take the appropriate steps and to proceed clearly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Iraq, however, being open about your Christian faith has almost become a mark of exceptional courage. Today, we have rightly condemned the horrific attack of Sunday, 31 October, but in the meantime, new attacks have taken place, once again claiming human life. Last Monday, two brothers were killed in the town of Mosul. My fellow Member, Mr Belder, has given you the numbers of the ever dwindling group of Iraqi Christians who remain in Iraq, at least 100 000 of whom have also become displaced in their own country. This, surely, seems to be a targeted strategy by some groups to drive away this population group. Commissioner, we, the EU, cannot afford to just stand and look on. First of all, the Union should, of course, address the Iraqi authorities, who, sadly, are still in a weak position, and support them in taking action. However, I would like to go a step further and, indeed, as Mr Mauro has said, include as a priority in the partnership agreement with Iraq which we are debating now a safe living environment for Iraqi Christians in Iraq. As Vice-Chair of the Delegation for Relations with Iraq, I will continue to monitor the situation and will be happy to hear what the Commission thinks about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot tolerate this. Apart from the general issues of religious freedom, this is an absolute scandal and I welcome the fact that a number of Christian bishops from Iraq are to travel to Strasbourg in December in order to inform us in detail of the situation of their religious communities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be clear that it is not enough to make the occasional tired gesture, but that we have a genuine responsibility here. Eighty percent of Europeans are Christians. Naturally, we are in favour of religious freedom in general, but who is going to look after the interests of these people if we do not? These are people who even survived the vile regime of Saddam Hussein in their country, but whose very existence is now under threat.</p>

The symbol of the Christian faith is the cross, which appears to be a symbol of death but is, in fact, a symbol of freedom because, for Christians, Christ’s death on the cross freed mankind from sin and from darkness.

The Foreign Affairs Council on Monday expressed its outright condemnation of the recent terrorist attacks, notably those which targeted places where civilians congregate, including Christian and Muslim places of worship.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, adopting conclusions put forward by High Representative / Vice-President Ashton, also stressed that the new government in Iraq will need to dedicate itself to the pursuit of national reconciliation. This means it should represent the interests and needs of all Iraqis, regardless of creed and ethnicity. The protection and promotion of human rights, including those of persons belonging to minorities, must be a top priority. In its dialogue with Iraq, the European Union frequently voices its human rights concerns, including not only the freedom of religion or belief but also on the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten days ago, the EU made an urgent and direct call on the authorities in reaction to the decision by the Iraqi High Tribunal to sentence to death five representatives of the former regime, including Tariq Aziz. The EU recalled its firm opposition to the use of capital punishment under all circumstances, seeking a global moratorium on the death penalty as a first step. Human rights have a prominent place in the partnership and cooperation agreement which we hope to sign with Iraq soon. That is the direct answer to Mrs de Lange.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2003, an important part of EU cooperation with Iraq has focused on strengthening the rule of law and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms, for example, through EUJUST LEX and Community assistance. Substantial funds have also been dedicated to providing protection and relief to the most vulnerable Iraqis. Many of them are, for obvious reasons, internally displaced and now live in areas with dense minority group populations. Our work has ranged from promoting awareness and enforcement of human rights among vulnerable groups to the rehabilitation of schools in areas already mentioned in the discussions, such as Nineveh, which has a large Christian population.</p>
<p class="contents">Humanitarian assistance also continues to reach the most vulnerable inside and outside Iraq. EU aid cannot directly target specific ethnic or religious communities, but it should and it can, help the most vulnerable Iraqis, wherever they live.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not underestimate the challenges facing the Iraqi Government. It is no easy task to root out the extremists who seek to create sectarian tensions through acts of barbarity. Security, development and the preservation of human rights are closely linked. The EU remains committed to helping Iraq as best as it can to secure progress on all three issues. The Iraqi people deserve no less. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current bilingual model, which allows ethnic minorities to study in their own national languages alongside Chinese, is to be replaced by one in which Chinese is to be the basic language of instruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in Qinghai province, Qiang Wei, said in a press article that standard Mandarin will be the main language of instruction in primary schools by 2015. Due to the need for Tibetans and representatives of other ethnic groups to function effectively in the Chinese labour market, they should be able to study Chinese, but not at the cost of not being able to have an appropriate education in their own language.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be remembered that the rights that the Tibetans are fighting for derive from Article 4 of the Chinese constitution and Article 10 of the Regional National Autonomy Law. The Tibetans are therefore asking for the rights already granted to them to be respected, and Parliament should emphatically support them in their attempts to preserve their own culture, a basic element of which is language. I think that the words of Dokru Choedaka, a campaigner for the Tibetan language, ring true for all of us when he says that schools and language are the fabric of national identity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If China intends to wash out the Tibetan culture this way, it is acting against its own stated intentions of harmonious relations among the countless cultures, ethnicities and identities the country knows. The Chinese authorities should also allow access to Tibet by foreign media without the need for special permits and allow uncensored communications and access to information – also on the Internet – throughout the entire country.</p>

Given this, we are very justifiably concerned about the news which we recently received that the status of the Tibetan language as a language of instruction might be being weakened.

<p class="contents">It is important that the People’s Republic of China should acknowledge that the preservation of Tibetan culture is crucially dependent on its language, and that the Tibetan language should be kept as the first language of instruction and also used in universities. Of course, genuine bilingualism is an important objective. It needs to be recognised that it is only sensible that the Tibetans also study Chinese, but making it the first language of instruction is bound to be problematic, as it will mean that Tibetan culture will suffer.</p>

The Chinese Government is planning to withdraw this fundamental right from the Tibetans, threatening them with a loss of identity. Thousands of Tibetans have campaigned against the possible end to bilingual policy in peaceful protests in schools and universities. On 27 October, I received a petition in front of the European Parliament building in Brussels from Tibetan schoolchildren seeking our solidarity. China’s ambassador, Mr Song, yesterday emphasised that bilingual education in Tibet was an important measure to support Tibetan culture. While I have heard what he has to say, I am not sure I believe him. After all, he has not denied the numerous media reports indicating that Mandarin Chinese is to be the main language used in educational institutions in the Quinghai region. Cantonese and Shanghainese are also to be replaced by Mandarin throughout the education system and even on the radio, this despite the fact that the government claims that Mandarin is only spoken by half of the Chinese population. Article 4 of the constitution and Article 10 of the law on regional autonomy emphasise the freedom of all ethnic groups to develop their own written and spoken language. Commissioner Lewandowski, I would urge you to ensure that this worrying development is raised during dialogue between the EU and China. Please send a group of experts to the region on a fact-finding mission to establish where the threat to the bilingual system lies. The Tibetan language can be supplemented by Chinese, but certainly not replaced by it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks, too, to these experiences, which have been the fate of many Europeans, we must demand that those who negotiate with China on our behalf, talking about the development of technology, investments, trade and so on, do not avoid the subject of the habitual violation of human rights in China. In negotiations with the Chinese Government on human rights, and here I join all those who have made appeals before me, I ask that the issue of human rights is not relegated to the background, irrespective of whether we are currently in an economic crisis or not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today’s debate on the attempts by the government of the People’s Republic of China to introduce Chinese as the only mandatory language in the teaching system in Tibet is an attack on the culture of that nation. Up to now, Tibetan has been the official language in Tibet and in those regions in China where Tibetans are the main ethnic group.

The need to understand Chinese as well is understandable for those who are going to look for work outside of Tibet, but an appropriate and adequate solution seems to be the introduction of Chinese as a subject to be taught, and not the replacement of Tibetan with Chinese as the language of instruction.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we should express our opposition to the attempt to take the Tibetans’ basic tool of communication away from them.

Evidence of this is the Slovak language law and the Romanian education law currently in force, which allow for instruction in certain subjects only in the state language. I could name a few more EU countries. I will not do this now. I am a committed supporter of monitoring infringements of rights outside the European Union, but at the same time, I think it is important that practices disadvantageous to national minorities within the territory of the EU are not passed over in silence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In relation to this, I firmly believe that it is necessary to support the preservation of Tibetan, which is one of the four oldest and most original Asian languages, and which is one of the fundamental roots of Tibetan identity, culture and religion, and which, together with Tibetan culture as a whole, also represents an irreplaceable part of world cultural heritage, bearing witness to an historically rich civilisation. I trust that China will consistently apply Article 4 of the constitution of the People’s Republic of China, and Article 10 of the Act on Autonomous National Regions, which guarantee the freedom of all nations to use and develop their own spoken and written languages.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that every ethnic minority has the right to retain its own language and literature. A fair bilingual education system will contribute towards better cooperation and understanding, especially if Tibetans learn Chinese and Han Chinese people living in Tibetan areas are, at the same time, encouraged to learn Tibetan. As the submitted joint draft resolution includes all of the points I have mentioned, I have decided to support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is about reconfirming our values, Mr Bütikofer.</p>
<p class="contents">Before addressing the issue of Tibet, allow me a quick word on our bilateral relations with China. Our strategic partnership is strong, which permits us to tackle all issues, including the most sensitive ones. We have constructed an impressive framework of high-level interactions where we regularly address the global challenges that our citizens are facing without, however, neglecting the issues where our views may differ. The overall situation in Tibet is one of those where we differ.</p>
<p class="contents">The moves to institute Chinese as the main language of instruction in Tibetan areas raise complex and sensitive issues. China needs to strike the right balance so as to allow the effective instruction and preservation of the Tibetan language, as a living language for maintaining education in the Tibetan language and as the mother tongue in Tibetan areas while, at the same time, teaching Chinese in parallel to give Tibetan students decent chances of future employment. The remoteness of Tibetan areas does not make this task any easier.</p>
<p class="contents">We sincerely hope that China will ensure that Tibetan is used as the main language of instruction in schools in Tibetan areas and ensure the protection of minority languages in the other parts of China in the same way. Seeking the view of experts and avoiding discrimination and the influence of ideology are good recipes for the way forward. The EU is ready to share its expertise, should China so decide. We hope – and here is my direct response – to have a frank discussion with the Chinese authorities on this very issue at the next round of the EU-China human rights dialogue. It is most important that China should allow open public consultation in order to allow those affected by any changes to language policy to freely express their opinions, which would have to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">We have followed also with deep concern reports of the detention of several Tibetan students and teachers who peacefully demonstrated in protest against the government’s education reform plan. We urge China to release the detainees and to enter into discussions with Tibetan civil society on the merits of the proposed reform.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I would like to recall the EU’s long-standing position with regard to Tibet. The preservation of Tibet’s unique culture, language, religion and traditions and the need to achieve a system of meaningful autonomy for Tibet, within the Chinese constitution, remains a top priority for the EU. These are issues that we are persistently trying to address in the framework of our political dialogue with China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament has, for many years, demonstrated its support for and solidarity with Tibet, a country that has always struggled against the oppressive and discriminatory policies of the Chinese authorities, which have threatened the territorial and cultural independence of the Tibetan people for years. Beijing’s latest act of oppression was the decision to introduce Chinese as the compulsory official language in Tibet, even though the people speak Tibetan and consider Mandarin to be a foreign language. Cultural genocide is going on as we speak, because this decision expresses the clear intention to wipe out this people, not only geographically but also culturally, by preventing younger generations from learning about their own culture and, first and foremost, their linguistic heritage. Faced with China’s inflexible and rigid attitude to Tibet, I would like to call on the European Parliament to maintain a position of intransigence with regard to the severe violations of human rights and minority rights committed by the Chinese authorities and to ensure that the people of Tibet know we are behind them and ready to help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tibetan culture is not the only one threatened by this unreasonable decision – Cantonese and other languages will also fall victim to the policy of standardisation. Given that the Chinese Constitution specifically recognises each citizen’s right to express him/herself in his/her chosen language, how can the political authorities justify this legal U-turn?

I would therefore like everyone to remember the emotion that overcame us when we saw the liberation of Aung San Suu Kyi on the television. It is true that we have a particular link with this remarkable woman, who won one of the first Sakharov Prizes here, in 1990, and who, over 20 or 21 years of her life, spent nearly 15 years in prison. She is the symbol of a political woman who can remain in a tough country like Burma, free and always showing resistance. It is absolutely extraordinary.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this event must not make us forget, first of all, that her freedom is fragile. She has already been freed before and then put under house arrest again. Second, let us not forget that the elections that have just taken place in Burma were really a farce, a travesty of democracy. Before the elections, laws were voted in to repress freedom of expression. Some people, such as monks, were prevented from being able to vote. There are still 22 000 prisoners of conscience in Burma today, and it remains one of the worst dictatorships in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask the Burmese authorities to respect rights of association and freedom of expression and to free political prisoners, and we trust this remarkable woman, whom we are awaiting in the European Parliament, or whom we will visit if she cannot receive her Sakharov Prize, to maintain a spirit of freedom in this shattered country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As an Iranian woman said in the movie <span class="italic">The Green Wave</span>, after being released from Evin prison in Tehran: ‘The moment I stepped outside I realised I had just moved from a small prison to a bigger one: that prison is called Iran’.</p>
<p class="contents">People should not live in small or big prisons for their thoughts. The EU will see to and encourage further freedoms for all Burmese citizens and remains concerned about Aung San Suu Kyi’s wellbeing and safety, as she is being kept under surveillance by state security services.</p>
<p class="contents">The welcome move of her release needs to be reflected in further expansions of freedoms to all citizens, which are systematically curbed through the 2008 constitution and the military junta. Elections such as those which took place in Burma this month, even if held in a climate of fear and repression, are often used by regimes to claim legitimacy and to suggest that a democracy is in place. However, any government derives its legitimacy from providing for the wellbeing of its citizens, and democracy is always more than ‘one man, one vote’. It is enshrined in democratic institutions, good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that a week after the elections, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, was released. However, nothing suggests that the same fate will meet the other political prisoners in the country, numbering over two thousand. In fact, several days ago, we received information that the military junta ruling Burma had suspended the publication of a further nine journals, restricting the already limited freedom of speech in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, further pressure is needed from the international community. First and foremost, the European Union should concentrate on putting pressure on China, as without China, the ruling junta in Burma could not hold on to its power. Finally, I would like to thank Parliament’s President, Mr Buzek, for inviting Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi to the Sakharov Prize award ceremony next month in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Any step in the direction of democratisation and an improvement in the extremely problematical human rights situation is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is not going to be an easy process. The constitution now in place in Burma, following the undemocratic elections, puts the president above the law and guarantees an amnesty for past human rights violations. This must be criticised in the sharpest terms by the European Union, as must the continued serious human rights violations against ethnic minorities, who are frequently driven from their lands and forced into slave labour, many of their children being recruited as child soldiers.</p>
<p class="contents">We must redouble our efforts to bring on board countries that have a significant influence on the government in Burma, such as China and India. We must persuade them to exert their influence in the interests of the people of Burma.

As we know, and as has already been mentioned here in Parliament, the elections have taken place in a climate of fear and intimidation. They were an utter farce and served no purpose other than to give a civilian gloss to the military junta. Many people were barred from voting. Thousands of Burmese – 1 000 according to the very generals of the military junta – have taken refuge in Thailand, where 100 000 Burmese are already living, and where there are now greater risks of armed conflict along the Burmese border. This serves to remind us that while the release of Aung San Suu Kyi obviously fills us with joy and hope now that we will be able to meet this remarkable woman, as has already been mentioned, and receive her here in Parliament, we cannot divert our attention from the most important matter for Burma, namely, the liberation of an entire people and the more than 2 000 political prisoners, along with the lifting of a general climate of intimidation and fear.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should not, therefore, lower its guard. We need a great deal of focus, of concentration and of stubbornness: we absolutely must not allow ourselves to be complacent. At this juncture, I believe that it is worth saying that certain Member States need to be firmer and, above all, more consistent in advocating human rights. The businesses that many Member States are continuing to maintain in Burma must be brought into line with the EU’s human rights commitments. I recall, for instance, that the oil company TOTAL has holdings in Burma that make up 7% of the Burmese junta’s budget. Parliament will continue to be focused and united on this issue, and I hope that the Commission and the Member States will also continue to take this approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I must also tell you that I want us to support Aung San Suu Kyi in rebuilding her party, the National League for Democracy, which was illegally disbanded in May. She certainly has a huge job to do. This is why I believe that international pressure must continue because the military junta has not committed to a process of democratisation, but is going in the exact opposite direction to this process, given that the elections held in November were neither free nor fair. This is why I believe that we must not diminish our focus on this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, as other colleagues have said, we can now persuade the junta to release all political prisoners, if we can persuade the junta to allow Aung San Suu Kyi complete freedom, both in terms of movement and in terms of political public statements, and, finally, if the new Burmese parliament and government start to improve human and fundamental rights in the country, and to improve the social and economic conditions of the people of Burma, then perhaps, in a few years time, there will be grounds for our institutions to start negotiating and engaging with the Burmese regime and to see a better future for that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without the efforts of the international community, without pressure being exerted on the ruling junta in Burma, democracy will not reign there. I remember the times when the leaders of the free world came to Poland during the Communist dictatorship, and all of them, alongside official visits, also visited the leader of the underground movement, Lech Wałęsa.

Awarded the Nobel Prize and Parliament’s Sakharov Prize, she remains a symbol of fortitude and hope for the better future which the people of her country deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that Aung San Suu Kyi has unrestricted freedom of movement and speech. It is equally essential that all remaining political prisoners be set free – more than 2 000 of them, according to Mr Posselt and Mr Preda. This would allow for a credible transition to a more inclusive system of government.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma/Myanmar has seen elections which were not up to international standards, notably as far as conditions for competing opposition parties were concerned. However, the fact that civil society could partially organise itself politically is welcome, notwithstanding the difficulties. We acknowledge the decision of certain opposition parties not to participate, but also the fact that some other parties, including from ethnic groups, did participate. Their resolve to seize what they saw as an opportunity was commendable.</p>
<p class="contents">Elections in themselves do not make a country democratic. Nevertheless, they can offer the opportunity for a new beginning and they do, at least, introduce a degree of pluralism into the system. In spite of the evident flaws, if the elections mark the beginning of a positive process, this will be a welcome development.</p>
<p class="contents">We have repeatedly said that the EU was willing to engage with the government in order to use the opportunity of elections to begin a new and positive phase in the history of the country. From now on, we need to observe closely how accountable the new parliament and government will be to society; whether the new institutions will ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; and whether they will deliver better policies to improve the economic and social situation of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">To improve the human rights situation in the country, a meaningful dialogue between all stakeholders must be established. Such a dialogue should usher in – apart from the long overdue transition to a civilian, legitimate and accountable system of government – a political system based on the rule of law and on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The EU has repeatedly stated that it stands ready to support such a process.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to use all the means at our disposal – dialogue and engagement, United Nations channels and restrictive measures, but also assistance – to help persuade the new government to improve its record. Human rights aspects are built into our aid programmes. Moreover, we seek links with civil society and parts of the administration and we will try to engage with the government on its responsibilities for attaining the Millennium Development Goals. Promoting our values – namely human rights, development and dialogue – is, and will remain, the cornerstone of our policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to focus on the government’s treatment of the citizens when 40% of the population belongs to an ethnic minority that was forced to flee to Thailand after the recent election. The release of Aung San Suu Kyi is a positive. However, history has shown us that the Burmese Government has a habit of reverting back to its old ways where any or all opposition is imprisoned. Currently, more than 1 000 ‘political prisoners’ are still being held. The blatant disregard for free elections is a clear indication that the new government has little or no interest in providing a true democracy for the people of Burma. The UN proposal for further dialogue with Burma should be supported by this Parliament and we should continue our efforts to protect all the citizens of Burma from future injustices.

That is clearly unacceptable, because we would be forcing Christians from Kirkuk, Mosul and Baghdad to become ghettoised.

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The Council has not discussed the situation in the Serbian region Sandžak and cannot comment on the issue.</p>
<p>However, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), which is currently being ratified, states that Serbia and the EU shall seek to strengthen regional and local development cooperation, with the objective of contributing to economic development and reducing regional imbalances. Specific attention shall be given to cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.</p>
<p>Allow me to add that the SAA also establishes close economic cooperation, including the development of a free trade area and financial cooperation that shall take due account of the priority areas related to the Community acquis in the field of regional development.</p>
<p>The Council has reaffirmed on many occasions its full support for the European perspective of the region, including Serbia, which remains essential for its stability, reconciliation and future. In accordance with the Stabilisation and Association process and particularly with the SAA, which is currently being ratified, the Council supports Serbia’s efforts to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, and to contribute to political, economic and institutional stability in Serbia, as well as to the stabilisation of the region.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes Serbia’s commitment to EU integration by undertaking key reforms in line with European standards. In recognition of these efforts, the Council has recently taken some important decisions with regard to Serbia: on 30 November 2009, the Council lifted visa restrictions; on 14 June 2010, it decided to begin ratifying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and, on 25 October 2010, to begin the procedure laid down in Article 49 TEU.</p>
<p>As regards the protection of persons belonging to minorities, in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria, in December 2009, the Council stressed the importance of protection of all minorities and encouraged the governments of the Western Balkan countries, including the Serbian Government, to take the necessary action to address these issues. It added that the Roma minority continues to face very difficult living conditions and discrimination.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of 7 and 8 December 2009, the Council recalled that strengthening the rule of law, fight against corruption and accelerating economic reforms remain important, and that a constructive approach towards regional cooperation, including trade, remains essential. The reform agenda must be continued.</p>
<p>The specific priorities of the European Partnership with Serbia, adopted on 18 February 2008, also include human rights and protection of minorities. Serbia must therefore fulfil all obligations arising out of membership of the Council of Europe and must ensure compliance with the human rights provisions of the new constitution.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0516"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The economic and financial crisis, which began in 2008, has caused a sharp decline in the number of jobs and in potential output, and has led to a serious deterioration in public finances.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop of crisis, the June 2010 European Council adopted the Europe 2020 strategy, which is designed to guarantee smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as evidenced by its objectives, relating in particular to employment, research and development, renewable energy and energy efficiency, early school leaving and poverty reduction.</p>
<p>In July, the Council, under the Belgian Presidency, adopted the broad economic policy guidelines for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy aimed at improving competitiveness via structural reforms.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Council began examining certain structural elements such as fiscal frameworks, the effectiveness of education as a vehicle for growth, and the sustainability of pensions.</p>
<p>On 21 October 2010, the Council also adopted the employment policy guidelines, in order to give precise guidance to the Member States on defining their National Reform Programmes and implementing reforms, reflecting interdependence and in line with the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p>As regards economic governance, the European Council of 28 and 29 October 2010 endorsed the report of the Task Force on economic governance and called for a fast track approach to be followed on the adoption of secondary legislation needed for the implementation of many of the recommendations. This will enhance confidence and thus contribute to sustainable growth, employment and competitiveness. Therefore, in order to ensure balanced and sustainable growth, Heads of State or Government agree on the need for Member States to establish a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole.</p>
<p>As regards growth rates, the Council has made no estimates. The latest interim report by the Commission estimates growth of 1.8% in the EU and 1.7% in the euro area in 2010.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0523"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) In the Communication ‘The CAP towards 2020<a href="#defann_4_1" name="refann_4_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>’, which it recently adopted, the Commission refers to the option of reviewing the direct payment system within the framework of the future post-2013 CAP.</p>
<p>In June 2009, the Council took note of Presidency conclusions, supported by a number of delegations, which stated that, in order to meet the challenges for agriculture after 2013, any future direct payments scheme will need to be fair and legitimate, effective, simple to implement, sufficiently flexible, and easy to justify and explain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council has taken due note of the position expressed by the European Parliament in its Resolution on the future of the CAP, adopted on 8 July, and in particular of its recommendation that, in order to ensure a fair distribution of CAP funds to farmers across the EU, fair and objective criteria should be clearly defined for the implementation of a fair system of distribution that respects the diversity of farming in the EU.</p>
<p>I would draw the honourable Member’s attention to the fact that Commissioner Cioloş will present his Communication to the Council as early as Monday 29 November.</p>
<p>The Belgian Presidency attaches great importance to this issue, which is why it has scheduled a political debate for the Council meeting of 13-14 December 2010.</p>
<p>However, the Council will be able to express an opinion on the details of the issue of the fair distribution of direct payments only after it has received the legislative proposals that the Commission is due to submit to it and to the European Parliament in July 2011.</p>
<p>The European Parliament and the Council will then be required to make a decision, under the ordinary legislative procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the objectives set out in the Belgian Presidency’s work programme and in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, the Member States are to undertake reforms in order to make progress towards achieving sustainable and transparent economic growth.</p>
<p>All Member States face the problems of illegal employment and unfair competition on the market. Workers on the labour market are exploited, often have no social protection and are also sometimes obliged to accept undeclared work.</p>
<p>High unemployment means that employers cannot find the workers they need because unemployment benefits are similar to the wages on offer. There are even situations where people prefer to work on the black, because that lets them continue to benefit from employment exchange services and not lose out on allowances. As a result, people generally choose the option that suits them best. The objectives set in Member States’ annual budgets are not achieved because the revenue forecast in these budgets is not collected.</p>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) Whereas Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that the Union shall aim at full employment, Article 147 TFEU stipulates that the Union shall contribute to a high level of employment by encouraging cooperation between Member States and by supporting and, if necessary, complementing their action. In doing so, the competences of the Member States shall be respected.</p>
<p>To date, the Commission has submitted no legislative proposals to support or complement Member States’ actions aimed at combating the undeclared work of EU citizens.</p>
<p>However, on 21 October 2010, the Council, under the Belgian Presidency, adopted guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States; the latter will have to transpose them into their national policies via national reform programmes. Since those guidelines are aimed, in particular, at reducing structural unemployment and promoting job quality, it may be argued that they are designed to boost declared and legal work.</p>
<p>As regards the issue of illegally staying third-country nationals, the Council has recognised the importance of strengthening the measures to combat the employment of those persons in order to combat illegal immigration and undeclared work. Since that objective, namely to combat illegal immigration by acting against the employment pull factor, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, on 18 June 2009, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2009/52/EC providing for minimum standards on sanctions and measures against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals. The aim of that directive is to counteract illegal immigration by acting against the employment pull factor, an aim which both institutions agreed could not be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and therefore required a European directive. As far as sanctions are concerned, these should include in particular the employer’s contribution to the costs of returning illegally employed third-country nationals, with the possibility of reduced sanctions where the employer is a natural person who employs an illegally staying third-country national for his or her private purposes. The measures include, among other things, simplified procedures for employers, to enable the Member States to check the validity of residence permits or to check for forged documents. The Member States must take the measures necessary to comply with this directive by 20 July 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0529"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) According to the latest figures published by the European Commission (September 2010 interim forecast), gross domestic product (GDP) growth is forecast at 1.8% in the EU and 1.7% in the euro area in 2010. The figures confirmed for the first and second quarters of 2010 show that the rate of GDP growth in the 27 EU Member States was 0.3% and 0.7% respectively (the Council has not adopted a position on the issue of the recession). These figures would seem to indicate, according to a widespread definition of the recession, that the EU is no longer in recession.</p>
<p>However, looking to the future, a fall in GDP growth is forecast in the second half of 2010, due to the anticipated slowdown in the global economy. Consequently, the challenge for the future is to ensure that the EU continues to consolidate its growth while guaranteeing the strength and viability of public finances. This effort should be aimed at stabilising debt levels, and subsequently reducing them, in order to restore them initially to pre-crisis levels, and then to bring them within the limits laid down by the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p>The Member States and the EU have made a huge contribution in budgetary terms to support the financial sector and the real economy, something which has naturally led to an increase in government deficits. These necessary and timely contributions have played an extremely important role in preventing a more serious crisis, while laying the foundations for future growth. Nevertheless, the crisis has shown that sound budgets are not enough to guarantee sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>The package agreed by the Task Force, when validated by the European Council of 28 and 29 October 2010, will be the biggest reform of the Economic and Monetary Union since the euro was created.</p>
<p>The recommendations and concrete proposals contained in the report of the Task Force are aimed in particular at implementing a surveillance mechanism, as a macroeconomic pendant of the budget-focused Pact, in order to create an early warning system to detect the risk of real estate bubbles or of unsustainable patterns on the balance of payments, or strong divergences in competitiveness.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0534"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) Faced with the unacceptable level of youth unemployment, ‘Youth on the Move’ is one of the flagship initiatives forming part of the EU’s Europe 2020 strategy for employment and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, adopted by the European Council on 17 June 2010. However, the EU’s Europe 2020 strategy concerns the entire population, with particular emphasis on women and men aged 20-64, the employment rate of whom is intended to increase to 75% under the strategy.</p>
<p>The Member States are responsible, in the first instance, for drafting and implementing their employment policies and, through those policies, they must contribute, among other things, to the achievement of the objectives laid down in the Europe 2020 strategy. The Europe 2020 strategy is based on a set of consistent guidelines on employment issues and broad economic policy issues.</p>
<p>On 21 October 2010, in accordance with Article 148 TFEU and on the basis of the conclusions of the European Council, the Council adopted the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, as part of the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p>In this regard, Guideline 7 ‘Increasing labour market participation of women and men, reducing structural unemployment and promoting job quality’ emphasises that ‘employment services play an important role in activation and matching’ and that ‘such services should be open to all’.</p>
<p>Guideline 8 ‘Developing a skilled workforce responding to labour market needs and promoting lifelong learning’ reminds the Member States that initial education and vocational training must be complemented with effective incentives for lifelong learning for those who are not in employment, thus ensuring every adult the chance to retrain or to move one step up in their qualification. In particular, efforts should focus on supporting those with low and obsolete skills and on increasing the employability of older workers.</p>
<p>Lastly, Guideline 9 ‘Improving the performance of education and training systems at all levels and increasing participation in tertiary education’ provides that the Member States should invest efficiently in education and training systems notably to raise the skill level of the EU’s workforce, allowing it to meet the rapidly changing needs of modern labour markets. In line with the lifelong learning principles, action should cover all sectors (from early childhood education and schools through to higher education, vocational education and training, as well as adult learning). Reforms should aim to ensure the acquisition of the key competencies that every individual needs for success in a knowledge-based economy, notably in terms of employability, lifelong learning and information and communication technologies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0535"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The Council is fully aware that the wrongful removal or retention of a child is a distressing and potentially harmful experience for the child concerned.</p>
<p>The Council recognises that the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is a highly important international instrument, which, it must be stressed, has enabled many child abduction cases to be solved since its adoption. Like the honourable Member, the Council is anxious to see this convention applied effectively, for the benefit of the children concerned.</p>
<p>The Council would point out that the European Union as such is not a contracting party to the Hague Convention. The Council notes, however, that the Member States, which are all contracting parties, exchange views and experiences within the framework of Special Commissions convened at regular intervals by the Hague Conference in order to monitor the practical operation of the convention.</p>
<p>In this context, the Council would also point out that the 1980 Convention was supplemented, in 1996, by another convention adopted by the Hague Conference. It should be mentioned that, in connection with the implementation of the latter convention, the Member States have cooperated closely in creating a practical guide of which some parts are specifically aimed at providing guidelines on the handling of child abduction cases.</p>
<p>As for the benefit to be gained from Member States coordinating their approaches to cases of child abduction, the Council would point out that such coordination already exists. Indeed, in their dealings with each other the Member States must apply Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility. This Brussels IIa Regulation contains, among other things, rules of jurisdiction on child abduction, in particular with regard to judgments requiring the return of a child who has been wrongfully removed or retained in a Member State other than the Member State where he or she was habitually resident.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0536"></a>

<p>The Managing Director of the IMF has expressly and categorically stated that the Fund is prepared to extend the repayment schedule for the loans contracted by Greece from the financial mechanism, provided the Member States of the EU do likewise. The main reasons behind Mr Strauss-Kahn's statement are that the refinancing needs for the Greek debt will increase inordinately over the two-year period 2014-2015 and that there is a need to create a positive climate on the markets. The Greek population is apprehensive at the thought that extending the repayment schedule will prolong the unpopular policies implemented under the Memorandum.</p>

<p>(FR) Following the deterioration in Greece’s macroeconomic and budgetary situation in 2010, the Council addressed some recommendations to Greece inviting it to adopt appropriate measures to reduce its budget deficit and to implement the necessary structural reforms.</p>
<p>Thus, on 10 May and 7 September 2010, the Council addressed two Decisions to Greece with a view to reinforcing and deepening fiscal surveillance and giving notice to Greece to take measures for the deficit reduction judged necessary to remedy the situation of excessive debt. The two Decisions set out the main elements of the economic programme that Greece will have to implement, and which reflects the key conditions attached to financial assistance.</p>
<p>The financial support programme for Greece has been agreed and implemented by the Member States of the euro area outside the EU treaties. It consists of a package of bilateral loans granted individually by those Member States of the euro area that are participating in the programme.</p>
<p>The conditions attached to the bilateral loans were the subject of a specific loan agreement between the Member States providing financial support and Greece, to which the Memorandum of Understanding is annexed. The Memorandum lays down the loan disbursement conditions.</p>

The confirmed total amount of funding to be channelled to developing countries as ‘fast-start funding’ for the year 2010 is EUR 2.2 billion. A total of EUR 7.2 billion has been set aside for the entire period 2010-2012. These commitments confirm the EU Member States’ compliance with the Copenhagen Agreement.</p>
<p>The Member States have made considerable progress in implementing the commitments for 2010. A non-exhaustive list of projects has been drawn up and disseminated by the Council. The Council will draft annual reports on ‘fast-start funding’ for the next two years.</p>
<p>The Council has called on the Economic and Financial Committee and the Economic Policy Committee to update the data in order to present the most comprehensive information possible at the Cancun Conference.</p>
<p>The Council has made no provision to increase the sums laid down in paragraph 1. The Council merely checks that the Member States are honouring their commitments. Since the ‘fast-start funding’ is a set of commitments made by the Member States, it is possible that some Member States will decide to increase their contributions.</p>
<p>EU action to mitigate or cancel the debt of developing countries is carried out as part of the HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Initiative and of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).</p>

<p>(FR) South Africa is participating, along with the other countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) – Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Swaziland – in the negotiations on an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA). In this respect a new impetus can be observed in 2010.</p>
<p>Indeed, during the third EU-South Africa Summit, which took place on 28 September 2010, the political leaders engaged in frank and open discussions on the EU-SADC EPA and, at the same time, reaffirmed their will and determination to conclude negotiations on an Economic Partnership Agreement that enhances the trade and economic relations between the SADC and the EU.</p>
<p>The leaders welcomed the timetable of negotiations planned until the end of the year. They urged both sides to reach a mutually satisfactory conclusion of all remaining issues.</p>
<p>Our shared objective to conclude the negotiations by the end of 2010 is certainly ambitious, but it is within our reach. It will, of course, require effort, a serious commitment and a spirit of compromise from both partners.</p>
<p>Since the Summit, the negotiators have already met and will meet again. I am convinced that, thanks to the political momentum provided by the Summit, the negotiators will be able to find a solution to the outstanding issues.</p>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The Communication ‘A ‘Small Business Act’ for Europe’ (SMA), adopted by the Commission on 25 June 2008, aims to place SMEs at the heart of policy-making (‘Think Small First’), to increase their capacity to create jobs within the EU and to stimulate their competitiveness within the single market and the world markets alike.</p>
<p>On 1 December 2008, the Council adopted conclusions approving the Commission’s approach and calling on the Commission and the Member States to ensure its implementation and ongoing monitoring.</p>
<p>In its report of 15 December 2009, the Commission outlined the progress made in implementing the SBA and announced its intention to publish a communication in December 2010, once it had consulted representatives of SME professional bodies and the competent public authorities. The Council is awaiting this communication so as to decide on what follow-up action, if any, to take.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the Belgian Presidency, the Council has made progress on matters of great importance for SMEs: the functioning of the internal market and the ‘Single Market Act’ project; the new innovation strategy; the concrete measures for European tourism approved by the Council; and the simplification of European research programmes to enable innovative SMEs to access financing more quickly.</p>
<p>We have had success: the adoption, in conjunction with the European Parliament, of the directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions is a huge success as far as SMEs are concerned, and we welcome the European Parliament’s unfailing spirit of cooperation, which has made this outcome possible.</p>
<p>The Council would also point out that the work in relation to the consolidation and appropriate regulation of the financial sector is being undertaken with the aim of improving access to capital for SMEs, the businesses most affected by the credit crunch.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0553"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The EU-US Summit on 20 November was a great success. The discussions between Presidents Obama, Van Rompuy and Barroso were of a very high quality.</p>
<p>On the economy, the European Union and the United States discussed the results of the G20 summit in Seoul, and the contribution the European Union and the United States can make to securing a sustainable and balanced recovery and to creating jobs through structural financial market reform and fiscal consolidation which promotes growth.</p>
<p>The European Union and the United States stressed the need to fully tap into the potential of transatlantic commerce to boost growth and generate jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union and the United States recognise the central role of the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) in achieving these objectives, and they tasked the TEC to develop a transatlantic innovation agenda to stimulate growth and create jobs in areas such as clean energy, e-health, information and communication, and other emerging technologies. The TEC is expected to report on progress in these areas in the first half of 2011.</p>
<p>The European Union and the United States emphasised that they stand by the commitments they made in Copenhagen last December to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union and the United States agreed to promote a positive outcome at the Cancun conference.</p>
<p>The European Union and the United States reaffirmed their commitment to collaboration and coordinated action on development. The European Union and the United States pledged to continue cooperation on food security, climate change and the Millennium Development Goals, including health, within the framework of the EU-US Dialogue on Development.</p>
<p>The European Union and the United States also welcomed their deepening partnership on a wide range of transnational security issues that affect their citizens. Recognising this, as well as the growing challenge of cyber-security and cyber-crime, the European Union and the United States established an EU-US Working Group on networks and cyber-security, which will report progress within a year. We aim to facilitate transatlantic travel for the citizens of our 27 Member States and of the United States while pursuing the vital task of maintaining security, and now look forward to similar success in our forthcoming negotiations on a Passenger Name Record agreement. We will also continue our work towards negotiating a comprehensive agreement on data protection, with the aim of facilitating cooperation between our respective services while guaranteeing a high level of protection of our citizens’ privacy. We are also committed to extending our partnership on countering violent extremism, in particular by sharing research and good practice and by enhancing cooperation on assistance to third countries at risk.</p>
<p>Finally, we also discussed our common efforts to promote security in certain countries across the world.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0559"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) In 2008<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the European Parliament called on the Commission to propose an EU programme in the field of sport, as well as preparatory actions in that field. The preparatory actions, which may only run over three consecutive years, have been proposed by the Commission for 2009, 2010 and 2011: the objective of these actions is to prepare future EU actions in the field of sport with a view to implementing the provisions of the Treaty in this field.</p>
<p>The Council has had no involvement in these preparatory actions, which are the responsibility of the Commission and of the European Parliament and have been financed from the margins of a European Parliament budgetary heading since December 2009, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Under Article 165 TFEU, the EU is granted a new power to support, coordinate and supplement Member States’ action in the field of sport, in particular with regard to social inclusion and integration, sport for health and volunteering.</p>
<p>On 10 May 2010, the Council held a general debate on the future of EU sport policy, thus helping the Commission in its efforts to draft future practical proposals aimed at implementing the new provisions of the Treaty. The following were designated as priority areas by the Council: social inclusion in and through sport, health-enhancing physical activity, education and training in sport, the fight against doping, good governance, structured dialogue with the sports movement, and the sport economy and sport statistics.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on 18 and 19 November 2010, the Council, acting on an initiative of the Belgian Presidency, adopted a resolution on the structured dialogue on sport, conclusions on the fight against doping and conclusions on the role of sport in society.</p>
<p>Although the Commission intends to propose a new framework, on the basis of an EU programme on policy-making and cooperation in sport in the coming years aimed at implementing the new provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon in that field, to date no specific proposal (whether a ‘mini’ programme covering the period 2012-2013 or a comprehensive programme covering the period 2014-2020) has been submitted to the Council by the Commission.</p>
<p>In the absence of proposals from the Commission, the Council is unable to take any action.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the November 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The exchange rate should simply be a reflection of the economic fundamentals of a currency. If this mechanism is to work properly, countries must refrain from competitive devaluations.</p>
<p>In an effort to further strengthen the economic pillar of EMU, the European Council of 28-29 October 2010 focused on sustainable growth, employment and competitiveness, which are the fundamentals of the euro area. Special emphasis was placed on fiscal consolidation plans, financial regulatory reform, social cohesion, job creation and the need for further structural reforms.</p>
<p>In preparation for the Seoul G20 summit, the October 2010 European Council discussed the priorities which the representatives of the EU and the EU Member States which are members of the G20 would promote there. Particular attention was given to the issue of rebalancing world growth, and the European Union stressed the need to avoid all forms of protectionism and to avoid engaging in exchange-rate moves aimed at gaining short-term competitive advantages.</p>
<p>The Seoul Summit took due note of these points made by the EU and the Member States that participated in it, and the G20 leaders adopted the ‘Seoul Action Plan’, in which they pledge to ensure ongoing recovery and sustainable growth and to enhance the stability of financial markets, including enhancing exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, and refraining from competitive devaluation of currencies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0526"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission intends to propose a Council Recommendation on policies to reduce early school leaving. This Recommendation will set out basic guidelines for coherent, comprehensive and evidence based policies against early school leaving. It will provide a reference framework to assist Member States to develop more effective policies against early school leaving, to support them in their implementation, and so to lead to a significant reduction in the rate of early school leaving in all Member States.</p>
<p>Early school leaving is a complex phenomenon and causes leading to drop-out differ between Member States, regions and localities. The proposed Council Recommendation will add value to Member States’ efforts by supporting them in developing policies that identify the causes of and address early school leaving in a lifelong learning perspective, tackle it as a phenomenon that cuts across several related policy areas, involve all stakeholders, and make policy interventions more systematic and consistent.</p>
<p>The Recommendation itself forms part of a wider ambition to improve education and training in Europe. It is part of the Europe 2020 flagship initiative 'Youth on the Move', plays an important role within the 'Agenda for new skills and jobs' and will be implemented in the context of the Open Method of Coordination in education and training (Education and Training 2020 programme and its predecessor).</p>
<p>Both the Lifelong Learning Programme and the European Social Fund have important roles to play in supporting measures to reduce early school leaving. The future funding for both instruments after 2013 will be determined in the context of the future financial perspectives and the adoption of specific new legal bases for them.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0554"></a>

<p>(EN) The only means to increase the overall number of beneficiaries of the Erasmus Mundus programme, given the full absorption rates of existing funding, would lie in a budget increase. Any occasional increases in funding have been quickly absorbed by stakeholders and have been quickly turned into deliverable and measurable outputs on the ground through, for example, an increase in the number of scholarships or joint programmes.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2004, the European Commission has put in place measures to ensure a satisfactory participation of EU higher education institutions in the programme. Every year it has organised information days in Brussels, which are specifically addressed to universities interested in participating in the programme. In addition, national information days take place yearly in the different Member States. The Commission also organises Erasmus Mundus coordinators meetings to share information and exchange good practice.</p>
<p>Extensive information is also provided on a website, including a detailed description of the programme's actions, information on the ways to apply and relevant documents (programme decision, programme guide, call for proposals, financial and administrative handbooks, and so on).</p>
<p>Considering the very high application rate by EU higher education institutions and the consequently rather low success rate of applications (around 13% for joint masters courses and 7% for joint doctorate programmes), the Commission does not consider it necessary to increase the level and the scope of its promotional actions within the EU.</p>
<p>Concerning the participation of individual European students in the programme, there have also been no difficulties in absorbing the entire budget for EU scholarships. However, a higher application rate would have ensured stronger competition and subsequently a broader choice of more qualified beneficiaries. The Commission, with the support of the Erasmus National Agencies, has therefore launched an information campaign on the opportunities that the programme offers EU students, including by providing information to organisations such as all Erasmus University Charter holders, university associations<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, student associations<a href="#defann_18_2" name="refann_18_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the Erasmus coordinators’ association.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The financing of culture in the EU is currently achieved through various financial mechanisms dealing with exchanges and cooperation in cultural matters, dialogue between cultures and the strengthening of this sector. The EU’s Europe 2020 strategy focuses on economic growth based on a knowledge society, green industry, etc. There are fears that this strategy regards culture as one part of economic growth. Cultural identity is one of the fundamental values of the EU and cannot, by its very nature, be measured in terms of quantitative indicators. Projects which aim to combine current financial mechanisms are cause for concern, as the programmes vary greatly, even though they are concerned with culture. Efforts to merge cultural programmes and the Citizenship Programme are another worrying trend, as the resulting projects have little artistic value.</p>

<p>(EN) The European Union supports cultural cooperation activities within the framework of its Culture Programme, running from 2007 until 2013. This Programme aims to enhance the cultural area shared by Europeans through the development of cultural cooperation projects between cultural organisations from different countries participating in the Programme.</p>
<p>The thrust of this strand, which receives over three quarters of the overall Programme budget, is to help organisations, such as theatres, museums, professional associations, research centres, universities, cultural institutes and public authorities to cooperate so that different sectors can work together and extend their cultural and artistic reach across borders.</p>
<p>It is too early to say anything on the specific financing mechanism of future cultural initiatives, for which proposals will only be made in the second half of 2011. However it is already clear that the formulation of any programme proposal will take into account the objectives and priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p>In that light, the Commission is looking at a number of issues which will contribute to designing future initiatives in the field of culture.</p>
<p>The mid-term evaluation of the current Culture Programme is currently being finalised and will include recommendations for the future. In addition, a public online consultation is currently underway asking for views on future actions to promote culture. More than 160 responses have already been received and the Commission will take them into account when reflecting on a new culture programme. The consultation will remain open until 15 December 2010.</p>
<p>Following the consultation, a debate with stakeholders will take place in February 2011 to enable them to express their views in more detail and to discuss the various options for future initiatives.</p>
<p>Finally, prior to making any proposals for future actions, the Commission will conduct an assessment to ensure the maximum impact and added value of any possible programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0528"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission fully understands the honourable Member’s concerns regarding the allegations of corrupt practices and recalls that he raised some of the same issues in his question <a href="/doceo/document/H-7-2009-0320_EN.html">H-320/09</a><a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> to which he received a response in October 2009.</p>
<p>Action by judicial authorities comes under the responsibility of the Member States. The Commission’s responsibility in anti-corruption matters focuses on prevention, legislation and monitoring. Should the matters to which he refers concern EU funds, the Commission would recall that Member States are required under Treaty obligations to take all necessary measures to protect the EU’s financial interests. They are also obliged under the relevant sectoral regulations to notify the Commission of any cases of fraud, irregularity or any other illegal activities involving EU funds which they have detected.</p>
<p>As was already explained in its response to question <a href="/doceo/document/H-7-2009-0320_EN.html">H-320/09</a>, European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may intervene when a corruption case involving EU funds is brought to light, but on a more general level the Commission may act through legislative initiatives, intervention in international fora, dialogue with the Member States, etcetera in order to develop efficient tools to combat such activity. The Commission has not been inactive in this last area. As foreseen in the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme, the Commission envisages presenting in April 2011 a Communication on a comprehensive policy against corruption in Member States, including the establishment of an evaluation mechanism as well as presenting modalities of cooperation with the Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) for that purpose.</p>
<p>The Commission has been informed by the OLAF that the number of current cases with which it is presently concerned is quite limited. The following is an overview of the two cases, both of which involve only Siemens and not any of the other companies mentioned in the question:</p>
<p>a case investigated by OLAF and closed in the last quarter of 2003, involving external aid, is in judicial follow-up in Germany. OLAF is following closely the judicial proceedings in that country;</p>
<p>a second OLAF case relating to projects funded by the European Investment Bank has just been concluded. It involves public procurement procedures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Globally, a Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) could be an appropriate option as a revenue raiser in particular to provide financing for global policy goals. For it to work effectively and fairly, participating countries should try to come to an agreement on global financing tools that can be acceptable to all. The Commission is committed to continuing to work with its international partners, in particular in the G-20, to reach such an agreement. In the Commission's view the FTT is less suited for a unilateral introduction at EU-level because of risks, such as relocation and reduced liquidity, are high and would undermine the ability to generate revenue. Thus, the Commission is currently exploring the possibility to introduce a Financial Activities Tax (FAT) at EU level, as an alternative instrument. The Commission will conduct an Impact Assessment in order to be able to propose, where appropriate, tax designs, aimed at minimising distortions or adverse effects on the economy and the internal market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the honourable Member points out, the EU-Turkey Customs Union has contributed largely to the substantial increase of the trade volume between the two partners. The Commission is also aware of the fact that counterfeit products and inadequate protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) in Turkey constitute significant problems in the EU-Turkey trade relations.</p>
<p>To address the above shortcomings, the Commission proposed in April 2008 to Turkey the establishment of a joint working group on IPR issues. The aim of the working group will be to discuss in depth issues related inter alia with the enhancement of IPR enforcement capacity in Turkey. After long hesitations, Turkey accepted recently the establishment of the working group and appointed the relevant coordinating authority. The Commission is now expecting Turkey's formal response to its proposal to hold the first meeting of the working group and start discussing substantial IPR matters.</p>
<p>Moreover, the establishment of the EU-Turkey working group on IPR issues and the successful engagement of Turkey into an IPR dialogue is a key requirement for progress under the relevant negotiation chapter ‘Intellectual property law’ (chapter 7). Therefore, in the framework of discussions with regard to IPR chapter, the Commission is monitoring progress of Turkey towards further alignment and implementation of the IPR acquis as well as its enforcement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the framework of EU-Turkey Customs Union, the Commission is urging Turkey to comply with the provisions of Article 31 of Decision 1/95 of the EU-Turkey Association Council establishing the Customs Union, which invites Turkey to improve the effective protection of IPR in order to secure a level of protection equivalent to that in the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0531"></a>

<p>The food supply chain in the EU is characterised by a broad base of producers with a very narrow route to the market for these products. Market power in the chain is ultimately in the hands of a few operators.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the consolidation process which took place along the food supply chain, and agrees that this situation is liable to give rise to significant imbalances in bargaining powers between contracting parties. The Commission has identified in its Communication on the food supply chain of 2009<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, as well as in its Retail Market Monitoring Report of July 2010<a href="#defann_27_2" name="refann_27_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the existence of situations where some actors face large companies that are often their only channel for accessing the market. It should be stressed that this situation is found throughout the supply chain and is liable to affect both producers that have a weak bargaining position vis à vis retailers – specifically those of non differentiated products, including farmers who produce mostly undifferentiated commodities - and also retailers that do not have access to certain branded products sold by large multinational producers.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the fact that imbalances in bargaining power in certain specific conditions can lead to the imposition of unfair commercial practices by one of the contracting parties on the other. Unfair commercial practices can have a negative impact and limit a company's capacity to invest in innovation and quality of products, be they food or non food products or services.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that in general imbalances of bargaining power resulting from the unequal size of contracting parties are not per se problematic in competitive markets, as the lower costs achieved through bargaining tend to be passed through downstream market chain to the ultimate benefit of consumers.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently exploring how to address the issue and will come forward with an initiative geared towards business-to-business relations aiming at protecting the different operators in the supply chain against unfair commercial practices. As far as food is concerned, the Commission has established an Expert Platform on Business-to-Business (B2B) Contractual Practices in the Food Supply Chain to collect information on possible unfair commercial practices. This Platform will report to the High Level Forum for a Better Functioning Food Supply Chain<a href="#defann_27_3" name="refann_27_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission is also currently preparing legislative proposals to strengthen the bargaining power of milk producers in the specific sector of dairy products following the debate within the High Level Group on Milk.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission would refer the honourable Member to the Commission Statement on the sludge catastrophe in Hungary (plenary session of 19 October 2010).</p>
<p>The acute impact of the accident is mainly due to the very big amount and high alkalinity of the leaked sludge. The longer term impact on the environment is likely to be confined to a limited territory in Hungary. The alkaline pollution also reached the Danube River, but due to the safety measures taken by the Hungarian authorities (dilution of the pollution with gypsum and acidic materials), this water body did not suffer any significant harmful effects.</p>
<p>The Commission received notification through the early warning system of the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR). This information has been sent to all countries in the Danube basin in order to allow them to take the necessary protective measures to safeguard their water catchments. The Commission has been in contact with Slovakia, Romania and the ICPDR. Based on their sampling results cross-border effects are likely to be minimal.</p>
<p>The Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC) was in close contact with Hungary from the outset of the emergency and offered assistance in case of need. Information has been shared with all Member States on the disaster and its possible effects on the population and the environment.</p>
<p>On 7 October 2010, at 8 p.m., the Hungarian Government activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism by issuing a request for assistance to the MIC. The request was for a team of 5 experts with strong field experience in preventing/mitigating damage from alkali sludge on flora and fauna, and decontamination of agricultural land. The EU Civil Protection Team was deployed to Hungary for 1 week and delivered a number of recommendations for measures agreed upon with the Hungarian authorities to further enhance the remedial and recovery plan for the affected area.</p>
<p>Industrial accidents are normally not covered by the European Union Solidarity Fund. The Fund may provide assistance in case of natural disasters and when the damages exceeds 0,6% of Gross National Income following an application from an affected Member State. Damage for which there is liability may not be compensated by the Solidarity Fund. Operational programmes co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund might contain provisions for prevention of disasters and remove risks for further development. However the polluter pays principle is to be applied, before a project could be approved for funding under any of these programmes.</p>
<p>The ‘polluter pays’ principle likewise applies to rural development policy. Nevertheless, Council Regulation (EC) n° 1698/2005<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> foresees possibilities to grant support for 'Restoring agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and introducing appropriate prevention actions'. This measure is not programmed in the New Hungarian Rural Development Programme (NHRDP), but it could still be introduced if the Member State requests so. In addition, the measure 'Restoring forestry potential in forests damaged by natural disasters and fire and introducing appropriate prevention actions' provides a similar support for the affected forestry sector. This measure is included in the NHRDP. Support under both measures can be provided under the condition that the catastrophe has to be recognised as a natural disaster.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the honourable Member pointed out, in November 2009 the Commission decided to refer Bulgaria to the European Court of Justice for the failure to establish an integrated and adequate network of waste disposal installations as required by the Waste Framework Directive<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and in April 2010 Bulgaria submitted to the Commission a major project application ‘Integrated System of Municipal Waste Treatment Facilities for Sofia Municipality’.</p>
<p>With regard to whether the application made by Bulgaria meets the financial and technical criteria laid down by the Commission, and whether the Commission considers the technology selected to fulfil all the necessary requirements from an environmental and financial-economic standpoint with a view to co-financing of the project, it should be pointed out that the technical assessment of Bulgaria's application by the Commission has confirmed the viability of the first substantial components of the new waste management system, namely an adequate long-term landfill capacity and the facilities for composting. At the same time, in view of the need for more consistent and up-to date waste stream data and for additional assurance regarding the cost-efficiency of the system, certain parts of the submitted project will have to be reworked. In this regard, while the upgrade of the integrated waste management system should be seen as one project, the Commission considers that time can be gained by implementing this project in two phases, with a first phase to start immediately and a second phase to be implemented once the additional analyses have been completed. This model should give the opportunity to the Bulgarian authorities to develop a well-functioning waste management system that is viable in the long term both from an environmental and economic efficiency point of view.</p>
<p>With regard to your question on the infringement proceedings, suspension would require a new Commission's decision amending the decision from November 2009 to refer Bulgaria to the Court. However, in line with its practice in such cases, the adoption of a decision regarding the first phase of the project and the rapid start of the construction of the first-phase infrastructure should be sufficient for the Commission to suspend the pending infringement procedure, which will provide Bulgaria with the necessary time to prepare an environmentally compliant and long term cost-efficient second phase of the Sofia Municipal Waste Management Project.</p>
<p>With regard to the storage of waste in the city of Sofia, until such time as the new processing factory is constructed and enters into operation, the Commission will work together with the Bulgarian authorities to ensure that the storage of waste complies with the main requirements of the EU waste acquis. The Waste Framework Directive requires MS to ensure that storage is taking place without endangering human health and without harming the environment. The Waste Framework Directive also contains specific provisions on the storage of hazardous waste. In addition, the requirements of the Landfill Directive apply to the storage of waste prior to recovery for a period of three years or longer and the storage of waste prior to disposal for a period of one year or longer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In practice, this decision will lead to 255 000 wagon loads of freight being diverted to road transport and in the short term will reduce the volume transported by a third in comparison with 2008. In total, this will be equivalent to increasing road traffic by 1 200 000 lorries, which, according to a study carried out by SNCF, means 300 000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. These environmental risks will inevitably go hand in hand with job losses, which are unacceptable at this time of crisis.</p>
<p>Can the Commission say if it still plans to launch a complete study on single wagon loads by 2011?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is well aware of the situation and developments in single wagonload traffic in France and other Member States, which have been aggravated by the recent economic crisis. Single wagonload services in many Member States accounts for an important part of total rail freight traffic and its discontinuation in some countries could jeopardize the viability of this kind of traffic in other parts of Europe, where railway undertakings are still committed to it. This would have a negative impact on transport options for shippers and result in undesired modal-shift effects on a European level. The Commission therefore considers single wagonload services as an important part of European rail freight.</p>
<p>The Commission confirms that it plans to launch a comprehensive study on single wagonload traffic in 2011 in order to identify possible policy options. The study is intended to address questions related to the ‘last mile’ (industrial spurs, freight terminals), freight flow consolidation and deconsolidation, train formation facilities and services as well as regulatory issues related to these. It will take into account possible future production methods and business models for single wagonload services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0541"></a>

<p>In the Civil Enforcement section of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), paragraph 1 of Article 2.X: Injunctions allows judicial authorities to issue an order (injunction) against a party, or a third party, to ‘prevent infringing goods from entering into the channels of commerce’. This injunction power is considerably different from that existing under the EU acquis (Article 9 of the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive (Directive 2004/48/EC)), which permits injunctions ‘to prevent any imminent infringement’. Furthermore, the third parties need to be involved in the infringement (‘against an intermediary whose services are being used’). The ACTA text essentially eliminates the thresholds for injunction powers that exist under the EU acquis.</p>
<p>Given that, by laying down the thresholds for injunctions, the EU acquis has struck a delicate balance between enforcement and fundamental rights safeguards, how will the Commission ensure that these safeguards under the current EU acquis are maintained?</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to clarify that Article 2.X.1 ACTA (page 6) refers to injunctions in the sense of measures taken when the court establishes an infringement (‘… order against a party to desist from an infringement’), while Article 9 of the Enforcement Directive refers to provisional and precautionary measures (also described in EU law as interlocutory injunctions, hence the possible misunderstanding), which are temporary measures taken before a final decision is issued by the court. This is the reason why these two provisions make reference to different requirements, or ‘thresholds’.</p>
<p>The provision dealing with injunctions in Article 2.X.1 ACTA (page 6) must be compared with the equivalent provision in Article 11 of the Enforcement Directive, while the provision addressing provisional measures in Article 9 of the Enforcement Directive is equivalent to the provision in Article 2.5.1(a) of ACTA (page 8).

<p>(EN) In the case of the admixture of genetically modified (GM) Amflora potatoes with the non-authorised GM Amadea potato in Sweden, the Commission has, upon reception of information from the Swedish authorities, contacted the company BASF Plant Science and the three Member States where this genetically modified organism (GMO) is cultivated (Czech Republic, Germany, and Sweden). The Commission ensured coordinated actions notably through the organisation of a joint mission with experts from the three Member States to the facilities of the company where the first steps of the process for the production of GM Amflora potatoes take place. The main objective of the mission was to gather more information on the possible sources of the admixture for all lots of Amflora potatoes cultivated in 2010. This coordination will be pursued in order to ensure that there will be no contamination in the future.</p>
<p>On the basis of available information, the Commission considers that the actions taken by the three Member States following the admixture of GM Amflora potatoes with the other non-authorised GM potatoes are sufficient. The Commission is examining further options to reinforce monitoring of environmental effects of GM crops. This will provide proper feedback so as to enable them to enhance their assessments.</p>
<p>Member States are responsible for the official control regarding the implementation of the legislation of GMOs, including the control on the illegal release of non-authorised GMOs. It is also the role of Member States to impose sanctions on the operators that are infringing the legislation, and to impose corrective actions addressing deficiencies in their production process.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomed the decision taken by the Member States' competent authority to request to destroy the areas with the illegal released non-authorised GMOs. In addition, the Commission has requested the 27 Member States to provide an overview of the presence of non-authorised GMOs in seeds.</p>
<p>As already done in the past, the Commission may where necessary take specific measures to ensure that products containing non-authorised GMOs are not placed on the market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0544"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is well aware of the risks posed by asbestos fibres. With a view to stepping up worker protection, Directive 2009/148/EC<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> consolidates various asbestos-related legislative instruments to make the legislation easier to understand and implement. In particular, Article 14 of that directive makes it an obligation for employers to provide appropriate training for all workers who are, or are likely to be, exposed to dust from asbestos or materials containing asbestos. The transposition and effective implementation of that legislation is the responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p>As regards further steps or stronger protection measures needed, the Commission is drafting guidelines for workers who are mainly but not exclusively in the construction sector and who may be in contact with and affected by asbestos, with a view to preventing further cases of asbestos contamination and any ensuing asbestos-related diseases.</p>
<p>The Commission will ensure that the guidelines and related material are disseminated as widely as possible. It is also in contact with professional organisations in the field with a view to gathering evidence and ultimately helping to design the best possible strategy to address the problems posed by asbestos.</p>
<p>The Commission would also draw the honourable Member’s attention to the information available on the website of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, including guidance on asbestos-related safety<a href="#defann_33_2" name="refann_33_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, the issue of measures targeted at workers suffering from illnesses related to exposure to asbestos and families of workers who have died as a result of exposure is linked to the recognition of asbestos-related diseases, which is the sole responsibility of the Member States. The EU-level legal instrument of relevance to the recognition of and compensation for asbestos-related diseases is Recommendation 670/2003/EC<a href="#defann_33_3" name="refann_33_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which is not legally binding. Article 2 of that Recommendation specifically acknowledges that the Member States are to determine the criteria for the recognition of each occupational disease in accordance with the national laws or practices in force.</p>
<p>The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) can support the decontamination of asbestos in contaminated worksites. In the framework of the 2007-2013 Cohesion Policy, about EUR 3.5 billion are planned to be invested in the rehabilitation of industrial sites and contaminated land. Based on the principle of shared management, it is up to the Member States and their Managing Authorities to select and implement the co-financed project in line with the priorities set in the relevant Operational Programmes, for instance the rehabilitation of sites or land contaminated with asbestos.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Paragraph 2 mentions the exception for some Member States benefiting from the rule as from 31 December of the third year for each commitment. The so-called ‘N+2/ N+3 rule’ works as an incentive for Member States to spend the allocated funds in a timely manner.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the absorption rate does not completely reflect the level of spending on the ground. It only reflects the payment requests submitted by Member States to the Commission for reimbursement of final beneficiaries’ expenses. Moreover, most Member States tend to submit high payment claims towards the end of the year, resulting in some payments executed only the following year. The real level of advancement on the ground is reflected then in the absorption rate with a delay.</p>
<p>Figures as of 8 November 2010 show an average absorption rate for all Member States of 19.3% for the European Regional Development Fund, 18.2% for the Cohesion Fund and 20.0% for the European Social Fund. In the specific case of Lithuania, these figures respectively amount to 34.7%, 29.0% and 27.9%.</p>
<p>Evidence shows that most programmes are reaching cruising speed and the absorption rate is increasing month by month. The Commission is constantly working with Member States to ensure regular and timely submission of payment claims. This works well in the case of Lithuania which regularly submits payment claims to the Commission four times per year.</p>
<p>It is, however, difficult to compare the absorption rate per Member State for the various funds, as the de-commitment rule is applied differently for the various Member States. Lithuania will only be subject to the rule as from ‘N+3’ (i.e. 2011) whereas some Member States already face the risk of de-commitment this year. This has an impact on the spending profile and, consequently, on the absorption rate.</p>
<p>Lithuania’s absorption rate for each fund is higher than the average ‘paid/decided’ for all Member States. The relatively high absorption rate is partly due to payments in favour of financial engineering instruments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A court ruling rejecting an appeal by 160 local authority contract workers in Thessaloniki is yet another serious blow to the right to stable and permanent employment. This is causing a major problem regarding the operation of the Thessaloniki landfill sight in Mavrorachi, biological waste processing, recycling programmes and the operation of the environmental park on former landfill sites. The local authorities have announced the signing of two-months contracts for the operation of the above services, thereby continuing to implement their policy of holding workers to ransom, so as to speed up the process of waste management privatisation, resulting in the dismissal of thousands of workers.</p>
<p>What view does the Commission take of plans by the local authorities to privatise waste management, which is of crucial importance in terms of public health, given that, in addition to endangering the health of local residents and the environment, such a measure will result in thousands of job losses and their replacement by posts filled through temporary and flexible contracts containing no rights for the workers?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>With regard to the general issue of restructuring, and especially where this is likely to lead to redundancies, the Commission would stress that it is the employer’s duty to comply with the national provisions implementing the EU directives on informing and consulting workers. In this connection, special attention should be paid to compliance with the provisions implementing Directives 98/59/EC<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and 2002/14/EC<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.

<p>(EN) The Commission has not so far been approached by solar panel installation firms with a view to reaching agreements to install solar or photovoltaic panels on the roofs of its buildings, whether in Brussels or in Luxembourg. The Commission's policy is to install photovoltaic solar panels for its own buildings, where possible, based on the results of feasibility studies. The question whether firms who do the installation free of charge should be used has not been considered so far.</p>
<p>In Brussels, the Commission's new ‘Cornet Leman’ nursery which is to open in early 2011 has been equipped with photovoltaic solar panels (over a roof surface area of approximately 70 square meters) which will provide 9.89 kW peak power. In addition, the Commission is currently examining the possibility of installing photovoltaic solar panels on the roofs of other buildings and has already identified two buildings where this appears feasible (Rue Demot 24 and Rue du Luxembourg 46). Further verifications still have to be carried out before the Commission can proceed in line with the relevant procurement rules. Feasibility studies show that the installation of photovoltaic solar panels is expected to provide a return on investment after approximately eight to ten years, taking into account the local electricity production as well as the various support mechanisms available such as investment aid, green certificates, etc. The final return on investment can of course be affected by changes in these support mechanisms. In Luxembourg no panels have so far been fitted on any Commission building. On the other hand, the Commission has made arrangements in Luxembourg to be supplied exclusively with ‘green’ electricity, from renewable sources. It should be pointed out in this connection that all the Commission's buildings in Luxembourg are rented, with the (partial) exception of the EUROFORUM building, in respect of which it has the right/option to purchase.</p>
<p>In order to assess the overall potential for reducing the Commission's energy bills and/or its carbon footprint, individual studies have to be made of the possible sites which would be adequate and of the energy potential of any solar panel installation. These studies will have to look at matters such as the characteristics of the roof concerned, the possible presence of other equipment on the roof and the physical environment of the building concerned etc. At this early stage, it is not yet possible therefore to give an overall estimate of the impact this long term project might have on the Commission's energy bills or on its carbon footprint.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0565"></a>

<p>Apparently, Member States are increasingly undermining the internal market in medicines, patients’ access to medicines and the role of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by using the so-called ‘fourth hurdle for market access’, i.e. the national pricing and reimbursement decisions, to undermine the European quality and safety standards. It seems that some Member States are trying to establish a second standard for the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines. These actions could undermine the EU regulatory framework for medicines, which requires a long and costly process for market authorisation. These practices also threaten the single market in pharmaceuticals. It is contrary to single market principles to distort competition between those pharmaceutical companies that undertake the proper clinical research and tests to secure authorisations and those that disregard them.</p>

<p>(EN) The Court of Justice in its case-law has ruled that it is within Member States’ powers to determine the prices of medicinal products and decide on their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance systems, but that they must comply with EU law when exercising their power<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In the light of this, Directive 89/105/EEC lays down a series of procedural rules for how these decisions should be made, to ensure timely and transparent decisions.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully aware that a number of Member States use a methodological approach often referred to as HTA – Health Technology Assessment – as a basis for such decisions. Such assessments may include a comparison between a new medicinal product and existing alternatives on the market, considering patient outcome and in many cases also the relative cost-effectiveness of the new product.</p>
<p>The Commission considers HTA a relevant tool for this purpose which does not unduly distort competition in the pharmaceutical market.</p>
<p>To ensure that HTA does not constitute an unnecessary extra burden for the industry, the Commission supports European cooperation to develop common standards and methodologies for HTA use.

<p>After extensive consultation with stakeholders, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has made a proposal (opinion) to the Commission on pilot licences issued by third country authorities, which reproduces largely the standards commonly applied in Member States and developed previously by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA). This opinion also contains a proposal for the acceptance of licences issued by or on behalf of third countries, including a proposal for the conversion of third country licences issued in compliance with ICAO Annex 1. This proposal will be further discussed in the framework of the Committee established by Article 65(1) of Regulation 216/2008.</p>
<p>Beyond the current proposal for third country licence conversions the Commission takes the opportunity to recall that the recognition of non-EU licences could be simplified in case bilateral safety agreements between the EU and third countries are put in place.
