<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Derk Jan Eppink, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, these days, competition is often regarded as a concept that makes life difficult. Some people prefer cosy arrangements and the hot tub of backstage agreements as protection against the harsh world of global competition. But, Commissioner, competition is not the spoiler but the lifesaver of the European economy. Europe is at a crossroads. Will it create a transfer economy, with low growth and high structural unemployment, or will it have a wealth-creating economy that stands the test of global competition?</p>
<p class="contents">A football team, Commissioner, that is not competitive loses game after game. An economy that is not competitive loses investment, jobs and finally, the basis of its social arrangements. Since European competition policy is the exclusive competence of the European Commission, you, Commissioner – or rather Commissioner Almunia, for whom you are standing in – play a decisive role.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, the United Nations published figures on foreign direct investment in 2010. The United States attracted 43% more foreign investment than in 2009. Foreign direct investment in Latin America rose by 21% and in Asia by 10%. In the European Union, it dropped by 20% – and why is that? The money goes to where the action is. Apparently, investors regard Europe as the continent of inaction, only generating poor growth figures. It demonstrates the European Union facing a competitiveness deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have to assure a level playing field for entrepreneurial activity in Europe to make our continent fit for global competition. We all know China.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to several aspects of competition policy in 2009, of which many features are visible today. The main issue now is the consequences of massive State aid to the financial sector: states allocated taxpayers’ money to prevent the collapse of the financial sector. Had we allowed a meltdown of the financial sector, the savings and pensions of millions of European citizens would have been buried too. But it goes without saying that State aid on this scale created distortions of competition. That is why it has to end as soon as possible and the money has to be paid back to taxpayers in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, my first question therefore is: how temporary is the temporary framework, and how will it be phased out? I hope you will clarify this issue on behalf of Commissioner Almunia.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect is liquidity support of the European Central Bank to certain banks in order to keep them alive. I admit there is an interface between monetary and competition policy – but did its impact distort competition? That is my question.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the set of rules for divestment. Work criteria for downsizing companies are sufficiently clear and fair. Now we should look at the future: what is going to happen, Commissioner? Member States have gone very far to recapitalise the financial sector by partly and/or entirely nationalising institutions with taxpayers’ money. This will have to be unravelled. But once Member States start withdrawing from financial institutions to restore their private status, there is a danger that they will leave behind a dowry, a sort of wedding gift. Dowries may be used to prop up the position of financial institutions in the private market.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a feature we have often seen in the process of privatisation. I remember it too well in the postal sector. Governments propped up their postal provider just before entering the private market. In a letter, I reminded Commissioner Almunia of the long-lasting investigation into the German postal provider. The Commission is currently opening investigations into the British, French and Belgian postal providers as well, since these postal markets will be liberalised this year.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, I ask you to be attentive to the phenomenon of dowry in the financial sector. Preventing a problem is better than going the long way of legal redress.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you, Commissioner – and also Commissioner Almunia – for your cooperation, and I also thank the service of DG Competition which, as I know, is one of the best in the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the rapporteurs in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and the Committee on Transport, Ms Koch-Mehrin, Mr Buşoi and Mr Cramer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the positive tone of the report and the support expressed for our actions in the field of competition policy in 2009, in particular, in the context of the economic and financial crisis. We share your view that competition is essential to ensure a level playing field in the single market and to promote a sustainable exit from the crisis. This is why the Commission remains committed to enforcing its firm stance on anti-competitive behaviour and mergers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes note of the many requests for specific reports or studies – more than 10 of them. It is not feasible for the Commission to produce all these reports, due to our priorities and limited resources. However, as Vice-President Almunia announced to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in November, the Commission will analyse the effects on competition of the temporary State aid measures taken in the context of the crisis. This work will be difficult, but the crisis is a learning opportunity we simply cannot miss.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to restate here that these measures are indeed temporary. The Commission prolonged the crisis framework for State aid until the end of 2011 because the economic conditions are still uncertain. However, the gradual phasing out of these measures has already started. Some measures have been terminated and others have been maintained under stricter conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as regards private enforcement of competition rules, the Commission takes note of Parliament’s support for the creation of a European form of collective redress, and of its request for specific EU legislation to ensure compensation for victims of infringements of EU antitrust law. The Commission will launch a public consultation at the beginning of 2011 on a European approach to collective redress. It then plans to adopt a communication based on the results of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to refer to the concerns expressed about competition in specific sectors, such as energy, transport, the food supply chain and emerging digital industries. The Commission shares your concerns, and we will maintain our strong enforcement activities in these fields in close cooperation with the national competition authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Good competition policy enables markets to function properly. Good competition policy also allows consumers to benefit from a wide variety of products at reasonable and affordable prices. Good competition policy also contributes to creating growth again in Europe. That is why it is so important, Commissioner, to include all the areas that you have mentioned in competition policy. It is also important to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, as they are the driving force behind growth in Europe. Market barriers must be abolished, which also means doing away with the excessive costs that still pertain where competition is not working, such as roaming charges on mobile phones, where competition still does not exist – something that needs to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Eppink, for his excellent work, and to the Commission I would say: be ambitious in your goals.</p>

It is very important that the crisis is not used as a pretext to eliminate competition, and the Commission has already shown a very firm attitude against cartels, which is a good thing. We need to make sure that there are exit mechanisms and that we come back to normal market conditions as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some areas – and you spoke about that, Commissioner – where competition can be enhanced. These include the energy market, where regulated energy prices still distort competition; the completion of the single railway market can also bring important benefits to European travellers. The Commission should also be particularly careful concerning competition on the medicines market, especially with regard to those practices of originator producers which restrict the entry of generic medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I call on the Commission to be firm in securing competition between public and private hospitals by means of bold action against cross-subsidies which favour public hospitals. The Commission needs to communicate the benefits of competition policy to consumers more effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Transport is also a decisive issue when it comes to competition. After all, transport is responsible for 30% of CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, which is why I am pleased to see that it has been accepted that transport should be included in the central demands of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we still have unfair competition and this is where the Commission needs to take action. For example, the aviation sector, which is the climate killer <span class="italic">par excellence</span>, enjoys an exemption from value added tax and duty on fuel. This means that the European taxpayers pay out EUR 30 billion every year for aviation, simply so that the airlines can offer intercity flights at the same price as a short taxi journey. The railways are required to bear the burden here. We have a mandatory rail toll for every locomotive for every kilometre travelled. This is a mandatory levy and has no upper limit. On the roads, it is left up to the Member States to decide whether they charge any tolls at all. The tolls mostly apply only on motorways and only to heavy goods vehicles weighing 12 tonnes or more. In other words, some of our Member States levy a high rail toll but no road tolls at all. We cannot allow this because it completely misses the point. After all, if we do not change mobility habits, we will never succeed in averting climate change. Yet this is something we have to achieve. That is why you must establish fair competition in the transport sector too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we can get away with not doing something, most people will indeed not do it. Business is no exception in this respect. The majority of entrepreneurs (I am convinced of this) dream of the possibility of being monopoly providers who can dictate terms, instead of having those terms dictated to them by consumers. Competition is exactly what ensures consumers receive not only low prices but also optimum quality. Unfortunately, in the European Union, we still have several sectors where there is no real competition. The first of these is energy. There are still isolated markets in several areas in Europe where there is no competition at all, for legally technical reasons. What is the result? Artificially high prices for consumers. A concrete example of this is the Baltic States and the gas market. As Commissioner Oettinger himself has admitted, consumers in Germany currently pay 30% less for natural gas than consumers in the Baltic States. Why is there competition on one side, but none in the Baltic States? This must change. There is a second sphere where there is no real competition, and that is the agriculture sector. Without even mentioning what effect subsidies as such have in the agriculture market, we have within Europe very unequal agricultural payments or subsidies in one Member State compared to another. What does this mean? It means that European consumers pay artificially high prices in many places and, of course, farmers also suffer. Ladies and gentlemen, I call on you to support this report, which concerns the Commission’s work on ‘Towards competition’ in 2009. I shall remind you, however, that this work does not end with this, and that we have to extend the spheres where competition needs to be present. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the implementation of the regulations could be improved if the priorities were better aligned, the cooperation efforts redoubled, the administrative burden alleviated and if there was convergence between national and EU laws.</p>
<p class="contents">The report includes the importance of public services in meeting the basic needs of citizens and we feel we need to emphasise this within the new framework established by the Treaty of Lisbon. Therefore, and taking into account the importance of the information society, support is being given to the aid aimed at offering suitable universal broadband coverage at affordable prices to our citizens, and we request that attention is paid to the development of roaming prices in the telecommunications field in subsequent reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition policy is key in financial services. The aid offered has contributed to stabilising and mitigating the effects of the economic crisis. The report highlights its provisional nature and that its extension must take place under stricter conditions and a level playing field must be re-established for the exit process in order to avoid any moral risks and, above all, so that the financial institutions that have not claimed State aid see their competitive position restored.</p>
<p class="contents">Three points are also emphasised in the financial arena: the transparency of financial information, the need for the European payment system to be accessible, transparent and to function in a non-discriminatory and efficient manner and, thirdly, the need to combat unusually high prices in cross-border transactions with payment cards. The report also raises concerns about small and medium-sized businesses and energy, and takes on board the recommendations of the High-Level Group for the dairy sector – which holds the view that strengthening the negotiating power of the producers and the new contractual relationships must be compatible with competition policy – and asks the Commission for a legislative initiative to facilitate individual or collective claims for compensation for damages caused by infringements of competition law, whilst avoiding the excesses of the US system.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Eppink, on his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have worked in tandem (me being last year’s rapporteur), and that brings me to my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me about these annual debates on competition policy that there is a very friendly and polite exchange of views, and then the Commission just carries on with business as usual because the Commission has the exclusive powers in this area. I think, at a time where we are discussing economic governance for the European Union, that should change. The European Parliament should have a much bigger role in shaping competition policies, and I therefore urge the Commission to follow, in particular, recommendations 3 and 4, and really seriously report back to the European Parliament about its recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in my view, a report should be more than a mere summary of actions taken. It should be an analysis of the impact of the competition policies, and that is currently lacking. You say that you will do one on the temporary State aid framework because that is your priority, but we have been calling for such analyses for years: on green recovery, on State aid to innovation, on State aid to public services. That is long overdue, so I would ask the Commission to do more in-depth analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would urgently reiterate the calls we have been making – for years now – for a sector inquiry into online advertising and search engines. This is really long overdue, and I would like to hear from the Commission when they intend to conduct such an inquiry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the rapporteur. We often do this formally but, Mr Eppink, although our parties often disagree on many things, I must say that while drawing up this report, there were no taboo matters in our discussion. All points were fully addressed in a very constructive spirit, and this should be highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to move on to three points with which I believe the Commission should move forward. One, as was pointed out, is the importance of the financial sector, which, in truth, is given too much weight in the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the financial crisis has meant that the financial groups that came through did so bigger and stronger. So there really is a problem of market distortion in that area, and this does not only relate to special State aid measures established by Member States to help their financial sector, but also, and we emphasised this in the report, various forms of direct aid from the European Central Bank (ECB) that are, I am sorry to say, not very transparent at all.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore urge the Commission to focus on the way in which the ECB has helped the banks, because it is clear that the banks that went to the ECB to seek help benefited from a kind of aid that those that were better managed did not request. Banks that were properly managed, therefore, have somehow been victims of a market distortion.</p>
<p class="contents">The second sector is that of raw materials, particularly food commodities. We know that large agro-industrial businesses and major retailers have a market position that gives them far too strong an influence over price formation. A market survey on this issue is absolutely vital.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point, and not the least important, is tax competition. You know that most Member States, including my own and many others, practise forms of tax competition that are very harmful to the general European interest. These forms of competition must be stopped. I know that the Commission is beginning to take an interest in this issue once again, but I strongly urge Commissioner Almunia and Commissioner Šemeta to tackle this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to my last point, we were pleased to note that Commissioner Almunia has already imposed fines in various sectors since the beginning of his term of office, particularly in the air freight sector. We also welcome the opening of the investigation into Google, which I think partially answers the point Mrs in ’t Veld made a moment ago.</p>

<p class="contents">What is the issue here? The European Central Bank (ECB) agrees to provide liquidity to banks that request it, in an unlimited way, accepting all kinds of assets as collateral for that liquidity. However, we do not have a very clear idea of the nature of those assets. We also strongly suspect that many of them are, as they say, syphilitic or toxic assets whose real market value is very difficult to determine and some of those assets might even be worthless.</p>
<p class="contents">Under such conditions, this therefore constitutes a direct form of aid. Clearly, if the ECB did not provide this liquidity in exchange for these guarantees, which are actually quite short-lived, then it is possible that some of these financial institutions would go bankrupt.</p>

Fundamentally, competition policy should be at the heart of the European single market and solid principles of competition should be built into all EU legislation. Competition should create a stronger marketplace for EU citizens and allow the EU to be more competitive on a global basis.</p>
<p class="contents">In the latest wave of financial services legislation, there is a danger that this principle is being lost. We must use every opportunity to create more competition in markets dominated by large market participants and create a more vibrant marketplace. In the derivatives legislation currently being negotiated, we can ensure that we do not create or reinforce monopolies by supporting open access to CCPs and the like, and by ensuring the availability of important data streams to all players.</p>
<p class="contents">In the upcoming review of MiFID, we must remember its original purpose of opening up Europe’s equity markets to competition and, after its expansion to include new asset classes, we must ensure that the competitive principles are upheld, since a combination of these has actually significantly driven down trading fees for investors in the equities over the last three years.</p>
<p class="contents">When we consider reforms for auditors, credit rating agencies and other financial services providers, we can consider where the barriers to market entry lie, and work to break them down. I believe that standing up for competition in key industries is the way that we will generate the true growth potential of the EU and reinvigorate our economies in this ever-changing world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we should not forget that unregulated competition can also lead to an increase in unemployment, so that the gap between the rich and poor grows ever wider.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union, free competition continues to take precedence over the social needs of our citizens. A fervent belief in free markets cannot mask the fact that these markets not only fail time and time again, but are also incapable of bringing about lasting social justice. A couple of procedures aimed at combating distortion of competition and price fixing will not be enough to resolve this problem. A fair and social internal market will only work with strong and just regulation. More work is urgently needed on this. For example, it is not acceptable for more and more institutions providing services of general public interest to find themselves exposed to private competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The report sets down pointers for the Commission’s future policy on competition. There is an urgent need for much stronger consumer protection and for services of general public interest to be shielded from the rules of competition and removed from the control of cartels. It is also necessary to introduce a contractual clause that favours secure social progress and that is regarded with the same importance as the rules on competition in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the bank rescue in the UK was less swift than it might have been because of the consequences of EU competition policy. My distinguished colleague, Professor Tim Congdon, has written a pamphlet on this. The fact is that these matters should be handled at the national level and not at the level of the Commission. The Commission simply does not know what it is doing and should stay well clear.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last 15 seconds I have, I must address the singularly depressing speech made by Mr Lamberts when he talked about tax competition. Tax competition is why we have lower taxes. What he was advocating was an EU-wide fiscal policy, which would result in EU-wide higher taxes. That is what it is, and I would ask Mr Lamberts and his colleagues to please call it that next time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a little unfortunate that the Earl of Dartmouth did not understand that you had also allowed him this opportunity to reply. I believe it is a very positive thing when someone like Mr Lamberts comes forward with such concrete proposals and when we have a chance to engage in lively debate, so that people get to respond in a more direct way, which is exactly what we want in this House. Perhaps you will allow him the opportunity for a brief reply later on.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to continue where Mr Lamberts left off. There is no denying that we need transparency in the banking system. The public is still quite unaware that these subsidies as a result of the financial crisis have actually done something quite unimaginable under EU standards. They make it clear that competition per se cannot always manage without subsidies when there are higher objectives at stake. However, what makes this entire business such a bitter pill to swallow is the fact that those banks that have received support are once again profiteering and, in some cases, actually going against common European interests. That is enough about the financial market.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to discuss is one you have all heard from me before – the question of pharmaceuticals. It find it very regrettable that we have still not made the progress that has been possible and necessary for decades. It would indeed be a great step forward for Europe if citizens in my country, Austria, as well as in Germany and in other countries, only had to pay the same amount for pharmaceuticals as their fellow citizens in other EU Member States. This is the work of cartels and big business. I believe that the Commission has the opportunity and the duty finally to take action here.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect of this issue is pharmaceutical authorisation. Unnecessary trials are still taking place, both on animals and on human beings. A lot of work is duplicated unnecessarily. In the context of the European internal market, this is something that should have been resolved last century. I would once again call on you to take intensive action here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are discussing when China will become the biggest economy, but that is based on a false assumption, because we forget that the European Union is the biggest economy, but that China and the US have the bigger markets. This is because of the lack of competition in the European Union across borders and within different areas.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a lack of competition that makes us look upon them, instead of us, as having the self-confidence of being in the lead. That is why it is important, in the future, that the report on competition should also focus on the lack of implementation of the legislation which is already in place, and also on the lack of competition in the European economy. We need to do that in a number of areas. Also, to be the leading economy, we need to ensure that we are the most competitive economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you a secret: we will never be the most competitive if we do not have competition. State subsidies and regulations hindering new entrants are preventing the European economy from being in the lead. That is why we must ensure that state subsidies are always there only in exceptional cases, where nothing else can be done, or when we can channel them in a way that supports the common good without distorting competition.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to ensure is that we can allow for new entrants in as many areas of the European economy as possible. Competition is not about out-competing others. It is about allowing big companies to merge and grow bigger and bigger on the global scene, and about allowing new companies to open up to new innovations. We do have a lack here and it is the responsibility of the Commission to demonstrate that, and to take action so we can proceed together so that in the future, we will be looked upon as the leading economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to mention once again a new phenomenon: it is not market players but rather governments which seem, from time to time, to be playing by giving special advantages, in terms of competition policy, to some of their favourite companies. This is a very bad phenomenon and it goes back to party treasuries.</p>

It is rather like flogging a dead horse. Without doubt, I would join Mrs in ’t Veld and Mr Lamberts in saying that we need to have proper monitoring of competition, and to think about what is happening in the agricultural sector, which has very few buyers and a huge number of producers – something that has never worried the Commission before, whereas if this had been the industrial sector, it would have immediately thrown itself into the buyers’ cartel. We also need new rules for the Internet sector.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our relationship with the Commission is tremendously boring. It sends us a report which sweeps three-quarters of the subjects under the carpet.

<p class="contents">I just wanted to say this today, and to repeat what Mr Hökmark said: the world is changing. It is very nice of us to say that State aid is not good, but the fact remains that China, Korea, the United States and others give State aid. I am not in favour of it.

I believe that this is a very sensible proposal and wish to make it more specific. Last year, Parliament decided during the relevant debate that we wanted to focus on fair and non-discriminatory competition for small and medium-sized enterprises. The Commission has done nothing in the interim. This recommendation is once again to be found in Mr Eppink’s motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to hear from the Commission whether it now intends to implement this reiterated recommendation or I would ask them, at the very least, to tell us what it is that is preventing them from taking on board the particular concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the commodities sector. I am very pleased to find that this report deals with the lack of transparency in the commodities sector. I also welcome the fact that it deals with the question of speculation in commodities. However, I regret that it has not taken up the recommendation of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy as a whole, which suggests that we should not follow the proposal made by the French Presidency, namely, that the issue of speculation should be confined to agricultural commodities, but recommends that speculation in metals should also be included. In my opinion, this is just as important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As other Members have pointed out, energy supply and pricing can vary greatly between different Member States. In the region I represent, nearly a quarter of households have no access to mainstream gas, and the vast majority of those are reliant on domestic heating oil. In the one month between November and December, pricing in that market rose by over 50%. Consumers are concerned (and very cold) – they are concerned about cartel pricing, and there are allegations of this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right that this should be looked at by the domestic regulators first, but I am hearing similar concerns from other EU Member States. So I would like to ask the Commissioner: when you are looking at the energy markets this year, please do not forget those who live in very rurally isolated areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since an EU competition policy based on equal competitive conditions applied in all sectors is the prerequisite of the aforesaid priorities, I am very pleased by the creation of this report. However, ladies and gentlemen, this is now in the distant past. Times have since changed. Nevertheless, I believe it is important to draw the conclusions of this report, and I also find the fact that the European Parliament – that is, we, the Members – will be able to play a more active part in the shaping of competition policy in the future to be important. In this, however, I request the Commission’s cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I request what I believe to be a necessity, that Parliament should be informed regularly about all initiatives launched in this field. Secondly, I ask the Commission, as the only competition authority with EU-wide competence, to report to Parliament annually about the application of the recommendations made by it, and about any deviations from them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is important to realise – and in this I agree with my fellow Members – that competition policy cannot be managed vertically. Coordination is also required in all functional and regulatory areas. This, however, is the responsibility of the Commission. For this reason, it is essential to harmonise EU policies and the priorities defined in the EU 2020 strategy, which is aimed at supporting growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I too would like to mention small and medium-sized enterprises, whose involvement is indispensable and unavoidable for the growth of the entire European economy, including, of course, employment. However, the conditions of competition must be equal. This must be guaranteed by competition policy. I ask the Commission to pay special attention to SMEs and to provide equitable and non-discriminatory competitive conditions for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hopefully, he will continue to play a progressive role in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this report on the state of play of competition policy for 2009. However, there are still elements of competition in the EU that need to be strengthened and clarified. I would encourage more cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament in this field. That is the only way we will be able to maintain public confidence in the decisions that have been taken. Furthermore, it is imperative that the European Parliament be kept up to date on the action that is taken by the Commission, with a particular focus on SME policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to the reports and the investigations that have been highlighted in this report – at the last count, 11 reports, six investigations into different fields and the re-establishment of DG Competition’s fiscal State aid unit. In particular, I strongly welcome the reiterated request for the incorporation of the basis for calculating fines, which we have already discussed. I think this is absolutely vital.</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, it was very interesting to hear earlier from the Earl of Dartmouth, speaking as he was as an aristocrat, about competition policy. As everybody knows, aristocrats in the United Kingdom have a huge focus on land concentration. Perhaps we ought to ask the competition authorities to look into that and see just how the aristocrats have been looking after their land across the European Union for all this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Mr Eppink for his report. Knowing his approach, I look at the report with admiration and am pleased that it was he who drafted it. It is also a pleasure to listen to the speeches of fellow Members, but there is something which I feel I must say. We are concentrating, here, on the work of the European Commission. We are accusing it of not having a strong position or a policy and of not fighting protectionism, but quite honestly, our opponent or our greatest problem – Mr Hökmark spoke about the fact that the European economy is not competitive – is the Member States. Meanwhile, the European Commission very often has no option but – acting under pressure from Member States – to try to protect free competition as much as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Chamber several weeks ago, we talked among other things about special legislation for the coal market. On that occasion, however, we did not hear Members talking about free competition, but could only hear the voices of people demanding protectionist principles and the possibility of subsidising, for example, closed mines – that is what it was called – while in fact, the real issue was assistance for mines which are not going to be closed at all. We must, therefore, be consistent in our work, and that consistency is often lacking in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been talking about assistance for the banking sector. I fear that the European Commission, acting under that pressure from Member States, has only sanctioned that assistance, and today, when we talk about the report, which is, in fact, for 2009 – I agree, here, with the criticism – it seems to me that the report lacks an evaluation of the effects which that assistance has achieved and if, in reality, it has restructured the banking industry in a stable way. I expect, Commissioner, that this aspect – the evaluation of an important policy – should be present in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also talks about the fact that the Commission is fighting protectionism, among others when we talk about the automotive sector, but there are examples – I come from Poland – where the best factory in the Fiat group was closed – perhaps not closed, but production was reduced – and production was transferred to Italy. This is obvious protectionism, and the European Commission should be fighting this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I can give another example. In 2009, two Polish shipyards were closed. I come from a shipbuilding city in Poland, but the problem is bigger than two Polish shipyards. The problem is to do with the fact that, at world level, European competition policy forces the shipbuilding industry to fight mainly against the heavily subsidised shipyards of the Middle East, and today we have, in fact, closed down the shipbuilding industry in Europe through this competition policy, because we force them to compete against subsidised industries. It should be important to us for the shipbuilding industry in Europe to exist. Thank you, and I apologise for exceeding my speaking time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is delicate, because applying it too rigidly could genuinely affect the impact it has, and could have serious consequences for the social sphere and the economic cycle. It is complex, because the parameters adopted may not necessarily apply across the board to all areas of the economy at such a delicate time. Therefore, the Commission should be congratulated for its work on the subject. It has managed to combine a rigorous method with the flexibility necessary in these economic conditions. Indeed, making provision to evaluate the ad hoc tools adopted at national level to end the crisis is evidence of an approach that is not only highly professional, but also sensitive.</p>
<p class="contents">European competition law is both wide-ranging in scope and highly specialised. This once again puts the European Union in the position of being a guiding light for its neighbouring countries, particularly the less developed ones. This helps prevent a separation and divergence between the countries leading the way and those following behind. Therefore, it is doubly important to ensure that this guiding light is not dimmed in any way. In my opinion, special attention should be paid to evaluating the various post-crisis scenarios that should begin to emerge in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very likely that this will mean re-examining the extent of the structural changes that we need to take into account and evaluating the current status of the various industries and sectors. Caution has to be the keyword at a time of such uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Commission to focus both on small and medium-sized enterprises and on youth employment, which is once more making competition a European-wide problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Time and again this Parliament has demanded a rapid SEPA migration, and the reasons are simple. The Commission’s impact assessment quotes a study that SEPA would save EUR 300 billion in the EU economy in six years’ time. These savings are due to increased competition via common standards and processes. This will also save time and stress for all Europeans who need to carry out payments in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I also strongly agree with the report when it states that the public economic support to banks and other companies in the economic crisis has distorted competition. Like many of my colleagues here this morning, I urge the Commission to provide an analysis of these distortions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add one more thought on the need for common standards and processes. A lot of inventions in the future will be based on information and communication technologies. We need more competition in the ICT business, and this could be encouraged by increased use of open-source code in Europe. I expect that Europe will, in this way, become more competitive in this crucial field in relation to the US and other major economic areas, as Mr Hökmark said previously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

National and political interests were repeatedly victorious, not only over the rules of the free market, but also over common sense. The major economic crisis, the effects of which are still being felt to this day in the countries of Europe, was a significant determinant of competition policy in 2009. It was a period which saw the use of mechanisms and instruments whose main objective was to help troubled financial institutions as well as some large enterprises, and not to uphold the rules of a market economy, and the worst effects of this were felt by small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Will what was done be effective in the long term? Only now are we finding out. Therefore, we should call on the Commission to prepare credible analyses which show the effect of this aid on the economy. This will not only allow an evaluation of what was done, but will also enable a rapid and effective reaction to similar threats in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time, during the current crisis, the European Commission has seen the need to approve State aid grants, especially for the banking sector, but also for other sectors which have encountered difficulties. Member States have therefore granted sizeable sums in the form of guarantee schemes, recapitalisation schemes and other forms of financing banking institutions’ liquidity, with the aim of providing them with a source of funding and a guarantee against risks.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the European Commission must keep a close watch on the sector and submit plans for restructuring and regulating financial institutions to guarantee that they will not continue to adopt risky behaviour which jeopardises the European Union’s financial stability.

<p class="contents">A good example of this is agricultural output, where both the EU and the individual states allow various subsidies and supports, thereby greatly distorting the competitive environment. Agricultural enterprises from the new Member States in particular are suffering considerably as a result of the incorrect subsidy policy of the EU.

Notwithstanding, it is a good report, as reflected by Parliament’s resolution. However, there are points where work could be improved in the near future, primarily in the field of prevention and appropriate information. Without cooperation, we will not be able to recover from the crisis, and it is therefore very important for the Commission to assure us that it will continuously provide us with information about results already achieved. Compliance with, and enforcement of, EU competition policy rules is one of the keys to the success of the single market. There are still raw material markets in the field of energy policy, for example, where transparency needs to be increased. Similarly, competition is not fully guaranteed in every segment of the energy sector. This is why it is urgent to implement the second internal market package and the third energy package. Requesting a more thorough investigation of competition in another sector, namely agro-industry, is a very timely step. Through a study, we must identify the major suppliers and distributors who are responsible for distorting competition in the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are especially important to the whole European economy, not to mention the huge innovation potential they offer. In this respect, I think that it would be advisable to include a chapter devoted to small enterprises, with an emphasis on fair competition. Competition policy should help promote and enforce open standards and interoperability. This would prevent a technological lock-in being applied by market players.</p>

A bit of it is true, but I am afraid it misses the point completely. We are having a debate among ourselves, and in particular groups in this Parliament, about what is happening to the agricultural markets and why there is not fair transmission of the final price that we, as consumers, pay for food to those who produce the food.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very serious problem at a time when we are reforming agricultural policy, threatening to cut the budget for agriculture and not looking at the imperfections in this marketplace. So the report should say much more about that. The Commission is urged to look at competition in the agro-industrial sector: yes, please, and look at it too in the retail sector but then stop looking and do something about it! We are great at talking in this House, but we are not so good at action.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one other point in relation to competition. I make some complaints to the Commission on behalf of constituents. The small person gets no hearing against the state, and I would like the Commission to take this back: that there are some complaints which I, as a Member, have not ...</p>

Appropriate competition policy is the right tool for achieving this objective. If competition is operating properly in the market for goods and services, we can guarantee better quality, lower prices and greater choice for the consumer. It is good that we make these annual assessments of competition policy. Such an examination, with the benefit of hindsight, is very instructive. Effective use of the instrument of competition policy allowed an improvement in economic stability and moderation of the effects of the economic crisis for businesses and consumers. It is necessary to improve competition in the markets for medicines and energy. Let us remember that a monopoly, whether privately-owned or state-owned, restricts competition. It is worth stressing that changes to the common agricultural policy mean that subsidies and external support do not now restrict competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will continue to inform you about important policy decisions relating to competition and will endeavour to address your requests in our response to your resolution, either in the next Report on Competition Policy or on an ad hoc basis, as requested by Mr Bütikofer and other Members.</p>
<p class="contents">I note your call for sector inquiries in a number of markets. Past experience shows that fair and firm enforcement itself produces positive effects on competition across a sector. Sector inquiries are not always the best way to enforce our rules in a given sector. They are very expensive in terms of resources and should be used only when the Commission’s policy objectives make an inquiry necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I can confirm again that the temporary crisis-related State aid measures are indeed temporary. I would like to pick up on a few of your questions in a really telegraphic way in the limited time available.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on the investment and financial sector, consultation is ongoing on rescue and restructuring guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on transport, the Commission is preparing a White Paper on the future of transport, which is due to be adopted in March 2011. This will outline several proposals for speeding up completion of the internal market for transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on services of general economic interest, the Commission will report on this in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, on the digital agenda, the Commission fully agrees with the importance of promoting a truly integrated digital internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, on SMEs, a level playing field for all companies, big and small, is essential for them to flourish. The Commission’s enforcement of the competition rules is essential to enable this. We also have targeted State aid rules for SMEs, innovation, research and development and green technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Next June, Vice-President Almunia will present to you the Report on Competition Policy 2010. In the meantime, he will keep you informed on the issues you have raised and, in relation to paragraph 4 of Parliament’s report, the services of DG COMP will be instructed to respond to you in more detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the initiative of the Commission with regard to collective redress, which is a long-overdue initiative. It is also mentioned in the report, and I think it is in the interests of the consumers – provided it is well defined and well legislated. I think it is good. We will start with the Green Paper to see what the different opinions are. I welcome this.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />In the banking sector, we have a very strange situation: State aid is on different levels in different countries, in different stages. In some countries, such as Spain, in the banking sector, the regional banks <span class="italic">(cajas)</span> in particular are in difficulty, and here, life-support from the European Central Bank is needed – although the ECB, as Mr Lamberts pointed out in 30 seconds, risks having many bad assets. This turns the ECB into a sort of bad bank – something we should not have.</p>
<p class="contents">In other countries, the states are trying to disengage from the banking sector, and here there is the danger of a dowry. I expect that you cannot reply to this issue of a dowry – it is something for the Commissioner – but it would be very unfair to other banks that did not get State aid if some that have been recovered or needed resuscitation suddenly got one. So here we have to look at the issue of the level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I come to the follow-up, because there were a few remarks by Mrs in ’t Veld, Mrs Gáll and Mr Bütikofer which were spot-on. We had a report last year, we have a report this year and we will probably have a similar report next year. It all stays the same. It looks a bit like a Vatican-based ritual where we have the same things over and over again. I think that we have to look into the follow-up to the questions we have asked, and I propose that the rapporteur and the previous rapporteur get in touch with the Commissioner and with the Director-General of DG COMP to see what happens with the request we made.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to have a report that is properly implemented in terms of information provision. This is why I propose that we have a proper follow-up, in which Mrs in ’t Veld will certainly support me, to see what the Commission is doing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michael Gahler, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of our Arctic neighbours who are following this debate, in my capacity as rapporteur, I am particularly pleased to be able to present to you today the result of over a year’s work, carried out in cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, other colleagues in the EU Arctic Forum, and numerous experts and representatives, some of them from the Artic region itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a broad consensus and believe that we have formulated a sustainable policy on the High North. The report analyses the new significance of the Arctic region and describes how the EU’s policy in relation to our northern neighbours should be organised from the point of view of the European Parliament. My guiding principle here is the offer of cooperation with the states and institutions of our neighbours in the High North.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the bilateral and multilateral cooperation already taking place with the Arctic states. Quite apart from the issues relating to the Arctic, Norway and Iceland are already closely involved in the European Economic Area and in cooperation under Schengen. The EU is already an ad hoc observer in the Arctic Council, but I would like to make it clear that I believe it desirable that the EU should be given permanent observer status. This is particularly the case because almost all policy areas of relevance to the region have been brought within the Community sphere in part at least. This offer of cooperation is formulated in this way because we, the EU, cannot take action or initiate any activity in the Arctic in our own right. We are largely dependent on the willingness of the immediately adjacent territories to cooperate with us.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, I also focused on the human dimension. In pursuing each individual area of common policy, all those involved must never lose sight of the fact that the concerns of those living in the Arctic must be given due consideration. I am referring to the indigenous peoples in the countries, whose way of life and livelihoods follow the principle of sustainability, as well as for the other people living there.</p>
<p class="contents">We accept that these inhabitants of the Arctic region wish to develop their habitat; in other words, they do not want to see a conservation order placed on the area as it currently stands, turning it into something like a national park. That is why we are working with the partners to ensure that intervention in the ecosystem and in natural habitats always follows the highest possible conservationist principles. The EU is an attractive cooperative partner for Arctic states because we have played a pioneering role in the relevant policy areas, such as protection of the environment and the combating of climate change. Thus, the question of whether or not the world’s largest internal market pursues an ambitious environmental policy makes a vital difference for this region.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is also an attractive cooperative partner because we are obvious customers for the commodities provided by the Arctic – not just oil and gas, but also rare ores, for example. We should follow the good examples provided here, for example, in the cooperation between Norway and Russia in the Shtokman Field in the Barents Sea. The highest Norwegian environmental standards are applied here as the partners cooperate in extracting these mineral resources. I hope that the same will apply to the cooperative agreement reached between Russia and BP in recent weeks for exploration in the Arctic Sea. In future, our monitoring satellites will provide valuable support, both in the environmental sector and in the opening up of new shipping routes, such as the Northeast Passage. Cooperation in this area will make it possible to shorten shipping routes to Southeast Asia, for example. For the EU, which accounts for about 40% of the world’s commercial fleet, this is an important factor, particularly from a financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Framework Programme for Research offers valuable support for further scientific cooperation between the various Polar institutes in their research stations in the Arctic. Our neighbours in the High North know the EU to be a competent cooperative partner. However, there is room for improvement when it comes to the formulation, coordination and implementation of our policies. Improvement could be achieved by bringing together the responsible areas within the Commission under the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries and by establishing an appropriate body in the EEAS. In addition, an Arctic information centre to gather and evaluate all the relevant information would also further improve our database. The development of a circumpolar cofinancing and programming mechanism involving all the partners in the High North would also be an important instrument for better, more efficient cooperation in respect of research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that this draft policy document will provide better guidelines for a comprehensive and successful Arctic policy in the EU that will also benefit our northern neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The plenary debate has helped us to receive your views and to illustrate the importance we attach to Arctic cooperation as part of the external relations of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We engage with the Arctic region on many levels. Firstly, both the Union and Member States have active research policies in the region. Secondly, we pursue solid environmental and maritime policies. Thirdly, our diplomacy in the fight against climate change addresses the core origin of Arctic transformations. And fourthly, we continue to take action in favour of indigenous peoples worldwide, including those living in the Arctic.</p>
<p class="contents">While we acknowledge that our dialogue with all circumpolar Arctic indigenous peoples could be improved, 2010 has witnessed the beginning of a fruitful and wider process of interaction, which we will certainly pursue in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">When dealing with access to the Arctic and the exploitation of its resources, we must live up to our reputation as a responsible consumer of raw materials and energy resources, adhering to the highest safety and environmental standards. In parallel, we will firmly seek fair treatment of our interests, including those of our companies.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased to see that these areas are covered by Parliament’s High North report, along with valuable proposals on how to proceed in the future. This report is an important contribution to the gradual building of the European Union’s Arctic policy, and I would like to thank Michael Gahler for taking this initiative forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiative is particularly praiseworthy, as the rapporteur and several other MEPs facilitated an interesting dialogue with Arctic third parties and civil society, in which we participated actively. The various perspectives are present in the final report, demonstrating the European Union’s commitment to listen to, and work with, all Arctic stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now opening a new phase in the development of EU Arctic policy. Parliament’s report will become the third pillar of its basic architecture, following the 2008 Commission communication and the 2009 Council conclusions. These three texts are consistent and offer a responsible and positive message to the Arctic partner countries and the people living across the region. We seek to promote a safer, sustainable Arctic. We respect the international agreements and arrangements, and would like to cooperate in their development and enhancement.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I would like to acknowledge the Norwegian-Russian delimitation agreement on the Barents Sea, which was signed last year, as a reference point for long-term peaceful cooperation in the overall circumpolar Arctic region.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union would like to see a reinforced and efficient Arctic Council, in which key decisions on the future of the region are agreed and implemented. We would like to participate in the Arctic Council as a permanent observer to share our solid experience in international regional cooperation, and we are particularly grateful for Parliament’s endorsement of this endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">The High North report will give the European External Action Service and the Commission a robust stimulus in our external action concerning the Arctic region. I believe that its messages and approach are timely and appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s High North report will also inform our own progress report on EU Arctic policy, which the Council has asked us to deliver later this year. Our reporting will be addressed to both institutions, Council and Parliament, and we hope that it will be to your joint satisfaction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am genuinely pleased that the European Union’s policy towards the High North is one of those areas to which the European Union has turned in relatively good time. Significantly rich resources – around a quarter of the world’s unexplored oil and gas resources, biogenetic and fish resources, minerals – may be found in the Arctic. It also offers new maritime transport opportunities. Melting of the ice cap has resulted in a shipping route to the countries of Asia that is about 40% shorter. The potential of the Arctic is impressive. That is why it must be husbanded responsibly. Both irresponsible exploitation of resources and ill-considered transport flows can have serious ecological consequences. At the same time, it has to be recognised that using the riches of the Arctic can open new possibilities for resolving not only energy problems, but also raw material and food-related problems. There is stiff competition between the world’s great powers over who is to have the lion’s share in managing and exploiting these resources. Although approximately 3.7 million people live in the Arctic, representing several tens of indigenous peoples, it can nevertheless be regarded to a certain extent as belonging to the world in common. For the time being, the United Nations has not confirmed privileges for any nation in the Arctic and, hopefully, will not do so in the future. That is precisely why our policy must be responsible. The European Union must develop a specific, coordinated strategy for all spheres associated with the High North, and agree the funding for that policy and the sources of that funding. Climate change, the welfare and development of the local population, and energy security issues must also be taken into account. In order to implement that policy, permanent observer status on the Arctic Council would be important. Although we have no direct sea frontiers with the Arctic, the European Union can become a leader in exploring the region in respect of both its resources and new shipping routes, and in securing a high standard of environmental safety. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly the best acknowledgement of this came from Commissioner Füle, when he said that this report would become the third pillar of EU Arctic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not any wonder that Arctic policy is becoming central to international policy, since, just as the Member who spoke before me said, the Arctic region has a third of the world’s as yet undiscovered natural resources: minerals, gas and oil. Climate change and competition for these natural resources are issues that are connected, but what is really driving the trend is obviously the global economy. Fortunately, developments in the Arctic region have been steady and based on a willingness to cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future, Arctic policy will be a test of whether together, we can increase stability or, on the other hand, cause new conflicts. It is important that natural resources are exploited responsibly and carefully in order to avoid the ‘gold rush’ phenomenon and catastrophes of the sort that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we have a balanced report and the message that the Arctic Council should be reinforced and that the European Union will be more robustly involved there in its capacity as observer. We should not just barge our way in, however, but exercise diplomacy, negotiate, engage in sound political cooperation and, above all, be at the forefront when it comes to assessing environmental impact. I think that it is excellent that the report mentions the importance of an Arctic Information Centre and also states that the University of Lapland in Rovaniemi, Finland, would be a good place to locate it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We think that we have worked excellently together and it is important that the own­initiative report is adopted and that a proposal is made based on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The report argues strongly in favour of heavy future investment allowing people in the Arctic region to survive there, and investment in conditions of employment, transport and the environment. I also think that the view it takes regarding the need to recognise the position of the indigenous nations, especially the Sami, is of particular importance. The Sami are Europe’s only indigenous people and the EU, that is the Commission, Parliament and the Council, must cooperate equally with them.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also acknowledges the status of the Arctic Council, which Commissioner Füle even said the EU was willing to reinforce. I was, however, really quite disappointed with Commissioner Füle’s appraisal that cooperation in the Arctic region was progressing gradually. Of course, the EU must show drive, and there must be investment and a desire to step up cooperation in the Arctic. That must not be allowed to progress only gradually, almost as if we were only using one hand: it must be one of the priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that I am also pleased that there is to be investment in research into the Arctic region, and that the report mentions the University of Lapland as a possible centre for this. The University of Lapland deserves praise for being the only university, the only agency, that has really worked to ensure that such a centre would be established, and has devoted much time and effort to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank my fellow Green Members for their cooperation and contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">We can finally say that we have come up with a decent document allowing us, the European Union, to proceed in a fairly reasonable manner, taking into account all the interests of all stakeholders. Even though the Greens justifiably think that we should be even more radical, we are still glad that this report takes our worries and concerns into account, such as the proposals we made to the rapporteur concerning the fact that scientific data clearly demonstrates that the Arctic ecosystem is currently going through massive climate-related changes and that this situation requires a precautionary and scientifically robust approach to be taken to any future development in the Arctic.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we called for further scientific studies, within the framework of a multilateral agreement to be completed, to inform international understanding and decision making for the Arctic ecosystem before any further major development goes ahead. We thank the other groups for accepting that. This is an example of how to put things in a congenial form for our wide range of different constituencies. There are some sceptics in this room who have stated that the Arctic region does not deserve our attention, but it does, particularly with Iceland likely to become the 28th member of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Arctic is ‘cool’. This is not because of climate change and the consequent warming up of the normally cold High North. The Arctic is also ‘cool’ because of the lucrative possibilities emerging on the horizon, even though they bring with them very complex and difficult problems. That is why I think politicians who tackle these problems in a responsible and politically subtle manner are ‘cool’ politicians, as are those of us who will vote for Mr Gahler’s report today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most obvious results of these changes are the possibility of establishing new transportation and trade routes, and the possibility, which is already clearly in view, of exploiting natural resources and extracting oil and gas.

On the one hand, we have the very constructive Norwegian-Russian delimitation agreement on the Barents Sea, while on the other, we also have the Russians attempting to pursue a policy of <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span>. I think there is a huge role to be played here by the European Union and the international community. We give encouragement for this in the report, and it has been expressed well there. The second matter to which we have drawn attention is the necessity of achieving a guarantee of equal, non-discriminatory access to transportation routes. Neither regulatory nor financial considerations should be an obstacle in this equal access to routes. This has all been expressed well in the report.

It is clear, also from this report, that there is enormous interest in the natural resources of the Arctic region. As a result of climate change, oil and gas and other resources can be extracted increasingly easily. The issue of making better use of shipping routes has already been discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">The logical consequence of this is that pollution will increase in the region. Industrial development – in particular, through the extraction of oil and gas, the expansion of commercial fishing and increased shipping traffic – will all necessarily lead to the disturbance, or perhaps even destruction, of this highly sensitive ecosystem, with devastating consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this report deals in generalities and does not contain any effective strategies for combating these dangers. A point that is not mentioned is the fact that the EU is not alone in recognising the increased geostrategic significance of the Arctic. The bordering states of Russia and NATO members USA, Canada, Denmark and Norway have already begun militarising the Arctic region and intend to protect their interests there.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change has led to this situation in the Arctic. We need to prevent the catastrophic progress of this change, something that can only be achieved through a rapid changeover to renewable energy sources. However, this strategy takes a diametrically opposite approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, demand that the Arctic should not be allowed to become the next geopolitical hotspot. In common with numerous environmental organisations, we are calling for a moratorium on new oil extraction projects in the Arctic. A treaty needs to be agreed – similar to the Treaty on the Antarctic – that prohibits the extraction of mineral resources in the region. Last but not least, we are calling for the immediate demilitarisation of the region and therefore for the establishment of the Arctic as a demilitarised zone.</p>

<p class="contents">The Arctic is of strategic importance, especially now that the warming of the Arctic region seems to have opened up opportunities for transport and resource extraction there. It is also an area where the environment is very fragile, especially as a result of pollution from Europe, North America, Russia and China. The fact that national claims to the Arctic are not always clear is a complicating factor. Although the EU will not have access to the Arctic coastline before the accession of Iceland, the EU does have Member States in the Arctic region.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support an EU strategy for the Arctic regions which will position the EU squarely alongside the other major powers, in particular Russia, which is clearly bent on exploiting this region economically. If the economic activities intensify over the coming years, then it will be important that we ensure a proper balance between the environment and economics and, in doing so, that we involve the local population. Securing an observer status for the EU in the Arctic Council would be a good step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is estimated that 90 billion barrels of oil alone lie untapped under the ice. Inevitably, there is a certain feeling of unease that British Petroleum of all companies, having caused the oil catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico last year, is now to be allowed to extract resources in this sensitive natural environment, where conditions are far more extreme than in the Gulf.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the fact is that the Arctic region already provides the final resting place for the world’s mercury emissions. Nonetheless, in view of the global demand for energy, it is probably unrealistic to expect a decision to be taken to forego the Arctic’s oil resources. It is to be hoped that the European Union, in its role in the Arctic Council, will ensure that better safety standards are put in place, so that the Arctic’s wildlife does not suffer a similar horrific fate to that in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of the recent oil disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, from the EU’s perspective, the Arctic is also of essential importance for the development of new world trade routes. If it were indeed possible to open up a new shipping route between Europe, Asia and North America, this would immediately circumvent piracy in Somalia, while also saving the EU a lot of money because the Atalanta Mission would no longer be necessary. Of course, this is to assume that the indigenous Inuit populations would not be driven to similarly desperate measures such as piracy as a result of losing their livelihoods. This is something that needs to be kept in mind both when planning shipping routes and when drilling for oil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For me, the most important matter during work on this report was the increased significance given to research into and monitoring of environment change, because the information gained is crucial in making political and economic decisions. It looks as if economic matters like fisheries, transport and natural resources are the main object of the European Union’s interest. This is a pity, because there is no doubt that science allows us to assess what influence economic changes have on the environment in the region. An influence which is significantly greater than in other regions. What exactly is this influence? Only the experts can tell us.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the openness of research in the Arctic is being increasingly restricted by the states which have access to the Arctic Ocean. Even in areas covered by international conventions and treaties, in the last two or three years, there has been a significant reduction in freedom of activity and research, often under the pretence of protecting the environment. Climatic and oceanic processes in the Arctic have a significant effect on climate and environment change, so freedom of research is extremely important for understanding what is going on, not only in the Arctic itself, but more importantly here, where we are. Furthermore, the work which has already been completed on these issues by scientists from countries outside the Arctic and the money which has been spent entitle us to make our voice heard on matters concerning the northern polar region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the challenging nature of the environment in the Arctic, the rising price of oil has stimulated international interest in drilling in that zone. We all know that oil was first produced in 1968 from Prudhoe Bay on the Alaskan North Slope, but many areas of the Arctic have not yet been explored.</p>
<p class="contents">A 2008 US geological survey estimated that areas north of the Arctic Circle have 90 billion barrels of undiscovered oil – technically recoverable oil – and 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids. Now this represents between 13% and 20% of all undiscovered oil in the world. Needless to say, the recovery of so much oil will have a dramatic impact on the Arctic and may cause ecological disasters on a global scale, so I think we have to ask ourselves whether it is wise to embark on such a project at a time of determined efforts to sever our dependency on fossil fuels and to aim ultimately for a CO<span class="sub">2</span>-free society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Global warming and the melting of the ice at the North Pole are certainly opening up new opportunities: natural resources, oil, fish, shipping and so on. We have heard all about this. However, I think it is important for the EU not to get too excited, as it does not have any coastline along the Arctic Ocean. As a Dane, it strikes me as rather pathetic that Denmark is being used as one of the justifications for the EU’s Arctic connections. The fact of the matter is that Denmark’s only connection to the Arctic is via Greenland, which, in a referendum 26 years ago, decided to leave the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, the EU should not expect too much in relation to Iceland, either. The decision on Iceland’s membership must be taken by the Icelandic people alone, without pressure from the EU. There is absolutely nothing to indicate that there is a majority in favour of EU membership there.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, instead of seeing ourselves as a potential Arctic power, the EU should perhaps recognise its geographic location and instead work to attain good neighbourly relations with the countries that are actually situated in the Arctic. This includes our friends in the western Nordic countries, Norway, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. It should be the job of the European Parliament, in particular, to ensure this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will vote in favour of this report, although my biggest criticism is targeted at the climate change claims, according to which we should have an agreement based, as it were, on the views of the EU. Emissions trading in the EU has failed completely. In 2008, it was revealed that there had been abuses, VAT swindles and many other scams to the tune of EUR 5 billion. Furthermore, these have grown steadily in number. Emissions trading simply does not work; it is harmful. To take its place, we need a system of specific emissions, as there is with vehicles, where one can measure who is doing the emitting and what is being emitted, and not engage in an international trade in indulgence where people buy the right to pollute. This is an important matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Arctic issue is also important, though I am not very sure how it will progress when I consider the recent action taken by the EU. The things that the EU touches do not necessarily go ahead. The Danish Member spoke here sensibly about the regions which are there.

The fact as well that both Iceland and the European Union are currently in the process of devising an Arctic strategy may provide an opportunity to coordinate both policies, among other reasons, with regard to the European Union’s application for permanent observer status in the Arctic Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by saying that the European Union can obviously contribute to effective multilateral governance in the High North. I would also like to tell Mr Søndergaard that I listened very closely to what he said about the majority in Iceland. I believe that we are facing a lengthy process which could go through numerous changes. In my view, we are in the position to encourage a responsible pre-accession process and a mainly balanced debate in this country about the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some colleagues have said that countries should deal with problems that arise individually and that there is no need for so much coordination here. I categorically reject this opinion. It is precisely the European Union, which has the greatest experience of how to work together and really go into unchartered territory, which should play a very important role in this region. It is, after all, clear – either confrontation, an uncertain scramble and conflicts, or peaceful cooperation and a region that could be an example to other countries around the world. One other dimension – profit, or economic benefits, or the environment and conservation. I believe that the European Union, which always led the way in the fight against climate change, must continue to place more emphasis on the second dimension when harmonising both approaches. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore very important that the companies that are going to conduct explorations and drillings in that area do not go there with the profit-mongering mindset of the gold diggers of old, but instead with the sense of European responsibility that took shape by the 20th and early 21st century. Let us not forget that work there will have to be performed under extremely harsh weather conditions and through the use of new technologies. It is of the utmost importance that we do not make concessions in this, and that we apply rules, standards and requirements to these companies, which enable the technical management of this issue at the most up-to-date technological standard, while financial funds should be available to prevent any kind of natural disaster, such as the one we have seen in the case of Deep Horizon.

It is quite true to say that Europe needs to adapt continuously to new realities and to deal with changes in the balance of political power. In relation to Arctic policy, this means: we must understand that the Arctic states wish to develop the region themselves, but that they are open to cooperation. They are not interested in new treaties, but want to see existing regulatory treaties being developed further.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change and new shipping routes do not solely entail risks, but can also offer opportunities. In relation to the Arctic, this means the EU has an opportunity for greater cooperation and development.

The first is the issue of energy, and there has been talk here of oil and gas, and in the future, there will be methane as well, since there are about 300 years worth of reserves of usable methane in the permafrost. EU bodies have, in the meantime, not looked into this issue in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is transport. The opening up of the northern route shortens the journey to the Far East. From Hamburg to Seoul will take 21 days. If this possibility is taken into account, it will greatly reduce costs, and contribute to closer contacts between the two regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is the environment, because the exploitation of energy resources and greater transport volumes will bring a series of environmental risks to this region. In my opinion, it would be good to draw up a plan ... </p>

A fifth of the world’s undiscovered resources lie in precisely this region. Reckless competition for access to the Arctic’s natural resources is most undesirable, but real. It is therefore important to broaden the dialogue so that the Arctic region does not become the arena of a competitive struggle among countries and oil companies, the victims of which would, above all, be local inhabitants and the particularly sensitive Arctic ecosystem. The report states that in the Arctic region, where the effects of climate change are especially visible, drilling projects will increase over time.

<p class="contents">But in dealing with the High North, it is important that we are seen to be diplomatic, not didactic; cooperative, not coercive; and explorative, not exploitive. Because of the importance of the indigenous people, they must be given primacy of consideration, and there are companies and countries out there which are casting their greedy eyes on the North now because of its resources in terms of fossil fuels, fish and – probably – maritime transport possibilities. The European Union, because of its treaties and because of its <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>, is not in a position to strike the balance.</p>

However, the ecosystem of the High North is relatively self-sustaining and therefore extremely sensitive. For this reason, it is important to strike a balance between exploitation, on the one hand, and maximum protection for this sensitive system, on the other. However, this cannot be achieved without imposing restrictions on the extraction of commodities and the methods used in this extraction, as well as stricter rules for tourism and commercial shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">News that major mineral oil company BP and the Russian state-run enterprise Rosneft have drawn up joint plans for extracting oil and gas would not seem to point in the direction of the prudent extraction of commodities – quite the opposite in fact!</p>

Let me address five specific issues raised in this morning’s discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Arctic Information Centre. Both the Commission communication of 2008 and the Council conclusions of 2009 ask the Commission to explore the possibility of establishing a new Arctic Information Centre. We are thoroughly examining the various possibilities in the European Union, including the centre in Rovaniemi, Finland (Lapland) and, above all, the role of this possible centre.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union is the only Arctic stakeholder to have recognised upfront that, as an industrialised entity, it is responsible, along with other industrialised areas, for the changes happening in the Arctic. The Commission communication gives priority to environmental protection, and the prominence of this point was maintained in the Council conclusions of 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are proud of our Sami EU citizens, and we are proud of the different provisions in the EU treaties and in the EU regional policy addressing the Sami people. Our cross-border cooperation and European instrument for democracy and human rights programmes are supporting the Sami people of north-west Russia and other indigenous peoples of the Barents region.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the European Union and Member States are a leading force for Arctic research in the world, and we are proud of it. This area has been mentioned in the framework programme. Altogether, through the fifth, sixth and seventh framework programmes, the European Union is investing EUR 200 million in this field. However, trying to be the prominent and unilateral leader in overall Arctic politics and policies, while not being an Arctic coastal entity, will not be a wise policy to pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the Commission adopted in 2010 a communication on offshore drilling, which should guide our actions across the world, including the Arctic region. It promotes a cautious approach that we will also apply in the Arctic. This is totally in line with the EU principles of protecting the Arctic and firmly asking for the highest environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, the Parliament’s High North report gives a comprehensive overview of the European Union’s activities, responsibilities and interests in the Arctic region. It also consolidates the EU’s balanced approach to the Arctic, combining its protection and its sustainable development. We are convinced that this is within our reach and that the European Union will become an unavoidable and positive reference for Arctic circumpolar cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, when I referred to a policy in relation to our neighbours in the High North, I did not wish to imply that you were engaging in a dispute over authority with Baroness Ashton. I just wanted to clarify that.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost all the speeches we have heard have made one thing clear: the challenge confronting us is to demonstrate through our policy that different interests and activities are reconcilable or must be made reconcilable.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this can be seen in microcosm in Norway, for example: they catch fish, they drill for oil and gas, they practise the highest environmental standards on land and sea and they develop their northernmost regions for the people who live there. If we can apply this principle to the region as a whole through cooperation with local communities, then we will become a role model for other sensitive regions. What has changed in the political reality is the fact that we do not believe that we can compel people to comply with our wishes, but that we must accept the challenge of achieving all our goals at the same time: we need a high standard in environmental protection, a clamp-down on climate change, a sustainable fisheries policy, secure shipping route development and acceptable development for local communities. If we try to work together to set these targets and then to achieve them, then we really will achieve something important in cooperation with our partners for the benefit of the region and ourselves.</p>

This was the first step towards a coherent policy in one of the most sensitive areas in Europe, and it was a step in the right direction because the Black Sea is now widely analysed – and feared – as a converging space of political, strategic and security hopes, strengths and ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, our policy in the area can be further developed. This House can play a crucial role in upgrading EU policies to a fully-fledged EU strategy. This is actually the main idea in the report I initiated with the support of my colleagues from the Foreign Affairs Committee and Parliament as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">But why a new report on the Black Sea and why an EU strategy for the Black Sea? Some people would say that the Black Sea is a small sea. Indeed it is, but if we exchange this map for a strategy map, the Black Sea becomes huge. There is also another factor: the Black Sea is getting blacker and blacker.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the Black Sea is now partially an internal EU sea. However, developments in the region are often unpredictable: tensions accumulate and misunderstandings abound. A summary analysis of the Black Sea region leads to the conclusion that the negative challenges in this area persist or are, indeed, gaining in intensity. The Georgia-Russia war of 2008, the unsolved and so-called ‘frozen’ conflicts, and the worrying deterioration of democratic rule in Ukraine and Russia are all very serious developments and vivid examples of the security risks in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">If we examine the current results of EU involvement in the region, they seem at least mixed. The EU policy approach towards the Black Sea lacks mechanisms for monitoring, evaluation and follow-up. The Black Sea region is not visible enough in debates in Brussels, and EU funding for the region is fragmented and complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">While building upon the merits of the Black Sea Synergy which we adopted three years ago, a new EU strategy for the Black Sea should put in place a stronger policy and concrete tools. Let me mention just two of the recommendations in the report. The first concerns adequate resources: if the EU wants to play a key role in the Black Sea region, it needs to devote adequate resources, both financial and human. The creation of a separate budget line in the EU budget is vital. The second recommendation is for the elaboration of an EU action plan with clear objectives and tasks, including regular ministerial-level meetings of the relevant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU strategy for the Black Sea should not underestimate, or overestimate, any state in the area. The principles of inclusiveness and regional ownership should be reflected in an important role for Turkey and Russia, but also for all the regional partners, in the success of regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to thank all my colleagues for their very positive contributions to the final version of this report. I think we all agree that this House expects the Commission and the Council to turn this report into reality. The strategic and beneficial involvement of the EU in the Black Sea region should become a fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This region is important for the European Union and we need to focus on it to reflect its extreme sensitivity for us.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank and congratulate the rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Traian Ungureanu, on an excellent and very substantive report. The report and its recommendations are interesting and innovative on the many issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the latest enlargement, the Black Sea is also an EU sea. We have responsibilities towards it, just as we do to all other basin regions that border us. We have to tackle this new responsibility resolutely.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, we already have an initiative targeting this region: the Black Sea Synergy. However, we must admit that its implementation has proved much more difficult than we had thought. Not everything we want to do is being welcomed with enthusiasm by everybody in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely for these reasons, Parliament has chosen an approach based on regional ownership and fostering dialogue. I believe that this is now the right approach for us to pursue, but these commitments can only be credible if and when they bring concrete improvements to the peoples in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the report on developing a new European Union strategy for the Black Sea represents our commitment to the region and to our Member States who belong to this area by giving them our full support in facing the challenges linked to their specific geographic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand that a strategy for the Black Sea region should not be interpreted as a replacement for existing efforts, particularly the Black Sea Synergy. It should rather be a comprehensive framework where guidance can be found for all European Union activities in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Black Sea strategy can provide an ideal occasion to review our interests in the region, including strategic, political and economic interests, and to discuss how best they can be achieved. Parliament has identified the appropriate fields in which the strategy should be developed, like governance, security and energy, transport, environment, trade, local economic development and social and human development.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing this strategy can also provide the opportunity to add a maritime dimension to ongoing activities in the region. The Commission is currently developing a comprehensive package that will address maritime policy initiatives, management of natural resources and the fight against illegal fishing activities.</p>
<p class="contents">We can draw on our know-how from other strategies, such as the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region and the EU Danube strategy. Indeed, the Danube strategy will require obvious interactions with the Black Sea. However, we are aware that each European basin region is different. Accordingly, we need to ensure that all future EU strategies should be adapted to their own sectoral characteristics, economic and social development, environment and energy, infrastructure and natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The report on developing an EU strategy for the Black Sea region offers an overview of the future challenges for the region, but it will also be relevant for establishing solid channels with the state partners in the region to ensure its smooth and effective implementation. We need to use this opportunity to consult extensively with all stakeholders, starting with our partners in the regions and with the involvement of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, this report is welcome and we are keen to draw on its recommendations. The External Action Service and the relevant Commission services will be committing their efforts to prepare a Black Sea strategy for which we will seek your and the Council’s support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am pleased that, as has already been mentioned, after the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, the Black Sea, to put it figuratively, became a ‘European’ sea and requires an overall European strategy involving quite a lot of administrative and financial resources, as well as good coordination and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">A key task is to incorporate a project approach into the new strategy. Special attention has to be paid to areas of common interest, such as the environment, energy, transport and infrastructure, which are of decisive importance to the region’s sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Intensive cooperation at parliamentary level is also necessary, for example, with organisations such as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the WTO, and with the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank. Finally, I also believe that we should consider other regional initiatives, but not allow the strategy to drown in them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coordination is certainly needed with the Danube strategy, which is soon supposed to become a major priority of the Hungarian Presidency.</p>

<p class="contents">We must understand that this cooperation in the Black Sea region should not be confused with the Eastern Partnership or with our strategic relations with Turkey and Russia. These are different matters and this cooperation does not replace them. On the other hand, I find hugely exciting that it is possible to bring these divergent groups together on certain issues in order to produce a coherent policy that is in our own interests, as well as helping the relevant countries too. Such cooperation may possibly help to bring together conflicting political and economic interests, so that future disputes will be less dramatic and dangerous and so that, for example, our work in the Eastern Partnership is not construed as being directed against any particular individual, but rather that everything is understood to be complementary. However, when it comes to a European perspective, this cooperative stance should not preclude us from expecting that the Eastern Partnership with these countries will produce different results from development strategies with Russia, for example. We must be permitted to make such distinctions and the Commissioner is no doubt well aware that this should be the case. However, for this reason, Black Sea cooperation is in the interest of the European Union, in the interest of Russia, in the interest of Turkey and in the interest of the remaining countries in this region – most of whom are members of the Eastern Partnership. I could imagine that this will contribute significantly to the economic and political stability of Europe and hope that we can work closely with the Commissioner in order to drive this forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not a far distant place of little relevance which occasionally comes to our attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the area has already put – and will continue to put – items on our agenda, be it through the interruption of gas transit as in 2006 and 2008, or the Georgian war in 2008. However, in spite of the evidence and its recognised importance, the Black Sea area still does not enjoy the attention it deserves from the EU – an EU which was, in a way, compelled to address these problems once Bulgaria and Romania had become members in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The Black Sea Synergy, elaborated not long after the admission of those two countries, appears to have been, in retrospect, a hastily put together document designed to cover a ‘blank spot’ or ‘black hole’ – depending on your preference – which the EU had to deal with almost overnight. The fact that nothing of importance has happened since the first review of the initiative in 2008 – and we are not very far advanced in its implementation as mentioned in the report – is indicative of that.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, there are two main reasons for this. First, there is an apparent disinterest and unwillingness on the part of EU Members to address the area decisively. Moreover, now that money is short, there is even less willingness to do so than before.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the initial assumption on which the synergy was based, namely, that the area should become a coherent and cooperative region in order to qualify for EU attention and material support, has ignored the simple truth that just 20 years ago, the area looked completely different. To expect an area so complex and different to become coherent and get an individual identity in such a short time is either unrealistic or – I hate to say – ill-intended. Perhaps, in the context of a revisiting of the Eastern Partnership, things would improve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The diversity of political systems, cultural traditions, religions, statuses and ambitions in terms of moving closer to the European Union, the level of economic development, the availability of natural resources and, of course, the new situation which has arisen because, today, three Member States of the European Union form part of the region that we are discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, the Black Sea region is particularly interesting because of its geostrategic position, which brings with it either added value or serious risks to our security interests.

All of this can be achieved with a deeper engagement of the countries in the region and with the participation of all Member States of the European Union and other organisations and networks present in the region, including networks of civil society organisations; it is precisely they that require our special attention and recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need new institutions for any of this; what we need to do is ensure regular funding and greater political engagement. Commissioner, I believe that you will be able to put this report to good use and I look forward to working with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This resolution pursues that objective and is therefore supported by my group. This is also because a number of our proposals have been included, for example, dealing with the unresolved conflicts in the region, improving cooperation in civil society, support for people-to-people projects and the promotion of small projects in the context of cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to see a sustainable energy policy, greater energy efficiency and the establishment of academic and student networks. However, what I would criticise is the lack of a coherent position in relation to the question of the energy infrastructure in the region – I would mention Nabucco and South Stream in this context. I fail to understand why our call for stricter monitoring of oil rigs in the Black Sea has been rejected. This is absolutely essential following the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. It is for this reason that we are presenting this amendment once again today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to emphasise that the Black Sea Synergy needs rethinking, today. Noble intentions have not always translated into effective use of the Synergy, and it is very good that the rapporteur stresses this. Therefore, I think the most important task today for Mr Füle is to try to sort out our initiatives in this part of Europe and show that our priority is Neighbourhood Policy, and that other issues should be given second place in this context. I think this way of thinking guarantees that the Black Sea Synergy will be effective in the future, especially in the field of energy. The Synergy could also be a good instrument, for example, if we are talking about supporting Georgia in the democratic and economic transformations it has been going through in recent years. However, the first and essential step, today, is to organise initiatives in this part of Europe, so that we can not only be proud of them, but that they will really be effective in achieving some specific objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All must tread carefully here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Black Sea area is Russia’s backyard. It has its fleet anchored in the Crimea at Sebastopol, close to the bloody battlefields of the Crimean War. We have seen the unfortunate conflict in Georgia, where there was fault on both sides. Had Georgia been in NATO, the consequences could have been disastrous. Whilst I support Georgian independence, it is unwise to goad the Russian bear in its own lair.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is Turkey which the EU is playing with by offering membership despite the reality that members such as France will veto an application. Turkey has just 4% of its landmass within Europe. It should not be in the EU. There are real dangers in leading Turkey on. Disappointment could drive Turkey into the hands of Islamic extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, underlying all of this is the fact that the Black Sea is the hub for vital Caspian oil and gas. Tread carefully indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also welcome the endorsement of several of the previous speakers, my distinguished colleagues, who have committed themselves to promoting a new European vision for the Black Sea region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Black Sea has indeed become a partially internal sea of the European Union. Its geostrategic importance can hardly be overstated, considering the regional stability, the democratisation processes, and the related energy security, economic and commercial issues. I strongly believe that we, the EU, should benefit from the potential of the Black Sea region and not others.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this goal, the European Union has to rely more on its Member States belonging to the region, has to give up any anchorage in the past and has to show more dynamism, leadership and vision. Without touching on the issues related to the enlargement process, I would like to address a message to all the Black Sea sceptics. Any slowdown in the EU integration process of the region will have a throwback effect on the democratic evolution of the area. The risk is medium and long-term instability, whose implications would be hard to evaluate, and even harder to manage, for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the EU needs its internal Black Sea and we need an integrated strategy for this region. The Black Sea strategy should be drafted by the Commission, relying on the recommendations reached by our rapporteur. Today, this House should offer its wholehearted support for the strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The area combines EU Member States and countries which are important to regional cooperation. We therefore have a common need to safeguard the existence of an area of peace, democracy, security and stability around the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a stable framework for cooperation through the Black Sea Synergy, which was put in motion some time ago, although not with tangible results. Its successful implementation through action by all participating countries will further strengthen our relations on the basis of common values. It needs to complement the established European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Stability and security around the Black Sea have a direct impact on Europe. Consequently, the European Union shares responsibility for supporting the peaceful resolution of conflict and building confidence. This area is important to the Union, especially by reason of its energy and transport links. Strengthening democracy and a strong rule of law system will facilitate trade, investments and the free movement of people.</p>
<p class="contents">I absolutely endorse the view that a special line should be set up in the budget for the Black Sea Synergy. This will provide effective help in modernising the area.

<p class="contents">We need to launch the energy and transport partnership alongside the environment partnership.

We need to get past our fragmented approach in terms of finance as well. So far, we have had various financial instruments and little visibility.

How could it be otherwise, now that, following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, it is practically an internal sea within the European Union? Energy, security, stability and, of course, democracy are sectors of prime importance to us in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2007, when we started our policy in this area, which is crucial on several counts, we have made some progress and achieved some successes. However, unfortunately, we have also seen delays and fragmented approaches and periods of inertia. It is unfortunate that no ministerial meeting on this policy has been organised since 2008. This situation falls well below our initial ambitions and, given the geostrategic, geopolitical and economic importance of the area, we only have one choice: to strengthen our policy and action on the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore unreservedly support the proposal by the rapporteur, Mr Ungureanu, to upgrade European policy on the Black Sea to an integrated strategy supported by a separate budget line. Within this framework, I wish, as a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, to highlight the importance of these two sectors, which must be constituent components of a European strategy for the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is no need to emphasise that the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy could also make an essential contribution to uniform, viable development of the Black Sea area. This needs to be done now. However, enlargement is another matter and requires a great deal of careful study. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a strategic bridge connecting Europe with the Caspian Sea and Central Asia. Its geopolitical and economic importance for the EU is constantly increasing in terms of security, stability and energy. The Union should therefore step up its presence, develop active policies and find lasting solutions to the existing problems in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only the littoral countries that show a big interest in multilateral regional cooperation – which is crucial for solving urgent issues of regional and European importance such as ‘frozen’ conflicts, trafficking and other security-related issues.</p>
<p class="contents">What is currently needed is a focus on several issues of concern that are of pragmatic interest to all the littoral states. One such issue is maritime security. In recent years, there has been an increase in accidents involving loss of human life and environmental damage in the Black Sea. The EU should reduce the risk of civil accidents by providing assistance to search-and-rescue operations within the framework of the European integrated maritime policy. We expect to vote soon on the report by our colleague, Iliana Malinova Iotova, which deals for the first time with EU fisheries policy in the Black Sea. This could also offer a good basis for multilateral cooperation in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">EU support is also desirable for ongoing projects like the Black Sea Ring Highway, Pan-European Transport Corridors 8 and 9, and the transport connections between the Black Sea ports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur for supporting my amendments and for his excellent oral contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So we should not delude ourselves that by formulating any kind of policy, we will be able to resolve matters which other policies cannot resolve. This is not a radio request show, and we cannot solve energy problems when Russia does not want the pipeline but we do want it. We cannot resolve regional conflicts, either. In fact, it is a very limited policy, but for all that, it is worth applying it.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we are talking about synergy in relation to Black Sea policy, we should bear in mind that synergy means a certain added value. I would like to ask, for example, why the European Parliament is not working with organisations which exist in the region, such as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (PABSEC). They want to work with us. The European Parliament thinks it is too big and too important, and is not seeking this cooperation. I propose we begin this cooperation and act together with others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For us Hungarian Members, this is particularly important with a view to support for the Danube strategy, as any request for support for the Danube strategy can only be credible if we remain open to supporting other strategies as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The second one is energy security itself. Other than its intention to ensure peace and stability in the region, perhaps the most important objective of the strategy for the Black Sea in the field of energy security is to ensure energy security itself, and as was said yesterday, energy security is the other main priority of the Hungarian Presidency, and is thus in all our interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation is unlikely to improve due to the differences in status of the countries involved in relation to the European Union, to the frequently differing interests of the actors involved in this cooperation and due to a lack of vision, which is also evident in the Ungureanu report. If we want to speed up the process of settling the unresolved conflicts in the region, we need to start from the observation that this action has been greatly delayed by sponsors of the various plans vying with each other, thereby holding the process up for more than 15 years. Indeed, this competition betrays their varying interests, most often linked, whether explicitly or implicitly, to control over the transport routes in the region. I believe that a clearer picture will emerge only when it is patently obvious what is going to happen with Turkey’s accession to the EU and what status Russia will have in relation to the Union. It is only when these matters have been clarified that the unresolved conflicts will be settled and long-term stability established in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is illustrated quite well by the joint declaration signed by the European Commission and Azerbaijan last week, in which Azerbaijan made a written commitment to making a large quantity of gas sources available to Europe. I am pleased to note that the European Commission is finally taking concrete steps to promote the Nabucco project, because ensuring access to the sources of gas located in the Caspian region should be considered a special priority. Meanwhile, however, we must not forget about the transportation of gas to Europe, which can only be realised through the countries of the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The intensification of dialogue between the EU and the countries of the Black Sea could represent a major advancement in guaranteeing the security of European energy supply as the construction of the Nabucco pipeline will also provide Member States currently characterised by a very poor diversity of resources with access to new sources of gas. However, the establishment of the pipelines will also require active contribution on the part of the countries involved. A transparent, non-discriminatory transport framework and a business environment that supports investments are not only important for the supply security of EU Member States, but are also crucial for the stability and prosperity of the region. In my opinion, the Black Sea region can only benefit from the construction of Nabucco: the pipeline will provide a predictable source of income for countries in the region, and will, at the same time, provide them with direct access to the world’s largest gas market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The enlargement of the Union with Bulgaria and Romania meant that this region found itself at the centre of our attention. After the situation in Central and Eastern Europe had stabilised, it seemed the time had come for the Union to concentrate on the Black Sea region. However, the global economic crisis made this subject literally disappear from the European agenda. We must not forget that the Union is not only the Baltic or the Mediterranean basin. Of course, current events in Tunisia show that these regions, too, require our attention. However, we must start to realise that the Black Sea region is slowly becoming pivotal from the European point of view. It is there that the solution to our energy problems is to be found. It is there that communication routes are located which are important to our economy. It is there that sources of instability, too, are to be found, which may, for us, represent a significant danger. For all these reasons, it is necessary to agree with the rapporteur that the time has come to develop a comprehensive EU policy for the Black Sea region. What is more, it seems that changes brought in by the Treaty of Lisbon may contribute to the effective introduction of such a plan. Furthermore, the establishment of a suitable unit in the European External Action Service could solve most of the imperfections of the current Black Sea Synergy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone talks about it, but no one has seen it. This belief of mine is strengthened by some of the contradictions I can see right at the beginning of the resolution. First, there is the definition of the Black Sea region. It is rather curious that Azerbaijan, a country on the Caspian Sea, is included, while Macedonia is not, although its two closest neighbours, Bulgaria and Greece, are included in the Black Sea region, ‘in accordance with the European Commission definition’. I had no idea that Greece stretches all the way to the shores of the Black Sea. The 13 areas of cooperation where greater EU involvement is anticipated in the region comprise a very extensive list. It seems that the Commission did not previously appreciate the importance of this region. Ultimately, given that EUR 1.5 million was taken from a pilot project on the environment and the development of the region in the spring of this year and redirected to a project on bananas in the ACP countries, I would have to query the information on which the Commission based such a decision. It is curious that the author ‘failed to notice’ the South Stream gas pipeline, yet mentions the controversial and not fully funded Nabucco project. I would like to emphasise that the opportunity to enter into partnership relationships with various EU regions will be very important for the further development of the region, excluding the area mentioned before. The conclusions from the last debate on suspending visas with Ukraine are missing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the EU has brought added value with the provision of access to the Black Sea, a region which also brings together countries neighbouring the Union, including strategic partners. Drawing up a common Black Sea strategy will enable us to make significant progress towards creating an area of stability, security, democracy and prosperity. In this context, we can regard the common, integrated initiatives adopted by the countries in the region as a preliminary step towards the reunification of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">As both a Romanian and a member of the Committee on Regional Development, I support the link being made between the future Black Sea strategy and the Danube strategy, recently launched by the European Commission. I think that the EU needs to be involved more in the Black Sea region and to cooperate with third countries, as our regions are interlinked territorially and economically. This will enable us to ensure greater energy security for the future, by implementing infrastructure projects such as the Southern Corridor or liquefied gas terminals and diversifying supply routes and sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must give due importance to coordinating the financial instruments available for the Black Sea region, develop and modernise its ports, and reduce pollution in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the strategy was adopted, construction of energy interconnections between the Black Sea countries and the European Union was set as a priority. The main investment which will enable achievement of this objective is the Nabucco gas pipeline. Unfortunately, we have, for a long time, been seeing a lack of determination from Brussels on this. Neighbouring countries which are interested in the construction of the pipeline are also saying so. For a year now, Azerbaijan has been signalling the need for action from the Union in order to contract gas from Kazakhstan and Tajikistan, because without their involvement, construction of the pipeline will not be financially worthwhile. Meanwhile, a competing project which by-passes the Caucasus countries – the Russian South Stream pipeline – is being given tacit consent for its construction. We must not work like this. The provisions of the energy report are insufficient. They should be made more specific by the addition of information about the means earmarked for investments of strategic significance for the future of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is strange to see that what is probably the most important element as far as Europeans are concerned is completely absent from this report, namely, the fact that illegal immigrants make enormous use of Libya as a transit country for entering Europe from all over Africa and from Asia, in other words, from large parts of the world. It is well-known that the EU is a magical land where the streets are flowing with riches and honey. It is therefore a huge magnet for an incredible number of people wanting to escape from the prison, poverty and misery that their own countries represent. It is also clear that the very fact that Libya, along with other North African countries, is patently used as a transit country is an enormous challenge for us in the EU. This ought to have played a much greater role in the discussions we had with the Libyan authorities – a much greater role with regard to the requirements we are imposing to prevent this pressure on Europe’s borders. It is good that we have initiated talks, but it is frustrating that the talks are not permitted to deal with what is important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is one particular aspect that has, in fact, been given far too little attention in this report. This is paragraph 7, which concerns the condemnation of the way in which the Turkish authorities are behaving in Northern Cyprus, which, according to all international rules, is unlawfully occupied by Turkey – by Turkish troops – and therefore by a country that is both formally and, in reality, negotiating its accession to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We are seeing how the Greek-Cypriot inhabitants who want to return to their churches, monasteries and sacred buildings in Northern Cyprus are being hampered when they want to come back, how they are being prevented from entering and simply restoring their churches and how they are being prevented from coming back and reclaiming the property that is rightfully theirs.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are actually witnessing in Northern Cyprus is the violent discrimination against, and suppression of, Christians, with the direct support of an EU candidate country, namely Turkey. That is unacceptable, and the European Parliament should therefore act in a way that is consistent with paragraph 7 and recommend that the negotiations with Turkey be stopped, at least until there is order in Northern Cyprus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot stand idly by in the face of such events. The issue of religious freedom, as well as other civil liberties, continues to be a priority of the European Parliament’s work. This is why I fully endorse the statement made by the President of the European Parliament, Mr Buzek, in which he condemns these crimes. I appeal, too, to the European Union to take all available diplomatic steps in order to secure religious liberties for minorities, particularly in countries whose citizens violate these rights. In the report on human rights in 2009 which was adopted recently, we emphasised the need for the Union to play an active role in efforts to improve human rights and democracy around the world. We called for the appointment of a special EU representative on human rights.

Extremist and fundamentalist beliefs are triggering deadly acts of violence against Christians, who are becoming true modern martyrs. The intolerance that is giving rise to this violence is generated by a fundamentalist culture. This is why any manifestation that denies other people’s religious or cultural identity must be immediately and unfailingly condemned. The international community and its institutions have a duty to safeguard respect for religious faith. They have not always taken swift action when Christians have been the victims of massacres.</p>

Once again, I would like to thank President Buzek for enthusiastically embracing the idea of a torchlight procession, a light for Christians in memory of all the victims of fundamentalism.</p>

For example, it has not been unequivocally stated anywhere that the greatest problems Christians face are occurring in Islamic countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There again, in recital N, it is stated that Europe is not completely innocent when it comes to violation of freedom of religion. That may well be the case but, by saying that, we are putting occasional and isolated problems in Europe in the same category as structural discrimination of, and attacks against, Christians in Muslim countries. Besides, this is not just about bomb attacks and other forms of physical violence committed by Muslim extremists; in many Muslim countries, there is also an official policy that is directed against Christians. Just take the supposed unavailability of resources for renovating Christian churches in Turkey, or the difficulties surrounding the succession of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. The behaviour of the Turkish occupation forces in Cyprus is also a real scandal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I hope that this motion might prompt among some colleagues a measure of self-analysis. Look at it from the point of view of a former Soviet apparatchik analysing the European Union. I put it to you that he might find a few things that would make him feel rather at home. He would see that we are governed not by an elected president or an elected system, but by a 27-member Politburo called the European Commission, he would look and see this rubber-stamp Parliament that would make him feel a little nostalgic, he would see the series of five-year plans by which we administer our affairs, he would even see the fleet of special limousines and even special reserve shops for employees of the system and members of the nomenklatura.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, he would see what Engels called ‘the doctrine of false consciousness’ – that when people vote, they do not understand their true interest and it is for us to impose a better system on them.

We believe that it will be an important signal both to the Belarusian authorities and to civil society, the media and everyone fighting for the country’s democratic development. We hope that the measures proposed in the resolution will be given careful consideration and be discussed by the Commission and the Council, and will be implemented as fast as possible to have an effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the inauguration ceremony for the re-elected President Lukashenko scheduled for tomorrow will not stop the issues that have been raised about him, the legality of the elections and the way in which the results in these elections were recorded. Up to now, the European Union has used various policies and mechanisms to influence Belarus and the Belarus leadership, with modest results. Perhaps it is time to consider new options or whether we do not have a new situation in the region which will allow us to apply other mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that was alluded to in the resolution, which we consider extremely important and which has not been tried so far, is coordinating our policy and relations with Belarus with its immediate non-EU neighbours, that is to say, Russia, which is our strategic partner, and Ukraine, which is part of the Eastern Partnership. I think that through joint and coordinated efforts, we could achieve, if nothing else, at least an environment which would be politically more conducive to fair and democratic parliamentary elections, elections which are scheduled for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament also has to make fullest use of the options that are there. Today, we decided to send a delegation to Belarus, and I believe that allowing this delegation to visit the country and giving it the necessary assistance and contacts will be a test for the Belarus leadership.

<p class="contents">The Lukashenko regime should be isolated. The current policy of believing that the regime will gradually become open to democracy has turned out to be a miscalculation. The sanctions which should be imposed on Lukashenko’s regime should be harsh, for among other reasons, that it is a country which is an immediate neighbour of Europe. In relation to such countries, we should expect the same standards as for the Member States of the European Union. In particular, I would like the European Commission to support independent media such as TV Belsat, Radio Racyja and others.

After a period of relative calm, President Lukashenko is again using force against opposition activists. He has turned again to the most shameful features of his dictatorship. The brutal clash with the participants of a peaceful demonstration and the arrest of opposition leaders and opposition candidates in the elections is a clear violation of human rights and signifies the abandonment of measures intended to improve relations with the democratic countries of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I endorse in full Parliament’s resolution calling for the immediate release of political prisoners and for the elections to be repeated. I strongly condemn the dictatorial practices of President Lukashenko’s regime. I believe that pressure from European institutions will help ease the repression of Belarusian citizens.

We have a saying in Denmark that those who live in glasshouses should not throw stones, and therefore it is perhaps worth taking a look at what the EU looks like from the point of view of Belarus. Well, the EU is governed by a Commission made up of officials with absolutely no popular mandate, and it is only this Commission, made up of people with no popular movement behind them, no one to report to and no mandate from the citizens, that can table proposals. Once those proposals have been put forward and adopted, who is it who, with enormous political influence, ultimately decides how the EU legislation is to be implemented in the Member States? Again, it is people who have not been democratically elected, it is judges who sit at a nice comfortable distance from reality. The same can be said about this Parliament, where the vast majority are very comfortable inside the glass palaces where they have been placed, with no one to answer to at all and no understanding of the enormous concerns, opposition and agitation there is among the European citizens. If we look at the EU from Belarus’s point of view, we may see many frightening similarities to the dictatorships that we are trying to fight against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to question whether there really is a will among the Member States to do something about this. One thing is clear, however, and that is that we have created a currency, a common currency, that is proving disastrous for the economy in the whole of southern Europe. One reason for this is that the majority of those countries cannot keep up and have completely failed to implement the reforms that are necessary if we are to cope with future competition with China, India, South America and others. However, even in those areas that we would like to regard as areas of low-hanging fruit, as easy areas, it is impossible to reach agreement. One example is a clear initiative like the common European patent. It is appalling that, in this area, which is simply a matter of technicalities, we have not once been able to reach agreement. This is an example of how ineffective the EU is. In an area that could so easily be so beneficial, we have allowed language differences to get in the way of us reaching agreement. In reality, this probably speaks volumes about the false foundation on which the whole of this cooperation is based. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We believe that the political coordination among partners who have highly differentiated levels of cooperation with the European Union is difficult, but not impossible. It also makes sense at a political level to try and combine our efforts, bearing in mind that three of the countries are European Union Member States, one is a strategic partner, and others are part of the Eastern Partnership, while Turkey is a candidate for membership</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s inability to engage more energetically in the region has, at least hitherto, deprived us of the development and opportunity to use a great potential, and in this sense, we should say at the present time that the Black Sea Synergy, which, from the outset, was assessed as an insufficiently ambitious initiative on the part of the European Union, has to be developed into a proper strategy for the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have models of interaction that can be applied successfully, provided, of course, that we adapt them to the region. An example is the Baltic Sea strategy, which, at macro level, has been successful in developing regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that several steps – not all of which were included in the report – need to be taken right now. First, at a practical level, within the framework of the neighbourhood policy review being done at the moment, we have to consider a greater coherence between the Black Sea Synergy and the Eastern Partnership, as almost all countries of the Eastern Partnership save Belarus are also part of the Black Sea Synergy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is that political dialogue needs to be strengthened at ministerial as well as parliamentary level, and we should try and find a greater coherence between the Danubian strategy and future initiatives for the Black Sea region. All this should result in a strategy that can go on stream with separate budgetary funding in the next budget framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that Bulgaria and Romania are EU Member States, the Eastern Partnership – the special relations with the countries of the Eastern Partnership and with Russia – and the negotiations being carried on with other countries in the region on EU membership all justify the region’s political significance for the European Union. The Black Sea has become an important region for the transit of energy resources and for promising projects which are important for the Union, such as the Nabucco project, which is strategically important for the diversification of gas supply. I fully share, too, the opinion of Mr Ungureanu, whom I congratulate on the report, that the strategy must ensure the recognition of all actors in the region, and not just of the biggest states, and that it must fit in with other strategies, such as the strategy for the Mediterranean Sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The region is of exceptional strategic importance and our involvement there needs to be intensified. To this end, it is vital for Parliament to draw up a new strategy, in addition to providing financial and human resources, in the form of a separate item of the EU budget. The new strategy must serve to ensure the peace, stability and prosperity of the Black Sea region, and to guarantee the energy security of the EU. The diversification of supply lines and resources must be given even higher priority, and I would therefore like to stress the importance of the planned development of liquid natural gas terminals at Black Sea ports. The transit routes crossing the region could also significantly improve supply to the EU. Further intensification of cooperation with the countries of the Black Sea is a vital element of the success of Nabucco, the Trans-Adriatic pipeline and the Pan-European oil pipeline, which are of special significance to the EU. For this reason, I voted in favour of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to start by saying that the timing of the idea from my colleague, Traian Ungureanu, to draft an own-initiative report is extremely apt when the European Union is strengthening its regional policy by devising strategies for coastal regions such as the Baltic Sea, the High North and, in this instance, the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to say how pleased I am that the amendments which I tabled have been included in the resolution text. These amendments highlighted the need to create a network of NGOs in this region, encourage programmes promoting intercultural and inter-religious dialogue, as well as initiatives such as the Black Sea Universities Network. In my view, all these measures are good examples of the way in which interaction between civil societies can generate positive synergy in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wanted to stress not only the need to strike a balance between economic development and environmental protection, but also the need to implement fully the Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution. I hope that this initiative adopted today in Parliament will receive the attention it is due from the Council as well, which ought to deal with this matter as a priority issue for the European agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it would be a decisive step towards achieving the more general aim of improving relations between the Mediterranean area of the European Union and Africa. As an Italian MEP, I have to emphasise the historical and economic reasons that have led to Italy’s favourable relations with Libya over the years. At the same time, I have to emphasise the importance of strengthening cooperation between the EU and Libya, and by this I mean cooperation not just in economic matters, but also from the point of view of safeguarding human rights.

Naturally, respect for human rights play an important role, which is why it also makes sense for Brussels to call on Libya to ratify the Geneva Convention on Refugees of 1951 or to urge a moratorium on the death penalty. However, we must also consider the fact that Libya is an important transit country for illegal mass immigration from Africa to Europe. For this reason, no purpose will be served by a general rejection of a readmission agreement with Tripoli, as contained in the report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not get a readmission agreement with Libya, the pressure on Europe as a destination for immigrants will increase even further.

The attacks against Christians in recent months are a tragedy for the many victims, particularly in Baghdad and Alexandria, but also for their co-religionists. Christians have lived in the East for 2 000 years; they are inscribed in the history of their country. Today, however, they are fleeing the region en masse. Because of this forced exile, these countries are losing a substantial proportion of their human resources. The Near and Middle East regions have always been an area of diversity and cohabitation of religious minorities. The terrorists behind these attacks are trying to instigate a clash between East and West, pitting the Muslim world against the Christian world. All of this has been fiendishly planned. Christians in Iraq and Egypt may be feeling abandoned and betrayed. It is important that the Egyptian and Iraqi authorities find and harshly judge the authors of these massacres. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe needs to do much more than it has done so far in terms of protecting Christians around the world. It has the instruments to do so, if it wants to. The hope is that this resolution will mark the beginning of a change in approach by Union bodies, especially from a diplomatic and commercial viewpoint, in their bilateral dialogues with the many – too many – countries that tolerate anti-Christian persecutions, or even lend support to the culture of Christianophobia. When the EU signs commercial, economic and cooperation agreements with third countries, it really must enforce the human rights clauses with great determination, which is something it has not done up to now. It is no longer acceptable to see that countries where Christians are discriminated against and persecuted have signed important agreements with the EU that are fundamentally based on respect for human rights.

Religious freedom is one of the main fundamental human rights; one that is generally recognised by national constitutions and international conventions. The existence of so many standards at various levels of governance, both national and international, and all over the world, shows that there is unanimous consensus about the importance of religious freedom. However, legislation is not enough. It is the foundation on which to build effective policies. Over the last 50 years, the globalisation process has brought distant civilisations into contact with each another. In order to make sure that such contact does not turn into conflict, it is not enough just to condemn the recent attacks. We need to reaffirm our commitment to the creation of policies that encourage religious pluralism and ensure that different groups learn to be tolerant of each other. It is not just fundamentalism that is the threat. Today, religious freedom is also under attack from widespread secularism, which is trying to eliminate the spiritual world of the individual from public life. Religious freedom concerns all religions; it even concerns atheists. This is because, when there is acceptance of religious freedom, there is also acceptance of its opposite, in other words, the freedom not to profess any religion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This worrying and deplorable fact has to be deeply regretted, particularly since Christianity preaches peace and understanding between men, regardless of whether they are Jews or Greeks, as St Paul would say. What is being threatened is the religious freedom and peace of communities that have existed for centuries. They have lived peacefully alongside other religions in the areas where they are settled and are the subject of indiscriminate violence simply because they believe in Christ. The question goes much further, however. Apart from the attacks that have been made, the Christian faith and its manifestations are also being attacked in Europe itself, often in the guise of the corruption of such concepts as secularity and the neutrality of states and institutions. In this respect, I must deplore the recent attacks on the celebration of Catholic mass in Barcelona and call on the Spanish Government and the European institutions to condemn and combat the Christophobic atmosphere that seems to be on the rise.

The European External Action Service must show determination and address these failings surrounding freedom of religion. Our foreign policy agreements with third countries must include a clause on freedom of religion and reciprocity. From the perspective of the promotion of human rights, it is crucially important to speak about freedom of religion, because that is the human rights litmus test: freedom of speech and expression and freedom of association lie at the heart of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All in all, it would seem as if the political elite in Brussels, which is indifferent to Europe’s Christian roots, has also forgotten the fate of Christians in Islamic countries.

We must not be indifferent to such disregard for human life. The European Union, as a guardian of fundamental democratic values and human rights, should maintain better monitoring of the situation in third countries, and in the Middle East in particular. Our efforts should be unequivocal and more resolute. Freedom of religion is a fundamental human right, and religiously motivated discrimination and violence are inconsistent with our values. By respecting these rights, we set an example to other countries, but we should be equally effective in exacting the same respect from others. Human rights are universal and should be respected everywhere, and we should react decisively to any kind of expression of intolerance and, in particular, to religious intolerance. The Union has suitable instruments at its disposal which permit us to force the governments of countries with which we maintain political or commercial relations to act properly and to respect civil liberties, including freedom of religion. In Muslim countries, but also in countries such as China, India and Nepal, churches and chapels are burned with impunity, people are turned out onto the street, tortured or even killed and women are forced to undergo abortions.

To attack these communities is to undermine our most fundamental values. Respect for religious diversity and religious freedom is a universal principle that must be upheld. These attacks, carried out in the name of some extremist obscurantism from another era, are designed to create a climate of fear, and in the end, it is the survival of these ancient communities that is directly under threat. The EU must show solidarity with the victims and must support the authorities, which are committed to pursuing the perpetrators. This demand must be at the heart of our relations with our partners, in the same way as the human rights clauses. Tolerance and peace are intimately linked, and I shall, as always, support the European Union’s actions to ensure respect for and the promotion of our values, freedoms and rights throughout the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They were characterised by the brutal repression of popular demonstrations complaining about a number of obvious cases of vote rigging, carried out by the police and secret service agents. Such unacceptable events have led the European Parliament, acting on statements made previously by its President, Mr Buzek, to call on the Union to impose heavy sanctions on Belarus and to launch an enquiry by external, impartial authorities to reconstruct what happened and ascertain who was responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The introduction of strict sanctions might, through its impact, create a barrier and isolate this country even more. In the final analysis, the greatest impact would, in all probability, be felt by persons other than the ones targeted. Communications between the EU and Belarus should continue intensively, making use of all the possibilities of diplomacy, and reviewed regularly. As far as effectiveness is concerned, it should involve establishing a different kind of dialogue, held in a different form and at different levels, including a balanced, rather than a one-sided, assessment. The cornerstone, however, should be a careful assessment of experience to date in mutual communications between the EU and Belarus, on the basis of which the experience could be incorporated into a strategic plan clearly reflecting EU foreign policy on this country.</p>

<p class="contents">Personally, I believe a coordinated approach should be adopted: while, on the one hand, Europe wants to put some kind of pressure on the Belarusian Government, on the other, it must not completely cut off cooperation with the Minsk authorities, without thereby endorsing their policy. Such an approach would, in fact, only hurt the people of Belarus. That is why we need to continue to support all the measures that favour civil society and protect the opposition, independent mass media and non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears, therefore, that the cooperation mechanisms between the European Union and Belarus should not be interrupted at all, since they alone can make a real contribution to the country’s wellbeing and to its social and democratic growth. I would therefore argue that the ‘critical dialogue’ that the 27 Member States of the EU have already put in place should be maintained, in order to convince Belarus that it must strengthen its resolve to move towards European standards in terms of respect for democracy and protection of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that not just in the European Parliament and the Commission, but also at ministerial level and the level of Heads of State, constant attention needs to be paid to Belarus and the situation in it, because Belarus is a country that shares a border with the EU. The appointment of EU coordinators for Belarusian affairs might ensure united action by the EU as regards this country. I support the provision that the EU should freeze the visa ban for an extended list of Belarus officials but, at the same time, unlock contacts and travel within the EU for ordinary Belarusians as much as possible. Lithuania is following this route, having signed an agreement on streamlined cross-border movement with Belarus, and issuing free visas to Belarusian citizens. I also support the objective of establishing the ‘most sensitive areas’ and reaching a decision on the application of targeted sanctions, while directing and adapting EU assistance to Belarusian civil society. I call on the Commission to find ways of increasing access to independent information for the Belarusian population. The European Humanities University in Vilnius is one of the most successful long-term development cooperation projects as regards Belarus. Faced with such an internal situation in Belarus, where all roads to becoming a critical, conscious and free citizen have long been blocked, the EHU is becoming not just an island of free Belarusian thought, but also a breeding ground for future Belarusian leaders. EU assistance for this university should therefore not only be maintained, but increased. That is logical and something we should welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of the competition policy is to create genuine competition on the single market using measures relating to the market’s structures and the behaviour of its actors. Free competition fosters innovation, reduces production costs, increases economic efficiency and, consequently, boosts the level of the European economy’s competitiveness. The report covers both antitrust policies and State aid control policies. It also features rules and procedures for combating anti-competitive behaviour in companies and prevents governments from granting State aid which distorts competition in the internal market.</p>

The negative effects of this crisis hit the economy and business environment hard, as well as decision makers. While decision makers have tried to draw up policies that will minimise the impact of the crisis on the real economy, the European Commission, together with Member States and central banks, has worked hard to stabilise the financial system. This year’s report pays particular attention to these issues and notes with satisfaction the rapid response from the Commission and its successful application of competition policy measures. I voted in favour of this report as I think that the European Union needs a strong competition policy, founded on the principle of a free market and fair competition in all sectors, which will generate a successful internal market and will favour the creation of sustainable, knowledge-based jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We wish to emphasise that an EU competition policy based on the principles of open markets and a level playing field in all sectors is a cornerstone of a successful internal market and a precondition for the creation of sustainable jobs. We therefore underline our call for greater consistency between all EU policies and the priorities set out in the EU 2020 strategy for growth and jobs. It is necessary to draft clearer competition rules that encourage the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are a driver of growth in all our economies.

A priority for the next period is to ensure lasting growth by increasing employment levels, which will result in a strengthening of our competitiveness. This will contribute to an improvement in the Union’s world position and allow us to overcome the crisis but, above all, it will raise our citizens’ quality of life. If competition is operating properly in the market for goods and services, we can guarantee better quality, lower prices and greater choice for the consumer. In particular, we must remember small and medium-sized enterprises, which not only provide jobs for most of our citizens, but also possess huge potential for innovation. Therefore, it is very important to create fair and non-discriminatory conditions for them to operate, and to develop very clear and transparent rules of competition. The Commission’s effective use of the instruments of competition policy allowed stabilisation of the economy and moderation of the effects of the economic crisis on businesses and consumers. The year 2009 was one in which help was essential in order to maintain the integrity and competitiveness of the single market. The policy of State aid is a crucial element of competition policy, because it allows equal opportunities to be guaranteed to all businesspeople operating in the single market. However, that aid should be monitored, so that it does not impair the working of the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European free competition policy is one of the key policies of European integration. The underlying concept aims to establish an internal market where its economic players can freely initiate and exercise their activities. As stated in this document, I believe that it is necessary to have clear competition rules so that the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is a real possibility. At present, the European Union is passing through one of the most serious periods of economic and financial crisis in its entire history and the activity of SMEs is vital for re-booting the economy. I am pleased to see the development of greater synergies between competition policy and consumer protection policy.

I agree that there is a need for a united, coordinated EU policy on the Arctic region, in which both the EU’s priorities and the potential challenges and a strategy are clearly defined, taking into account Arctic renewable and non-renewable resources, the impact of climate change on the region and the different geopolitical appreciation of the Arctic on a larger scale. The Arctic is a sensitive region where the effects of climate change are especially visible, having serious repercussions on other regions in the world. Therefore, the best protection for the Arctic is a long-term and ambitious global climate agreement, but the rapid warming of the Arctic makes it necessary, in addition, to work on possible further short-term measures to limit Arctic warming. This is particularly important given the increasing interest in the exploitation of resources. We also must not forget the indigenous peoples whose economies rely, to a significant extent, on sustainable use of natural resources and therefore, the reduction of climate change and its effects and the right of the indigenous peoples to an unpolluted natural environment are also questions of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This question needs to be dealt with on a global level, since its causes lie outside the Arctic and, in turn, will also affect the whole globe. The EU is already a frontrunner in research and in environmental and climate change policies in the international context and will continue to be so. Having said this, and recalling the contribution already made today by the EU and its Member States as regards research, funding, its impact through EU legislation on the environment, climate, fisheries, etc., as well as the possibilities for cooperation in the future on issues such as the development of mapping and maritime safety, economic development and the like, it can be concluded that the EU has a lot to contribute to the sustainable development of the Arctic.

Due to the growing need for natural resources, particularly in the EU, the Arctic represents an important and varied opportunity in terms of energy supply (gas, renewables), raw materials and fish. The EU must engage in policies that take into account the sustainable management and exploitation of natural resources in the region in terms of the environment, safety and organisation. Iceland’s application for EU membership highlights the need to establish a policy for the Arctic, coordinated at European level. The European Union is responsible for striking the right balance between environmental concerns and the race to exploit natural resources, and for taking into account the interests of the people living in the Arctic region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These effects are greater in the Arctic than in other regions, and sea-level rise and climate change are nothing but a consequence of the greenhouse gases that the EU is constantly emitting. I believe my vote in favour of a sustainable policy for the High North is of crucial importance, in that the region needs to be safeguarded and protected since it has had to face disastrous environmental impacts that do not depend directly on its own territory but on the more industrialised European countries. The problem needs to be tackled at a global level, therefore, because its causes lie outside the Arctic but, in turn, have an effect on the whole planet. In addition, the region has vast natural resources of energy sources and minerals, and the EU has an interest in ensuring the security of the supplies needed for Europe’s people and industries. The Arctic is therefore a major contributor of energy, raw materials and also fish for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the rapporteur’s opinion that given the strategic importance of the Black Sea region for the EU and the rather limited results of the Black Sea Synergy, a strategy should be launched to enhance the coherence and visibility of EU action in the region and that the EU Black Sea strategy should be an integral part of the EU's broader foreign and security policy vision. Three years after devising the Black Sea Synergy, an analysis of the current situation indicates, first of all, the lack of a clear, comprehensive and updated picture on the implementation results of the Black Sea Synergy. Therefore, the EU strategy for the Black Sea should put in place a stronger policy framework and boost EU involvement in the Black Sea region. I support the opinion that the main objectives of a Black Sea strategy should entail building a space of peace, stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region, while also ensuring EU energy security. As a consequence, security, good governance, energy, transport, environment, socio-economic and human development should be considered as priority actions.

The strategic importance of the Black Sea region for the EU was recognised in 2007, in the context of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession to the EU. As developments in this region, strategically situated at the junction of Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, started having a direct impact on EU internal affairs, the EU acknowledged the need to reflect upon its stronger involvement in the area. This resulted in the launch of a new EU policy approach towards the region, called the Black Sea Synergy. The aim of the Black Sea Synergy is to develop regional cooperation between the EU and the region, as well as within the region. However, much less was achieved in the field of implementation, while sectors such as stability, democracy and good governance seem to have witnessed less progress in a context of deterioration of the democratic rule in several Black Sea states and of the Russia-Georgia war in 2008. Furthermore, the region continues to face the following challenges: protracted conflicts, trends towards militarisation and proliferation of arms, maritime surveillance, illicit trafficking and cross-border crime. I believe that in order to achieve efficient implementation, it is necessary to devise mechanisms for regular reporting, monitoring, evaluation and follow-up. In addition, the main objectives of a Black Sea strategy should entail building a space of peace, stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region, while also ensuring EU energy security.

The strategy should be closely linked to the European Neighbourhood Policy, the development of which was given a major boost by the Czech Presidency of the EU in the first half of 2009. The key priority of the EU’s Black Sea strategy should be to secure energy supplies to the EU, and related support for energy projects which are in the interests of the EU and which focus on diversifying gas supplies to the EU. The establishment of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly is also important and urgently required as regards the EU’s energy security.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the projects which the Black Sea strategy should be helping to implement, I would include the Nabucco project, the South Stream project, the project to bring liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe and the development of LNG terminals in Black Sea harbours, and also the pan-European Constanta-Trieste oil pipeline. The Commission should not delay and should conclude agreements by the end of 2011 with potential supplier countries for the Nabucco pipeline. The package of measures for energy infrastructure, which the Commission intends to submit in the near future, should place particular emphasis on the previously mentioned energy projects in the Black Sea region. Last but not least, it is necessary to emphasise the considerable potential of renewable energy sources in the Black Sea region, which may contribute significantly to the future energy security of the EU and the entire world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both reports refer to the ‘Black Sea Synergy’. In the context of south-east Europe, the definition of synergy is one where it represents the ability of a group to outperform even its best individual member. Apparently, there is a consensus amongst some in this place that the best individual member of the Black Sea Synergy is the EU. I would caution against this belief, certainly with regard to fisheries. The common fisheries policy has failed. I would say to my colleagues from the Black Sea region: learn from the mistakes of the CFP, examine the consequences the present regime has had on the small-scale fisheries of the north-east Atlantic and ask is this what we want for the Black Sea? The Black Sea strategy must be based on the uniqueness of the area. As we have seen, ideas that fit one part of Europe will not work in another part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The strategic importance of the Black Sea region for the EU was recognised in 2007, in the context of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession to the EU. Developments in Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia started having a direct impact on EU internal affairs, and the EU acknowledged the need to reflect upon its stronger involvement in the area. This resulted in the launch of a new EU policy approach towards the region, called the Black Sea Synergy. The aim of the Black Sea Synergy is to develop regional cooperation between the EU and the region, as well as within the region. I agree with the opinion that the main objectives of a Black Sea strategy should entail building a space of peace, stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region, as well as ensuring EU energy security. As a consequence, security, good governance, energy, transport, environmental, socio-economic and human development should be considered as priority actions. A security dimension of the Black Sea must include resolute actions for strengthening democratic rule, good governance and State capacity building. Finally, economic, social and human development within the Black Sea region is an important premise for transforming the Black Sea into a stable and prosperous space. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, a strengthening of cooperation at many levels is in the European Union’s interest. For these measures to be successful, they need to be consistent and to take into account the differences in conditions between particular countries. Care should also be taken to ensure that it is not just giving on our part. The countries of the Black Sea Basin have much to offer us, starting from sources of energy and natural riches. I share the rapporteur’s fears on the question of the lack of a clear strategy towards these countries. In this situation, a large role could be played by Bulgaria and Romania, which are already part of the Union. It is there that they understand the region’s politics best. The last issue is Turkey, and we should definitely remember Turkey, because in contrast to Europe, it is a country which is developing at a frantic pace.

If to these purely geographical considerations we add the fact that many countries in the region are also Member States of the Union, we will be in a better position to understand why Europe has, for many years, been working to strengthen relations with the countries in this area. The Ungureanu report calls on both the Commission and the European External Action Service to establish a strategy for increasingly close relations of cooperation between the European Union and the Black Sea region. Such relations should, however, be subject to strict controls, in order to maintain effective coordination of activities and the subdivision of responsibilities. I believe, in fact, that the success of such an important partnership depends, to some extent, on the peaceful resolution of current conflicts. Lastly, I should like to highlight the part of the report that calls on the Union to promote strategies to strengthen the institutions of the countries in the Black Sea area, because I believe that respect for democracy needs to underpin such relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is great that we are discussing the Black Sea now, but I believe that we need to conclude this discussion with a concrete proposal. The Black Sea can contribute to the development of the Danube. The Danube region contributes to the development of the Black Sea. Both regions are interdependent. For this reason, I believe that a common approach should be considered. The issue that could bring an immediate result is energy. The new energy sources from the Caspian Sea, as well as the new routes, can develop the Black Sea region and, by implication, the Danube region.

The EU must continue in this direction. It should strengthen its involvement in the Black Sea in order to give positive proof of its ‘soft power’ diplomacy.

It is particularly important that natural gas supplies for Europe should be secured. However, whatever the efforts by the EU, Russian interests should not be forgotten.</p>

A fact that should not be ignored is that an unprecedented increase in fish mortality has been noted recently in the Black Sea. The biggest polluters affecting the marine biodiversity are the Dnieper, Don, Dniester and Danube rivers (which spill 60 000 tonnes of phosphorous and 340 tonnes of inorganic nitrogen into the Black Sea every year). Other factors that contribute to the degradation of the Black Sea are excessive fishing and waste materials. A group of experts estimated that subaquatic life will completely disappear from the Black Sea in approximately 30 years due to hydrogen sulphide. I believe that these issues should be as high as possible on the European agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, part of the Black Sea became an inland sea of the EU. As developments in this region, which is geopolitically situated between Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, also have an impact on EU internal affairs, there is a need for stronger involvement in the area. The aim is to develop regional cooperation between the EU and the region, as well as within the region. The Black Sea region is intended to be developed into an area of stability, security, democracy and prosperity. In addition, joint projects are being set up, such as the creation of a Black Sea Civil Society Forum, strengthening of the academic and students’ networks and creation of an Institute for European Studies in the Black Sea region.

The region needs democratic measures to be put in place, intended chiefly to ensure security, stability and peace, as well as to increase prosperity. The objective of the strategy is also to ensure the EU’s energy security. In the context of shaping a strategy for the Black Sea macro-region, and then for the Danube region, the proposal put forward by the European Commission in 2007 entitled ‘Black Sea Synergy – A New Regional Cooperation Initiative’ (which recognised the region as strategic for the EU) is the best method of dealing with the abovementioned issues. Unfortunately, Black Sea Synergy results have so far been rather limited. Furthermore, no clear and comprehensive picture exists of the current implementation results, in view of which the criticism is increasingly being made that the EU lacks a coherent vision and that the strategy is too fragmented. Therefore, as the rapporteur says, while building upon the merits of the Black Sea Synergy, the EU strategy for the Black Sea should put in place a stronger policy framework and boost EU involvement in the Black Sea region. Just as with the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region and the Danube region, success in implementation will depend on good dialogue at all levels of regional cooperation, because this dialogue will lead to proposals for appropriate and regular reporting, monitoring, evaluation and follow-up mechanisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the implementation of a strategy to develop greater cooperation between the EU and the region is a goal that the Union should set itself as soon as possible. This initiative, called the Black Sea Synergy, could transform the region into an area of stability, security, democracy and prosperity. In line with this House, I gave my assent – through my vote in favour – to supporting the creation and launch of the Black Sea Synergy. I believe the economic, social and cultural development of the region can be promoted, with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, by further liberalising trade and intensifying commerce within the region.

This importance results from its geographical location, encompassing three Member States of the European Union, namely, Greece, Romania and Bulgaria, a candidate country, Turkey, and six partners, including Russia. Apart from this, the challenges with regard to security and energy supplies require the European Union to achieve greater involvement and commitment in its relations with the countries of this region. Therefore, I subscribe to the concerns expressed in the document voted on today, which fall into two categories: to guarantee peace, democracy and stability in the Black Sea region and to guarantee the security of the European Union’s energy supply. I believe that from a regional point of view, it is necessary to create synergies and develop greater cooperation by establishing a more effective partnership with regard to transport and energy, with a view to greater diversification of supply channels and sources. The strengthening of the dialogue between the European Union and the Black Sea region will certainly be advantageous, since the different parties will be able to benefit from more effective cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The measures previously taken in the Eastern European Mediterranean were not coordinated and the results achieved have been marginal. The Black Sea region has known bilateral conflict for many, many years. In view of the fact that two EU Member States border the Black Sea and the region has therefore become one of the Union’s direct neighbours, the European Union must engage more closely in regional dialogue in order to foster political stability in the region. Cooperation in establishing regional structures will also benefit the environmental situation, which is currently a cause for considerable concern. The EU needs to provide active support in order to influence the balance between economic development and environmental protection. After all, Europe also has interests that it pursues in the Black Sea region.

These are leading to a climate of fear and intolerance and, in the worst cases, extremism.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against extremism is not an easy task, which is why the Pakistani Government and all those citizens who agree that intolerance and extremism are unacceptable need our support. We have to continue to wipe out terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Governor, Mr Taseer, was violently murdered out of sheer intolerance by a guard from his own security detail, a person who should have protected him. His daughter, Shehrbano, wrote a letter which was published in <span class="italic">The New York Times</span>, from which I would like to quote, because I think she gets to the essence and it is very good to use her words in memory of her father.</p>
<p class="contents">She says of the perpetrator: ‘Mr Qadri and his supporters may have felled a great oak that day, but they are sadly mistaken if they think they have succeeded in silencing my father’s voice or the voices of millions like him who believe in the secular vision of Pakistan’s founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah’. She continues: ‘There are those who say my father’s death was the final nail in the coffin for a tolerant Pakistan. That Pakistan’s liberal voices will now be silenced. But we buried a heroic man, and not the courage he inspired in others’.</p>
<p class="contents">Others followed in their condemnation of the blasphemy laws, even conservative politicians. We have to support that here in the European Parliament. The daughter of Governor Taseer went to Smith College and she studied European politics and human rights, but too many people in Pakistan are educated in madrasahs. We have to make sure that the young generation has opportunities, and learns how to live together in the diverse society which is Pakistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Salmaan Taseer was governor of the country’s wealthiest and most populous province, and was also an important politician in the ruling party. He died because he had the moral strength and the courage to demand the release of the Christian woman Asia Bibi, who has been sentenced to death for blasphemy. His murder, carried out by one of his own security guards and inspired by Muslim extremists, is not just another attack on a highly placed politician in Pakistan and proof of the dramatically low level of security there. It is, principally, testimony to the increasingly visible slide of the country – of Pakistan – towards a situation in which part of the armed forces, the judiciary and the political elite support, both openly and secretly, a policy of concessions towards Islamic political and religious extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, in this Chamber, we debated the subject of the persecution of Christians. Today, we have adopted a resolution on the matter. It seems to me that scope for activity is opening up for Mrs Ashton and her service to put diplomatic and political pressure on the Pakistani authorities, who must at last start to fight religious extremism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I personally knew Benazir Bhutto, and Minister Shahbaz Bhatti has become a good friend of mine. What links all three of them is their amazing courage as vocal and visible critics of blasphemy laws and their abuse by extremist groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Pakistan has indeed taken several important steps to improve the rights of minorities, for example, by allocating a minimum quota in public jobs. The government has also formed a committee to review all discriminatory laws, including the blasphemy law. However, the work has not yet finished. Despite several major steps, so long as there is a legal loophole, such as that in the current blasphemy law, so massive that it enables terrorists and extremists to push their own agenda forward, it is difficult to believe in a true commitment to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, with this resolution, we can express our continuing solidarity with the government of Pakistan in the fight against terrorism and the spread of extremism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, this subject has returned to our Chamber again, as a result of the religiously motivated sentence of death handed down to 45 year old Asia Bibi and the murder of the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, who had spoken out publicly in her defence.</p>
<p class="contents">It turns out that the situation we described eight months ago has not only failed to improve, but has become yet worse. In Pakistan, today, one can lose one’s life both for so-called religious blasphemy and for freedom of speech – in this case, a public statement about a judicial sentence. The murder of Mr Taseer shows how delicate a situation we face. Pakistan is divided by religion to such an extent, that on both sides – Christian and Muslim – people are dying, including the representatives of local elites. Public support for amendment of the Pakistan Penal Code and, in particular, of Section 295 C, which prescribes capital punishment for blasphemy, can also involve the risk of death.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, however, require courage from Pakistani politicians and, in particular, from the opposition, for example, the Pakistan Muslim League, which is blocking government reform of the code. We can also support the work of the Ministry for Minority Affairs and help the government of Prime Minister Gilani in such matters as improving the quality of journalism and media reporting and the standard of educational materials in schools, for example. Today, the European Parliament is not interfering in Pakistan’s internal affairs, but is only calling attention to Article 20 of Pakistan’s 1973 Constitution and the freedom of religion for which it provides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It offers a strange contrast to the resolution which was adopted this morning on Christian minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us here are committed, or so I hope, to protecting freedom of expression, conscience and religion. What we should be equally preoccupied with are all those who fall victim to persecution because of their religious choices, including when they decide to change religion and also when they do not believe in God.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to combat fundamentalism, of whatever kind that may be, then we must treat all victims of this fundamentalism in the same way. No religion is, or ever was, invulnerable to what I will call intolerable deviations. Just let us remind ourselves of the mass murder of American Indians, particularly in the Caribbean and in Latin America. Let us remind ourselves of the sorrowful period of the Crusades, the Inquisition or the wars of religion between Catholics and Protestants. Let us remember the anti-Semitism which had such devastating effects during the 20th century and which lives on more or less latently in a number of EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Every religion has its own form of fundamentalism and the first victims of such fundamentalism are often the religious moderates of those same religions. From this perspective, the assassination of the Governor of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, is a classic example. This man was murdered because he was a model of tolerance and because he dared to condemn the blasphemy laws in force in his country and the abusive usage of these by certain extremist groups in cases such as that of Asia Bibi, a Christian sentenced to death for blasphemy under the Pakistan Penal Code.</p>
<p class="contents">What is even more unacceptable is the praising of his murderer by fanatical groups. Let us not forget that the blasphemy law is applied primarily to Muslims, that it affects all religious minorities, and, in particular, women, but also trade-union activists, journalists and lawyers, and that people from all of these groups are also frequently deprived of their fundamental freedoms, if not obliged to go into hiding.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore time that the Commission and the External Action Service changed their policy, and I would like you, Commissioner, to provide an accurate assessment of the agreement with Tunisia and the agreement with Pakistan on democracy and human rights, and I would like Tunisia to be a lesson to us, to be a lesson to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are rightly distressed by his murder and the reaction to it by part of the population of Pakistan, but we should not forget, as well, that many have mourned him and have done that in public as a public act. It is an act we should be commending, like, for example, the action taken by the media regulator against certain media with regard to their coverage of the alleged murderer.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as we know, the blasphemy law in Pakistan puts the lives of Pakistani citizens at risk: Muslim, Christian and others alike, as many speakers have said this afternoon. We are aware that Pakistan is a new democracy, that it is facing conflict on its borders, and that it has faced the disaster of the recent flood, as well as the earthquake only this week. We know that the government is struggling, but we also recognise that it needs our support in terms of developing democracy within Pakistan, not least in the political battle against extremism and for universal human rights, and it is our role as democratic parliamentarians to support all those who are working for positive change and to give them the voice that others would deny them.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also asking for action by the government of Pakistan, not least to remove the reservations on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – which they ratified with a large number of reservations – and we urged this in our recent delegation visit to Pakistan. We want them, as well, to continue the efforts to change the blasphemy law because this is a law that is more abused than properly used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This disgusting murder of a dedicated and enlightened public servant was sparked by his advocacy of reforming Pakistan’s draconian blasphemy laws. In particular, he championed the case of a Christian woman who is currently awaiting execution – would you believe it – having been convicted of defaming Islam.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this Parliament have long called for the reform or scrapping of these wretched blasphemy laws, which are invoked frequently against Pakistan’s religious minorities. This assassination underlines the growing radicalisation of Pakistani society. Jinnah, were he alive today, would be shocked.</p>
<p class="contents">Few mainstream politicians dared to follow Salmaan Taseer’s lead and suggest a reform of the blasphemy laws and even fewer will be able to do so now. They will be afraid. Instead, the violent radicals and fanatics – including, I am afraid, leading jurists – praised the assassin and called for his release. They seem to be winning the battle of ideas in Pakistan. As a result, domestic terrorism is flourishing, and we saw this phenomenon again last week.</p>

Pakistan is burdened by two problems in particular: on the one hand, the continuous attacks from Afghanistan and India, and, on the other, the issue which is the most important for us in this sitting, Muslim extremists, to whom Salmaan Taseer also fell victim.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Štefan Füle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – Mr President, this debate is yet more proof that the European Union is shocked by the brutal murder of Mr Salmaan Taseer, Governor of Pakistan’s Punjab province, in Islamabad on 4 January. High Representative Ashton strongly condemned the killing in her statement on 4 January. She urged the Pakistani authorities to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice. This assassination is all the more distressing as, based on available reports, it is linked to Mr Taseer’s outspoken defence of a Christian woman, Asia Bibi, who was sentenced to death under questionable blasphemy charges.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that on 12 November 2010, High Representative Ashton expressed deep concern over the death sentence given to Mrs Asia Bibi. She called on Pakistan to abolish the death penalty and respect human rights, as guaranteed under the international conventions to which the country is a party.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has repeatedly brought up the continued application of the blasphemy laws with the government of Pakistan as part of this human rights dialogue. We are conscious of the fact that the blasphemy laws in their present form are open to abuse and have often been applied against religious minorities. We are also aware that false accusations have been used as a tool to settle private disputes or for personal gain.</p>
<p class="contents">We were encouraged by earlier steps taken by the government of Pakistan to try amending more controversial aspects of the laws. Ideally, of course, the blasphemy laws would be totally repealed. It is unfortunate that in the case of Mr Taseer’s assassination, there has been widespread public support for the murderer. We are concerned that fatwas were not only issued against Mr Taseer but also against other public figures who have spoken out for a reform of the blasphemy laws. Inciting hatred and violence with impunity should not be allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Pakistan has a responsibility to protect its citizens, and we count on it to do everything possible to ensure their safety. There are fears that the murder of Mr Taseer reflects a rise in extremism and intolerance in Pakistan. We need to face up to the situation and consider carefully how to react, knowing that the government, and democratic institutions of the states more generally, continue to face daunting challenges. Let me be very clear here: there is no alternative but to continue to strengthen democratic and progressive forces in Pakistan’s civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Pakistan’s constitution explicitly protects the rights of minorities, and accordingly, the government needs to tackle extremism not just in the border areas but also on the streets of Pakistani cities. We need to provide continued emphasis on education in our development cooperation and more needs to be done to promote tolerance within the educational system, especially towards minorities. We are well aware of the vulnerable situation of persons belonging to religious minorities in Pakistan; this does not just concern Christians but also Hindus, Shias, Ahmadis and others. The European Union should champion their common cause and not that of any particular group or religion, as this would play into the hands of those wishing to deepen divisions among Christians and Muslims.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to focus on the need to fully protect every individual’s right to religious freedom in Pakistan or elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the values of our Western societies, murder is considered as the worst single crime. It is, therefore, difficult to understand how someone can commit murder as a form of retaliation. Freedom of conscience and freedom of religion are as important as freedom of speech, which may lead to conflicts between these freedoms. However, any definition by governments of what is to be considered as blasphemy is an unacceptable restriction on freedom of speech. A modern society should consider as legitimate all personal views expressed in an inoffensive manner. Moreover, if Pakistan is to become a tolerant society, such barbarian acts motivated by religious fundamentalism are to be condemned. This incident is yet another reminder that freedom of speech continues to be absent in some regions of the world. Given the history of his country, it was courageous for Salmaan Taseer to speak out against the blasphemy law and in favour of free speech. It is regrettable that this ultimately cost him his life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

<p class="contents">In the resolution we have tabled and are shortly to vote upon, we point out that relations between Brazil and the European Union are based on mutual recognition and respect of the rule of law and of fundamental rights. There are therefore no question marks over our friendly relationship with Brazil.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that, in Italy, the defendant, Cesare Battisti, has been found guilty of four murders. Although a fugitive, Mr Battisti had the legal assurances in his trials – which were all conducted in the presence of his defence lawyer – that the Italian justice system had run its course, with all levels of justice exhausted, and that they sentenced him to two life sentences.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, even France – where Cesare Battisti had previously fled – decided back in 2004 to accept Italy’s extradition request, recognising his crimes and the corresponding sentences, because Cesare Battisti is a criminal who must be brought to justice. Brazil’s contradictory behaviour is difficult to understand, not least because the Brazilian authorities have not officially recognised him as a political refugee, which is one of the reasons to suspend the bilateral agreement between Italy and Brazil regarding extradition.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the decision of the Supreme Court seemed incomprehensible to the victims’ families and the wider public. Mr President, we are representing a Europe of rights and of rights for all. The victims have the right to know that those guilty of such heinous crimes will serve their sentence in the prisons of their own countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not acceptable. It is a question of certain elementary standards – I would even say human standards – and not European ones. Speaking as someone who is not very emotionally involved and who, I suppose, can look at the situation coldly and objectively, it seems to me I can say on this matter that a certain loss of balance has, in fact, occurred here, which is inconceivable to our taxpayers and our voters.

<p class="contents">Since this is the legal basis for the refusal to extradite Cesare Battisti, we cannot but reject it. Cesare Battisti, an individual with something of an ambiguous past, is the product of a time in which thousands of young people – many of whom were desperately lonely – chose armed struggle as a means of political struggle and ended up turning the alienating utopian dream they believed in into a crime. Other countries have experienced similar tragedies but none have so far offered the protagonists of these any chances to reform, unlike Italy, which, in fighting terrorism, really cemented its sense of national unity.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking up the appeal of the victims’ relatives, we therefore ask for Cesare Battisti to be brought before the Italian judicial system, which will know how to show – as it has done in hundreds of other cases of former terrorists who are now reintegrated into social and civil life – that to be punished is also to make amends, as the Italian, Cesare Beccaria, taught Western legal civilisation, and not just intimidation or brutalisation, as the Brazilian authorities fear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If you want to talk about Brazil, then it would be a matter of true urgency to demonstrate our solidarity with the people affected by the storms that recently lashed the state of Rio de Janeiro, in particular, the cities of Nova Friburgo, Petrópolis and Teresópolis, which killed more than 700 people, left more than 13 000 people homeless, and caused incalculable damage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is lamentable that the European Parliament has not commented on this tragedy and has not asked the European Commission to express its active solidarity to the President of Brazil and its availability to provide any aid necessary. Therefore, from these seats, we congratulate the new President of Brazil, Dilma Roussef, on her recent election. We send our feelings of solidarity and deep regret for the tragic consequences of the storms, feelings that extend to the Brazilian Congress, the families that are the victims of this tragedy and all the people of Brazil.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the resolution presented here, we insist on the need to respect the decisions of the legitimate authorities of Brazil, where Cesare Battisti is being held, and to await the decisions of the legitimate authorities of Brazil, without pressure from this Parliament. Therefore, I propose that the proposal be withdrawn in order to avoid a deplorable decision.</p>

He has evaded the Italian judiciary for 30 years now and so far, therefore, he has escaped a life sentence for murder.

<p class="contents">I have taken due note of your views on this particular case, and I share your feelings towards the victims and their families. However, the Commission considers that there is no scope for its involvement in this case. The European Union has not concluded any extradition agreement with Brazil and, even if this had been the case, it would have no right to intervene in individual extradition cases. A decision on extradition between European Union Member States, or between European Union Member States and third states, are entirely the preserve of the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy’s relations with Brazil on criminal cooperation are governed by a bilateral extradition treaty concluded in 1989. The Brazilian authorities have used their discretionary power within the law to refuse extradition of Mr Battisti.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add, in no uncertain terms: in the case of extradition, I have no doubts that Italian justice delivers the high standards expected of European Union Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a legal and political dispute between Brazil and Italy and a decision by the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil is pending. At this time, this House should be sending two other messages to Brazil: one of solidarity regarding the disaster in which more than 700 people lost their lives, and one of delight on account of the democratic election of President Dilma Rousseff. Brazil is, without doubt, a democratic country that has made significant progress in political, civil, social, economic and cultural affairs in the last decade and is a model in the fight against poverty and hunger, thanks to the government’s Zero Hunger and Family Allowance programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She is banned from practising law, but let us serve justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Rule of Law is no longer practised or existent in Iran, and the judiciary is highly politicised. Defending human rights is now considered an act against national security. Nasrin Sotoudeh, lawyer and mother of two, is charged with acting against national security. She defended, among others, Zahra Bahrami, an Iranian-Dutch citizen who was sentenced to death before Dutch diplomats had talked to her, and in a climate of serious doubts about due process.</p>
<p class="contents">As strong a woman as Nasrin Sotoudeh is and was, by standing for justice, we see a weak regime that represses its citizens instead of providing for their wellbeing. High Representative Ashton will be in Istanbul later this month in an attempt to bring the Iranian regime to cooperate with the international community on the nuclear issue. Economic sanctions have the same aim. I doubt they will render the desired result before disproportionately hurting the people of Iran who, as a result, become more and more dependent on the hard-line government.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while I am sceptical about the impact of economic sanctions, I am confident that sanctions against individuals responsible for violating human rights through, for example, censorship, rape, torture and executions, will be an effective and necessary step to end impunity and to honour the justice that Nasrin Sotoudeh stood for. Human rights are clearly the Achilles heel of the Iranian regime.</p>

The mullahs have hanged 65 people so far this year. Ten were hanged yesterday: first, they were heavily fined and had their homes confiscated, and then each was mercilessly flogged before being dragged to the gallows. Eighty-seven people have been hanged in the past four weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Ahmadinejad is a holocaust denier and a hater of the Jews; he says he wants to wipe Israel off the map and he is now building nuclear weapons that will enable him to do so. He and Khamenei preside over the ruthless suppression of the citizens of Iran, with hangings, torture, stoning to death, amputations and floggings all commonplace, and the execution of children, and even pregnant women, routine. Two prisoners in Mashhad had their hands amputated this week; two others have been sentenced to amputation and these verdicts will be carried out soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who tries to expose this evil is immediately targeted. Nasrin Sotoudeh is a case in point: a courageous human rights lawyer who has defended many of the innocent people unjustly sentenced and executed by this fascist regime. Her outrageous sentence of 11 years’ imprisonment for doing her job is an insult to humanity. The real criminals are the tyrants in Tehran and they will be held to account. They believe that their critics in the West are part of an international conspiracy to topple their regime. Well, I for one would sign up to that project today. Evil must never be allowed to prevail, and the sooner we can see freedom, democracy, humanity and women’s rights restored to Iran, the better it will be for the whole world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Islamic Republic of Iran is characterised not only by the threat it poses to world peace with a nuclear project capable of evoking the terror of nuclear war, but also by the illegitimacy of its elections; mass arrests of people requesting free elections; the killing of objectors; the rape and physical abuse of those who do not support the regime; the iniquity of judicial processes, where decisions can be predicted as soon as the accusations have been made; serious discrimination against women and homosexuals; and the absence of freedom of expression and of association. The conditions of Iranian prisoners in Camp Ashraf, where they are subjected to violence and even stoning, are absolutely incredible.</p>
<p class="contents">Every day, at least two people, including children, are sentenced to death in Iran, and they are guilty of nothing more than of not pleasing the regime. Legal evidence is often created through the cruel and skilful use of brutal methods of torture. These criticisms are certainly not aimed at Islam, which is based on peace, but at the Iranian regime. The arrest and conviction of Nasrin Sotoudeh bring to light a new level of judicial deceit, since in this case, the attack and conviction are against a defender of the people, which means that citizens of Iran cannot even defend themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The case of Nasrin Sotoudeh demonstrates this completely. She was punished for her work in support of human rights with an extremely harsh sentence: 11 years, banned from practising as a lawyer for 20 years and from leaving the country. This verdict was reached following a mockery of a trial.</p>
<p class="contents">This case is far from an isolated incident. It is part of a deliberate strategy by the Iranian regime to systematically silence human rights activists. A whole series of very harsh sentences are targeted at lawyers who are active in human rights matters, and we must show solidarity with these courageous people who support and take action on human rights in spite of threats, torture and imprisonment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We really have to because the situation in Iran is gravely problematic and dramatic.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important that this Parliament reiterates once again its call for the release of all prisoners of conscience, including all those who have been detained over the last year in connection with their peaceful – and I repeat, peaceful – political and human rights activities. This Parliament has to call again on the Iranian authorities to respect the internationally recognised rights to freedom of expression and assembly, and strongly condemn the extraordinarily harsh sentence against Nasrin Sotoudeh and to commend her for her courage and her engagement.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also why this Parliament has to consider Mrs Sotoudeh, as well as her fellow human rights activists and prisoners of conscience, and demand her immediate release. We have to express our concern over the ever more frequently imposed sentence of a ban on leaving Iran, which can lead to the logical conclusion that staying in Iran is considered a punishment by the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to call on the authorities to combat the impunity of human rights violators within the security forces and also reiterate our demand for an independent investigation into allegations of extra-judicial executions since June’s disputed presidential elections and for alleged violators to be brought to justice. Evidently, we also have to strongly condemn the bomb attack in Chabahar and to express our condolences to the victims’ families and the injured.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that we are seriously concerned about the persecution of certain religions and ethnic groups in Iran. We have to express our conviction, supported by recent European history, that peaceful and balanced social and political development can only be achieved by taking the cultural and social aspirations of differing regions into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has been held for four months. Now, following a trial, this distinguished human rights defender and dedicated co-worker of Nobel Laureate, Shirin Ebadi, has been sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment followed by a 20-year ban on practising law and leaving Iran. Let us remember that long prison sentences have also been handed down to other political prisoners. The 26-year-old women’s rights activist, Shiva Nazar Ahari, has been sentenced to four years in prison and 74 lashes for the same crime.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to emphasise clearly our opposition to flagrant violations of what are fundamental human rights: freedom of association, freedom of expression, the right to freedom of thought and the right to a fair trial. Nasrin Sotoudeh, who has devoted her life to the fight to defend human rights – defending minors who have been sentenced to death and people accused of causing peaceful protests as well as working closely with the opposition – has become living proof of the human rights violations in Iran. The European Union cannot continue to be a passive observer of this uneven fight on the part of Iranian society against the regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nasrin Sotoudeh was sentenced, after months of isolation and torture, to 11 years in prison because, as a lawyer and campaigner for human rights, she defended opponents of the Tehran government, including a Nobel Peace Prize laureate.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with numerous dissidents, dozens of journalists and bloggers who dared to exercise their basic freedom to express their own conscience are also suffering ill treatment in Iranian prisons. I believe that the European Union’s commitment to the release of these fighters for democracy should not only take the form of public protest, but also of concrete steps from the European External Action Service, with a view to mobilising the international community to exert increased common pressure to end these human rights violations in Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh has helped many opposition supporters who were detained and harassed following the rigged presidential election 18 months ago.

She was arrested in September last year on charges of spreading propaganda and conspiring to harm state security.

To this tragic statistic must also be added the sentences of many years in prison for Iranian lawyers who defend the victims of the country’s justice system. Those last two words should probably be put in inverted commas. Forty seven year-old Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was arrested on 4 September, tortured and who has now been sentenced to 11 years in prison, is an example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Other Iranian lawyers have also met with repression. Shiva Nazar Ahari, co-founder of the Committee of Human Rights Reporters, has been given a sentence of four years in prison, Mohammad Seifzadeh has been given nine years in prison and a ban on practising law for 10 years, and Mohammad Oliyafar has received a year in prison just for representing his clients in court. I think that by using the negotiating position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, we should press for the subject of human rights defenders to be included in talks with Iran as a matter of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the last two years, conditions have gone from being difficult to being near impossible for those who work to defend human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">For Nasrin Sotoudeh and many others like her who work to defend the just causes of fundamental rights and freedom, working from jail is not an option. The impact of her arrest is clear: those in Iran who are brave enough to stand up for those whom the state itself is supposed to protect risk being intimidated, imprisoned or worse.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has been speaking out; more than ten statements were released in 2010 by High Representative and Vice-President Ashton on both the general situation and on individual cases. At the same time, the European Union undertook discreet demarches with the Iranian authorities seeking clarifications and explanations, and conveying clear messages on the need to improve the situation in Iran. A statement on Nasrin Sotoudeh’s case was made by High Representative and Vice-President Ashton on 14 January 2011, which mentioned both Ms Sotoudeh and Ms Shiva Nazar Ahari, a lawyer and a journalist, sentenced respectively to eleven and four years in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">The Islamic Republic of Iran was recently elected to the membership of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. Mrs Sotoudeh and Ms Ahari are two women who have been deprived of the very rights they were fighting to protect. The European Union will continue reminding the Iranian authorities that, first and foremost, they must comply with those international obligations stemming from the multilateral agreements and conventions they have signed and ratified. We will continue seeking ways to make our action in defence of human rights more effective, using all the means at our disposal. The Iranian people deserve no less. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, we read about the increasing number of death sentences.

<p class="contents">As we know, the hallmark of Iran’s legal system is a serious lack of justice and transparency. It is therefore important that the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy does not let the country off the hook, but continues to raise human rights issues in relations with Iran. Let me list the minimum requirements: the immediate and unconditional release of human rights lawyer Sotoudeh and other prisoners of conscience, Bahrami’s death sentence to be reconsidered and the Dutch authorities to be included in handling the case, allowing representatives of the Red Cross to meet with prisoners, and letting human rights organisations into the country to assess the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Council has been consistent in promoting cultural and linguistic diversity as well as intercultural dialogue in its policy making together with the Commission and the European Parliament. This policy is enshrined on:</p>
<p>the Treaty on the European Union which, in its Article 3(3), fourth subparagraph, sets out that the EU ‘shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity’.</p>
<p>the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which, in its Article 167, sets out that the EU ‘shall contribute to the flowering of cultures of the Member States while respecting their national and regional diversity...’. Furthermore, the EU also ‘shall take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of the Treaties, in particular, in order to respect and to promote diversity of its cultures’.</p>
<p>the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which, in its Article 22, sets out that the EU ‘shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity’.</p>
<p>the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions which has been ratified by the European Union. In one of the guiding principles of the Convention, it is stated that ‘the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions presuppose (…) respect for all cultures, including the cultures of persons belonging to minorities (…)’.</p>
<p>In its 2007 Resolution on a European Agenda for Culture<a href="#defann_1_1" name="refann_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Council endorsed three strategic objectives, one of them being promotion of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue.</p>
<p>This objective has been translated into a priority area in the Council’s work plans for culture since 2002. In the latest Work Plan agreed for 2011-2014<a href="#defann_1_2" name="refann_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue will, for the first time, be dealt with by a working group of the Member States experts.</p>
<p>The Council designated the year 2008 as the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. In the decision on designation<a href="#defann_1_3" name="refann_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Council stressed that intercultural dialogue is an important dimension in many Union policies and instruments in the fields such as youth, sport, citizenship, employment and social affairs, combating racism and xenophobia, combating discrimination and social exclusion, audiovisual policy and policy on asylum and the integration of immigrants.</p>
<p>The Council also has noted that the intercultural dialogue can help to bring individuals and peoples closer together, and help towards conflict prevention and the process of reconciliation, especially in regions which are facing politically precarious situations<a href="#defann_1_4" name="refann_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The efforts to achieve the targets for energy from renewable sources, which is a long-term challenge, are being made within the framework defined by the Directive on the promotion of energy from renewable sources<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. All Member States had time until last December to implement this directive. It sets binding targets for the share of renewable energy in energy consumption to be reached in 2020, allowing the EU jointly to achieve a 20% share of renewable, as reconfirmed in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p>These targets were carefully negotiated in order to get the most out of each Member State’s potential and they represent a high level of ambition. Indeed, the level of ambition reflected in national targets is such that for certain Member States, it will not be possible to reach their targets without making full use of cooperation mechanisms, between Member States as well as with third countries, established by the directive. At the same time, the targets appear realistic, not only because of the cooperation mechanisms already mentioned, but also because of the possibility for Member States to continue with their national schemes to support renewable energy.</p>
<p>The directive is not the only EU instrument that could and will contribute to steer Europe on the path towards increasing the share of renewable energy. Some initiatives to support the generation of energy from renewable sources are already in place, such as the large contribution of the European Energy Programme for Recovery<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> to offshore wind energy. Key developments for the transport of renewable energy and the adaptation of networks through the roll-out of smart grids and smart metering will also be prioritised in 2011, as part of the EU Energy Strategy 2020<a href="#defann_2_3" name="refann_2_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, enhanced energy efficiency will be further promoted through the adoption of a reviewed Energy Efficiency Action Plan, which is a priority for the Hungarian Presidency.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Trio Presidency Programme prioritised the fight against illegal immigration and the Hungarian Presidency intends to build on the work of the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies in this field in keeping with the objectives set out in the Stockholm Programme<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, whereby effective action against illegal immigration is identified as essential in the context of developing a common immigration policy. The Stockholm Programme equally identifies an effective and sustainable return policy as an essential element of a well-managed migration system within the Union.</p>
<p>Concerning readmission agreements, the Hungarian Presidency will closely monitor the progress in the ongoing negotiations, notably with Turkey, Morocco and Cape Verde, as well as arranging for the launching of negotiations with Belarus. To that aim, and with a view to defining a renewed and coherent strategy on readmission, the Presidency will focus on the Commission’s forthcoming evaluation of readmission agreements.</p>
<p>Fostering practical cooperation among Member States will also be a key point in the Hungarian Presidency’s programme in the field of illegal immigration, with special focus on the effective implementation of the Return Directive. In this regard, the work begun under the Belgian Presidency with regard to the issue of facilitating transit by land of third-country nationals who return voluntarily will be taken forward, thus providing humane solutions for the irregular migrants returning voluntarily to their home countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the question of illegally staying third-country nationals falling under the principle of ‘non-refoulement’ is also on the Presidency’s agenda.</p>
<p>Finally, the Hungarian Presidency will pay attention to the EU-wide collection of statistical data on illegal migration. It is essential to have a full picture on all the data collected in this field, and make them available to the Member States, EU institutions and agencies</p>
<p>Finally, work on all aspects of the Global Approach to Migration<a href="#defann_3_2" name="refann_3_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> will be continued. Europe needs a global approach to migration policy, which should benefit society in the home as well as in the host country, and, of course, the migrants themselves. The Presidency believes that the global approach needs to be balanced thematically (including legal immigration, fight against irregular immigration and the promotion of migration and development) and geographically as well. The Hungarian Presidency attaches great importance to the further development of the Prague Process – Building Migration Partnerships<a href="#defann_3_3" name="refann_3_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> – directed to neighbouring eastern and south-eastern countries, by elaborating – jointly with the members of the Process – an Action Plan for the implementation of the Prague Declaration of April 2009 that would define the concrete objectives and activities required for the realisation of the goals set in the Declaration; including on preventing and fighting irregular immigration. The Hungarian Presidency will also focus on the preparations of the 2nd Ministerial Conference in November 2011. The aim of the ministerial conference will be to endorse the Action Plan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The catastrophic earthquake which struck Haiti in January 2010 cost thousands of lives and left an unbearable economic and social situation in the country, which was one of the poorest in the world even before the earthquake. Humanitarian organisations report that, several months after the earthquake, bodies had not been pulled out of the ruins, the sanitary conditions of the population were appalling and humanitarian aid conspicuous by its absence. A cholera epidemic was the logical outcome. The thousands of confirmed victims are adding to the ever-lengthening list of those killed in the earthquake. According to UN (OCHA) information, there is, as usual, a great discrepancy between the aid ‘promised’ and the aid actually delivered.</p>
<p>How much has the EU promised to send to Haiti and how much has it actually delivered to date?

<p>(EN) As the honourable Member is aware, the EU has been at the forefront in responding to both the consequences of the earthquake of 12 January 2010 and the outbreak of the cholera epidemic at the end of October. In coordination with international partners, the EU and its Member States took immediate steps to help the victims by rapidly providing humanitarian emergency assistance and deploying humanitarian and civil protection experts.</p>
<p>At the International Donors’ Conference for the reconstruction of Haiti, held in New York on 31 March 2010, the EU presented a joint pledge of EUR 1.235 billion out of a total amount of USD 5.3 billion pledged by all international donors for the period of 18 months, which has made the EU Haiti’s main donor. After the conference, an additional amount of EUR 62 million out of the EU budget was added, which makes in total EUR 522 million earmarked from the EU budget. So far, the Commission has committed EUR 322 million, out of which EUR 115.4 million have already been contracted, and EUR 62 million disbursed. In addition, the Commission has disbursed a total amount of EUR 57.8 million through general budget support since the earthquake, allowing the Haitian Government to maintain critical expenditure, notably in education, health and security<a href="#defann_5_1" name="refann_5_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Moreover, in support of the long-term reconstruction plan for Haiti and in the context of a joint EU approach linking relief to rehabilitation and development, the EU and Member States are currently in the final stage of identifying common priorities, together with the Haitian Government, with a view to adopting a joint programming document at the beginning of 2011.</p>
<p>In response to the cholera epidemic, the Commission has mobilised EUR 12 million to support DG ECHO partners on the ground, in addition to generous in-cash and in-kind contributions from the Member States. Due to the deteriorating situation in Haiti, the Commission has proposed to the budgetary authorities to scale up its humanitarian assistance with an additional EUR 10 million by transferring appropriations within the humanitarian aid part of the EU budget for 2010.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In particular, agriculture is included in the scope of the directive, as is stated in Article 2(1). According to the directive, the employer shall have a duty to ensure the safety and health of the workers in every aspect related to the work (Article 5(1)), including prevention of occupational risks and provision of information and training, as well as provision of the necessary organisation and means (Article 6(1)). The principle of the responsibility of the employer is not affected by the fact that each worker also has a responsibility to take care, as far as possible, of his own safety and health and that of other persons (Articles 4(3) and 13(1)).</p>

At the same time, the Council called on the Commission to continue to monitor and support the implementation of legislation in all Member States.</p>

<p>(EN) Supporting the economy is one of the cornerstones of the Presidency’s work programme for the coming six months, a period which marks the very first ‘European semester’ for economic policy coordination. In this sense, a comprehensive and coherent approach will be taken to the budgetary, macro-economic and growth- and employment-oriented policies of both Member States and the EU itself, in order to ensure both that financial stability is safeguarded and that all economic policies are conducive to strong and sustainable employment-creating growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, key objectives and initiatives were presented by the Council to the December European Council on implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. These should be reflected in the national reform programmes and may include the five EU headline targets relating to employment, research and development, energy/climate change, education and combating poverty and social exclusion, as well as the way in which the Member States should set and pursue their national targets, including the need to accelerate reforms addressing identified bottlenecks to growth. Member States will submit their national reform programmes in support of the objectives and targets established in the Europe 2020 strategy by April 2011, alongside frontload key growth enhancing structural reforms.</p>
<p>The Single Market, as a driver of growth, is of crucial importance for Europe’s competitiveness in the globalised economy. The Presidency attaches great importance to achieve an agreement on the Single Market package<a href="#defann_10_2" name="refann_10_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Particular attention will be paid to enhancing the labour market integration of young people in the framework of the two flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy, namely ‘Youth on the Move’ and ‘Agenda for New Skills and Jobs’, which aim to improve the employment of young workers and to make easier the transition from education to employment. The work of the Hungarian Presidency in this area will be closely linked to the joint Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Programme<a href="#defann_10_3" name="refann_10_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> since youth employment is a topic of common interest for the Trio.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the basis of the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs<a href="#defann_10_4" name="refann_10_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, the Hungarian Presidency intends to address the possibilities for stronger policies to facilitate an employment friendly recovery and address the issue of regional employment inequalities.</p>
<p>The Hungarian Presidency will invite Ministers to engage in a joint reflection on these issues during the informal meeting of Employment Ministers which will take place on 16-18 January 2011 in Gödöllő.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Belarus still has a considerable way to go in meeting its OSCE commitments on holding elections. The EU recognises the serious problems with the electoral process and the vote count as reported by the OSCE election observation mission and urged the government of Belarus to meet its OSCE commitments to substantially reform the electoral process. The EU regrets the government of Belarus’ decision to terminate the mission of the OSCE’s office in Minsk.</p>
<p>The OSCE has carried out valuable work in the country, in particular, in promoting institution building and the rule of law and supporting the development of civil society. The EU sees this process in great danger.</p>
<p>The EU strongly condemns all acts of violence and repression, especially the use of force against presidential candidates, political activists, representatives of civil society, journalists and demonstrators. The beating and detention of several opposition leaders, including presidential candidates, is unacceptable. Taken together, the elections and their aftermath represent a substantial step backwards in the development of democratic governance and respect for human rights in Belarus. The EU called for the immediate release of the presidential candidates and the more than 600 demonstrators who have been imprisoned in the wake of the presidential elections in Belarus.</p>
<p>Respect for democracy and human rights remain central to improving Belarus’s relations with the EU. Without substantial progress in these areas, relations cannot improve. It is against this background that the EU will be assessing the government of Belarus’s actions to address the current situation and to take developments into account as it reviews relations with Belarus. The EU intends to strengthen its support for and engagement with the people of Belarus and civil society representatives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000006"></a>

<p>Israel’s army and air force have recently escalated their murderous attacks in the Gaza strip, increasing the number of dead and wounded among the Palestinian civilian population, which is suffering from the occupation and from the economic blockade imposed by Israel which even prevents fishermen from putting to sea. The efforts to terrorise the Palestinian people continued unabated throughout the Christmas and New Year period, mainly around the area of the green line and the wall that Israel has built, and there were also bombing raids inside Gaza.

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Council has consistently been calling for a two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where Jerusalem would become a capital of two states. As recently as in December 2010, the Foreign Affairs Council reiterated in its conclusions that ‘urgent progress is needed towards a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We want to see the State of Israel and a sovereign, independent, democratic, contiguous and viable State of Palestine living side by side in peace and security’ and that ‘a way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of two states’.</p>
<p>The issue of Palestinian detainees and prisoners has featured prominently in bilateral contacts between the EU and Israel, for example, within the Informal Working Group on Human Rights, which had its latest meeting in September 2010 and in which the Council actively participates. Specific cases of detention, especially where the detainees could be considered human rights defenders under the EU guidelines, have been dealt with in this working group. Some were also given high visibility by means of statements issued by the office of High Representative, Catherine Ashton. (For example, the statement of the HR spokesperson on Mr Abdullah Abu Rahma of 24 August 2010).</p>
<p>The Israeli policy of blockade against the Gaza Strip has been subject to the Council’s criticism, which described it as ‘unacceptable and politically counterproductive’ (Council conclusions of December 2009, referred to in the December 2010 conclusions). While partial steps by the Israeli Government towards alleviating the policy of closure (most recently on 8 December 2010) are steps in the right direction, more remains to be done.</p>
<p>As regards alleged Israeli actions against civilians, the honourable Member knows that persecution of civilian population by state power, whether directed against a state’s own citizens or otherwise, is contrary to the rule of law and democratic principles in general. By extension, such acts are irreconcilable with basic values of the European Union, notably right to life in safety in security. It is imperative that allegations of such acts be subjected to thorough investigation and, if confirmed, to strong criticism.</p>
<p>Various incidents between Israeli security services and Palestinians as well as in regard to Israeli policies under the occupation regime, the Council has always insisted on respecting international law and including international humanitarian law by both sides. These are principles that the Foreign Affairs Council referred to in its conclusions on the Middle East Peace Process in December 2009 and reiterated as recently as December 2010.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000008"></a>

<p>Last year, Hungary, which has recently taken over the Presidency of the Council, was hit by a major environmental disaster, the red sludge flood. One of the main causes of the disaster was said to be poor maintenance of the facility concerned. The EU does not provide financial assistance to Member States in the event of disasters caused by deliberate human agency or by negligence. If those responsible are short of funds, Member States themselves are often unable to bear the financial consequences of such an accident unassisted.</p>
<p>Does not the Presidency consider that the legal provisions on the planning (particularly in connection with environmental impact assessments), maintenance and operation of installations which pose serious environmental risks should be reviewed and made more stringent? Would it not be desirable to establish a fund in the European Union financed by means of contributions from those with control over installations which pose serious environmental risks, on which it would subsequently be possible to draw to provide compensation for damage caused by environmental disasters attributable to such facilities (similar to the fund voluntarily established by British Petroleum to pay compensation for the consequences of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico)?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) An important body of EU legislation, that should help prevent accidents such as the one which occurred in Hungary, is already in place, in particular, legislation on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and on Management of Waste from Extractive Industries<a href="#defann_13_2" name="refann_13_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. As regards natural disasters, industrial accidents fall under the Environmental Liability Directive<a href="#defann_13_3" name="refann_13_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> which implements the ‘polluter pays’ principle.</p>
<p>The full assessment of the applicability of the existing legislation requires the completion of the analysis of the accident in Kolontàr by the Hungarian authorities and the Commission. Once this process is concluded, it will be possible to evaluate whether any further action regarding EU environmental legislation should be considered. Any conclusions from the Commission in this respect will be examined by the Council without delay.</p>
<p>Concerning the suggestion of the honourable Member to establish a fund to provide compensation for damage caused by deliberate acts or negligence, and financed by operators of installations entailing environmental risks, it has to be noted that it is up to the Commission to consider the possible options in light of the present accident, including the option to enable liable operators to bear the full costs of major accidents.</p>
<p>As far as the Solidarity Fund of the European Union is concerned, the Commission suggested in 2006 to review Council Regulation No 2012/2002<a href="#defann_13_4" name="refann_13_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.

<p>(EN) The Commission strongly supports the roll-out of high speed broadband across Europe and has undertaken a number of actions to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>The investment needed for broadband infrastructure will largely come from the private sector. In addition, the Commission encourages Member States to support the roll-out of broadband networks with public and EU funds where the business case for private investment is weak.</p>
<p>Just in 2010, the Commission has assessed and approved the use of almost EUR 1.8 billion of State aid for broadband development in the European Union capable of generating EUR 3-3.5 billion of investment in this sector<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Concerning Ireland, the Commission has so far assessed and approved 3 State aid broadband measures in the country and authorised the use of more than EUR 250 million in this sector<a href="#defann_14_2" name="refann_14_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, as well as the joint Project Kelvin<a href="#defann_14_3" name="refann_14_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> of Ireland and Northern Ireland, aiming to bring a direct international link through a submarine cable to the North West of Ireland.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission is working closely with the European Investment Bank to identify innovative financing solutions for the next Multiannual Financial Framework that could broaden the investment horizon to include, through credit and maturity enhancement, higher risk profile projects in less populated geographic areas.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Commission will also issue guidance for local and regional authorities on the use of EU funds for broadband project design and preparation and will adopt investment guidelines on broadband for local and regional authorities to facilitate full absorption of EU funds. In addition, by 2013, the Commission will reinforce and rationalise the use of funding of high-speed broadband through EU instruments under the current financial framework (e.g. ERDF, ERDP, EAFRD, TEN, CIP).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) For the last 5 years, the NAIADES Action Programme inspired the Commission’s inland shipping policy and will continue to do so for another 3 years. NAIADES addresses, in the first place, a series of legislative, policy and coordination measures, originating from current policies and the existing regulatory framework, and aiming at enhanced framework conditions for the sector and its consolidation. We can already see an increase in the share of inland waterway in the overall transport.</p>
<p>It is obvious that such a programme cannot be pursued at EU level alone, but requires also the commitment of Member States and the inland navigation sector as well as an appropriate implementation at national level.</p>
<p>NAIADES was meant as a medium to long-term policy programme that aims at making better use of relevant funding programmes such as TEN-T and Marco Polo. However, NAIADES is not a financial support programme with its own financial resources.</p>
<p>The second progress report on NAIADES summarising the main achievements in the five priority areas up to now will be published in the first half of 2011. As regards the remaining period 2011-2013, the Commission intends to continue with the implementation of NAIADES along already defined lines.</p>
<p>But the Commission also needs to ensure the long-term development and successful implementation of a European inland waterway transport policy beyond 2013. Therefore, it intends to bring forward a proposal for a continuation programme in due time, embedded in the wider strategic policy framework as defined by the forthcoming White Paper and developing further successful activities and reflecting on possible ‘lessons learnt’ where necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0633"></a>

<p>Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 came into force as long ago as 2005, with the key aim of ensuring that airline passengers were protected and properly informed. The Commission has run its own awareness-raising campaigns on the subject, yet airlines repeatedly violate the regulation, leaving passengers without swift and effective remedies. Meanwhile, online booking has turned into a racket: a ticket from Brussels to Strasbourg with an ordinary carrier, advertised and heavily promoted at the price of EUR 98, ends up costing a total of EUR 219.60, including something called a ‘fuel fee’!</p>

<p>(EN) First, let the Commission remind that the correct application of Regulation No 261/2004 on air passengers’ rights must be ensured by the designated National Enforcement Bodies. These National Enforcement Bodies (NEBs) have to take all reasonable measures to ensure that the rights of passengers are fully respected. The Commission constantly monitors their activity to ensure that EU law is correctly implemented and enforced by the Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission can assure the honourable Member that it is ready to intervene if there is a pattern of cases which shows that a Member State is failing to enforce the regulation. The Commission has been working in close cooperation with NEBs to improve the application of the regulation, notably through common interpretation, exchange of information on enforcement, exchange of best practices and further harmonisation of working tools as statistics on sanctions and complaints. In 2010, the Commission has encouraged several joint NEB actions against carriers, which greatly contributed to ensuring the successful harmonised correction of any improper practice.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission would like to recall that means of redress are available to passengers. The National authorities are also in charge of handling complaints from passengers and to issue a motivated opinion, albeit not binding, on the circumstances of the passenger’s individual case. Furthermore, air passengers always retain the right to seek redress via a court procedure. In this context, they may benefit from the European procedure of settlement of small disputes: a simplified, accelerated and cheaper court procedure for small cross-border disputes. They should also be able to benefit from the work of the Commission in the area of collective redress. Further initiatives of the Commission in the field of consumer protection will also help passengers. For instance, the future legislative proposal on ADR – Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms under the responsibility of the Commissioner in charge of Health and Consumer Policy, foreseen in the Commission Work Programme for the end of 2011, will improve the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms as an easy, low cost and quick way of resolving disputes out of court.</p>
<p>Finally, the honourable Member raises the issue of the price indications given during the booking process. Regulation No 1008/2008 on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community provides for price transparency rules: the final price to be paid shall, at all times, be indicated, including in advertisements; it shall include the applicable air fare as well as applicable taxes, charges, surcharges and fees which are unavoidable and foreseeable at the time of publication. This also includes the so-called fuel surcharge that you mention. The Commission is monitoring this important question very closely, in close cooperation with the national authorities in charge of enforcement in the Members States. In 2011, the Commission will undertake a deeper review on the matter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0643"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU-supported study to conduct variant-independent research into upgrading works on the Danube between Straubing and Vilshofen is of particular importance in the effort to identify a generally acceptable way out of this long deadlock. A deadlock that prevents inland waterways transport – in this part of the transcontinental connection – from fulfilling its potential as a particularly sustainable mode of transport, in both environmental and economic terms.</p>
<p>Developing inland waterways transport in a sound and sustainable manner helps lower the pressure on road transport – emissions, noise, congestion – and, in this specific case, also contributes to a better linking of regions, economies and people along one of the main natural connections of our continent (East-West, North-South).</p>
<p>It should be stressed in passing that economic development without proper care for environmental realities also poses undue economic risks, whilst fundamental blindness to sustainable and balanced solutions may entail serious environmental risks, such as from modal backshift, among other things.</p>
<p>On the Bavarian stretch of the Danube, between these two cities, the depth of the river is not sufficient for a reliable and economically viable navigation throughout the year. For two decades, inland waterway operators and environmental organisations have been debating on how to improve the navigability of the Danube.</p>
<p>Environmental organisations would favour the so-called ‘Variant A’ in order to preserve the last free-flowing section of the middle section of the Danube River, through the consolidation of the river banks for flood protection.</p>
<p>Transport operators object that this is the only section, from the Dutch border on the Rhine to the Austrian border on the Danube, where inland waterways transport cannot be ensured throughout the year as required. Transport operators therefore supported the so-called Variant C-280 that would ensure a draught of 2.80 metres throughout the year, but requiring the construction of a lock.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this stalemate, the German Government launched, together with the Land of Bavaria, a three-year study to explore possible alternative solutions to these two opposing Variants. At the suggestion of the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) Coordinator, Mrs K Peijs, a Monitoring Group to accompany the study was set up in January 2010 with the agreement of both parties: it is composed of nine prominent persons, four from the environmental side and four from the operator’s side, chaired by an independent Professor, Hans-Joachim Koch, from the University of Hamburg.</p>
<p>The Group has met several times since its formation in March 2010 and work progresses. It is expected that the study will produce valuable and fully transparent results in 2012, supporting the regional and national authorities in developing economically and environmentally sustainable inland waterways transport on the Danube.</p>
<p>Recent newspaper articles in the Bavarian/German press alleged that the implication of the Rhein-Main-Donau (RMD) company was impairing the transparency and the neutrality of the study. The Commission has been informed by the Monitoring Group Chairman that he has no reason to believe that the study is not performed correctly.</p>
<p>The subject of the study is to find an acceptable solution independent from the previous assessment and, by its very nature, will have to be in the interests of all parties concerned, including RMD.</p>
<p>The Commission is also aware of statements made by the German Transport Minister, Mr Ramsauer, as have other concerned parties in the matter. In the Commission’s view, such statements do not impair the proper results of the study but contribute to useful transparency in the discussion.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0645"></a>

Consequently, we should be able to minimise the potential disruption in case of future events of this kind.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue the work on all actions proposed in its information note of 27 April 2010 and endorsed by the extraordinary Transport Council of 4 May 2010, as well as other activities where European contribution is deemed necessary, notably the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)’s International Volcanic Ash Task Force.</p>
<p>In particular, we need to build greater resilience into our transport system to preserve the mobility of passengers and goods in case of disruptive events.

<p>(EN) Today, there is no EU legislation on the regular use of security scanners at EU airports. Member States can only use security scanners as a trial for a limited period of time, as a more stringent measure or as a demonstration. Therefore, the use of scanners does not currently fall under the Commission’s inspection programme.</p>
<p>In the context of the preparation of the impact assessment on the use of security scanners in the autumn of 2010, the Commission has been informed that security scanners based on different technologies are or have been used at the following EU airports: Amsterdam Schiphol, London Heathrow, Manchester, Helsinki, Hamburg and Paris Charles de Gaulle. On the basis of this information, X-ray security scanners are currently in use in London Heathrow and Manchester. The Commission is also aware that demonstrations of security scanners took place in Rome Fiumicino, Venice, Milan Malpensa, Palermo and Copenhagen airports, However, the Commission has not received any official confirmation from the appropriate Italian and Danish authorities.</p>
<p>To date, the Commission does not have an up-to-date overview of precise national rules that apply to maintenance controls to protect passengers from health risks at security screening check points. However, conditions for health protection enshrined in EU and EURATOM legislation apply.</p>
<p>In particular, as regards the use of X-ray equipment, security scanners like any other equipment using ionising radiation, need to respect the legal provisions set for their use. Indeed, the risk of long-term health effects from exposure to ionising radiation, albeit very small at low doses, is well known. For this reason, all equipment shall respect the provisions of Directive 96/29/Euratom<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, including the application of the following main principles, namely:</p>
<p>justification of the equipment’s use before being first put in operation regarding its economic, social or other benefits in relation to the health detriment it may cause;</p>
<p>optimisation of protection to ensure that the radiation doses from the practice are kept as low as reasonably achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account;</p>
<p>limitation of the exposure to ensure that the sum of the doses from all relevant practices will not exceed the legal dose limits for workers or the general public.</p>
<p>Ensuring compliance with the above provisions falls under the responsibility of the national authorities.</p>

<p>(EN) Air travel and, to a lesser extent, land transport in December 2010 was heavily disrupted throughout Europe. Many of our larger hubs partially closed during one of the busiest weekends of the year: the beginning of the Christmas holidays. Overall, thousands of flights were cancelled and tens of thousands of people were stranded at airports, not to speak about major luggage handling problems. It is the Commission’s duty to minimise the impact of these extreme weather conditions if these were to happen again. The Commission is, however, very pleased that no accident occurred and that safety was ensured.</p>
<p>Concerning the improvement of the overall transport network in case of crisis, the Commission also plans to use the existing work that has been carried out in the aftermath of the ash cloud crisis of April 2010: the Commission has been reflecting upon ways to ensure operators or Member States have mobility plans for passengers and goods to be applied in case of a sudden transport crisis. In this context, the Commission submitted a list of questions to Member States during the last Transport Council of 2 December 2010.</p>
<p>First, we have to learn from what happened. As Commissioner Kallas, responsible for Transport, announced in December 2010, he will meet on 19 January 2011with airport representatives to discuss precisely what happened and what could be done to avoid similar situations in the future. The Commission is, of course, open to discuss any solutions that would avoid a repetition of the events in December 2010.</p>
<p>The Commission’s services will also work together with Member States’ authorities and take this opportunity to welcome those Member States that offered to share their findings with the Commission and that supported action at EU level if necessary.</p>
<p>Based on these discussions, the Commissioner in charge of Transport will see if there is a need for the Commission to propose new measures. If so, he will not hesitate to take action. The Airport package that he will present later in 2011 will be very important.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to build on other planned initiatives. The upcoming revision of the Air Passenger Rights Regulation could be an opportunity to improve the communication with passengers as well as the re-routing of stranded passengers, for instance, by temporarily suspending night curfew restrictions.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to work hard to improve the European air travel system to ensure that European citizens will not have to go through a similar experience again.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0627"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission understands the concerns of the honourable Members. Similar preoccupations have been expressed by other Members of Parliament, Member States and European industry.</p>
<p>The EU advocates an ambitious approach to the opening up of the global procurement markets. For this reason, the EU is a party to the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), which opens up the public procurements markets of the world’s most developed nations. In addition, the EU has concluded free trade agreements with a procurement chapter with a number of trading partners (including, for example, Chile, Mexico, Korea and Switzerland), which open the procurement markets of these partners on a reciprocal basis.</p>
<p>However, the EU has no international commitments vis-à-vis China in the area of public procurement. As a consequence, China and its suppliers do not have the right to be treated equally to the EU’s GPA partners.</p>
<p>Since China is currently negotiating accession to the GPA, this situation could change in the coming years. In the context of the accession process, the EU requests China to commit to setting ambitious market access goals. In parallel with these negotiations, the Commission is conducting an intensive dialogue with China aiming at the improvement of the Chinese regulatory procurement framework to render it GPA compliant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission has announced in its Communications ‘Towards a Single Market Act’<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and ‘Trade, Growth and World Affairs’<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> that it will present in 2011 a legislative proposal clarifying the international market access commitments of the EU in the field of public procurement. The objective of this proposal will be to restore equal competition on the internal market and ensure an increased leverage of the EU in international negotiations. It will also clarify the position of third countries (and their suppliers) which have not subscribed to any international commitments vis-à-vis the EU in this field and will be based on reciprocity.

<p>(EN) Coastal erosion seriously affects around 25% of the European coasts<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The problem is likely to increase due to climate change impacts, such as sea level rise and more frequent and intense storm surges. Moreover, increasing coastal development may interfere with natural sediment processes or augment the assets and population at risk of coastal erosion or flooding. The pan-European study EUROSION<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> established the extent of the coastal erosion problem in Europe and provided guidance, case studies and policy concepts to address coastal erosion more effectively. In 2010, the CONSCIENCE<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> project elaborated the policy concepts further and recommended ways to implement them. Furthermore, projects and studies confirm that the financial costs of coastal defence and adaptation measures are significant. Prevention and early adaptation to climate risk are shown to be cost-effective policy options<a href="#defann_25_4" name="refann_25_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. The Commission’s 2009 White Paper on adaptation to climate change<a href="#defann_25_5" name="refann_25_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> addresses coastal risks, including coastal erosion and proposes action to increase the resilience of coastal and marine areas. Work is now underway to ensure that adaptation in coastal areas is included in the framework of the Integrated Maritime Policy.</p>
<p>The research confirms that a comprehensive and integrated approach is needed to address coastal erosion risk adequately. The basis for such an integrated approach is provided by the 2002 Parliament and Council Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)<a href="#defann_25_6" name="refann_25_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>. Also, other existing EU instruments, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment Directives<a href="#defann_25_7" name="refann_25_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> and the Floods Directive<a href="#defann_25_8" name="refann_25_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> are important to reduce coastal erosion risk. For the Mediterranean coastal zones, the EU ratified the ICZM Protocol to the Barcelona Convention<a href="#defann_25_9" name="refann_25_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a> in September 2010. The Protocol includes specific stipulations on coastal erosion.</p>
<p>The Commission will take the problem of coastal risk into account in the impact assessment for a follow-up to the ICZM Recommendation, envisaged for the end of 2011. Given that spatial planning is identified as an important tool to reduce vulnerability in coastal areas, the impact assessment considers both coastal management and maritime spatial planning (MSP)<a href="#defann_25_10" name="refann_25_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a>. In the meantime, the Commission continues to support the exchange of experience and best practice in the implementation of ICZM through the OURCOAST initiative<a href="#defann_25_11" name="refann_25_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a>. The initiative will deliver an interactive database with at least 350 cases and guidance on specific topics and ICZM principles, including adaptation to risks and climate change.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is carrying out a number of measures in order to fully implement an EU framework for the prevention of disasters, as proposed by the Communication on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters adopted in February 2009<a href="#defann_25_12" name="refann_25_12"><sup>(12)</sup></a> and enhanced by the Council<a href="#defann_25_13" name="refann_25_13"><sup>(13)</sup></a>. Within this framework, the Commission issued, on 21 December 2010<a href="#defann_25_14" name="refann_25_14"><sup>(14)</sup></a>, a guidance paper on national risk assessment and mapping for disaster management, which was developed together with the national authorities of the Member States. The ‘Risk Assessment and Mapping Guidelines for Disaster Management’ aim to enhance coherence and comparability between risks assessments developed at national level in the Member States. The non-binding guidelines, based on a multi-hazard and multi-risk approach, give orientation on matters of terminology, the involvement of different sectors and stakeholders, and the most useful methods and concepts.</p>
<p>Further to the White Paper on Adaptation to climate change, the Commission is also developing an Adaptation Clearinghouse, to be operational by early 2012, that will cover key policy sectors, including coastal areas. The aim of the clearinghouse is to enhance the uptake of knowledge by national, regional or local decision makers, by offering guidance, tools and best practices for assessments of vulnerability to climate change at different geographical levels. Building on the implementation of the White Paper, the Commission will, by 2013, develop a comprehensive EU Adaptation Strategy.</p>
<p>Regarding funding opportunities, the 2007-2013 Cohesion Policy will invest about EUR 5.8 billion in natural risk prevention. In accordance with the principle of ‘shared management’, it is up to the Member States to select and implement the co-funded projects based on the priorities set in the relevant Operational Programmes. In this framework, coastal protection activities might be supported. As regards Portugal, EUR 513 684 600 are planned to be invested in ‘risk prevention’ through its Operational Programmes of the 2007-13 Cohesion Policy. The Atlantic transnational programme supports ANCORIM (Atlantic network for coastal risk management)<a href="#defann_25_15" name="refann_25_15"><sup>(15)</sup></a>, which includes Portuguese partners.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is very much aware of the difficult situation Member States are confronted with in tackling irregular migration.</p>
<p>The Commission is concerned especially by the situation in Greece at its land border with Turkey where currently, 90% of detected irregular crossings of migrants along the EU’s external borders take place.</p>
<p>It should be underlined that the responsibility for controlling the external borders in accordance with the requirements set out by European law, notably, the Schengen Border Code, lies entirely with the Member States. Greece, like any other Member State, therefore has to do its utmost in order to meet those requirements.</p>
<p>However, the European Union should demonstrate solidarity and assist the Member States in its efforts to bring irregular migration under control.</p>
<p>With this objective, the EU is promoting a number of initiatives such as the joint operations and supporting concrete projects through the allocation of financial resources under the relevant Funds (External Borders Fund, European Refugee Fund and Return Fund).</p>
<p>Greece has been the main ‘beneficiary’ of FRONTEX operational activities in 2010, hosting joint operations at its land and maritime borders in order to increase the efficiency of border management (including surveillance, checks and identification of irregular immigrants with a view to their return with due respect for any potential need for protection). Due to the exceptional pressure of irregular immigration at its external borders, Greece requested on 24 October 2010 the assistance of Rapid Border Intervention Teams (RABITs) and a decision to deploy these teams was taken shortly after. The deployment of RABITs has already had a deterrent effect and it is estimated that there has been an overall decrease of 43% in the number of irregular migrants intercepted at the Greek-Turkish land border.</p>
<p>In tackling irregular migration, it is of vital importance to work with countries of origin and transit. Therefore, the Commission encourages Member States and FRONTEX to develop practical cooperation with those countries.</p>
<p>Concretely, this could involve initiatives such as the exchange of information on the modus operandi of irregular migrants and facilitators, the development of common risk analyses with regard to movements of irregular migrants, the appointment of contact points in FRONTEX and in the third countries’ authorities for the purpose of a continuous, operational exchange of information and cooperation with regard to returning irregular immigrants.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is also actively developing direct dialogue and cooperation with all the countries of origin and transit of migration, in order to persuade them to increase their efforts to prevent and combat irregular migration and to readmit the irregular migrants having transited through their territory.</p>
<p>With reference to the countries mentioned by the honourable Member, in particular, the Commission is taking concrete initiatives with all of them. The Commission is negotiating a readmission agreement with Morocco, is making serious efforts to start negotiations on a readmission agreement with Algeria, has proposed that Tunisia accepts the inclusion of provisions related to cooperation on the readmission of irregular migrants into the new EU-Tunisia Action Plan, and the readmission agreement with Pakistan, which the Commission successfully negotiated with this country on behalf of the European Union, entered into force on 1 December 2010.</p>
<p>Within this context, particular attention is paid to Turkey, a country through which a large amount of irregular migrants and asylum seekers transit towards the European Union coming from origin countries in Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>As a candidate for accession to the European Union, Turkey is expected to make particular efforts to enhance its policies and legislation in the areas of border, migration and asylum management, as well as the administrative capacities of its relevant authorities, in line with the European Union standards. The Commission closely monitors the progress made by Turkey in developing its capacities, and is providing important financial and technical assistance in this endeavour. Meanwhile, the Commission continues to negotiate a readmission agreement with Turkey on behalf of the European Union, while FRONTEX is negotiating a working arrangement with Turkish authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0642"></a>

The Communication already indicates that among the objectives of the centre will be to ‘build operational and analytical capacity for investigations and cooperation with international partners. The centre will improve evaluation and monitoring of existing preventive and investigative measures, support the development of training and awareness-raising for law enforcement and judiciary, establish cooperation with the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) and interface with a network of national/governmental Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). The cybercrime centre should become the focal point in Europe’s fight against cybercrime’<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

<p>After a protracted procedure, all the EU institutions finally came to an agreement on the EU budget for 2011. The EP had to back down from its initial request for a budget increase of more than 6% compared to 2010. The final compromise proposal keeps the budget increase at 2.91%, a total of €126.5 billion, despite the fact that new structures, such as the European External Action Service, will have to be financed from this small increase.</p>
<p>Can the Commission elaborate how these appropriations for 2011 will affect payments for Lithuanian farmers, as well as those from other EU Member States? Could the Commission provide exact figures?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission would like to thank the honourable Member for asking this question, which enables it to highlight the fact that the budget adopted in December 2010 by Parliament and the Council will not affect payments for farmers in Lithuania, or for those in any other Member State of the European Union.</p>
<p>In reality, the approved budget integrated the amending letter adopted by the Commission on 20 October 2010. In that amending letter, the Commission included the latest estimates for agricultural expenditure – markets and direct payments.</p>
<p>The budget has been drafted for the EU-27 as a whole and not per Member State. Nonetheless, the Commission can inform the honourable Member that, for Lithuania, the budget line for the SAPS includes a sum of EUR 262 million.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
