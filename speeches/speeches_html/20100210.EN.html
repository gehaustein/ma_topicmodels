<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diego López Garrido, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like to begin by reiterating the firm commitment of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to the enlargement of the European Union. Our work in this respect will follow the line of the renewed consensus on enlargement approved at the December 2006 European Council and the Council conclusions of 8 December 2009, which have also been endorsed by the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As highlighted in this House’s resolution, which we are now going to debate, the first half of this year will be crucial for the negotiations with Croatia. They have entered their final phase, yet much remains to be done before we can reach a successful conclusion. We are going to have to look at difficult chapters such as those on competition, fisheries, the judiciary and fundamental rights, the environment, and foreign security and defence policy. We will also have to close provisionally some chapters with financial implications.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, a great deal of work lies ahead. New Commissioner, Štefan Füle, who was a former colleague of mine when I was Europe Minister – and I would like to welcome him and congratulate him on his appointment – is going to be extremely busy with the enlargement issue as far as Croatia is concerned, because as soon as next week, we plan to hold an initial intergovernmental conference at ministerial level to open the chapters on fisheries and the environment, two very important chapters that, as you can imagine, will require an enormous amount of work and dedication.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to remind you about the conclusions on Croatia adopted by the Council in December. You are already aware of them but I would like to highlight a number of points. The Council commended Croatia for the considerable efforts it had made over the past year and the good overall progress made. It also referred to a series of financial measures for Croatia’s accession negotiations and noted that the negotiations were entering their final phase.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council underlined that building on the progress already made, Croatia still had to make significant improvements in fundamental spheres such as the judicial system, public administration, and the fight against corruption and organised crime. It also needs to guarantee the rights of persons belonging to minorities, including the return of refugees and prosecution of war crimes, in order to build up a convincing track record in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council noted, too, Croatia’s cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, although it felt that further efforts were necessary. We believe that we could achieve new goals in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we also welcomed the signing of the arbitration agreement on the contentious border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia. The agreement was signed on 4 November in Stockholm and ratified by the Croatian Parliament on 20 November. The Council encouraged Croatia to build on these efforts in order to solve all outstanding bilateral issues, especially border disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also welcomed the creation in December, just over a month ago, of a working group to prepare the draft Accession Treaty of Croatia. Finally, implementation of the revised Accession Partnership will be crucial when preparing for the country’s eventual integration into the EU. As I said, we have a great deal of work ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this is a joint debate on Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey, I would like to state that the Western Balkans are one of the European Union’s main priorities. Stability in that region is vitally important to us, and in 2010, we are going to see a number of milestones in the region’s transition: progress on the applications for accession – as we have just discussed – fresh impetus for the network of Stabilisation and Association agreements, closer regional cooperation and progress towards a more liberal visa regime.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the prospect of joining the Union – what we call the European perspective of the Western Balkans – is the most important catalyst for stability and reform in these countries. It is undoubtedly a prospect, a real prospect, but it is not an automatic right.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I would like to begin with a summary of the country’s general situation and I will refer to the European Parliament’s resolution, for which the rapporteur was Mr Zoran Thaler. The resolution does a very good job of presenting a dynamic situation, full of possibilities for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It highlights many of the challenges facing the country: widespread failure to comply with the law, corruption, implementation of the recommendations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, allocation of funds for effective decentralisation, access to justice, greater participation of women in political life, support for civil society organisations, persistently high unemployment, environmental problems, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution underlines the importance of having a timetable for the opening of negotiations as well as the common desire to find, as soon as possible, an acceptable solution to the issue of the country’s name, which, as you know, is currently the subject of a dispute with Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few comments in relation to events you refer to in your resolution, such as the local elections in March and April – which the OSCE considered to have met the standards laid down – and the sixth meeting of the Stabilisation and Association Council, held in July 2009, which we concluded and which revealed that the country was truly fulfilling the commitments it had made under that agreement. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has continued to work on its relations with the European Union, which is why the European Commission stated that it had made real progress and recommended that accession negotiations be opened.</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusions last December, the Council acknowledged the progress referred to by the Commission and agreed to return to the matter in the next few months. The European Parliament, as you know, has taken note of these Council conclusions of 8 December 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, 19 December saw the entry into force of the visa-free regime, in accordance with the Schengen system, for citizens of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also mention a number of specific points relating to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: inter-ethnic relations, differences of opinion between Macedonian Slavs over the ‘antiquity’ of the country and differences of opinion over its relations with neighbouring countries. All of these topics are reflected in various sections of Parliament’s resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, I would like to say that some aspects warrant close attention, beyond the mere adoption and application of laws; some issues fall under the auspices of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, some are purely national matters, and some relate to neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European institutions believe that the future of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia involves membership of the European Union and that such aspirations will have to take the shape of full national integration, in accordance with the Ohrid Framework Agreement. This is what the European Union believes and will continue to believe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to look in greater detail at the state of Turkey’s negotiations and to present the Spanish Presidency’s plans for this important enlargement issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important – and I want to say this at the outset – that we continue the negotiations with Turkey, that we keep the process on track. Building on the work of previous presidencies, we hope to convince everyone of the need to move this process forward where possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations have entered a phase which we could say is somewhat more complicated or somewhat more problematic, which requires Turkey to redouble its efforts to meet the conditions laid down. A number of technically difficult negotiating chapters await us. However, it is important – and I want to say this at the outset, too – that Turkey makes progress on the reforms concerning the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, as the new Commissioner knows all too well, the technical work is focusing on four negotiating chapters: public procurement; competition; food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy; and social policy and employment. We must stress that the energy chapter is also important and it has become especially relevant following the signing of the Nabucco Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">At its last part-session, Parliament debated Turkey and, in particular, the country’s democratisation. There is a contrast between, on the one hand, the process of democratic initiative, as the Turkish Government calls it, and, on the other, some worrying decisions such as the recent decision by the Constitutional Court concerning the ban on a political party, which has also been mentioned here and is a very sensitive topic.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in spite of the progress made, further efforts to ensure that Turkey fully meets the Copenhagen criteria are required in a number of areas, including freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of religion in law and in practice for all religious communities, respect for property rights, trade union rights, rights of persons belonging to minorities, civilian supervision of the military, women’s and children’s rights, and anti-discrimination and gender equality measures. This is clearly reflected in both Parliament’s resolution and the Council conclusions of 8 December.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention some other aspects of the Council conclusions. For example, the Council stressed that Turkey needs to commit itself unequivocally to good neighbourly relations and to the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter, having recourse, if necessary, to the International Court of Justice. In this context, the Union urged Turkey – as we have done in the bilateral meetings with Turkey – to avoid any kind of threat, source of friction or actions that could damage good neighbourly relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also noted with deep regret that Turkey has yet to implement the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement, the so-called Ankara Protocol, and that it has not made sufficient progress towards normalisation of its relations with the Republic of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first half of 2010, in the Association Council and the Association Committee with Turkey, we will have a chance to assess the development of our relations; it will be a good opportunity to examine significant problems, such as the political criteria, the progress made in adapting national legislation and the application of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also planned a series of political dialogue meetings at ministerial level, between political leaders, that will enable us to look at our relations in the wider international context. In this respect, the Council expects Turkey to support the ongoing negotiations within the UN framework on the issue that I just referred to, namely the Cyprus problem, in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and in line with the principles on which the Union is founded.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to hearing your views and will respond to any comments or questions you might like to put to me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also think that it is an excellent turn of events that the very first debate in this high House with a new Commission is taking place on enlargement. Thirdly, I am delighted that the European Parliament expressed its strong support for enlargement in three reports.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolutions are proof of the commitment of the European Parliament to the accession prospects of Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey. This is a clear signal that enlargement will continue to be a top priority of the European Parliament and, together with my colleagues, I will do my utmost to bring this success story forward. I am very glad that my friend, Secretary of State López Garrido, has just reconfirmed full support for this process on behalf of the Council and its Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">On Croatia, I appreciate Parliament’s fair and balanced report and would like to congratulate Mr Hannes Swoboda, the rapporteur. The report highlights the progress achieved by Croatia in meeting the criteria for accession but, at the same time, recognises the efforts that are still necessary for concluding the negotiations. Your report thus reinforces the messages and supports the work undertaken by the Commission. Let me underline that closure of negotiations in 2010 is still possible, provided that Croatia progresses in fulfilling all outstanding benchmarks. The ball is clearly in Croatia’s court.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia has come a long way over recent years but important challenges still remain to be tackled. Here, we share a common assessment. Croatia needs to focus, in particular, on the further reform of its judiciary and public administration, the fight against corruption and organised crime, respect for minority rights including refugee return, as well as war crimes trials and full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">We are encouraged by recent developments in fighting corruption. We hope that investigation into wrongdoing leads to concrete results. As for cooperation with the ICTY, which is a fundamental requirement, Chief Prosecutor Brammertz confirmed that full cooperation has still not been achieved. However, he acknowledged recent positive steps such as the setting up of the task force aimed at stepping up investigation efforts. I hope that the work of the task force will soon produce concrete results. Finally, the arbitration agreement of November 2009 between Slovenia and Croatia on the handling of the bilateral border issue has started a new momentum in the negotiations process which, I trust, Croatia will be able to seize by intensifying its efforts to address the remaining outstanding issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 2009 was a good year as regards its reform process. Thanks to political consensus between all the main political forces, the country was able to make significant progress in key areas. It achieved visa liberalisation, and the Commission could recommend starting accession negotiations. I am glad to see that there is a strong consensus between Parliament and the Commission that accession negotiations should start, as expressed in Mr Thaler’s constructive and forward-looking report. Now the challenge for the country is to maintain the reform momentum.</p>
<p class="contents">While the country met the political criteria, there is still much work to be done. A shared vision of the future and effective political dialogue between the political forces will be crucial to ensuring progress. Continued efforts are needed in particular on fully implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement and improving inter-ethnic relations, ensuring the rule of law and an independent judiciary, and successfully prosecuting high-level corruption cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic crisis has not left the country untouched. Unfortunately, the country was already suffering one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe. Now, more than ever, prudent macro-economic management and active labour market measures are needed to contain, and then reduce unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Like you, I am convinced that the start of accession negotiations is key to maintaining the reform momentum in the country. Equally important, it will enhance the European perspective for the wider region. It is therefore in the strategic interest of the European Union. This is the message which I will be putting forward to the Member States and to the country so as to take the process forward.</p>
<p class="contents">On Turkey, I would like to thank your rapporteur, Ms Oomen-Ruijten, for her continued efforts towards a fair and balanced approach in her report on Turkey. The Commission remains committed to the accession process with Turkey as this process gives strong encouragement to political and economic reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Work on the political criteria remains of the utmost importance, in particular, as regards fundamental freedoms. A number of landmark reforms have been carried out in the past year. Some of them were next to impossible only a few years ago. Last week, the security protocol that allowed the army to intervene without authorisation in the case of security threats was annulled. This is a landmark achievement in civilian-military relations. We will observe closely the follow-up of this conciliation. The submission of a draft law setting up an independent human rights institution and the much awaited anti-corruption strategy, adopted in principle by the Turkish Government on 21 January, are also promising.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue to support the democratic opening launched by the government. The success of this initiative requires the participation and support of all political parties and all segments of society. However, the Commission has concerns following the decision of the Constitutional Court to close the pro-Kurdish party represented in Parliament, the DTP. We also regret the arrests that took place in the south-east at the end of December. We condemn the terrorist attacks that took place at the same time. None of these developments is really conducive to the successful implementation of the democratic opening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These statements indicate that both the Council and the Commission have the determination to complete this process as quickly as possible. I also agree with Mr Füle that it is possible to complete the negotiations with Croatia this year, given the necessary good will and the appropriate policies. Of course, it is also Croatia’s responsibility, in particular, to take the decisive steps.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say at this point that Croatia has made considerable progress, particularly in recent months and with regard to corruption. Croatia has shown that no one is outside the law or exempt from measures to combat corruption. This sends out an important signal. Croatia has also come to an agreement with Slovenia and has ratified the agreement relatively quickly in parliament, which shows that there is a strong shared determination to meet the necessary requirements. I hope that the same thing will happen soon in Slovenia. I am convinced that the Slovenian Government fully supports the agreement and I hope that the domestic political problems can soon be resolved and that the agreement can be ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is still some work to be done. The point has already been made that the fight against corruption is an important element. However, the situation will not change overnight. There are many unresolved issues in this area, but I am certain that the government and the relevant public bodies have the will to continue this fight without exerting political influence.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the reform of the judiciary, this is not only about combating corruption, but also about a number of other issues, such as training for judges. Several steps need to be taken by Croatia to establish a modern judicial system and I hope that this will happen soon.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the collaboration with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Mr Füle has given us an accurate and complex description of the situation. Mr Brammertz has assured the Committee on Foreign Affairs that a great deal is being done. It is only a case of finding some documents relating to the case against General Gotovina, but Mr Brammertz himself has said that he does not know whether these documents still exist or whether they have already been destroyed. It may be that some of them have never existed. Nevertheless, I hope that Croatia does everything in its power in this respect. I would like the task force mentioned by Mr Füle to have broad support from experts from other countries, without giving automatic approval in advance to the efforts made by Croatia. However, I believe that a great deal of progress has been made in this area. I hope that the few small items outstanding will be completed in the next few weeks or months in order to convince Mr Brammertz that he is receiving full cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has also been achieved with regard to the return of refugees or internally displaced persons. There are still a few problems at a detailed level which are relatively difficult to solve. When people have fled from houses that did not belong to them, where they were tenants, such as the social housing which existed in the former Yugoslavia, it is difficult to organise their return and ensure that they have a home again. Although a lot of people want to return in principle, as a result of the economic crisis and unemployment, when they arrive in regions where there are already high levels of unemployment, it may not actually be practical for them to return in such large numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that a great deal of progress has been made in this area. I am convinced that the current government and, I hope, also the opposition will work together to take the final steps. It has become clear over and over again in Croatia in recent months that a joint approach to European issues is the decisive factor. There must be widespread determination to solve the outstanding problems and, despite internal differences, to make it clear that the path leads to Europe and that Croatia must arrive there as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zoran Thaler, </span></span>  <span class="italic">author. </span>– <span class="italic">(SL)</span> 2009 was a good year for the candidate country of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). The Commission of the European Union has confirmed this and the two presidencies-in-office, both the Swedish and now the Spanish one, have confirmed this. And that is what I, too, have said in my draft report.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities in Skopje have addressed and fulfilled the key priorities of the accession partnership, commonly known as benchmarks. Secondly, FYROM was the first country in the region to comply with all the visa liberalisation requirements. It did so by as early as July last year and the visa-free regime came into force on 19 December. It has solved the border dispute with Kosovo and has cooperated successfully on regional initiatives, such as CEFTA and the South-East European Cooperation Process. It has also cooperated successfully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Hague. Last week, the FYROM Parliament passed a resolution on Srebrenica.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we trying to achieve in Parliament with this resolution and with my report on FYROM’s progress? Above all, we want to help. We want to help FYROM progress along the road of stability towards the European Union. We should remember that FYROM was the only former Yugoslav republic that successfully avoided Milošević’s wars.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want to help our fellow Member State, Greece, and thereby the European Union as a whole, because we need to bear in mind that any country thrives only in so far as its neighbouring countries do. That is an empirical fact and one which can be proven. That is why I invite our friends in Greece, our fellow Member State, to try to solve this problem together with the government in Skopje and to relax its approach north of its borders. I invite Greece to be a true, fair and broad-minded leader, a mentor and a sponsor of the Balkans. The Balkans of today needs that.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would particularly like to welcome Agenda 2014, an initiative prepared by the new Greek Government of Mr Papandreou. Well done for this initiative! I stand together with Greece. Let us do everything we can to reach this goal. Let us show solidarity with both Greece, our fellow Member State, and with the FYROM. Solidarity must be mutual.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to bear in mind that the Balkans is like a bicycle ride. As long as it is moving, as long as it is pedalling forward, everything is more or less OK, but if it stops, it there is a blockage, if it reaches a stalemate, we fall down, all of us fall down. If we stopped now, peace, stability, security and social cohesion would break down.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, let me stress one more fact: FYROM has been a candidate since 2005. We all need to be aware of the consequences of our decisions or failure to take decisions. Whenever I visit Skopje, I always make it clear to them that they are responsible for finding a solution with Greece, their neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore appeal here to the authorities in Skopje, Athens and Sofia, as well as to the Spanish Presidency, Commissioner Füle, Foreign Affairs High Representative Ashton and Parliament: let us do everything, each within their own remit, to help solve this problem. That is how we can achieve a different Balkans and a better Balkans than we have seen over the past 20 years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members, whose constructive contributions to the report have made it possible for us to achieve a consensus in most areas. I would also like to reiterate that my aim as rapporteur for this Parliament is to bring about a situation where we send out a clear, balanced and coherent message. I believe that we can only do that if we seek out a broad majority together.</p>
<p class="contents">I actually have three messages for Turkey. First of all, and this is how the report begins, too, we have open debate, then there is the constitution and the enforcement of legislation. I will begin with open debate, democratic opening. From an entirely objective point of view, we welcome the broad debate that the Turkish Government initiated last year in respect of the rights of Kurds, the Alevi, the role of the army, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President, the judgment from the Constitutional Court last December ensured that terrorist attacks would take place once again. There was a wave of arrests of Democratic Society Party (DTP) members, and the threat of arrest still hangs over members of the Turkish Parliament. The open and positive debate that there had been since the summer thus seems likely to come to a premature end as a result. Of course, Mr President, as a representative of the people, I have respect for legal verdicts, but I also understand that the Constitutional Court has also said of the prohibition of political parties that Turkey should now enthusiastically engage with what has been recommended by the Council of Europe and the Venice Commission. I ask Turkey, then, to do so, to ensure that this kind of unfortunate situation does not arise again.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, that brings me to another verdict by the Court, namely the annulment of the law restricting the jurisdiction of the military court. As parliamentarians, we are in no position to criticise the judgment, but it does show, once again, that the basis of these judgments, the constitution, is inadequate, in the sense that – and I need to word this carefully – in any case, it gives grounds for such judgments to be made. That is why we are all calling, once again, for Turkey to bring forward a revision of its constitution without delay, as that is the only thing that can bring about the real reforms that are so necessary to modernise Turkish society.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, my third, fundamental point concerns the implementation and the enforcement of legislation that has been adopted. In the areas of women’s rights, freedom of religion and the maltreatment of criminal suspects, the standards laid down also need to be complied with throughout Turkey. Mr President, I am therefore calling for additional attention to be paid to enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">I will turn now to the amendments. On Cyprus, I attempted to reach a clear and broad-based compromise with the shadow rapporteurs. Turkey needs to know that the supplementary protocol that has been agreed must be accepted without delay. In paragraph 34, I have called on all parties to ensure that a solution is reached in respect of the division of Cyprus. With this paragraph, then, I am specifically asking Turkey to send out positive signals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we emphasise, in a new paragraph 48, that both leaders must be encouraged to have courage in order to reach a solution for the island soon. This is absolutely necessary. I would say to Mrs Cornelissen that, although your amendment about violence against women is probably a little redundant, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will also, as expected, support it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, finally, I would like to reiterate, once again, that, this year, too, my aim is to produce a report that offers a very clear message that is critical, but also balanced. It is my belief that, if we adopt this report with a large majority, we will also be finding a good solution for Turkey in modernising the country and making it prosperous for all of its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We expect negotiations with Croatia to be completed and negotiations with Macedonia to be started this year. This includes recognising that the policy on minority groups in these two countries is better than in many Member States of the European Union and that all the minorities and ethnic groups in both countries are represented in their governments. Mr Füle, the question of the return of the refugees, if you will pardon my saying so, has been handled by Croatia in a way which could serve as a model for other states. Therefore, I would like to say quite clearly that we should, of course, explain to these countries that they still need to make an effort. However, saying that the ball is solely in Croatia’s court is totally unacceptable. Croatia has ratified the border agreement and I would like to join with Mr Swoboda in calling on the Slovenian Parliament to do the same thing. Three negotiating chapters remain to be opened by the Council. I would like to call on the Spanish representative of the Council of Ministers to ensure that they are opened during the Spanish Presidency. This will allow Croatia, if it is treated fairly, to complete the negotiations this year.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the appalling blockade of Macedonia on account of the name issue is concerned, in this case, the ball is not solely in Macedonia’s court either. Instead, the responsibility lies with an EU Member State which has set up a blockade that runs contrary to international law. I would like to make it clear at this point that the EU must behave in a credible way, in other words, we must demand things from others, but we must also live up to our own standards, otherwise we will lose all credibility. I feel that it is important for us to work towards voting on Croatia this year in this Parliament, after following a long and difficult path. Then the observers can come here, in the same way that the Czech, Slovenian and Hungarian observers came and were welcomed by us. I hope that European elections can take place in Croatia either next year or the year after and that Croatian Members will join us here in Parliament and help to prepare for the accession of other southern European states, with Macedonia being the first in line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our Parliament will do its utmost to support you in these efforts because those of us here in the European Parliament are actually the strongest proponents of the enlargement of this region of security, prosperity and citizens’ rights, which is the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I think that the statements from the three rapporteurs highlighted the serious work which was done by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and them personally. I want to congratulate them on this and say that these three reports which we are discussing today were adopted by a huge majority in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I believe that this will also be the case today.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to stress that we wish to use our reports to give a very clear signal to the three countries as well, even though the general debate will probably dilute our messages to some extent, that we remain committed to the process, but that there are issues which cannot be avoided and on which the three countries must take action. They are mainly linked to the fact that the European Parliament cannot and will not close its eyes to a whole series of issues related to the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria supporting the protection of fundamental rights, media freedom and freedom of association, as well as the protection of minorities’ rights, good neighbourly relations, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to dwell briefly on three issues which, in my view, are of fundamental importance to making progress on the three countries’ accession. Firstly, it is clear with regard to Croatia that the path to membership is already open for this country. The agreement reached with Slovenia is extremely important, but we call for its ratification as soon as possible so that it will provide the opportunity for the negotiations with Croatia to be concluded by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Macedonia, we hope that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will demonstrate the necessary flexibility. We also hope that the new Greek Government will find a solution to the name issue so that Macedonia can receive a date for starting negotiations by this year.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Turkey is concerned, the Cyprus question cannot be avoided. Until progress is made on this first, Turkey cannot hope to make substantial progress in its process of integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That also opens up the possibility for Croatia to wrap up negotiations as early as this year, as we have stated in our report.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very pleased to note that Mrs Kosor, the new Croatian Prime Minister, has quickly and successfully taken steps in the areas where we have met the greatest obstacles so far: in the fight against corruption and organised crime, in implementing a programme of administrative reform, in addressing war crimes and in ensuring legal or constitutional protection for ethnic and other minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">By signing a border arbitration agreement with its neighbour Slovenia, the new Croatian Government has not only eliminated an obstacle to the negotiating process, but has also paved the way for the resolution of other issues. It is important that Croatia continues to address border disputes with its other neighbours and ensures that these negotiations are conducted in good faith and according to the principle of <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also point out that this resolution, which was drafted under the excellent guidance of my fellow member and rapporteur, Hannes Swoboda, has, in an objective and positive way, also highlighted problem areas where Croatia still has a great deal of work to do. To name but a few, these include cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, efforts made so far in prosecuting corruption, restructuring the economy and finances and greater commitment and sincerity in eliminating the obstacles to the return of Croatia’s Serbian population. Croatia is their homeland, too.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive reports on the progress of Croatia and FYROM should also be seen as a definite signal of the EU’s openness to enlargement to all the countries in the Western Balkans and a confirmation of the commitments we have undertaken towards these countries, Turkey included, provided they meet all relevant criteria. That, however, depends primarily on them. Let me conclude by wishing Mr Füle, our new commissioner, every success. I know he will do an excellent job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are happy to work with you and look forward to our future cooperation. I would also like to thank Mr Swoboda for the good cooperation on the Croatia report. I think there was good cooperation in the process and I thank my colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say that we would have preferred to have had the debate en bloc so that we had all three countries, but separate sections, in the morning. We think that would have made more sense instead of having them all mixed up together, but that is a side note. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is in favour of Croatia joining the European Union quickly and we welcome very much the rapid progress which this country has made. Croatia’s quick accession will send out an important signal on security policy to the entire Western Balkans. It means that the promise of membership made by European Heads of State or Government in Thessaloniki to all the countries in the Western Balkans still holds. The credibility and validity of this promise represent an enormous incentive for all the states in the region to implement far-reaching reforms which will make these countries more secure, more stable and more prosperous.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to say with regard to Croatia that the civil service there must be strengthened and made more transparent. The decisive factor here is not only the adoption of new legislation but, above all, the administrative implementation of the laws. We in the Verts/ALE group would like to see better results in this area. We believe that the only solution to the problems of corruption and organised crime is the consistent implementation of new laws and directives. The same applies to the judiciary and the particularly important chapter concerning the judicial system that has not yet been negotiated. The announcements made by the Croatian Government are a good thing, but they must be followed by action that brings about <span class="italic">de facto</span> improvements in the situation in the courts. We would like to see more transparency and less political influence in this area as well.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we are proposing four amendments, which I would like to encourage you to vote for. The first concerns the fight against corruption. We would like the construction and urban planning sector to be included in particular, as this is where the largest public contracts are awarded.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we would like a reference in paragraph 19 to the fact that the situation of gay men and lesbians is unsatisfactory. There have been repeated attacks on people from these minority groups. We have now received assurances from the Croatian Government that some of these cases are being investigated. We feel that this is a very positive sign and would like to encourage the Croatian authorities to speed up the implementation of the anti-discrimination act.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that we have no vision for a new energy policy for Croatia. Therefore, we would like to call on you to support our Amendment 7. We are looking forward to Croatia joining the European Union soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We see not only significant benefits in a larger single market, but we also look – unlike some Members of this House – for a dilution of the federalist ambition at the heart of the European Union. However, candidates must be subject to rigorous and exacting standards as laid out in the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore fully endorse the Commission’s thorough approach to preparing candidates for membership and its willingness to learn the lessons of previous enlargements, in particular, the most recent ones to Bulgaria and Romania, where there were outstanding problems in the areas of organised crime and corruption. Croatia, along with Iceland – if approved as a candidate – is undoubtedly the country most ready to join the European Union, and its accession will help stabilise the Western Balkans. While recognising that a border dispute with Slovenia remains outstanding, we do not think that bilateral disputes can be allowed to delay Croatia’s membership. Italy, after all, did not stop Slovenia joining in spite of border and minority disputes at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission report makes clear, Croatia has also made some substantial progress in meeting the negotiating benchmarks, and the country’s commitment to the EU’s expectations remains strong. Macedonia is also now fully back on track towards membership, and we welcome its EU visa liberalisation, along with Serbia and Montenegro, and support immediate calls now to the Council to allow the opening of negotiations for membership for Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECR Group believes that the almost comical name dispute with Greece should be resolved sensibly and rapidly. President Ivanov has helped to add momentum to Macedonia’s EU ambitions, and we hope his request to meet the newly re-elected President of Greece will be reciprocated in the spirit of friendship and neighbourhood relationships. Meanwhile, Turkey’s EU membership application remains problematic, not least in the field of human rights. The recent horrifying case of a teenage girl buried alive for talking to boys simply gives ammunition to those who say that Turkey has no place in the European Union. Its failure to recognise Cyprus or implement the Ankara protocols, as well as stalling in the ratification of the treaty to re-establish relations with Armenia, is a disappointment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as permanent rapporteur of the Parliament for Montenegro, I should just like to add that in my view, having recently visited this country, it is well on its way to candidate status, and I hope to see that happen as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I, too, would like to take the opportunity on behalf of my group, the ECR Group, to congratulate Commissioner Füle on his electoral appointment yesterday, and my group will be fully cooperating with him in his challenging tasks ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We mean this and we believe in it. It is necessary, primarily for Turkey itself, in order to safeguard the rights of all minorities, to reduce the electoral limit for seats in Parliament and to safeguard labour rights, such as the right to strike and collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="contents">Finding a real political solution to the Kurdish problem, recognising the Armenian genocide, normalising relations with neighbouring countries and ending the occupation of Cyprus are some of the issues which Turkey is required to address. As emphasised by the Council, it needs, urgently and without further delay, to comply fully and without discrimination with the additional protocol to the Ankara Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In ignoring international law, Turkey is preventing the Republic of Cyprus from exercising its sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone. As such, we declare that we disagree with the position that the relevant energy chapter should be opened.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to mention the intention of some members to vote for an amendment calling for all interested parties to help to resolve the Cyprus question. I am sure that everyone will help. However, is this not unacceptably making everyone equally responsible, making the victim and the occupier equally responsible? If we want a solution to the Cyprus question, we must underline Turkey’s responsibilities. We must speak openly to Turkey, whose integration, I repeat in closing, we support. However, it is the integration of Turkey into the European Union that we support, not the integration of the European Union into Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">1. The granting of legal personality to all religious communities in Turkey – the fundamental precondition for the realisation of the freedom of religion in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">2. The immediate ending of the public hate campaign against Turkish Christians beneath the cover of allowing the doubly negative loaded term ‘missionary activities’ in schoolbooks and local media, as if Turkish Christians were, by definition, subversive and bent on undermining the state.</p>
<p class="contents">3. The immediate ending of the conspicuous discrimination against non-Islamic minorities when filling important civilian and military posts within the Turkish Government apparatus.</p>
<p class="contents">4. Effective government measures against growing anti-Semitism in public life in Turkey. A Turkish academic recently spoke of a poisoned atmosphere. I am pleased that the atmosphere is still open enough for an academic to openly come out and say such a thing. What is needed, therefore, is effective government measures against the growing anti-Semitism in public life in Turkey, in which regard Prime Minister Erdoğan, specifically, should take the lead role.</p>
<p class="contents">5. Finally, a strict bringing into line of relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran with transatlantic policy on Tehran and its controversial nuclear programme. Turkey must spell out where it stands on the increasingly urgent issue of Tehran’s nuclear programme. As a NATO member and EU candidate country, Turkey must nail its colours to the mast. It must make a clear choice.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Council and the Commission to take the Copenhagen criteria and the urgent criticisms of Turkey that I have mentioned seriously and, Commissioner, once again, I would like to wish you all the best in your new role.

Mr President, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), my party, has chosen to operate independently in this Parliament. In this case, we have enjoyed excellent collaboration with the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group and with Mr Messerschmidt, to whom I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that the PVV is not in favour of enlargement – not to Croatia, not to Macedonia and certainly not to Turkey. Turkey’s occupation of Cyprus is illegal, all of us in this Chamber believe that, and yet we continue to be involved with Turkey without seriously denouncing them for this. We do not impose any sanctions – or next to no sanctions – on Turkey. This, to me, is really weak-fisted behaviour, and I have therefore tabled an amendment that condemns this occupation and orders Turkey to withdraw its troops from Cyprus, and to do so immediately. I therefore hope that you will all support this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the freedom of the press in Turkey is under severe pressure. When I was visiting Turkey, the press was even moved on. We must strongly condemn this and that is why I have tabled Amendment 16.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, ladies and gentlemen, we come to Iran, a rogue state. Mr Ahmadinejad, an Islamic dictator, terrorises his own population, wants to wipe Israel from the map and says so openly, is working on long-distance missiles, regularly carries out missile tests and yesterday began enriching uranium, which is suitable for nuclear weapons. Ladies and gentlemen, we can but express our disgust about this. Turkey, which wants to accede to the EU, counts the Iranian Government as a great friend and must be strongly condemned for this, which is why I have tabled Amendment 17. I count on your support.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I want to mention the negotiations with Turkey. Turkey, which counts Iran as a friend, occupies Cyprus, oppresses Christians, violates the rights of women, is a member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), operates Sharia law, which limits human rights, and is an Islamic country, can never accede to this Union. We should not allow that to happen, for which reason I have tabled Amendments 18 and 19, which aim to bring an end to the accession negotiations. Thus, I hope that you will all support my amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European People’s Party considers that FYROM went through many positive developments during the last year. The progress it made in fulfilling most of the criteria towards starting EU accession negotiations is indeed both significant and remarkable. The fact that the Commission has recommended the opening of negotiations with FYROM should be seen as a clear message that this country is on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament should therefore stand firmly behind this recommendation and, by adopting this resolution, send a positive signal to the country and indeed the whole region. I hope the European Council will confirm the Commission’s decision and the call included in this resolution, and will give the green light for negotiations with FYROM in the near future without further delay. I also believe that up until this happens, the negotiations on the name issue will progress and relations with neighbouring countries will get better.</p>
<p class="contents">FYROM should rise to the challenge and show that it is ready to fulfil all the Copenhagen criteria, on the basis of which its ambitions to become a member of the EU should be assessed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is frank, and some criticisms can be made; but it is a balanced report and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, our political group would have placed greater emphasis on certain aspects. However, we have negotiated a broad consensus because we believe the report should be given as much support as possible by this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to send out a clear message on that point. It should be a positive message, one of good will, but it should also be rigorous so as to boost the negotiating process and stimulate the advancement of modernising, democratic reforms in Turkey. We have to be clear on this matter: we need to overcome this phase of sluggishness and indecision in the negotiation process.</p>
<p class="contents">According to opinion polls, public support for accession in Turkey has waned, and that public perception needs to change. The only way to achieve this is to ensure that the negotiations and reforms continue to move forward, that the European Union shows itself to be consistent with the commitments it has undertaken, and that it also avoids sending out contradictory signals which create uncertainty. Of course, Turkey must also take decisive steps on the path towards reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Two scenarios lie ahead: a vicious circle of divisions, confrontations and mistrust; or a virtuous circle of serious, rigorous, yet unambiguous negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">If this report makes even a modest contribution to progress along those lines, then I think we can be satisfied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Skopje has carried out reforms and is on the way to joining the European Union. We welcome this very much and are very pleased about it. The visa liberalisation was perhaps the clearest and most visible sign. It was a milestone in our cooperation. This objective has only been achieved as a result of close collaboration with the EU Member States. It represents openness, interaction and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not forget that Macedonia was granted the status of accession candidate four years ago and since then, we have constantly been asking ourselves when it would finally join the European Union. I would like to call on all the parties to ensure that the name conflict, which is currently the focus of attention, is resolved. We must make use of the momentum generated by the Council decision in December and by the new Greek Government. This momentum is diminishing day by day. I would like to explain to the parties that if we concentrate now on other topics, such as the financial crisis, the goal of Macedonia’s accession will be pushed further into the background.

It is tremendous to actually see what is going on on the ground there with a view to accession: major political breakthroughs, but also, and above all, entirely practical changes that benefit the people who live there.</p>
<p class="contents">In Montenegro, for example, the existence of homosexuality is finally being recognised. In Turkey, the shelters for women have finally succeeded in achieving good relations with the police, to name just two examples. We should be enthusiastic about what is being achieved in these countries and what is going well, but, at the same time, we need to be very clear about what still has to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Member States must continue to insist on the criteria that we laid down at the beginning of the process. However, we also need to avoid watering down the power of the accession process by erecting extra obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to focus in on Macedonia for a moment. We all agree that the bilateral problem of the name must be resolved. We also all agree that the EU must provide all possible support in this process. Bilateral problems, in themselves, should not represent an obstacle to the accession process. This applies to Macedonia, but also just as much to Croatia, Serbia, Turkey, Kosovo and Iceland. For the people who live there, the prospect of accession is too important to be held hostage to the resolution of a bilateral disagreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask you all to also vote in favour of our amendment, Amendment 4, which aims to insert a new paragraph 30(2) into the report on Macedonia. I also ask you all to really bear in mind, in respect of these three reports, how very important the accession process is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am certain we are going to work fruitfully and effectively together for further enlargement of the European Union. I am sure that you will complete the negotiation process of the European Union with Croatia before the end of the year. I am sure that you will also begin the process of negotiation with Macedonia soon. I hope this will also be this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In this speech, I would like to stress the exceptional role of Croatia as a future Member State of the European Union, particularly in the context of the defence of our common values and the security of our continent. We value the fact that Croatian units, as part of NATO, are present in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Around 300 Croatian soldiers, diplomats and police officers are also taking part in ISAF operations in three regions of Afghanistan. Our new ally has bravely supported our fight against terrorism in several NATO missions. I am certain that Croatia’s membership of the European Union will contribute to continued stability in a part of Europe which only a few years ago experienced a cruel conflict and ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p class="contents">If Croatia completes all the reforms, it can finish negotiations with the European Union before the end of the year. This is a good objective, and I call upon everyone to support these efforts. We should value the fact that Zagreb has carried out numerous reforms, especially in the area of the judicial system and public administration, and also concerning the fight against corruption and organised crime. Bringing Croatia into the family of Member States of the European Union is part of our strategy to build a continent of democracy and prosperity. The example of this Balkan country confirms that the process of European Union enlargement is a strong incentive to political and economic reform in countries which aspire to membership. Let us remember this, too, when we look at our eastern neighbour, Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words about Turkey, firstly to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the excellent results obtained in the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Her report, which refers to 2008 and 2009, neither overstates nor underplays matters; it highlights the efforts Turkey is making to try to meet the Copenhagen conditions and criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, however, these efforts need to be considered within Turkey’s current context and political situation: seven years of Mr Erdoğan’s moderate Islamic government, with elections expected in July 2011; a country that is seething from the Operation Sledgehammer cases; from the annulment of the Emasya Protocol, which handed major powers over to the military; and, in particular, from the ruling that has banned the activities of the Democratic Society Party in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">This context, Commissioner, means that the Turkish case needs to be handled with great caution. Turkey has to meet the conditions and requirements of the Copenhagen criteria and, obviously, it has to comply with the Ankara Protocol. However, in this particular context and situation, it goes without saying, Commissioner, that if any wrong signal is sent out, it could have very serious consequences for the security of the European Union, especially when the governing party does not have the three-fifths majority it needs in parliament in order to modify the constitution; such a signal could seriously give rise to alarming turmoil in an already unstable country that is a strategic partner for the West, in the context of the Atlantic Alliance.</p>

We got you up early this morning on your first day in the job, and I think it will not be the only time that we do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In Turkey, there is significant public scepticism that the EU will keep its promise and, just as you confront scepticism amongst some of our publics within the EU, your challenge, Commissioner, is to be fair and objective – and, yes, that wins public trust. But also to put the positive case for enlargement, to win over sceptic publics, and our group will support you in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">On Turkey, the Socialist and Democrat Group remains pro-accession, pro-reform. The Commission’s progress report says that reform efforts have been resumed but should be intensified. We agree. So, on this first report during the five years of this Parliament, let me focus my opening remarks on how we as a Parliament should deal with Turkey. To the rapporteur, I respect your sincere commitment to pursuing consensus in this House and I thank you for your cooperation. I hope, in future years, that you will seek agreement of the political groups before submitting plenary amendments to agreed compromises at committee, as our differences are small.</p>
<p class="contents">But the real test of your rapporteurship and for this Parliament is to ensure that we use our influence to secure, year by year, steady progress in shepherding Turkey towards accession, and that requires leadership here as well as in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">To our Cypriot colleagues we understand the pain of injustice you feel. In our group, we have sought to include you fully in our consensus, but we are determined at this crucial time to seek to take positions which support reconciliation efforts to provide justice to both communities and not to prejudge their outcome on behalf of either side.</p>
<p class="contents">To others in this House, constructive criticism of Turkey is needed; we ourselves are critical friends. But to those who speak in this debate opposing Turkey, we say that you are a minority; too many of you are motivated by religious intolerance against Islam and seeking your own political advantage by deliberately creating false fears about immigration. These arguments are loathsome and repellent, and so are you.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to the majority of this House who want Turkey’s accession, we have to say so again and again. The shrill voice of the rejectionist must not be allowed to drown us out. We expect our Turkish counterparts to continue to make painful changes in their own society with difficult impact on their domestic politics.</p>
<p class="contents">These reforms are good in their own right, but, those of us who say in this Parliament we want accession: we have to make their pain worthwhile by ourselves doing what we say, opening and closing chapters on merit, delivering the promises of the Council, ourselves acting in good faith. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The 12th hearing of the trial of the alleged assassins of Hrant Dink was held in Istanbul on Monday. For the first time, official observers at that trial felt that the court was sincerely trying to establish the truth and that the connections between this trial – that of the alleged assassins of Hrant Dink – and other trials under way – such as that of the Ergenekon network – had been highlighted by the prosecutor.</p>
<p class="contents">This fact is extremely significant because it is every political assassination, intolerance within society and the impunity that still prevails that are being put on trial here. Moreover, this is a view that the families of the victims of these political assassinations eloquently expressed when, referring to the Turkish ‘Deep State’, they declared themselves to be Hrant Dink’s ‘deep family’. I am telling you this because things are moving forward and because, within Turkish civil society, there is a desire and a movement for reform aimed at promoting democracy and rights, and this desire and this movement are exceptionally powerful.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to cite another example which is making the headlines in the newspapers at the moment –family honour crimes have already been mentioned – and that is the young 16-year-old girl who was found buried in a chicken pen and who had been sentenced by the family council for having spoken to boys. This is terrifying and it is a crime. The members of that family will obviously have to be put in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, a few years ago, these crimes did not make the headlines. It is therefore pleasing today to see that these so-called ‘honour crimes’, which are simply barbaric crimes, are no longer being tolerated in Turkish society. Turkish society is in a state of flux, it is in turmoil even, and I think that, when we discuss Turkey, we must be keenly aware that any reform in that country deeply affects relations between citizens, the establishment, Turkish history and democracy. These are absolutely crucial elements.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that our process must be totally sincere. Today, the sincerity of our process is acknowledged, and it matches our ability to support the complicated, critical and historic process in Cyprus. Today, the EU must say clearly to Cyprus that we are ready to support and to guarantee, using all the means at our disposal, economic and financial means included, any agreement reached between the north and the south and that we are also determined to ensure that nothing in the body of EU law can hinder the achievement of a consensus in Cyprus. We must forge ahead; the future of Turkey’s membership of the EU is also riding on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, could I call for more honesty in our approach to Turkey. I am sure all of us want good relations with Turkey and many of us, probably the majority, wish to see Turkey one day as a member of the European Union, a different European Union to what is being developed today. It is because some recognise that Turkish accession would inevitably change the nature of the EU project, driving as it is towards unwanted political integration, that they are so resistant to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one or two questions for the Commission. What has happened to the negotiations with Turkey? Why are so few chapters open? At a time when, in all our countries, we have serious concerns about energy security, and Turkey is in such a key geographical position in providing the routes for pipelines from the Caspian, why is the energy chapter not open? And, with presidential elections imminent in Cyprus, and unification talks in progress, Cyprus is very much on our minds. Turkey, of course, can hardly ever be discussed in this Chamber without reference to Cyprus, but perhaps it would be more helpful if instead of always criticising Turkey, the EU endeavoured to provide it with more support on this issue. Why do we just call on Turkey to use its influence when Greece and the Republic of Cyprus, both EU members, have a crucial role to play?</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that the Turkish garrison in Northern Cyprus should be much reduced. In fact, I regularly propose to Turkish emissaries that a unilateral reduction in troops would be a bold confidence-building measure, but we all know that had the Annan Plan been put into effect, the Turkish troop presence would have been reduced to a mere 650 and the Greek presence to 950. It is scandalous that no real progress has been made in opening international trade with Northern Cyprus. Why has the European Union not kept its promise given in May 2004 to end the isolation of Northern Cyprus?</p>
<p class="contents">Of all the places in the world where the EU might actually play a useful role and exert some benign influence, Cyprus stands out – yet we are absent. Let us not blame Turkey for the EU’s internal difficulties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The entire enlargement process is in keeping with the strengthening of NATO and the NATO occupation of the Western Balkans, with the secession of Kosovo and with the destabilisation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the European Union’s contesting the borders and stability in the area, with coercion against the people of Serbia, with new frictions and oppositions in the Balkans.</p>

<p class="contents">This process is in keeping with Ankara’s intransigence on the Cyprus question, with the <span class="italic">casus belli </span>in the Aegean, which is being backed by Frontex contesting the borders in the area, and by effectively banning trade unionism and other anti-democratic arrangements in Turkey.</p>

<p class="contents">We do not feel that Turkey’s membership is either realistic or opportune for many reasons. Firstly, because Turkey is not geographically located within Europe; secondly, because Turkey is becoming more and more Islamic and Ankara is actually a leading member of the largest international pan-Islamic organisation, the OIC; thirdly, because religious minorities are persecuted and their inferiority is ingrained in society; fourthly, because Turkey continues to officially deny the genocide of one and a half million Armenian Christians and occupies Cyprus in both military and political terms in breach of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remember that with Turkey in the European Union, we will have countries such as Iraq, Iran and Syria on our borders. Lastly, we must also remember that Turkey, with its 90 million inhabitants, will be the most populated country in the European Union by 2030. This means that it would have the highest number of MEPs and the most significant percentage vote in the European Council; the balance of Europe would certainly be destabilised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is happening in the current negotiations. In my opinion, we have made very good progress with Croatia and we can complete the process quickly. However, it is, of course, important that the Copenhagen criteria are met in every case, including the integration capacity of the European Union, because we must be aware of the risk of overstretching ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We will meet our obligations to the Western Balkans, but in individual cases, the path may be a long one. We must be aware of this, so that we do not arouse false hopes. On the other hand, it is clear that the European perspective is a valuable tool and perhaps the only one available for maintaining a certain amount of pressure to ensure that the internal reform process in these countries continues, with regard both to the maturity of the market and the political system.</p>
<p class="contents">I have problems with Turkey when I look at its behaviour towards Berlin and when I consider Cyprus, religious freedom, freedom of opinion, the ban on political parties and similar issues. I can only ask myself whether the last steps that are needed – from the point of view of the mentality and not of the form – will be taken to ensure that Turkey can become a member and whether we can be sure that the European Union has the capacity to integrate Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Füle, you have an important opportunity, because you have a broader range of responsibilities, which include enlargement policy and neighbourhood policy.

I am pleased to follow my distinguished friend, Mr Brok, who mentioned the Copenhagen criteria. Can I reinforce that the Copenhagen criteria are non-negotiable, especially when it comes to minority rights and human rights, and Macedonia and Croatia are therefore failing to reflect the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>, especially as regards non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to both of those countries that the accession procedure is an opportunity to bring your laws into line and to explain to your citizens the need to do so, and that once you join this club you, do not join a club which is based on an à la carte menu. We will enforce the <span class="italic">acquis</span> rigorously, and especially Article 19, which gives the Union the right to combat discrimination on the grounds of – and it is a very important list – race, ethnicity, religion, belief, age, disability and sexual orientation. Why is this important? Because one person could experience discrimination on each separate ground, and to do nothing on one is to make irrelevant all the good that you have done on the other. I therefore say that lesbian, gay and bisexual rights are non-negotiable. Bring in anti-discrimination legislation now. The litmus test of any civilisation is not how it treats its majority, but how it treats the minorities that make up that majority.</p>
<p class="contents">On Turkey, there has been progress, and I am pleased to quote Ban Ki-moon, who says that there has been progress on Cyprus. We in Parliament should welcome that. Mrs Dodds is right: if we are going to be a part of the resolution, we have to be absolutely honest and bring the sides together. But again, on anti-discrimination, I wish them to go further.</p>
<p class="contents">Non-discrimination is in the Constitution, but it needs to be reflected in the laws, especially again in relation to lesbians, gay men, bisexual and transgendered people who are often murdered for no other reason than they are transsexual. So, allow Turkey to proceed along this route, on the same terms, the same conditions. If we undermine the principles of accession, we have no principles left. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That seems rather strange to me.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to discuss the subject of Turkey. Other speakers have said that Turkey is a society in motion and that is true. However, for the sake of honesty, we must explain that this is not a linear movement towards European values. Turkey is moving forwards and backwards. Let us take the example of the armed forces. We are, of course, pleased about the decree that prevents the armed forces from intervening without political authorisation. This is a good thing. However, the judgment of the constitutional court also makes up another part of the picture and this prevents members of the armed forces from being brought before civilian courts. That, of course, is not a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the example of freedom of speech and opinion, it is true that there is a lively debate taking place on a number of topics which were previously taboo, including the rights of minorities and sexual minorities, Mr Cashman. We think that is very good. However, at the same time, there is the ban on YouTube and there are legal provisions which create a framework that generates legal uncertainty about the question of freedom of speech and opinion, which is particularly important to the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. There is also the ‘private war’ against the Doğan group. All of this is very unfortunate.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example is that of the role of women. Of course, it is good that so-called honour killings, which are a barbaric crime, are being discussed in the media, but do we really believe that Turkish society is moving in a linear fashion towards adopting European values on equality? I do not think that this is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say something about what Mr Howitt has said. It is true that we have a process – the accession negotiations – which we must follow in good faith. However, this is not an automatic process. During this process, we are not only responsible for the accession candidate. Our primary responsibility is to the European Union. Our enlargement policy must be credible and we need to take an honest and credible approach to the accession candidates. I must say that I sometimes find it disturbing that there is an alliance between the Greens, who want a strong Europe and enlargement as soon as possible, and Members such as Mr van Orden, who want to bring in new countries as quickly as possible in order to weaken the European Union. This seems to me very strange.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an accession perspective, but accession will only come about when all the criteria have been met.</p>

You said that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wanted enlargement at any price. It is quite clear to us that we are in favour of enlargement, including Turkey and the Balkans, of course, but only if all the criteria are met. On the subject of Turkey, I would like to say that, despite all the problems that have been referred to today, I believe that the Turkish Government has the will to continue. For example, the Ministry of Interior has annulled the protocol which, until now, has allowed the armed forces to intervene independently in security issues. This is very important. I hope that a majority of this House will support our Amendment 10 which concerns keeping track of the goal of accession. This is the only way in which the EU can maintain its credibility with regard to the promises it has made – the goal of accession, with all the criteria being met.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of Macedonia, there has been a great deal of progress in many areas. I recognise this and I am pleased about it. However, with reference to one point which Mr Cashman has already mentioned, it is not right for a government to introduce anti-discrimination legislation that does not include sexual orientation. That is European law. Human rights are not negotiable and I hope that a majority of this House will also vote in favour of these common European human rights in our amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, he does not want Euro-bureaucracy to come between that Europe and its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking, today, about enlargement, and it is good that we are talking about it, because, and let us not hide this, the European Union is going through a certain institutional crisis, and so one way of moving out of it is to enlarge the European Union. This could give us a certain energy, a certain vigour, so it is worth taking this route. A Europe without that Balkan lung is not Europe. The accession of Croatia, a European country with a European culture and a European history, should be accomplished as quickly as possible. However, let us also think realistically about receiving into membership as quickly as possible countries such as Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is something which is, truly, very important. Turkey’s membership is something which is much further away, and certainly will not happen within the next 10 years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is that what is ultimately being fabricated is not a Europe of social cohesion and solidarity; it is marketplace Europe and, secondly, in certain instances, enlargement policy has problematic relations with international law. I refer to the report on FYROM in which, where the rapporteur does not unilaterally resolve the name issue, as in paragraph 17, he systematically avoids stating that the solution is being sought and must be sought within the UN. This reference makes the problem an international problem, as indeed it is, not a bilateral problem, and sends out a more accurate message than just generally hoping that the problem will resolve itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, <span class="italic">o tempora o mores</span> you may say, the fact that FYROM is participating – I repeat participating – in EU military missions in Afghanistan is considered to be an important attribute for FYROM, a country with poor economic and military resources, as is the fact that it unilaterally recognises Kosovo, contrary to UN Resolution 1244/1999.</p>

It is in our interests and also in the interests of the Turkish people, and when this problem is sorted out and brought to a successful conclusion, it will be an achievement both for Europe and for Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will certainly represent a major step forward in the direction of European integration for the entire Western Balkans region. I hope 2010 will be a very good year for Croatia and for the Western Balkans too, but I would also like to underline the necessity of considering and adequately addressing the issue of refugees and the internally displaced persons.</p>
<p class="contents">See the last report of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. As you know, in 2005, an agreement was signed in Sarajevo by Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Montenegro – the so-called Sarajevo Declaration. The agreement was aimed at sorting out the problem of the very large numbers of refugees and internally displaced people deriving from the conflict in the region. However, this is an issue that is still pending. I would very much like Croatia to finally affirm its readiness to relaunch the Sarajevo Declaration and to bring to an end a situation that I consider highly sensitive, and this at least before its accession.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome very much the commitment of the Commission to relaunch this spring the negotiations and I reiterate in front of you that this problem should be solved once and for all before Croatia joins the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">A final remark on Turkey: when evaluating Turkey, I would invite you not to let our prejudgment based on religion, ethnicity and clichés to speak. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Croatia has come a long way in its efforts to achieve membership and has taken many difficult decisions in order to deal with the European dimension. Important pieces of the jigsaw have yet to be put in place before membership can be accomplished.</p>
<p class="contents">One matter that is very close to my heart is decentralisation; in other words, political decisions being taken as close to the people as possible. When we add a fourth level of decision making, such as in the case of EU membership, it is incredibly important that people are aware of which decisions are to be taken at local, regional, national and EU level. On this matter, the progress report indicates that there is still much to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Other outstanding weak points are legal certainty, the fight against corruption and the position of women in the labour market – areas in which Croatia must make greater efforts. However, I can see that a huge amount of progress is being made and that the new Croatian Government also attaches great importance to these issues.

<p class="contents">Today’s motion for a resolution on FYROM tries to mirror this delicate balance. However, it does not succeed adequately. The pressure for negotiations to commence immediately is creating fears of sending the wrong signal to the talks on the name issue. Indefinite postponement, on the other hand, might encourage equally unproductive behaviour once again.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the amendments are positive. However, I would point out that any form of nationalism damages its own country first. Greece must strike its own balance. As a Greek Macedonian, I call for greater composure; what we need in the dispute over the name is for the two different self-determinations which both use the name Macedonia to coexist. This sort of compromise would be a catalyst for building the mutual trust which is vitally necessary in these times of ecological crisis, when immediate neighbours must be seen as necessary collaborators in combating it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My second comment relates to the word ‘comprehensiveness’. In my opinion, we must take a comprehensive view of the Balkan issue and we cannot focus on just one specific country, be it Croatia or Macedonia, but we should be dealing with the issue of a comprehensive approach involving countries, for example, such as Serbia.

<p class="contents">Turkey is playing a very negative role in those negotiations. It is not backing a sensible solution and the European Union therefore has to send out a clear, unequivocal message: Turkey cannot keep the 40 000 soldiers who are occupying the northern part of Cyprus in contravention of international law. It cannot continue to occupy the city of Famagusta in breach of the United Nations Security Council Resolution. It cannot continue sending to the northern part of the island settlers who are stifling the Turkish Cypriot community. That is the path Turkey is taking at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, the Commission, the Council and Parliament need to send out an unambiguous message to Turkey: if Turkey maintains its position, it will never be able to join the European Union. That is the message that should be conveyed at this critical point in negotiations over the reunification of Cyprus, which is a Member State of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thus, while the Turkish Government is trying to present itself as moderate, the armed forces of the country appear to be aggressive both towards Greece, constantly violating Greek airspace in the Aegean, and constantly harassing Frontex. It should be noted that, despite the fact that Greece and Turkey are NATO countries, and so are allies, Turkey is threatening Greece with a <span class="italic">casus belli</span> in terms of extending its territorial waters and by refusing to recognise the state of Cyprus, which is a member of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Turkish Government also appears to be unable at the moment to safeguard popular sovereignty in the country and is planning a new type of Ottoman commonwealth, as was clear from the meeting in Sarajevo at the beginning of November attended by Minister Davutoglu. I also find strange the moves by the Turkish Government in terms of its overtures to Iran, which conflict with the accepted views of the international community and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we should not overlook the fact that, in contravention of the roadmap, Turkey is allowing and, perhaps, encouraging the movement of illegal immigrants through its territory to the countries of the European Union and is not complying with its obligations to grant docking and landing rights to Cypriot ships and aircraft. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But I think it is also worth underlining the message that the efforts made by Croatia have not been done for us. They are making Croatia a better country and a better society for its citizens and by that, Croatia is becoming a better neighbour and contributing to Europe, because fights against organised crime or corruption must be made across borders, and it is an advantage for us to see the achievements made in Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to other candidate countries. All the achievements we can see are of benefit to Europe and, I must say, given the experience we have on the enlargement process, we have very few regrets on the achievements we have made; we should have the same perspective when we talk about Turkey, Macedonia or the other countries of the Western Balkans. When they reform, they are becoming neighbours. When we close the door, we are running the risk of new problems and new threats to European values; we should underline the need to go forward together in order to achieve a better European enlargement based on the criteria we fully support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that process to take place with mutual understanding, it must be assured a high level of quality. Fulfilment of strict but clear conditions, which are understandable and accepted by both sides, is the basis for reception of new members, and this also applies to Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, for a comprehensive report on Turkey’s progress in 2009. This year, the report is more critical, and, unfortunately, rightly draws attention to the small amount of progress made by Turkey, especially on questions of citizens’ freedoms and the justice system. However, stagnation in the process of democratisation was not all that happened last year, so it is necessary to be critical where progress was not made or where the situation became worse, but also to show that we value the changes for the better. For, on the one hand, the need to strengthen the principles of the rule of law is being neglected, and the constitution is based on this law, so this should be made a priority. On the other hand, Turkey is putting great effort into the negotiations which have been started, and I welcome the changes and Turkey’s desire to continue reforms in order to meet the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">However, good intentions are not everything. Ankara still has many challenges ahead on the road to membership of the European Union, and those challenges are not easy. I trust that Turkey will manage to overcome all the obstacles, and I wish the country success in reforming itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur has submitted a very balanced draft resolution. Turkey has indeed made good progress, but many points of concern must be addressed urgently. The horrible phenomenon of honour killings must be stamped out as well as the killing of transgender persons. Just yesterday, we learned of the umpteenth killing of a transgender woman in Antalya. The Turkish Government must ensure, as a matter of urgency, that transgender killings no longer go unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I appeal once again to the Turkish Government to ensure freedom of association and put an end to the systematic attempts to close down LGTB organisations. The resolution rightly urges freedom of religion and freedom of expression. For a liberal, these freedoms are at the heart of our democracy and are non-negotiable preconditions for EU membership.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if we ask Turkey to comply with EU standards, we must make sure to meet these standards ourselves. That is a matter of credibility and moral authority. Homophobia, compulsory religious education and restrictions of freedom of the press must equally be fought in the current Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, the authorities have encouraged public debate on certain areas of key importance to the reform process such as: the role of the judiciary, the rights of ethnic minorities and the role of the army in this country’s political life.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the signing of the Nabucco agreement has shown Turkey’s involvement in creating a secure gas supply within Europe, as is also demonstrated by Turkey’s negotiations to join the European Energy Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey has shown the key role it plays as an actor in the region by establishing normal relations with Armenia and improving relations with Iraq and the regional Kurdish Government. We certainly must not forget either its cooperation within the Black Sea Synergy launched three years ago with the aim of promoting stability and reforms in the countries around the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would not like us to forget some of the fundamental reasons which advocate this country’s accession to the European Union. Turkey is clearly a member of the European family and is an important partner in the dialogue between civilisations.

The Western Balkans and the Balkans have never been stable except during the brief era of Tito’s Yugoslavia. Accession to the Union is the only option to stabilise the region. This was proved by the 2004 and 2007 accessions, as illustrated, for instance, by the significant positive effect on relations between Hungary and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I would like to draw Commissioner Füle’s and Parliament’s attention to the fact that all interethnic problems, all important issues and neighbourly relations need to be resolved prior to accession, as the European Union will be powerless in the face of such issues after accession. Just look at the unresolved problem of Russians in Latvia, or at Slovakia, where the policies of the Fico Government have led to a souring of relations between the Slovak majority and the Hungarian minority.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in the case of the Western Balkans, where such problems are even more complicated, it is particularly important to settle them in relation to each country. Croatia is a neighbour country of Hungary, so it is of the utmost importance that Croatia becomes a member of the European Union as soon as possible. It is very important for Croatia to face its responsibilities in terms of the war, and to allow the refugees to return. This is a very important issue. Negotiations should be started with Macedonia as soon as possible, as also mentioned by Mr Thaler in his excellent report. Finally, with regard to Turkey, as long as the Kurds are not granted autonomy in the broadest possible sense, as long as the rights of women and sexual minorities are not resolved and Turkey does not apologise for the Armenian genocide, Turkey cannot become a member of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there seems to me to be a difference between the text adopted last year and the one that is now being proposed to us on Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, in its 2009 resolution, highlighted the negotiations in Cyprus but did not set any preconditions associated with the colonies or the Famagusta situation. These issues are dealt with in the six negotiating chapters which are being handled under the auspices of the UN. I therefore think that Parliament’s taking such a strong, one-sided position may harm these negotiations and render us partisan.</p>
<p class="contents">As the former commissioner emphasised on 16 November 2006, the restitution of Famagusta to its legitimate inhabitants is an issue which will have to be dealt with under the auspices of the UN, as part of an overall settlement of the Cyprus issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to quote another of the Council’s conclusions. In 2004, the Turkish Cypriot community clearly expressed its desire to have a future within the EU. The Council resolved to put an end to the isolation of that community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community.</p>

Everybody will be pleased by the progress that Croatia is making in the completion of its accession process. Key areas of governance must be adapted to the requirements of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, and some of these changes – let us be clear about this – are likely to go against the grain of tradition and expectations. So, negotiating the transformation demands a major act of political will.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add that the effort is well worthwhile, especially for a relatively small state like Croatia or, for that matter – and the same applies – for the other states of the Western Balkans. EU membership – I think we can take this for granted – provides a set of advantages in political, economic, cultural and security terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest problem of adaptation, though, lies elsewhere. It is one thing to change the structures of governance but it is a very different matter to change the attitudes of society to something radically different to the forms and content that have been developed in the European Union. The two are frequently far from each other, and there will certainly be elements in society, some quite powerful ones at that, which will see only disadvantages for themselves in the new dispensation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let there be no illusions about this. The Croatian authorities have not only to complete their negotiations with the European Union but, at the same time, they must also do what they can to change social attitudes. That may turn out to be the harder task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">May I start by congratulating Hannes Swoboda on his report on Croatia. We are all delighted that this country will shortly be joining the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Turkey is concerned, the message from the exceptionally balanced report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten remains the same as in previous years.

However, we cannot have <span class="italic">à la carte </span>accession tailored to Turkey. Turkey is a large country, which needs to accept that continuing reform, respect for human rights, proper help in resolving the Cyprus question, good neighbourly relations and removing the <span class="italic">casus belli </span>against a Member State are the steps that will bring it closer to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is concerned, the report by Mr Zoran Thaler sends the country a positive message. Greece, for its part, calls on the leaders of FYROM to come to the negotiating table in good faith, so that a jointly acceptable solution can be found within the framework of the UN. The Greek Government knows that the process requires new momentum and is genuinely determined that the issue be resolved.

I wish you every success in your work. I wish to thank Mr Swoboda, Mr Thaler and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for their balanced, objective reports.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has declared on numerous occasions its political desire for the countries of the Western Balkans to join the European Union and expressed its readiness to assist these states so that they can quickly meet the membership criteria. Croatia is in the home straight. I strongly hope that the Accession Treaty for this country will be signed by this year. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made progress in meeting the criteria for initiating the pre-accession process. The European Council is expected to reaffirm the European Commission’s decision made at the end of last year and launch the accession process. For this to happen, I believe that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia needs to make further efforts to resolve problems with its neighbours in a European spirit. If the authorities in Skopje have the political will not to use history, whether ancient or more recent, and to argue about current political or national intentions, a compromise can be reached. History must bring us together and not tear us apart. Let the historians come to their academic conclusions, but they must not stand in the way of the European destiny of any candidate country. So-called hate talk must not be tolerated. I want to mention in particular the schoolbooks which children use in school. They must not contain descriptions inciting a hostile attitude towards other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The way to increase trust in the Balkans is not only through the visa liberalisation scheme, which is up and running and something I am very pleased about, but also, in my view, through the joint commemoration of historical dates and heroes which are shared by certain Balkan countries. I hope that the recommendations made by the reports are taken into consideration by the relevant institutions in Member States. I wish Croatia, Macedonia and Turkey every success on their European journey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I come from a neighbouring country, Bulgaria, and we, as neighbouring countries, see some worrying trends. In my opinion, the name issue should not come first. Macedonian nation-building started after the Second World War and now a big part of the population identify themselves as Macedonians. However, we have to stick to our values: we cannot tolerate nation-building being confused with nationalistic rhetoric or with gross manipulation of history, going back to ancient times. Secondly, affirming national identity should not lead to xenophobic feelings towards citizens who declare themselves to be of Bulgarian origin. These people are subjected to verbal and physical abuse and even legally persecuted for fabricated reasons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You have already made it clear to the committee that the negotiations with Turkey are about its accession and not about the crazy idea of a privileged partnership, which has never been adequately publicised by those in favour of it. However, you have also made it clear – and we welcomed this very much – that both sides, Turkey and the European Union, must meet their obligations and undertakings. In this case, Mr Posselt, the principle of <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda</span> applies. You must be familiar with this phrase which was used by your former prestigious leader.</p>
<p class="contents">One further point is also very important to me. Of course, Turkey still has a great deal to do, but so does the European Union, whether it concerns the issue of Cyprus, the implementation of minority rights in Turkey or the political and military aspects. However, one thing is clear. The process will never be linear. We know this from the history of the European Union. You only need to look at the processes and procedures relating to the Treaty of Lisbon. There will always be progress and setbacks in the process in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that is obvious is that when Turkey has fulfilled all the requirements, when it can accept the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, Turkey will be a different country. However, the Treaty of Lisbon will also have brought about lasting changes to the European Union. We should be aware of this. As I have said, both sides must fulfil their undertakings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When things are good in the neighbourhood, they are also good for the people who live there. Turkey and Cyprus are neighbours. When they look over each others’ fences, it is not each other they see, but the Turkish Cypriots, who find themselves caught between two stools.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that all the people who live on Cyprus are once again truly able to live together, a solution is needed that requires all the neighbours to play their part. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon last week indicated a belief that a solution for Cyprus is possibly within reach. This Parliament has an important job to do in making a positive contribution to the situation on Cyprus, searching constructively for solutions and clearing obstacles instead of erecting them. Yes, Turkey must be made to make efforts to bring that solution closer. That is what we are calling for in the report on which we are about to vote. It is not just Turkey that has to make an effort, however. All the affected parties must play their part in creating a positive atmosphere in which a reliable solution can be found. Ultimately, that is, of course, what we all want: a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also be supportive in connection with the candidate country of Macedonia, when it comes to the issue of its name, so that negotiations can begin. As Member States, we must be careful to ensure that we are not part of the problem, but that we instead contribute to finding a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made a great deal of progress, and can act as an example for the other countries of the Balkans, whilst also offering an opportunity to increase stability in the region. We need to make an effort, here, to see the EU’s most important export products flourish: democracy, human rights, peace and security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Political will has been reflected in reforms of the public administration and judiciary and in the fight against corruption and organised crime. In the judiciary, there has been a growth in transparency, a reduction in the numbers of pending court proceedings and excessively long proceedings. One significant factor is the continuing exposure of war crimes, in which Croatia is fully cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal. Croatia is showing a good level of regulatory harmonisation with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. It is undergoing significant legislative and institutional changes with the aim of combating organised crime and the mafia and strengthening cross-border cooperation with law-enforcement authorities in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The banking sector in Croatia is sound, investors have confidence in the state of the economy, and macro-economic stability has been maintained. There is still a need to complete the programme of small-scale privatisations and reduce state interference in the economy. In my opinion, the reconciliation between ethnic Croats and ethnic Serbs, the improved safeguarding of minority rights and the integration of refugees, including the rebuilding of homes, are particularly deserving of praise. I therefore urge Croatia to further the development of a culture of political responsibility and for a public debate on membership and the consequences of accession, since only a third of the population currently consider accession to the EU to be beneficial. I would also like to congratulate the new commissioner, Mr Füle, and welcome him to the role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Turkey is the most Western of Eastern states and the most Eastern of Western states, so its unique role is not only European but also global.</p>
<p class="contents">Ankara must accelerate reforms, more determinedly seek compromise on the Cyprus problem and take further steps on reconciliation with Armenia.

In this decade, enlargement policy has been the European Union’s greatest success, along with the euro. That policy should not be held back. Furthermore, we cannot break the commitments we have made with candidate countries, although we should also respect the well-known principles of consolidation and conditionality.</p>
<p class="contents">We also should not forget the European Union's integration capacity or the need to communicate with citizens on the subject of enlargement and its advantages and consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the time restrictions, I shall just make a few brief comments. In principle, candidate countries should resolve beforehand any territorial disputes and similar issues they might have with each other and with Member States, so as not to later slow down the operation of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Turkey, I would particularly like to highlight how important it is for the rate of reforms – which are also necessary for Turkey itself – to be maintained and even increased.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the recent commitment Turkey has shown with regard to Nabucco, which is very important for energy diversification in Europe. However, I must admit that I was somewhat surprised by the gesture that the Turkish Government made last autumn in support of the Iranian authorities. Indeed, I believe that a candidate country’s foreign policy should be in line with that of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, last week, I read an interview with the Turkish Minister for European Affairs which seemed to suggest that Turkey had abolished visas for countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Libya. I was somewhat surprised by this because a candidate country should also be bringing its visa policy closer to that of the European Union, not moving in the opposite direction.</p>

<p class="contents">In the talks being conducted on the Cyprus question, Turkey, via Mr Talat, has tabled unacceptable proposals and remains intransigent and maximalist. That is why it is wrong to call on all the parties to support the negotiations under way. The party on which pressure needs to be exerted is Turkey as the occupying power. Turkey must immediately withdraw all Turkish troops, end the occupation and stop holding the Turkish-Cypriot community hostage, because it, not the Greek Cypriots, is responsible for the so-called isolation of Turkish Cypriots. Turkey needs to return the besieged town of Varosha and to stop illegal settlements and the encroachment on to Greek Cypriot property.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey holds the key to the solution to the Cyprus problem and progress with its accession. The small country of Cyprus asks for nothing more and nothing less than a solution in keeping with the European <span class="italic">acquis</span>, without derogations, and with the UN resolutions.

Macedonia has fulfilled the conditions and has been waiting for negotiations to start since 2005. Greece has had so much solidarity from the other 26 Member States that it should not now put a veto on starting negotiations with its neighbour Macedonia. The name issue is a purely bilateral question, even if the UN has given its help in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Croatia, I would like to say that this country is combating corruption to such an extent that other countries, including some within the EU, should take an example from it. My second point is that the return of the refugees, which Mr Boştinaru has just mentioned, has, in my opinion, been handled in an exemplary way. As Mr Swoboda said, many things cannot be resolved in the way that we imagine they will be.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. Croatia handed over all its wanted war criminals years ago. The documents from the homeland war which have been called for are either no longer available or have never existed. Therefore, a common sense approach is needed to these questions. The government is searching for the documents and it has set up a task force, but it cannot do more than look. If it does not find anything, then it is important to take a step forward, in the light of the fact that Croatia has been cooperating with the tribunal for years and, therefore, has, to a large extent, met the conditions. I hope very much that the chapter will soon be opened, so that the negotiations with Croatia can be completed by the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turkey, too, has made significant progress. If we look at Ukraine, we can realise the difference that the very prospect of accession can make. Turkey is welcome to membership on the basis of meeting the Copenhagen criteria. With a new Commissioner, there is no time to be lost in making Turkey start pulling its troops out of Cyprus and implementing the Ankara Protocol. I think this could be seen as a condition for proceeding with negotiations. As for myself, I could feel comfortable with Turkish accession when it is as easy to build a Christian church in Ankara as it is to erect a mosque in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is generally the ethnic conflicts that are discussed, and rightly so. There is still work to be done in this area and some difficulties remain. However, what people usually overlook is the fact that there are still significant problems in Turkey with regard to trade union and employee rights. The Turkish Government continues to oppose trade unions – in some circumstances even using the power of the police – which provide support for their members, in other words, for Turkish working people. This has happened recently in the dispute involving the Tekel workers. That is one of the comments that I would like to make. A democratic society must protect the rights of employees and trade unions and it is important to fight for these rights. The EU also supports these rights, in particular, in its role as a social European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second factor is privatisation. Turkey is adapting to the EU and this includes the area of privatisation. The Tekel employees, of whom 12 000 are currently on strike, are threatened with the loss of their jobs or have already lost them as a result of privatisation. However, it is not only the Tekel employees who work in the tobacco industry. Around 500 000 people employed in growing tobacco in south-eastern Turkey have lost their jobs in recent years, with the result that, having been one of the major producers and exporters of tobacco, Turkey has now become an importer. A week ago, I had the chance to go to Ankara and speak with the Tekel employees. If the process of cutting jobs and destroying whole sectors of industry continues as a result of privatisation, the people of Turkey will lose their enthusiasm for accession to the EU. Therefore, we must put the focus on the social aspect of the EU. I would like to emphasise that once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do, of course, wish you many other terms, Mr Füle, but it is my wish for you, that when you speak here at the end of this term, you will be able to meet us in a new, enlarged European Union consisting, perhaps, of even 30 Member States.</p>

The EU is calling on Turkey to do more in the area of minority rights, but instead of resolving the issue of the Kurds as it had said it would, Turkey is planning to ban the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP). For the fourth year in a row, the government in Ankara has failed to implement the additional protocol to the association agreement, but, via its ambassadors, it is calling on the major EU Member States to resolve the Cyprus question. In my opinion, the long-awaited negotiations on the Mediterranean island are not a cause for celebration, because the most recent Turkish Cypriot proposal goes against the existing consensus on some points, which means that it actually represents a step backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the positive results which the Spanish Presidency announced that we could expect. Turkey is not a part of Europe either geopolitically or in spiritual or cultural terms. Human rights, the rights of minorities and international law remain concepts that are foreign to Turkey. In my view, the only honest response which is in line with the wishes of EU citizens would be to bring the accession negotiations to an end and to aim for a privileged partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we are debating, among other things, Turkey’s progress towards Europe. Yesterday we debated the difficult economic situation faced by certain countries in the euro area, especially the critical situation faced by Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">These two debates intersect at one point, they have one common ground. That common ground is massive, inflexible defence spending by Greece, with around 5% of its gross domestic product allocated to military expenditure – and not because it wants to. Of course, part of this is spent honouring its obligations as a member of NATO. However, most of it is spent because we have to address a specific policy by a neighbouring country and candidate country, namely Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an official Turkish policy of threatening Greece with war, known as the <span class="italic">casus belli</span>, and it is not simply a paper threat; Turkey is in the habit of violating the airspace of and overflying even inhabited Greek islands in the Eastern Aegean.</p>
<p class="contents">This has to stop and this must be a strong message sent to Ankara by the European Parliament. If there are improvements on this, its progress towards Europe will regain momentum, together, of course, with all the other commitments which it must honour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is why I appeal to Member States and candidate countries not to promote bilateral conflicts to the level of the Union. Being a lawyer, I would like to recall that, through the interim accord between Greece and FYROM signed in September 1995, Greece agreed not to object to FYROM’s application to international or regional organisations if made under the name referred by the United Nations, which is FYROM. The Union’s institutions refer to this country as FYROM. These provisions are legally binding in terms of international law. Therefore, there is no legal basis for Greece to obstruct the country’s accession process. Decisions must be taken on the performance of the applicant country.</p>
<p class="contents">On this note, I support the debates on the progress made and the areas in which improvement is still needed. We need to talk about the merits and closely monitor the implementation of the reforms. Based upon the progress made, the Commission proposed that the country be given a date to start negotiations. I join the Commission and call on the Council to provide a starting date for accession negotiations at its summit in March 2010. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do appreciate this very well, but I would like to draw attention to a problem which has received too little emphasis in this debate. I am thinking of the problem of religious freedom, which is still restricted in Turkey, particularly towards Christians. In Turkey, we still have a problem with the obstacles faced by religious communities concerning their legal status. Christian communities, despite the introduction of the Law on Foundations, are having serious problems with regaining confiscated property. The Ecumenical Patriarchate has limited rights to train clergy and freely elect the Ecumenical Patriarch. I am very grateful to the rapporteur for emphasising all these aspects in the report. At the same time, I regret that this matter was completely ignored in Mr López Garrido’s speech. Mr López Garrido, I have a personal comment: ideology and human rights do not mix. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My concern is that in 2003, the UK Independence Party, of which I am a member, stated in this Parliament that there would be dire consequences regarding migrants from new Member States coming to our country, the United Kingdom. My fear is that, if Turkey joins, 70 million people will be allowed to come into the UK. The United Kingdom is full. We have millions of people unemployed. The pressure on our public services is incredible. The thought of Turkey joining is not on at all.</p>

We certainly need a discussion in our country about whether we should be in the European Parliament or not. I fear that Turkey joining will be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. I am convinced that we are now in a position where the whole European situation is about to crumble, with the euro and so forth. The addition of Turkey joining will just make matters far, far worse.</p>

Do we deem the cultural heritage of Europe important as a cohesive force? If the answer is ‘yes’, Turkey has no place in the European Union. Naturally, we should aim to establish the best possible partnership with them. Another important factor is that their accession would create a precedent.

It would be a positive sign if France and others were to ratify the Charter of Minority and Regional Languages, if Slovakia were to retract its measures discriminating against minorities (see the language law) and if Greece were to admit that minorities do live in its territory and guarantee their rights as individuals and communities. In Romania, there will hopefully be a law on minorities, though we are still far from having members of minorities in the top command of the army, and autonomy is feared more than the 14th Transnistrian Russian army.

There was to have been either a breakthrough in accession negotiations or an end of the talks. Today, talks are still in progress on further areas related to accession. The Spanish Presidency, it is true, is saying it wants Ankara to join the Community as soon as possible, but indications are growing that Ankara is redefining its place in the global order, and that its membership in the Community is not a priority. Lifting of visas for Jordan, Libya, Iran and Syria, a worsening of relations with Israel, a strengthening of relations with Sudan, the signing of an agreement to commence diplomatic relations with Armenia and blocking an understanding with Cyprus – all this shows that Ankara is increasingly orienting itself towards cooperation with its neighbours, even at the expense of weakening its position in the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the question of energy security and Turkey’s crucial geographical location mean that it is slowly becoming indispensable for securing European interests. It may, therefore, not be long before Turkey’s accession to the European Union is more important to us than to Turkey itself. I appeal, therefore, to the Commission and the Council to redefine Turkey’s perspectives for membership of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it needs more than a minute.</p>
<p class="contents">This story, going back to the late 1940s, is a sad story which ended in creating a false idea about them. I can assure you that Greeks are neither nationalists nor expansionists. All they do is resist the use of a name which is part of their own ancient historical and archaeological tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as a new independent state, is undergoing a retarded ethnogenic phase. Serious academics in Skopje do not support the nationalistic trends of their Prime Minister. They prefer to remain silent rather than expose themselves against the trendy phrase, which the Thaler report rightly remarks, is liable to increase tensions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like this Parliament and the new Commission to try and contribute with a solution to the name issue, not by stimulating the nationalistic tendencies of the FYROM Government, but by supporting the Greek view, which fights for a gentle compromise that would, finally, seem to satisfy the people of FYROM more than the people of Greece. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also believe that economic instruments are needed, along with regional, economic and commercial cooperation, including with regard to investments, which have already proven to be effective. I think that these instruments must be considered by the European Commission and the governments of Croatia and Macedonia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think we can say that the large majority of you has spoken in favour of the enlargement process as an essential part of European integration. As Mr Brok has said, enlargement has been a success for the European Union, and other Members have mentioned some of the examples of success in the enlargement process. It is also a vital element of progress towards democratic reform and of democratic deepening in those countries that are moving closer to the European Union, those that have begun their entry into the European Union and those which have the prospect of joining. As Mr Mauro has stressed, this always implies a commitment to meet the Copenhagen conditions, which is another element of broad consensus, and therefore to show full respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely agree with Mr Cashman when he said that the treatment of minorities is what singles a country out, and not its treatment of the majority, although that is important as well. This, therefore, is how we should measure respect for human rights and, as a result, compliance with the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point of general agreement was that for the Western Balkans, the European perspective is a fundamental element in their progress – as Mrs Giannakou and Mr Winkler pointed out – and this is not only in the interest of those countries but also, as Mrs Göncz has said, in the interest of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Croatia, we have also had general agreement on the need to open new chapters as soon possible, but it should be said that currently 28 out of 35 chapters have already been opened and that 17 of those have provisionally closed. The Spanish Presidency will continue to work to achieve new progress in the negotiations, together with the European Council and the Council, in order to bring them to their final phase soon. That is why I mentioned earlier that the accession meetings to be held with Croatia will begin immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Our expectation is that the membership negotiations roadmap will be completed this year, as the report’s author, Mr Swoboda, has proposed, and as some Members have requested, including Mr Hökmark, Mr Berlinguer and Mr Lisek, who expressed the hope that the Polish Presidency might see Croatia's accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So progress has been made with regard to Croatia, as Mr Poręba has emphasised. However, we still have work to do; there are shortcomings in the legal area, for example, as Mrs Serracchiani pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, we think we have reached an important closing stage of Croatia’s accession and we hope that the negotiations will be concluded and Croatia will join the Union as soon as possible, following the ratification process of the relevant European Union treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to Macedonia, the debate centred primarily on the question of its name. Obviously the name is not one of the Copenhagen requirements, but clearly good, neighbourly relations play a vital role in the process of shaping national policy in all the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Candidate countries, like Member States, must therefore show the utmost sensitivity in matters such as this. We also have to remember that the starting point for negotiations is unanimity, in other words, a unanimous agreement between existing Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution advocated earlier by Mr Posselt, Mr Kasoulides, Mrs Cornelissen, Mr Chatzimarkakis, Mrs Göncz and Mrs Paliadeli is rooted both in negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations and in bilateral contact between the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece. While this is, of course, a very important matter, the European Union itself does not actually take part in such discussions under the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment therefore, I do not think we can say precisely when this conflict will be resolved; nevertheless, I can certainly say that the Spanish Presidency joins in congratulating Prime Minister Gruevski and Prime Minister Papandreou on renewing a direct dialogue. This demonstrates leadership ability in both of them and will no doubt lead to an atmosphere and an attitude of openness, to which Mr Tremopoulos referred in his speech.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be able to carry these negotiations forward. The prospect of joining the EU has always been of great importance for the whole country, that is, for its ethnic groups as well, whether large or small.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to Turkey, a great many speeches have been made and I would like to begin by saying that negotiations are continuing at a reasonable pace – they have not been halted – and I say this in response to Mr Van Orden’s comment concerning the speed of those negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope to open other negotiation chapters during the Spanish Presidency. I have mentioned some of them, but naturally we cannot predict the rate of these negotiations because they depend on the progress of Turkey’s reforms and on whether Turkey meets the criteria. What is more, as you are all aware, in each case, at each stage and for each chapter of the process, there needs to be unanimous agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of human rights and the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria is a subject that has been mentioned in many speeches and which is clearly referred to in Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s report; and it has to be said that Turkey must make more effort in this area. It has to make more effort, and I say this in response to Mr Belder, Mr Salafranca, and others, and to Mr Angourakis and Mr Klute, who have spoken about promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">They are right, but it is also true to say that the negotiation process continues to be the European Union's principal means of influencing the progress that is made and, while progress has indeed been made, it remains insufficient. This has also been mentioned in speeches by other Members, such as Mr Obiols, Mrs Flautre, Mrs Lunacek, Mr Preda and Mr Balčytis. I think we need to remain very aware of that when we make a balanced assessment of our negotiations with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Cyprus has also been the subject of a great many speeches. Cyprus will, of course, be a decisive issue over coming months. It should be said that the negotiations currently under way between the leaders of the two communities on the island are positive and that a better atmosphere of trust has been established.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that resolving the Cyprus issue would eliminate this obstacle, or all of the obstacles, or at least some of the obstacles that might hinder Turkey’s progress towards accession and, whatever happens, it would send out an important, positive signal to the region as a whole, with reconciliation as the basic objective, as Mr Howitt so rightly put it.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree, of course, that Turkey has to comply with the additional protocol. There have been continuous calls for it to do so, and every time we have a dialogue with Turkey, the Council reminds it of that commitment, which must be honoured. On 8 December 2009, the Council adopted conclusions in which it was stated that if no progress were made on the issue, then the Council would maintain the measures adopted in 2006, which would have a permanent effect on the negotiations’ overall progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Koppa and Mr Salavrakos have also referred to other incidents: violations of air space and incidents in the Aegean Sea. So I repeat, neighbourly relations are an indispensable requirement for measuring Turkey’s progress in the negotiations. The Council’s 8 December conclusions, which I have mentioned many times, sent Turkey a message on that matter. I assure you that the Presidency is going to following the issue very closely and pursue it at all levels when appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, Madam President, the Presidency’s position on negotiations with Turkey is absolutely clear. We are in agreement with the renewed consensus on enlargement, which the Council decided in December 2006, and this means that the objective of the negotiations is certainly Turkey’s future accession to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Štefan Füle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, I am very grateful that I had such an early chance to participate in this exchange of views with you on the accession countries. I promised during my hearing that I would come to listen and to take your advice, and today’s debate was a clear proof of the richness, wisdom and insight that are assembled here in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make two general observations. First, I take the promises I made during the hearings very seriously. I am interested not in having two monologues, but in having a dialogue with this House which would reflect the true spirit of the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also make another general observation, and I referred to this a couple of times during my hearing. In talking to the candidate countries and the prospective candidate countries, I always underlined the following four principles. The first is strict commitment to the Copenhagen criteria; they are non-negotiable. Secondly, a strict commitment to fundamental freedoms and rights, including religious and minority rights and, of course, women’s rights. Thirdly, the process being honest and reflecting credibility on both sides and at all levels. Fourthly, I will never underestimate the issue of integration capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">On Croatia, both Parliament’s resolution and the Commission’s position underline that Croatia can count on Parliament and the Commission as reliable allies. If the country manages to deliver on all outstanding conditions, I remain confident that accession negotiations can be concluded this year. The Commission, and I trust the current and future presidencies as well as the European Parliament, will support Croatia in reaching its goal.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, let me stress once again that the country earned a Commission recommendation to start accession negotiations on the basis of its own merits. Nonetheless, the country continues to face many pressing challenges, including the political criteria. As was pointed out during the debate, there is now a window of opportunity to resolve the name issue, and I am fully committed to supporting the ongoing talks.</p>
<p class="contents">On Turkey, we are all aware that we do not have an easy way ahead of us, either for Turkey or for the European Union, as was clearly stated by many during the debate. I know, however, that the Turkish Government is still committed to the democratic opening. Who would have imagined only five years ago Turkish society and politicians openly and intensively discussing the Kurdish issue, civil-military relations, the reopening of the Halki seminar or relations with Romania?</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I remain concerned about restrictions on press freedom and media pluralism. Further legal amendments are needed to protect journalists, human rights activists and politicians from prosecution and conviction for the expression of non-violent opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the accession negotiations, the opening of the important environment chapter last December is an encouraging development, bringing the number of open chapters to 12. I am hopeful that we will be able to open more chapters this year. However, Turkey will need to make additional efforts in order to be able to fulfil the demanding benchmarks. It is therefore important that the necessary preparations are being continued with rigour.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also welcomes the reinforced dialogue with Turkey on migration, which should lead to concrete achievements, in particular, as regards readmission and border controls. In response to a specific question from one of your colleagues, let me say that the Commission is aware of the recent developments concerning Turkish lifting of visa requirements for Lebanon and Syria. The Commission’s Director-General responsible for these issues will be in Ankara next week for talks. This will be one of the issues he will discuss on that occasion and I will report on these discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also add, having been requested, the following position of the Commission. All measures that the Commission has proposed and undertaken have always been aimed at ending the isolation of the Turkish-Cypriot community as a means of facilitating the reunification of Cyprus in line with the Council conclusions of April 2004. We are implementing the EUR 259 million aid package for the sustainable social and economic development of the Turkish-Cypriot community and its full participation in the European Union following a settlement and reunification. The Green Line Regulation is facilitating economic and personal contacts between Turkish-Cypriots and Greek-Cypriots. The Trade Regulation, on special conditions for trade for the Turkish-Cypriot community, remains with the Council for consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming back to Turkey, the reform process is to continue and the European Union should continue to encourage the process and progress. The Commission remains committed to the accession process with Turkey. Our leverage and influence in Turkey will become all the more credible and stronger if our commitments remain unambiguous.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking forward to a very fruitful and close cooperation over the next five years.</p>

I recall that in December 2006, negotiations were partially suspended due to the country’s refusal to apply the Customs Union with the EU to Cyprus. The conflict with Cyprus must be resolved and the country must continue to make progress in terms of democracy and the protection of human rights, combating corruption, improving freedom of the press, the need for political transparency and swifter and more effective justice, consolidating anti-discrimination laws relating to gender, sexual orientation and ethnic and religious minorities, and reforming the civil service. The Turkish Government continues to demonstrate the political will to proceed with reforms, and it has substantially increased fundamental freedoms and democratic development within the country. We must therefore continue to make progress in negotiations aimed at securing the accession of Turkey as a country with a crucial role as a mediator in conflicts between Israel and Palestine and as a platform for Iraq and Iran to find common ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These documents do not oppose Turkey’s theoretical future entry into the EU; however, I am very happy to welcome the findings that Parliament intends to make known regarding Turkey’s supposed lack of progress. Those who, like myself, are opposed to Ankara joining the EU find in them confirmation of their own traditional objections to the accession: in Turkey, there are still restrictions on fundamental freedoms, human rights violations, an aggressive attitude towards Cyprus and Greece, and discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities – all of which are problems that Europe clearly cannot ignore. And all this compounds the usual concerns about the cultural and geographical differences between Turkey and Europe, and about the problems that would be caused by the admission of a country that shares borders with over 80 million inhabitants: factors that will continue to reinforce my unshakable conviction that it is not right for Turkey to enter a Europe whose unity depends, above all else, on the spirit of Christianity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, discussion of Turkey’s future membership of the EU cannot be left to one side. Every expansion involves budgetary considerations as to whether the accession of a given country to the EU will bring a contribution or whether financial losses will prevail. I am afraid that in the current crisis situation with the Common Agricultural Policy and, by implication, the European budget, we cannot permit an expansion involving a country in which 7 million of the inhabitants rely on agriculture for their livelihood (in the EU, the figure is 10.4 million). For the purposes of comparison: under current conditions, the expenditure for Turkey up to 2025 would be around EUR 10 billion, while for all 10 of the new Member States in the ‘eastern expansion’ it would be up to EUR 8 billion. Direct payments to Turkish farmers and payments for rural development and market support would, under the current legislative arrangements, spell doom for European agriculture and farmers. In view of the enormous size, number of inhabitants and economic situation of this candidate country, the accession of Turkey to the EU would impose an enormous burden on the budget together with a 9% decline in per capita GDP for the EU. For these reasons, we must discuss again and in greater detail Turkey’s accession to the EU, together with related reforms to the CAP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much welcome the fact that the presidential and local elections in March 2009 went smoothly. This is an indication of the growing democratisation throughout the entire region which was reflected in Macedonia. Macedonia has met all the criteria for liberalising the visa regulations and, therefore, from 19 December 2009 onwards, its citizens have visa-free status. This represents a major step forward. However, Macedonia still has a number of reforms to implement. I very much hope that we can use the experience which we gathered during the first phase of the eastern enlargement of the EU to help it in this process. In this context, I am thinking of the implementation of institutional reforms, where political foundations and a range of different NGOs have achieved so much. There are two areas where we should strengthen our cooperation with regard to transformation and EU standards. These are reform in the public administration, in the judiciary and in the police. Personally, I would like to see the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece put aside in the immediate future. It is important that progress towards the unification of Europe is not brought to a standstill because of bilateral disagreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Croatia’s accession to NATO in April 2009 has definitely strengthened her claim for accession to the EU. Stabilisation in what is known historically as the Balkan Cauldron will be guaranteed only by Croatia’s accession.

I hope also that Croatia’s recognition of Kosovo will not cause an increase in tension in the Western Balkans, in particular, with Serbia, which is now, understandably, showing concern.

Turkey’s 2009 development report points out shortcomings in the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria, with a particular emphasis on political criteria, which include the implementation of democracy and the rule of law, human rights and the protection of the rights of minorities. In the development report, it was noted that, through the development aid instrument, EUR 567 million have been allocated to Turkey in the past year. The allocations were, for the most part, aimed at implementing outstanding reforms in the political and justice systems, as well as the development of civil society. At the same time, it was made clear that the use of these instruments had been decentralised, which means that the Turkish authorities administered the allocated aid, following the Commission’s accreditation. Since they are interested in carrying out the membership negotiations for Turkey as quickly as possible, which means that the current shortcomings need to be resolved, the Council and the Commission should have an accurate synopsis of concrete actions by the Turkish Government carried out in order to achieve this objective. On its homepage, in visual form, the Commission has indeed put some projects for ending the use of child labour, acquiring a basic education, involving people with disabilities in society, and setting up a confidential line for women in Turkey suffering from domestic violence. However, are these actions enough to create the necessary grassroots public support for the immediate and successful implementation of the necessary reforms? In the light of the contents of the development report, what kind of additional urgent measures or projects have been planned to overcome the obstacles that have arisen in problematic areas? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe came into the European family at that time. It also then became clear that the ‘great enlargement’ would have to be continued, with the accession of several more countries of the region. In 2007, Rumania and Bulgaria became Member States of the European Union. However, the accession of these countries cannot be thought of as the end of European Union enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the country which is closest to acceding to the EU is Croatia. I fully support completion of negotiations by Croatia as quickly as possible in order to achieve the quickest possible accession of the country to the European Union. I appeal to both sides of the negotiations for maximum flexibility and the will to reach agreement. In addition, I appeal to the Croatian side to increase efforts at accommodating Community requirements in such areas as the organisation of public administration and the judiciary and for improvement of mechanisms concerned with the effective fight against organised crime and corruption. Furthermore, I would like to add my voice to appeals calling on Croatia to show a maximum of goodwill in cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support these actions, and I support Turkey’s accession to the EU, provided, of course, that the conditions for membership are met in full. Today, though, it worries me that recently, positive messages concerning the reforms implemented have begun to fall short, and there are still severe problems in Turkey with implementing legal norms, particularly sections that would establish women’s rights, non-discrimination, freedom of speech and belief, a zero-tolerance approach to torture, and anti-corruption measures.

I would like to draw attention to notorious cases of violations of the rights of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost daily, the press informs us of further murders of women, which are known as ‘honour killings’. The press is currently highlighting the case of 16-year-old Medine Memi, who was cruelly murdered by her own father and grandfather. It is shocking that these two took the girl’s life because she had been talking to boys, but the way in which this atrocity was carried out is even more shocking. Autopsy results show that Medine, who was buried in a chicken pen, was still alive at the time of her burial and was conscious to the very end. The unimaginable suffering of the dying teenager was inflicted as satisfaction for ‘bringing dishonour’ on the family. It is horrifying that the case of Medine is not an isolated incident, but a widespread and barbaric phenomenon. The girl, fearing for her life, had reported her fears to the police several times – unsuccessfully, because she was sent home each time.</p>
<p class="contents">Murder, which has been deeply rooted in Turkish tradition for generations, is often interpreted favourably for men, who are supposedly acting to clear the disgraced honour of their family. A country which has not yet managed to deal with this problem continues to be separated from Europe by a broad divide, because Europe stands in defence of fundamental values. This difference is a serious obstacle in building a common identity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a pity that it took an economic crisis to motivate this step. The Achilles heel is the existence of tax havens in various island states, a number of which even receive support from EU funds. It is therefore up to us to confront this issue and to bring to bear the full weight of the EU.

A state can raise its taxes only up to a certain level before the money begins to go abroad and the revenues dwindle. As Milton Friedman put it, competition between governments in their delivery of services and their levels of taxation is every bit as productive as competition between companies and individuals. This is why it is so distressing to see the European Union going down the road towards tax harmonisation and the export of high costs from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">If there was one theme which came out of these recent Commission nomination hearings, it was the desire for a dedicated revenue stream for the European Union and for a measure of tax harmonisation. That explains why the European Union’s share of world GDP is dwindling; why we have fallen from 36% 20 years ago to 25% today and we are scheduled to fall to 15% in 10 years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">The good news is that the electorate does not like it. Like the people of Massachusetts, the people of Europe do not want taxation without representation, and I am sure they will vote accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, when the Cayman Islands tries to do this, people right across the EU – politicians in this place – complain about it. It does not avoid taxation. What it tries to do is avoid double taxation.

There was all this talk about the need to put an EU flag on aid to Haiti and about the need to establish the principle of a European civil protection force. Baroness Ashton came in for a lot of criticism for not having been there to put a European face on things.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, of course, the Americans were delivering real aid in the most extraordinarily swift manner. And what thanks did they get? They were accused by a French Minister of having occupied the country. Neatly, we see how the American’s place is always in the wrong in this House. If he intervenes, he is imperialist. If he does not, he is isolationist.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just stand back and ask whether the European Union does not have rather more pressing concerns closer to home than whether it puts flags on things in the Caribbean. Greece is on the verge of fiscal collapse. We are about to mandate a bail-out in plain violation of Article 125 of the treaties. When we have put our own House in order, then perhaps we will be in a position to lecture others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I endorsed the resolution, which calls for development of effective tools for the fight against this phenomenon and for better coordination of action between Member States and the appropriate operational bodies of the European Union, in hope of achieving salutary effects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we voted in favour, because we believe that it is vital that Parliament express its strong disappointment with the agreement that came out of Copenhagen. That agreement is not binding, although there is an implicit or stated commitment for us to reach a binding agreement within the current year. Yet the problem is getting worse, time is slipping away and we have to take up this stated commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I would like to appeal to the European Union to stop using others as an excuse. It is very easy to refrain from acting because others are doing nothing. We have taken a strong stance, however, and we have to proceed from that. This making of excuses is irresponsible and indefensible. There are many things we can do to maintain our strong stance. One of these steps might be the redefinition of the EU budget to ensure our own funds to combat climate change. This has not been done so far. Another step would be to allocate additional funds to help developing countries, rather than removing or cutting the existing humanitarian aid. Otherwise, there is a cynical attempt to resolve the problems of climate change while simultaneously unleashing and ignoring other problems that will jeopardise their survival. We cannot resolve additional problems without additional resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to make a commitment, and we cannot afford to wait any longer to do so. We took a firm stance at Copenhagen. Let us be able to live up to it, because these are real problems and real people, and we have to deal with them now. That is why we are taking on this responsibility here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The result was a long way from the EU position and from the position that we need to be in to protect the climate. The only positive aspect is the recognition of the two-degree goal, as this could lead to the necessary reduction commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now ask ourselves what we can learn from the failure of the negotiations and what we should do next. It is important to have a period of reflection and to take a critical look at different points on the route that we have been following. We have to ask ourselves how we can make progress jointly with other states. How can we ensure that the EU is also present at the table when the US, China and India meet to negotiate a compromise? How can we negotiate more effectively with the developing countries and emerging economies? Is it essential that these negotiations take place under the aegis of the UN?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say how pleased I am that I was able to vote for the resolution, because in my opinion, it continues to emphasise the pioneering role played by the European Union. We must now answer these questions and continue on our current path, both from a domestic and an international perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, many experts believe that the notorious hockey stick-shaped exponential global warming curve is, in reality, a graphic fabrication. Glaciers are not melting everywhere. In any event, contrary to what the IPCC announced, they are not melting in the Himalayas. Water levels are not about to rise and cover Bangladesh, quite the contrary. The Ganges delta is rising as a result of alluvial deposits. White bears, which are said to be disappearing, have never been as prolific as they are today. The alternation of hot and cold periods has occurred several times in our history, including quite recently, independently of any human activity. It is probably astronomic in origin and not caused by the alleged greenhouse gases.</p>

How are we to explain this difference between the two Unions?</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to be that you have to look for an explanation in the foundational DNA of the two polities. The US was founded out of a popular revolt against a remote and autocratic government and against high taxation, whereas, of course, the European Union – in line 1 of Article 1 of its foundational treaty – commits itself to ever-closer union. In doing so, it sets its face against the competition, the external curve, which is the main constraint on government. That is why we now see – acting according to its foundational doctrines – this intolerance for tax competition masquerading as an attack on tax havens, by which it in fact means jurisdictions which have run a more efficient system and kept their taxes lower. The reality is that tax competition – tax havens, if you insist on calling them that – is the major way to keep the government small and the citizen large and free. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You only have to look at the evidence in a number of Member States to consider the answer. We have countries that have run up big debts. In my own country, the British Government has been spending money it does not have and now has to plug a massive gap in the budget. Even before the financial crisis, we had countries that are known not to be collecting sufficient taxes to cover the public services that are needed by the citizens of those countries. We are also spending taxpayers’ monies on propping up companies that have failed and are being badly governed, as well as badly run banks.</p>
<p class="contents">So, really, what should we be doing? We should be encouraging a solution in the first place to all the problems I have outlined, but we should also never forget that tax competition is a very good thing to have because it encourages governments to take less of our money and to provide services more efficiently for its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, taking action against those who commit fraud should not be used as a backdoor way by those who want to increase tax harmonisation across Europe for those of us who honestly pay our taxes. This Parliament has, for a long time, defended the right of Member States to have their own say over corporate tax rates and we should continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it suggests an EU-level levy on taxation areas. We have resisted plans for this Parliament to have Europe-wide taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is on sharing information. Yes, we should share some information, but we should always think how much, for what purpose and for what benefit, and we should not consider that all circumstances are identical. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although some considerations may be well-intentioned, let us not forget that too much protection destroys all protection. However, the stumbling block for my group has once again been the right to free social abortion, which is presented as an easy birth control method.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group does not disagree with the observation that women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights. We also believe that young girls in particular must be better informed in the area of sexual and productive health. However, to demand in the same sentence ‘easy access to contraception and free abortion’ proves that the authors of this text are not making the essential distinction between these two services and are putting them on the same footing as far as birth control is concerned. We do not agree with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, under the principle of subsidiarity, legislation in the field of legal abortion is the responsibility of the Member States. It is therefore not our responsibility in the EU to interfere in this issue. We have gone to great lengths to reach a consensus with the author of the report, Mr Tarabella, and we have done so in the interests of combating all forms of discrimination that have not yet been eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that a majority in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality – and also unfortunately in Parliament – has sought to instigate political and ideological disputes instead of concentrating on what should have been the main objective of our activities: to strive to achieve equal treatment and opportunities for men and women. I am sorry that, for these reasons, my group has not been able to vote in favour of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much has been achieved in this matter, but there are still areas where women are treated worse than men. We still earn less, women are at greater risk of poverty and it is more difficult for women to develop an academic or business career. Parliament’s report takes note of these problems, and stresses the necessity of introducing specific measures which will ensure equal participation of men and women in the job market and in education.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I regret that I could not support this proposal. I voted against the report, because it includes provisions designed to make abortion generally available in the European Union. Firstly, these matters are among those which are exclusively for Member States to decide. Secondly, the question of unwanted pregnancies is a huge problem, but we cannot bring in legislation which is going to treat abortion as a free means of contraception. Neither can I agree that abortion should exempt people from thinking about the consequences and responsibilities associated with becoming sexually active.

This is followed by a single line about contraception and the termination of pregnancy, abortion, two topics which are actually very different, and which need to be considered very differently. In the case of abortion, for example, we need to focus our attention and our thoughts on the sanctity of life.</p>

Perhaps they have not read it. In a number of the proposals, it interferes with the exclusive powers of the Member States, especially concerning their pro-family policies and ethically sensitive areas. Moreover, do they really want to set up and finance some form of new institution for monitoring violence against women in the EU? Do they really not know that the Union has instruments, an office and legislation for monitoring adherence to the human rights both of men and women? Do they really believe that we need a charter of women’s rights alongside the already existing and binding Charter of Fundamental Rights of all European Citizens? The report also refers to the so-called Barcelona targets, although these are contrary to the recommendations of experts, because infants and toddlers need to have full-time family care at that age, not to be dumped in nurseries on the basis of recommendations from Barcelona. Nurseries should only be the last resort. The recommendations in the report may not be binding, but human stupidity is contagious and Parliament should therefore not support such things. There were only 75 abstentions and I applaud the fact that 253 People’s Party members voted against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It says, ‘men and women shall be given equal pay for equal work’. Now, that sounds pretty straightforward. We all think we understand what that means.</p>
<p class="contents">But what has happened in the subsequent decades is that, through a process of judicial activism, the European Court has progressively extended the meaning of that phrase beyond anything that a reasonable person would assume. First, it defined ‘equal pay’ as meaning equal pension rights and equal holidays and so on. Then it defined ‘equal work’ as being work of equivalent value. How is an employer supposed to judge that? Is it a question of how hard it looks like someone is working? Do they have to factor in the availability of suitably qualified applicants? Then, in the South-West Trains case in Britain, it was extended to look at the rights of spouses of same-sex unions. Now we are talking about reproductive rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an argument for all of these things. You can take the view that the state ought not to regulate contracts between employers and employees or you can take the view that we need this legislation. But, whichever side you are on, surely that is an argument that ought to be had by elected representatives who we can vote for and vote against. It is outrageous for them to be imposed on us by a court. A court with a mission is a menace; a supreme court with a mission is a tyranny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to point out that matters related to abortion are something to be decided by individual Member States.

In 1978, Kenya banned the hunting of elephants and that decision was followed by an almost total destruction of elephant herds in Kenya. Round about the same time – in 1979 – Rhodesia, as it was still called, made elephants the property of whoever’s land they were roaming on. Result – explosion of elephant numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House do not think of the elephant in the way that the African does. We are not threatened by it; it does not trample our crops; it does not destroy our villages; and it does not damage human health. The only way to prevent local populations from doing the logical thing, which is to eliminate a dangerous menace, is by giving them an incentive in treating it as a renewable resource. This, of course, is what Rhodesia – now Zimbabwe – successfully did. Environmental policy should recognise the basic Aristotelian wisdom that that which nobody owns, nobody will care for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As first vice-chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and as rapporteur of a report adopted in September 2008 on VAT fraud, I have repeatedly argued the case for effective combating of VAT fraud, as this constitutes a major issue in terms of the income of the Member States and the proper functioning of the internal market. A common and particularly serious form of this fraud is known as carousel VAT fraud. The total amount of uncollected income is estimated at between EUR 20 and 100 billion per annum. That is a huge sum, and one that could certainly be put to good use in times of economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Criminals active in this area are particularly inventive. It has recently come to light that they are also pursuing their criminal activities within the emissions trading scheme (ETS). The transfers of emission rights between taxable parties within the ETS, which takes place entirely electronically, are regarded as services and are taxable in the country in which the recipient is established. Traders purchase carbon credits from VAT-free sources in other Member States and then sell them on to companies in their own Member State at a price including VAT. Missing traders then fail to remit the VAT to the national exchequer. It is crucial that we tackle this kind of crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I discern an error in it. For example, subject A sold something to subject B. Subject B sold it to subject C. Subject C sold it to the end consumer or non-payer of VAT. Meanwhile, subject A does not pay VAT, as he is not the end-seller. Only subject C selling the final goods to the consumer pays VAT. The crux of this is that subject B is not taxed at all although the basis of his business is to buy low and sell high. Therefore, it is being proposed that subject B should pay VAT on the price difference to the state’s treasury. This scheme has many positive points, with one exception: no one will apply to the treasury for a VAT refund, but if subject C is a fraudster, then he simply will not pay VAT as the final seller. In other words, by applying the reverse charge VAT system, there will not be a negative balance, as no one will apply for a VAT refund and I feel that it will be very easy to administer this scheme, as state tax inspectorates will very easily be able to reveal the difference in the prices of goods. If I am mistaken, I would be very grateful for a written reply on the suitability or inadequacy of the scheme I have proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tax fraud is an important problem in terms of the smooth operation of the internal market and puts the Member States’ tax revenues at risk. That is why several of them have asked to be allowed to combat fraudulent mechanisms using a reverse charge mechanism targeted at certain sectors susceptible to fraud and certain goods. The most common form of fraud is where a VAT-registered supplier invoices supplies of goods and then disappears without paying the VAT owing on them, while leaving buyers (also VAT-registered) with valid invoices which allow them to deduct their VAT. The national Ministers of Finance do not therefore collect the VAT owing on the goods in question and have to reimburse the next trader upstream in the VAT chain for the VAT paid by them. Thus, the Member States loses twice. That is why I voted in favour of this legislative resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only references – which anyhow are already in the Commission’s proposal – concern the Roma population. The report’s request that the reference to the Roma should not preclude interventions to help other socially marginalised groups offers no guarantee that other individuals who are ‘socially marginalised’, because of particularly difficult economic, work-related or family situations, can benefit from the portion of ERDF that is to go towards housing policies. Lastly, according to the report presented to Parliament, the power to determine the criteria applied to establish which part of the ERDF can be assigned to helping marginalised communities should lie with the European Commission: this provision seems to allow the Commission alone broad discretionary powers in determining the aforementioned criteria; criteria on which the extent and the scale of the measure will effectively depend, at a time when Parliament will have no foreseeable way of acting and expressing its views.

Up until now, interventions in the housing sector could only take place within the scope of urban-development projects relating to the renovation of housing. In my view, this criterion is unreasonable and discriminatory given that, as is the case in Portugal, the majority of these families live in shelters in rural areas. These are the people most in need, and they should not be excluded by reason of their location. I welcome the amendment made by Parliament, which supports territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, unlike the European Commission’s initial proposal, which restricted its implementation to the new Member States, these new regulations widen the scope of implementation to all Member States, thus avoiding senseless discrimination between marginalised European families. This is a global problem, and it affects thousands of families all over Europe! This situation is particularly severe in Portugal due to the economic crisis that it is experiencing, and the extreme poverty of many families. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, until cofinancing is covered by the state, the proprietors of buildings and home owners have to pay the same absolute amount they paid until renovation. The reason is that often, the proprietors of premises and home owners can neither cover cofinancing with their own money nor obtain a bank loan for this. I welcome the second point of this initiative – to direct funds earmarked for renovation to rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Most private houses in villages are heated autonomously, meaning that heating is not paid for in a centralised way and therefore it is proposed that an absolute monthly amount should be set, which in time, could cover the cofinancing of these homes. This would make it easier for the Member States to legally implement the cofinancing for rural home renovation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now more than ever, we need to help each other in this field. The mobility of taxpayers, the number of cross-border transactions and the globalisation of financial instruments have evolved considerably. It is hard for the Member States to assess the amount of taxes and duties correctly. This increasing difficulty is having repercussions on the functioning of the tax systems and resulting in double taxation, which encourages tax fraud and evasion, while controls remain the responsibility of the national authorities. This is putting the smooth operation of the internal market at risk. Automatic exchange of information between the Member States would be mandatory for directors’ fees, dividends, capital gains, royalties and life assurance products not covered by other EU legal instruments relating to the exchange of information and similar measures and the resultant pensions, property ownership and revenue. In order to improve the exchange of information between the various national authorities, it is also proposed to establish monitoring of cases in which the Member States have refused to provide information or to carry out an administrative enquiry.

National provisions relating to recovery only apply within the territory of each Member State. The administrative authorities are unable to recover taxes and duties themselves outside their own Member State. At the same time, the mobility of people and capital is increasing, and fraudsters take advantage of the territorial limitation of the competences of the national authorities to organise their insolvency in countries in which they have tax debts. The first provisions concerning mutual assistance for recovery were established in Directive 76/308/EEC (consolidated in Directive 2008/55/EC) on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures. However, this instrument proved to be inadequate in terms of responding to changes in the internal market over the last 30 years. It is therefore necessary to repeal the current directive and make provision for an improved system of assistance for recovery within the internal market that will guarantee fast, effective and uniform procedures throughout the European Union.

The human distress caused by the Haiti earthquake is on a massive scale: hundreds of thousands are dead or injured, and Port-au-Prince is almost completely destroyed. The number of those in need of outside assistance is estimated at two to three million.</p>
<p class="contents">While the sympathies of Europeans are with the relatives of the victims, there is a need to act. The large­scale and prompt commitments in the form of assistance from the EU are obviously vital. The tardy reaction on the part of the new foreign affairs administration has provoked amazement, with good reason. It is obvious that the EU High Representative must be responsible in future for ensuring that the Union reacts faster and with greater coordination. Haiti will need help for a long time. Its wounds need tending and its homes need building one by one.</p>
<p class="contents">The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed the idea that no distress can be greater than what a single person can suffer. I imagine that he meant something like this: there is no greater unit of consciousness in the world than the consciousness of a single individual. You cannot tot up pain. There is no aggregate consciousness that would suffer more distress than a single one. The distress of the masses is always the distress of the single person. Therein also lies hope. Mother Teresa is reported to have said that if she had ever considered the masses, she would not have achieved anything. If I succeed in helping one person, I will be helping the greatest possible unit: one person’s entire world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Humanitarian aid must not stop only at reconstruction of the island, but must involve restructuring of the social relations which operate there, in a spirit of respect for human dignity and social justice.

In Haiti, only the United States was able to provide effective humanitarian aid without bureaucratic delay. It is also clear that the fastest and most efficient humanitarian agencies are those which are regularly condemned in resolutions by this illustrious House: the Catholic Church and humanitarian initiatives by Christian organisations. In this resolution, which I support fully, Parliament calls on the international community to ensure that the Haitian people and their government are the main actors in the reconstruction process, so that they can be masters of their own destiny. Members are also supporting EU action to re-launch local food production by restoring damaged infrastructures and providing the necessary materials (seed, fertiliser and tools) to small farmers, especially for spring sowing, which starts in March and represents 60% of national food production. At present, while the international community is investing in establishing earthquake-proof infrastructures, I should like to highlight the fact that religious buildings have also been hit and that international funds should also be allocated to the reconstruction of churches and seminaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the mullahs will not stop persecuting Christians and will not condemn the conditions which are reserved for Christians. Conversion to Christianity is considered as a form of apostasy and is punished by the death penalty. Unfortunately, the European Parliament does not have the courage to condemn the situation of the Christian martyrs in Iran. Pope Jean-Paul II said: ‘Persecution includes various types of discrimination against believers and against the whole community of the Church. Such forms of discrimination are often practised at the same time as is recognised the right to religious liberty and to freedom of conscience, and this in the law of individual countries as well as in declarations of an international nature ... Today, besides prison, concentration camps, forced labour camps, and expulsion from one’s country, there are other punishments less known but more subtle: not violent death but a kind of civil death, not only isolation in prisons or in camps, but social discrimination or permanent restriction of personal liberty.’ If Parliament wants to take its call for respect for human rights seriously, it should take a clearer stand in favour of Christians persecuted in Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main area of trafficking involving children, in particular, girls and women, has not changed for many years. Sexual exploitation in conditions akin to slavery is particularly prevalent in Eastern Europe, which is like a transit route for trafficking human beings to the west.

The current legal framework within the Union for combating human trafficking is insufficient, so it is essential that the European Union, drawing upon the mandate provided by the Treaty of Lisbon, undertake much more vigorous action against this phenomenon, with particular regard for the protection of, and assistance to, groups at risk, especially children. In this sense, the initiative to establish an EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator is welcome, and the fact that the motion calls for Member States to impose deterrent sentences reflecting the severity of the crime is also positive. As a very important development, the motion for a resolution stipulates that the victim’s consent to exploitation is irrelevant in terms of a prosecution, and that assistance is to be provided to the victim irrespective of his or her willingness to take part in the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to involve civil society as much as possible in institutional action to eliminate human trafficking, and to initiate information and awareness campaigns for the groups most at risk. Hopefully, Member States will soon implement this integrated approach covering prevention, sanctions and victim protection in their own legislation, and by ratifying the appropriate legal instruments, they will take a major step towards the elimination of modern-age slavery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number of victims of this modern form of slavery rises from year to year. The detection rate for this type of crime is very low. Therefore, I endorse the resolution of the European Parliament on preventing trafficking in human beings. Human trafficking must be fought using all possible means, beginning with a thorough and comprehensive information campaign to show the scale of the phenomenon and make society sensitive to the issue. Giving incidental, individual items of information about cases of human trafficking which have been uncovered is not sufficient. Every time, it is also essential to give the addresses of institutions involved in the fight against this practice.</p>
<p class="contents">A report presented in January 2010 by the Legal Aid Centre and the La Strada Foundation entitled ‘Preventing Trafficking in Women from Central and Eastern Europe. Information – Prevention – Identification – Intervention’ points out that, in Poland, procedures to guarantee the victims of human trafficking their rights are not being applied. One of the biggest problems is the protracted work on adding a modern definition of human trafficking to the Penal Code. In 2005, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings was signed in Warsaw. It took lawyers as long as three years to ratify it. Today, we still do not have a binding definition of human trafficking, which hinders preparatory and judicial proceedings, and so hinders the observance of human rights in Poland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This matter will have repercussions for generations to come and so requires firm, guiding, immediate and sensible action such as the EU has taken with other issues, for example, the financial crisis.

However, despite its ambition, the last climate conference in Copenhagen was a failure for all those who were determined to reach a binding agreement. This result is far from the EU’s position on the matter, and it is also far from what is needed to protect the climate. Given the disappointing outcome of the Copenhagen Summit, Parliament wants to send a clear signal to the European public and the world that it remains committed to fighting climate change. We are now preparing the way for the next conference in Mexico, where there should be a greater effort towards commitment from all parties. We cannot repeat the same errors that occurred in Copenhagen. We must ask ourselves what went wrong during those negotiations and think about how to proceed if we are to include the US, China and India. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of seriously analysing the part that the EU itself played in this failure, the majority of this House persists in picking scapegoats such as China (whose per capita atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide are less than half those of the EU), and now the countries of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America. This position is based solely on the blindness and partisanship of the most prominent politicians, and it undermines and subverts what actually happened in Copenhagen. Importantly, it insists on the effectiveness of market instruments such as trading in emission licences, while ignoring their ineffectiveness and the perversity that has already been shown in their use. Once again, necessary discussion about the so-called flexible mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism goes by the wayside.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the need to respect the sovereignty of developing countries in defining and implementing the so-called adaptation strategies is rejected. No fair and sustainable solution to the problem of climate change or other environmental problems can come out of the irrational system that caused them in the first place.

The main weakness of COP 15 was a failure to appreciate: the sensitivity of third countries and developing countries, and also some EU countries, to ‘climate justice’; the fact that the two greatest superpowers, the USA and China, are competing with each other both economically and militarily; and the fact that the ‘ambitious’ plans to limit CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions were based on the paradigm of anthropogenic climate warming, which does not have a great deal of scientific credibility. The alarmist statements of the IPCC should be regarded as highly irresponsible, because political and economic decisions which are based on them will affect many future generations. These decisions must not, therefore, be based on the opinions of people who are putting into practice a thesis which has been established in advance – the theory that it is mankind which is causing global warming. The scientific credibility of the IPCC is undermined by such things as the Climategate affair, the falsification of global temperature trends (Russia and Australia) and the Glaciergate affair.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, all legal regulations which are unfavourable to development of the European economy and are based on statements of the IPCC should be reviewed immediately. On the matter of climate change, which is so important for the whole of civilisation, the time has come for the European Commission to base its actions on its own meta-analysis of climate research, which should be carried out by a team of climatologists which is independent of the opinions of the Commission and free from all political pressure. These last two stipulations are missing from the resolution, and I therefore voted against its adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is difficult to resist the impression that in Copenhagen, world leaders were playing a risky game, and were not trying to work out the best agreement, but to blame the other side for the lack of an agreement. It is worrying that the EU, despite having worked out a common position, was not able to use it as a platform for an agreement with other countries. The European Union must begin efforts to ensure that the COP 16 conference in Mexico will end with success. The climate agreement which the EU should promote must have three basic features: it should be legally binding, should show solidarity and should be ambitious. The decision made during the EU summit in Seville, according to which the EU will not limit its emissions in 2020 by more than 20% in comparison with 1990, should be viewed with alarm.</p>
<p class="contents">The condition for increasing the reduction goal to 30%, which is that other countries must first make such a declaration, has been repeated. At the moment, however, the international situation looks as if only the EU can provide the impetus for more significant reductions. No one will take the EU’s place, here, and the EU must not give up the role of global promoter of radical means in the fight against global warming.

Those expectations were irrational, both in terms of the sizes of proposed greenhouse gas reductions and in terms of the financial expectations related to combating climate change. On top of this, there was also a little arrogance in claiming a leading role in the process of the fight against climate change. In my opinion, we are still at a stage when making binding and final decisions is inadvisable. This is because, among other reasons, we still do not have reliable scientific data on climate change and the role of mankind in the process. Recently, we have been witnesses of disputes among experts and scientists on the subject, which confirms that they do not all have the same views on the effects of global warming. An additional argument in favour of deferring a final decision is the economic crisis, which is forcing countries to make savings and cut expenditure. In the difficult times of an economic recession, priority treatment is demanded by social matters such as the fight against unemployment and the impoverishment of society, support for entrepreneurship and other measures to accelerate economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament reiterates its aim of increasing this reduction to 30%.

<p class="contents">It is important that lessons should be drawn from the failure in Copenhagen. Thus, we need to face the important self-criticism that the EU was unable to build confidence, during the negotiations, through specific prior pledges of international government financing for climate measures in developing countries. Thus, also, it is important to recognise that the EU’s collective contribution to the efforts to achieve a reduction and to fund the adaptation needs of the developing countries for 2020 cannot be below an amount of EUR 30 billion per annum.

<p class="contents">Moreover, good tax governance is an important pre-condition for preserving the integrity of financial markets. The motions on administrative cooperation and on mutual assistance for recovery, which we are adopting in this plenary session, are taking us in this direction. At the international level, one of the instruments that the EU can use to promote good governance in tax matters in third countries is to negotiate tax fraud agreements with them, which include a clause on an exchange of information.</p>
<p class="contents">The statements of the five countries with which the EU has a savings agreement (Monaco, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Andorra and San Marino) are an important step towards the end of a situation of complete imbalance. Such statements must, however, be followed by the conclusion of legally binding agreements.

This report underlines the urgent need for a Community initiative to effectively combat violence against women. Also, the adoption of this resolution integrates two dimensions, which I consider to be fundamental. Firstly, the recommendation for paternity leave at European level. If there is to be equality in employment, there also needs to be equality in society and family life. This resolution highlights the Commission’s responsibility to legislate in this area. However, the real major victory of this vote is that it reaffirms the right to abortion. No European text has reaffirmed this right since 2002, due to the reticence of one right-wing European party. Women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights. There is certainly much more to be done in terms of real access to information, contraception and abortion, but the Tarabella report must be used as a basic point of support for bringing European law forward in this sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Equality between women and men has long been a fundamental principle of the European Union. However, despite the progress made in this field, many inequalities between remain. The gap in employment rates between women and men is narrowing but women are still more likely to be in part-time jobs and/or on fixed-term contracts and, for the most part, to remain stuck in poorly paid posts. Four times more women than men across Europe work part-time. The gender pay gap – 17.4% – has barely narrowed since 2000. To earn the same as a man would earn on average for a calendar year, a woman on average must work until the end of the following February, a total of 418 days. The global economic, financial and social crisis is causing women to suffer a ‘double blow’. The sectors where they constitute the majority of the workforce are in the public sector (e.g. education, health and social welfare) which is being specifically targeted for shedding of jobs. In addition, because of service cutbacks, women who availed of child care and elder-care, learning support, etc., are being forced to quit employment to assume those tasks themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that some Members do not take the issue of gender inequality and related discrimination against women seriously. However, I am aware of these complications. The global economic crisis has exacerbated the situation and it looks as if women will be ‘sacrificed’ as a result of cost-cutting fiscal policies through reductions in maternity benefits and expenditure on social services. As women are traditionally more at risk of poverty and low incomes because they interrupt or end their professional careers in order to start a family, give precedence to their husbands’ careers or care for children and the elderly, the rapporteur is proposing an adequate means of enhancement. Mr Tarabella states correctly that the principle of ‘the same pay for the same work’, valid in the treaties since 1957, has not been complied with and women in some Member States are still not paid the same rate for the same work as men.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, there are a number of EU policies aimed at assisting families with children that do not, however, mention single mothers or fathers living with children. The demand for paid paternity leave to be legislated at the European level is also correct. A fair division of the family and domestic responsibilities of women and men will help to resolve the situation. For the reasons mentioned I agree with the assessments of the 2009/2010 report and I have therefore voted for its adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we share the rapporteur’s desire to improve equality between women and men in Europe, we do not feel that interference with the sovereignty of the Member States through demands for so-called gender budgeting, by urging the Member States not to cut social benefits and by imposing quotas through legislation is the right way to go. Equality must be achieved at individual level, by expanding opportunities to influence one’s own situation – not through legislation at European level and gesture politics such as specially designated days, further EU authorities and an EU charter on women’s rights. There is already an EU charter on civil liberties and human rights that has been strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon, and which covers women too. We must stand up for the principle of subsidiarity.

<p class="contents">Considering that our analysis of progress in achieving the Lisbon objectives is not encouraging, we welcome the call expressed in the resolution to speed up legislative changes in Member States, to tighten up infringement procedures and encourage greater participation of women in key sectors of the labour market that reflects the goals they have achieved as far as training is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I am bound to voice my absolute disapproval, already expressed at the voting stage, of this pernicious will to promote an abortion society by providing incentives for free access to termination of pregnancy.</p>
<p class="contents">The assumption that women must be able to achieve easier abortions in order to recover their right to sexual freedom not only runs counter to general lay morals, but also contradicts the principles enshrined in recital Z, which states that the promotion of ‘higher birth rates to meet future requirements’ is central to the European action.

Only then can the EU achieve its goals of growth, employment and social cohesion. The inclusion of provisions relating to ‘sexual and reproductive rights’ is, however, unfortunate in a report which appears within a context of economic crisis and which concerns itself mainly with the impact of this crisis on working conditions for women and the place of women in society.

It divides rather than unites men and women. There is nothing innocent about the wording of paragraph 36: ‘women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, notably through easy access to contraception and abortion’. The rapporteur also insists on women having access free of charge to consultation on abortion. However, abortion comes solely within the competence of the Member States. As this resolution has no binding legal force, it cannot be used to exert pressure to liberalise abortion. Then Parliament calls for sexist stereotyping, especially work carried out by men and women within the family, to be combated. The resolution emphasises the importance of pre-school child care provision, child-minding services and the provision of assistance to elderly persons and other dependents. Thus, Parliament is aiming to destroy the natural family as a place of socialisation and solidarity between generations. This resolution does not offer any added value to women or to men or to the Union. It is a pity, because respect for people who are different and the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women are a real social challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following this, the General Assembly of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) set a considerable reduction in the fishing of bluefin tuna by 13 500 tonnes and the European Commission restated its concern at the reduction in tuna stocks and committed itself to carrying out more reliable scientific studies.</p>

We should recall that at the last reunion of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), in November 2009, experts expressed the view that the species was being over-fished, but that this did not point towards a total ban on fishing. The recommendations pointed to a significant decrease in catches, which were restricted to between 8 000 and 15 000 tonnes, with a fixed limit of 13 500 tonnes.

Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that some sectors of the fishing industry have acted responsibly, respected quotas and adapted to all the requirements that have been established in recent years. For that reason, I voted in favour of subjecting the inclusion of the bluefin tuna in CITES Appendix I to the following conditions, as was finally approved: amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 introducing a general derogation for domestic trade; financial support from the European Union for the vessel owners that are affected; and tightening of controls and penalties to combat illegal, unregulated fishing.

The ban on marketing it now seems inevitable. It is aimed at protecting this species. Aware of the problem, many fishermen, especially French ones, have, for years, been doing all they can to make their boats comply with the regulations and to observe the fishing quotas necessary to ensure the survival of bluefin tuna. These fishermen, already severely affected by the crisis, will be the main victims of such a measure made necessary by illegal fishing and clandestine industrial networks. The effort made by these fishermen cannot fall on their shoulders alone.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot ask them to sacrifice themselves in the interests of the planet while the powers that be gathered in Copenhagen have shown that they sidestepped the issue. The UN principle of joint responsibility for environmental problems must therefore apply, and the fishermen’s effort must be compensated by a contribution from the European Union. Furthermore, the creation by France of a genuine exclusive economic area in the Mediterranean would make it possible to provide a sanctuary for resources while keeping alive small-scale fishing that is respectful of ecological balances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Faced with fishermen fiercely hostile to this ban, scientific and environmental experts are sounding the alarm. At the current rate, and despite the drastic efforts made over recent years, bluefin tuna could purely and simply disappear within three years. Italy has already made a gesture by adopting a moratorium from 2010. France has done so too, but much more ambiguously, because it is talking about an 18-month period to ‘assess the state of resources’. As for Spain and Malta, their display of silence is reprehensible. The urgency is there, however, and only radical measures can enable stocks to be replenished. This is also the one and only way of protecting the fishermen’s livelihood in the medium and long terms.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution does not come down to banning the fishing of bluefin tuna entirely, nor to letting it disappear from our plates. Small-scale and sport fishing will still be permitted. The measure for a ban on international trade should be enough to safeguard the species, given that 80% of the bluefin tuna fished in the Mediterranean is exported directly to Japan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such industrial and international fishing threatens traditional coastal fishing in the Mediterranean. In order to avoid an ecological disaster, made twice as bad by an economic crisis in the fishing sector, it is urgent to introduce a policy for an international ban on the industrial fishing of bluefin tuna. My demand is to reconcile two major issues: effective protection of bluefin tuna to enable its survival and future placing on the market, and support for European coastal fishermen whose livelihood is partly dependent on this trade. It is, for this reason, that I support the listing of bluefin tuna in Appendix I of the CITES to prevent it from being exploited and to prevent bluefin tuna from becoming extinct, but under the following conditions: that there be ongoing scientific assessments to find out the exact state of the biomass of this species, that economic and social support be given to the European players in the fishing sector and, above all, that a derogation be introduced in respect of the domestic trade in bluefin tuna so as to help small-scale industries and thus to prevent small-scale coastal fishing, which is a traditional activity in the Mediterranean, from being killed off. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the Member States are party to it. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora does not threaten the survival of the species to which they belong. International trade in endangered species is estimated to be worth billions of dollars a year and to involve hundreds of millions of plant and animal specimens. Unfortunately, the EU is one of the main markets for the illegal trade in wild species. The existence of an agreement guaranteeing sustainable trade is important if these resources are to be preserved for future generations. Within the EU, national legislation varies from one Member State to another. In order to provide better protection for wild species, coordination between efforts being made by the Member States and the European institutions to ensure that EU legislation on the trade in wild species is respected should be stepped up.

<p class="contents">Candidate countries must be involved in the European-level pursuit of Roma integration before now, since accession negotiations grant an unparalleled opportunity to trigger a substantial shift in the governmental attitudes towards granting equal access to Roma in employment, education, housing and health care, promoting political participation and empowering the Romani civil movement. All European countries –  present and future members of the European Union – must engage in a concerted effort in order to overcome the historical social exclusion of the continent’s largest ethnic minority and sign up for a community action plan which provides the proper legal leverage to force the participants to comply with their own pledges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that the resolution shows which measures should be taken to accelerate accession talks, so that the technical details can be completed in 2010. The authorities in Croatia should devote more attention to providing society with better information about the benefits of EU membership. The functioning of Croatia within the framework of a single, common European market will bring about a development of commercial exchange, an influx of investment and general economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The support from EU funds for modernisation of Croatia’s economy, building of its infrastructure and restructuring of its agriculture is also not without significance. Many examples can be given, here, of the benefits received by the countries which acceded in the last two enlargements. The very fact of belonging to a united Europe is, certainly, not without significance. Negotiations in the areas of fishing, the environment and the Common Foreign and Security Policy should be unblocked as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect the Presidency and the Commission to take specific measures in this area. Up till now, we have explained that further enlargement can take place only after adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon. The treaty is now in force, and we should accelerate talks on Croatia’s membership, along with preparations for enlargement of the Union to include other Balkan states.

Croatia is party both to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the Council of Europe European Convention on Human Rights.

Therefore, I am delighted with its achievements. 2009 was a successful year for Macedonia. The EU introduced a visa-free regime with this state. This in particular fosters the development of people-to-people contacts. Last year, Macedonia demarcated the border with Kosovo and improved relations with Greece. In the resolution on Macedonia’s progress in 2009 towards implementing the EU membership criteria, we drew attention to the fact that the country’s government should be more sensitive to matters of ethnic minorities and strive for greater media transparency. We called on the EU institutions to help resolve the dispute between Skopje and Athens over the name of the Macedonian state.</p>
<p class="contents">We also invited the EU Council of Ministers to accept the beginning of accession talks with Macedonia in March. The progress made by Macedonia in 2009 was also down to the EU’s magnetic pull. There is no doubt that the prospect of EU membership is pushing Macedonia to change for the better. This country is implementing significant reforms. Therefore, I voted for the resolution, which praises these while also underlining a roadmap for further progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the values, traditions and rules by which we conduct ourselves are public knowledge, and we cannot change them so that simply anyone can join. It is up to the candidate country to accept them, and eventually, after becoming a Member, to try to live by them, but only then. However, during the long process of negotiations that has been ongoing with the EU, the Turkish people have felt that violations of their habits and customs – which, it should be said, are not even being observed – are being imposed, only to be denied membership in the referenda that will surely take place in the Member States, even if the politicians do end up agreeing.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet Turkey is a friendly nation, with a very rich history and culture. It is our partner in NATO and deserves to be treated as such. In view of this, I would suggest that even at this late stage, there could be a referendum in Turkey where the people are asked whether they acknowledge and want to adopt our principles and values, or whether they would now prefer negotiations to begin for a new and deeper special partnership with the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the world stage, the European Union is seen as a paragon of economic development, a multicultural region that encourages respect for minorities and equal rights for all human beings, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or religion. These are inalienable values of the project of European integration, and they represent an opportunity for the Turkish people and the peaceful enhancement of their ethnic and cultural diversity. Nevertheless, the process of applying for EU membership drags on without making any real progress, highlighting the long journey from the formal request for membership in 1987, which led to the opening of negotiations in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, bearing in mind the effectiveness of this process, I believe that it is crucial to give priority to promoting a referendum in Turkey, with the aim of giving the public the opportunity to express their opinions clearly on the acceptance of full EU membership, and all the implications of this on social and cultural principles and values, or whether they would prefer a deeper partnership with the EU instead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its continuing occupation of part of Cyprus, its refusal to open ports and airports in the region, the violation of rights of political, religious and ethnic minorities, discrimination against women, the exclusion of political parties and the revocation of laws limiting the jurisdiction of military courts are some examples that demonstrate this. There are other basic issues. Most of Turkey is not geographically part of Europe. Turkey has an Islamic identity that is very different from the Judaeo-Christian identity of most EU countries. Strategically speaking, it would be problematic for the EU to have borders with Iraqi Kurdistan. The secularity of the country is only held in place by military force. Finally, the movement of people from what would become the country with the largest population in the EU would create great imbalances in the labour market. None of this precludes acknowledgement of the efforts made by Turkey over recent years to meet certain criteria required by the EU, and it recognises that invaluable role that this country plays within NATO. Perhaps it would be far better to guarantee Turkey privileged and preferential partnership status with the EU, rather than creating false expectations and hopes for membership, something that it would be difficult for the facts and circumstances to accommodate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Very significant progress has been made in terms of complying with the standards of a market economy. If, however, we are talking about changes in the areas of politics, democracy or human rights, then although there has been significant progress in creating law, its implementation has not been so successful. This, too, needs to be understood, as it requires a change in social consciousness, which is something that happens slowly. However, European standards in the area of human rights, women’s rights and treatment of prisoners and national and religious minorities must be met.</p>
<p class="contents">Some opponents of Turkish integration are guided by reasons unconnected with the substance of the matter, and others by fears that Turkey is a big country which will have a big influence on EU decisions, because, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, the voting power of each Member State is dependent on the size of its population. Turkey’s membership will certainly be a huge burden to the EU budget, but it should be borne in mind that it is a big market which is important for the Union. Turkey is a significant member of NATO and is an important partner of the USA and many EU Member States. It is also a territory which could provide routes for the transfer of energy sources to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us remember that Turkey could become a bridge for inter-religious dialogue as well as cultural and even macro-regional dialogue. The presence of Turkey in the Union could help stabilise this large and important region of the world. Turkey must understand that it cannot change its past. Mistakes have to be admitted. Then it is easier to live and establish good relations with one’s neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ban on the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) is an attack on the infant democracy in the country and, in particular, on the Kurdish minority, which represents as much as 20% of the population. The fact that this is the 27th party ban within 10 years gives a clear picture of the Turkish understanding of democracy. The annulment of the legislation limiting the jurisdiction of military courts is yet another indication of the disunity within the country. As soon as the Turkish Government plans a small concession to the EU, it is exposed by the nationalist opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">In almost every area, progress has come to a standstill or things are moving backwards. The Turkish Government is attempting to nip criticism in the bud by taking reprisals against hostile journalists and media organisations. Double standards are being applied to religious freedom. The prime minister wants to lift the ban on wearing headscarves and the age limit for Koran schools, while at the same time discriminating against religious minorities and harassing them on an ongoing basis. These are dreadful developments. Against this background, it seems only logical that the Turkish chief negotiator, Mr Bagis, does not take seriously our resolution and, therefore, our democratic decision-making structures. Turkey has shown very clearly that it is still generations away from joining the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, these efforts need to be stepped up in order to fully meet the criteria set at the Copenhagen Summit and in order to implement the judicial and electoral system and legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress towards real reforms stalled in 2009, and issues such as the non-opening of ports and airports on Cyprus are likely to affect the negotiation process.

<p class="contents">In fact, the reforms are necessary and urgent, as the resolution of Parliament ordains. However, in this context, where greater efforts are required to satisfy the criteria for the membership-application process, the suggestion of a referendum is pertinent.

<p class="contents">As you know, the European Parliament has been very active in this matter. Our Parliament is composed of Members directly elected by the citizens of Europe. Our main responsibility is for citizens’ rights, and we must guard these rights. We are fully aware of this. This is our first and greatest responsibility. At the same time, we realise how important the SWIFT agreement is – for completely different reasons. Therefore, finding the right middle ground, here, was important. While this was happening, in recent months, the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force.</p>
<p class="contents">In November of last year, I wrote to Mr Reinfeldt, who was President of the European Council at the time, with a request to postpone the decision and for the European Parliament’s decision to be taken into account, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon. As you know, this did not happen, and on 30 November, the Council made a decision on the matter and adopted the SWIFT agreement. On 21 December, I sent another letter to Mr Reinfeldt. Parliament expressed two expectations in this letter: inclusion of our position in the negotiation mandate for a permanent agreement, and also full information for Parliament during future negotiations. On 21 January, I wrote a similar letter to Mr Zapatero, who currently leads the rotating Presidency, and sent the same letter again on 8 February. I have also written a letter, saying the same things, to Mr Barroso. I have also been in touch with representatives of the American Government and with Mrs Clinton. I have also received a letter on this matter, which sets out the position of the United States Government on the SWIFT agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps you know all this, because the documents are all available – I have sent all the documents to the political groups, so that you can use them at any time. This is important. We must have full information, so that we can make decisions on this matter in a responsible way. The measures we have taken will also be helped by our discussion today. That is why this discussion about SWIFT is so important. I am extremely glad that we have representatives of the Council and of the European Commission with us, who will be able to speak, and then we come to our discussion and our responsibility for a decision on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Without a doubt, the targeted exchange and use of data for counter-terrorism purposes is, and will remain, necessary, but let me be clear: European citizens must be able to trust both security and data claims. Getting it right first time round should be the objective and, with all due respect, the Council has been insufficiently strong to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the proposed interim agreement is a significant departure from European law in how enforcement agencies would obtain financial records of individuals, namely through court-approved warrants or subpoenas to examine specific transactions, but with the proposed interim agreement, we instead rely on broad administrative subpoenas for millions of records of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">By the very nature of SWIFT, it is not possible to refer to the so-called ‘limited’ requests. For technical reasons, SWIFT has to transfer bulk data, thereby violating the basic principles of EU data-protection law such as necessity and proportionality. This cannot be rectified <span class="italic">ex post</span> by mechanisms of oversight and control.</p>
<p class="contents">At all times, it must be clear that Parliament is not out there to just passively take note of the actions of the Council and the Commission. The fact is that this House is always being promised jam tomorrow if only we would be patient. However, we cannot keep falling for fake promises of jam tomorrow. We need clear commitments now and the ball was in the Council’s court. I made that clear last week, but so far, it has failed to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council states that it wants to ensure the utmost respect for privacy and data, but fails to address in particular the rights of access, rectification, compensation and redress outside the EU for data subjects. The Council states that it shares Parliament’s concerns and therefore calls on the Commission to adopt draft negotiation guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Why hide behind the Commission? It is Council that will adopt the negotiation directives in the end; why have the negotiation guidelines not already been submitted? Council states yet again that it wants to ensure that the TFTP will continue. However, it fails to address the fact that in this way, the EU continues to outsource its financial intelligence service to the US. The lack of reciprocity is not being addressed. True reciprocity would allow the EU authorities to obtain similar data stored in the US and, in the long term, consider the necessity of building up our own EU capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council does not show any commitment to line up with existing legislation such as the data retention directive for the telecom service providers, which does deal with specific and targeted data. The Council fails to clarify the precise role of the public authority. A ‘push’ system does not mean anything if, in actual practice, SWIFT has to transfer bulk data. Transfer and storage are, in other words, by definition disproportionate under the terms of the interim agreement and the Council does not address a European solution for the supervision of data exchange.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, tell me how on earth I can tell 500 million European citizens that we are selling out on important safeguards and principles just because we are not able to put our foot down, because Council is not able to get its act together. Tell me; I am all ears.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my speech with an unequivocal statement: Spain has shown clear, unreserved support for the Treaty of Lisbon, and it has done so from the very beginning. We did so in the certainty that the implementation of the new treaty was going to mean, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, that the European institutions would be brought closer to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an objective that the Treaty of Lisbon entrusts largely to Parliament. Giving Parliament a bigger role and greater participation in issues such as the area of freedom, justice and security is the way in which this treaty has tried to bring the citizens and the institutions closer together.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin, then, by assuring all the honourable Members that the Council is committed to working closely and honestly with Parliament. For the Spanish Presidency, this conclusion is the result of our firm commitment to the Treaty of Lisbon and its aims.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also shares Parliament’s concern to ensure the security of all European citizens, for security means the guarantee that they can fully exercise their freedom. That is the context in which, together, we are fighting terrorism – all forms of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in the Resolution adopted in this Chamber on 17 September, the European Parliament ‘recalls its determination to fight terrorism and its firm belief in the need to strike the right balance between security measures and the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights’. I agree wholeheartedly with this statement.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the framework within which I would like to see this debate conducted; it is a new framework under the Treaty of Lisbon, and it is based on honest, interinstitutional collaboration and a shared desire – and this is not a new desire – to fight terrorism while respecting the principles of proportionality and necessity, which are also critical if we are to fight terrorism effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is widely acknowledged that international terrorism has brought new challenges to our societies. This is a relatively new form of terrorism which has no clear organisation, is extremely deadly and operates at a global level. A global approach is therefore needed to eradicate it. It lacks a rigid, hierarchical structure and so can only be combated with an extraordinary intelligence effort. It is so deadly that we are having to be on maximum alert in places where large numbers of people gather.</p>
<p class="contents">Prevention, coordination and intelligence are the three words that sum up our strategy for tackling this huge threat.</p>
<p class="contents">All countries have endeavoured to improve internal and external coordination, to be better informed and, ultimately, to cooperate with those who are engaged in the same struggle. The European Union has also increased its joint investigation bodies and teams, information exchange and shared analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the context for the agreement we are examining today between the European Union and the United States concerning the transfer of financial messaging data. Data exchange without an agreement has worked uninterruptedly for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">When I appeared before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs two weeks ago, several Members asked me about the outcomes of that data exchange. It is a pertinent issue which I think has been taken up and answered in the second report by Judge Bruguière, which has been referred to this House and from which I shall now quote: ‘during 2009, the TFTP has been a highly valuable tool used by intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help map out terrorist networks, to complete missing links in investigations, to confirm the identity of suspects, to locate the physical whereabouts of suspects and to identify new suspects as well as to disrupt attempted terrorist attacks’. I would also add that this not only applies to 2009 but earlier, in the United States, Europe and all over the world: in Barcelona in January 2008, in Germany in the summer of 2007, in London after the 7 July attacks and in the investigations into the 11 March attacks in Madrid, the Bangkok killings of April 2005 and the Bali bombings of 2002. These are just some of the examples Judge Bruguière cites in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">Data exchange has therefore delivered positive results. It has allowed us to investigate and prevent attacks. It has enabled us to arrest terrorists after they have committed attacks and, most importantly, before they have succeeded in committing them.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though SWIFT indicated in 2007 that it had made a decision to change its databases, it did not actually do so until just a few months ago. This meant we had to review the protocols which, up to then, had enabled us to exchange financial data. That had to be done in a very short space of time. The mandate was approved by Council in the summer of 2009 when there was still uncertainty over the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision that was taken is well known. We signed an interim nine-month agreement which should be ratified in this Chamber: an interim agreement lasting nine months, during which this Parliament, the Council and the Commission should establish a new negotiation process to set out a definitive agreement. That was the decision taken.</p>
<p class="contents">It may not have been the best decision. However, it is important to say clearly to this House that, in terms of privacy protection, the signed <span class="italic">ad referendum </span>agreement that we are debating here today is a great improvement on the protocols in place prior to this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an improvement because this interim agreement has additional guarantees, among other elements, that were recommended by Parliament and set out by the rapporteur in the report that has been presented to us today.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, I would like to say that the Spanish Presidency of the Council has taken full account of the resolutions adopted in Parliament and the letters sent by the President of the Parliament, as well as the report that was drawn up by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert and voted on in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 4 February. For this reason, the Council approved a statement that was sent to Parliament yesterday and whose key points I shall now summarise for you.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Council is committed to incorporating into a definitive agreement the sound guarantees that will strengthen proper protection, the deletion of data and greater precision with regard to the exchange of data obtained by the TFTP with national authorities and third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also committed, of course, to strengthening the guarantees contained in the current agreement; these should remain – and be strengthened – in the definitive agreement, as should a strict limitation on the end use of data and an absolute ban on extracting data and using profiles.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Council, in response to the new context created by the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, is committed to negotiating an interinstitutional agreement in order to enable easier access to classified documents relating to international agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, and I wish to reiterate this point as clearly as possible, the Spanish Presidency is totally committed to the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, particularly Article 8, and fully recognises the legitimate concerns expressed by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know that the commitment I have just set out is possible. In a letter sent to the President of Parliament by the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and the Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, the United States Government has expressed its commitment to incorporating the requisite guarantees in accordance with the position taken by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is possible that in the approval process for the agreement we are debating today, the Council could have done things better. What is certain, however, is that in this process, the Council has learned lessons and taken due note of Parliament’s concerns. It is also certain that the agreement we are debating today has contributed – and I hope that it will continue to contribute – to improving the security of citizens all around the world and, of course, in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is an interesting first day at work and I am grateful to share with you the important issue of sharing information with the US for the purpose of combating terrorism, this time in relation to the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP).</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has, of course, shown great interest in this matter. This is quite right, since the TFTP confronts us again with the challenge of reconciling data sharing with data protection and, if we take up this challenge, this helps us to give citizens security, privacy and data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the aims of the interim agreement has been to ensure implementation of the conditions in the European Parliament resolution of September 2009. We firmly intend to strengthen further the data protection part when negotiating the long-term agreement, particularly concerning the right to receive information about whether one’s rights have been respected under the agreement, and stronger guarantees about effective redress, lawful data processing and the deletion of data.</p>
<p class="contents">The second Bruguière report was made available to MEPs on Monday last week, and it demonstrates the significance and the value of TFTP in the investigation and disruption of terrorism, including in the European Union. The report confirms that TFTP has been used to identify and arrest individuals who have subsequently been convicted of terrorism within our Member States. The report also highlights that TFTP is a valuable source of reliable information necessary in the fight against terrorism. There are specific examples and the Council referred to a few of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the threat of terrorism in some of our Member States remains as high as ever, and I am sure that you can see that rejection of the interim agreement by this House would represent a serious blow to EU security.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of our Member States have made it very clear that they want the TFTP to continue because they have benefited from it in the past and will continue to do so. They have told us that the reliable information that the TFTP provides on known and suspected terrorism is an important source of legitimate intelligence needed to address the complex threat, notably from al-Qaeda inspired terrorism. The interim agreement is not only a favour to the US; it is in our common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said about the level of protection of data in the interim agreement and this is, of course, a key concern. I encourage Members – and I am sure most of you have already done so – to look closely at the interim agreement. You will see that it contains significant and detailed legally binding commitments on the way that the US Treasury Department can process data under the agreement. They include, for example, a strict limitation on the purpose of processing, which is limited to the investigation, detection and prosecution of terrorism. It includes an absolute prohibition on data mining – searches of the database can only be undertaken where it is possible to show a reason to believe that the subject of the search is engaged in terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">That means that the data held on the TFTP database are effectively anonymous. Only if there is a reason to believe that one identified person is a terrorist can the data of that person be seen and extracted from the database. This is important. The interim agreement obliges the Treasury Department to delete data within five years of receipt – a period which is in keeping with the retention period in EU legislation on terrorist financing. The agreement also provides for a detailed EU review in which some of our own data protection authorities will participate to ensure that these and many other data protection obligations are complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement does not involve the transfer of virtually all SWIFT data to the US Treasury Department. I can assure you that only a fraction of SWIFT data will be transferred under the interim agreement. It does not in any way affect the powers of data protection authorities with regard to processing activities performed in the EU by SWIFT or financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Refusal of consent will bring to an end the interim agreement, including the significant data protection safeguard it contains. If the US is able to access data by other means – for example through bilateral relations with the Netherlands – those safeguards will no longer apply. If the interim agreement falls, it is likely to take considerable time before any alternative can be put in place. So refusal of consent risks leading to both a data protection gap and a security gap.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the interim agreement is only an interim agreement. It might not be the best agreement in the world. It can – and it will – be improved. The Commission is now finalising the draft mandate and the guidelines for the long-term agreement and we will adopt them swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">I give a personal commitment to you to ensure that the European Parliament’s concern will be addressed and that we shall seek a strong protection of privacy and data protection in the new agreement. The European Parliament will be fully informed at all stages of this procedure. I hope that this answers a few of your questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also responsible for international agreements, such as the SWIFT agreement, and we are giving a strong signal that the situation has changed, now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in force. This is important. I think the recent signals from the American Government show that it has become clear that the European Parliament is, today, fully responsible for legislation. We wanted it to be a strong signal. However, we know we are responsible to our citizens. We are directly elected Members of the European Parliament.

At the beginning of this debate, we would like to say that we want a good partnership with the Americans, in particular, when it comes to combating terrorism. Secondly, we strongly support security for our citizens and also citizens’ rights and data protection. Thirdly, we have worked very hard to ensure that the guidelines for the negotiations and our position were in place as early as mid September and we now want to see these implemented. Fourthly, Mrs Malmström, I would like to say with respect that it is not that Parliament had a strong interest in this area, but rather that we regard the legislative process as our responsibility, as the President has said, and we want to be involved in this process on an equal footing with the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Our response to the text for the negotiations is to make two very clear points. Firstly, we cannot accept the way in which this text has been produced. Secondly, although the Council maintains that ‘the points from Parliament’s resolution have been fully taken into account’, in fact, some of the points have not been included, in particular the right to take legal action, the deletion of data and some others. These are the main reasons why we said in the Subcommittee on Security and Defence that this was unacceptable to us. It also became clear that it was only after this that things started to move. The US Secretary of State has not agreed to anything, unless the Council has received information which is different from the information given to Parliament. This has allegedly happened on some occasions. The Council has sent out encouraging signals this week, but has not given any guarantees. I would like to make that very clear. This is why we are saying that we want to discuss this further, that we want a good agreement and that we are very much in favour of more discussions, if there is a guarantee that this will result in a good agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, Gulliver believed that he had arrived in the land of giants. To me, it seems rather as if American diplomacy has followed Gulliver and believes that it can treat the European Parliament as if it were an organisation of little people. That is a mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Malmström, I would like to congratulate you on your election and your move from one bench to the other. However, you should be aware that it was not just an error committed by American diplomats, but also by the governments of the European Union who believed that an agreement of this kind could be pushed through Parliament and did not realise that we cannot vote in favour of such a defective agreement. This agreement embodies the spirit of the security ideology of the United States of America, but it does not embody the protection of fundamental rights, which we as Members of the European Parliament must guarantee for the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibility of transferring large volumes of data without specifications and without specific details in individual cases is in fundamental conflict with the data protection legislation that we have adopted in Europe in all our parliaments, including the national parliaments. The serious problems regarding data protection have already been referred to. You have done so yourself. How long will the data be stored? Who is storing it? Who is passing it on to whom? What options do I have for finding out about what is happening with my data, who is accessing it and whether it is correct? What legal protection do I have to ensure that incorrect data cannot be gathered about me and passed to third parties, whoever they may be? When will my data be deleted, if it has been collected and stored? Under the terms of the Homeland Security Act, data can be stored for up to 90 years. If this includes a guarantee that I will reach the age of 90, then I’m happy to discuss it. It is worth repeating that this data can be stored for up to 90 years! All of these factors represent serious failings in this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, Mr Rubalcaba, I have to say to you that this is a bad agreement and we cannot vote in favour of it. If we reject it, then it is your job to negotiate a new and better agreement with the United States that respects the interests of security but, at the same time, also respects the security interests of citizens with regard to their freedom. If you can do this, we will support the new agreement. The objective of a new round of negotiations must be to find a compromise between these two things.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot recommend to the members of my group to vote in favour of this agreement at this point and in this form. This evening, I will suggest that my group votes against this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a pleasure to see you here.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a first key decision for the European Parliament to take with its new Lisbon powers and expectations are high, but we need to keep a clear head. We owe it to our citizens to make a well-considered decision, free from outside pressures or scare tactics such as false claims of a security gap, because data, and we know this, can still be obtained by the US without disagreement. Let us not forget that the Member States were not unanimous on this agreement either. We can only give our consent to an agreement that has full democratic legitimacy, on grounds of substance and procedure. This is not about a battle of wills between the Council and the European Parliament nor is it about transatlantic relations. This is about European citizens being entitled to a proper democratic and transparent procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The answers of the Council so far are utterly inadequate, and the democratic rights of European citizens cannot be bargained away with promises of trips to the US or vague promises by the Council for future agreements. The Council has had countless opportunities since 2007 to handle this in a proper manner and ensure security, as well as protection of personal data and civil liberties, or ensure proper democratic scrutiny by national parliaments or, since 1 December, the European Parliament, but the Council has been incredibly stubborn. Parliament cannot and should not take a decision if it does not have access to all relevant information and documents. Our voters have a right to know that we consider all elements very seriously and that we do not simply rubber-stamp Council decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Parliament has been very clear for years about its concerns and expectations and, instead of coming up with more vague promises, the Council should finally provide us with the opinion of its Legal Service and the requested information demonstrating the use of the data for counter-terrorism purposes. I do not consider that the second Bruguière report is sufficient. So, if the Council wants the consent of this House, it will have to meet our demands. That, Council, is the only way.</p>

In the two meetings which I chaired, I did not feel in any way as if I were being regarded as a little person from Europe, quite the contrary. During these meetings with the experts from the US, I learnt a huge amount about the very different legal systems relating to the protection of fundamental rights in the US and in Europe. I am grateful to the Americans for taking part in this far-reaching dialogue. The nature of the task which lies ahead of us has become clear to me. The Council has not done this task justice in the past. The nature of the task facing the Europeans has also become clear to me, if we want to combine an effective fight against terrorism and effective protection of fundamental rights in the same agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I actually find it embarrassing that people have had to come across the pond to explain this controversial area to us and that the Council has not so far been able to have an honest debate of this kind with Parliament. The rapporteur has made it entirely clear in which areas fundamental rights, which enjoy the highest levels of protection in Europe, will be breached. I would like to make an additional point that I regard as a major problem from a legal and political perspective, if we look at the issue in more detail. The US and Europe have completely different definitions of terrorism and this is a problem which pervades this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As has rightly been said, the Members of this House are accountable to the citizens of Europe for ensuring that their rights are preserved. In my opinion, we should not vote for an agreement which many of us, including Mr Weber, Mr Langen, who is not here at the moment, and Mr Schulz, have said repeatedly in public is in breach of current law. We must take action now. We have told the citizens of Europe in the course of the public discussion that we would do so. We must vote against the interim agreement and we must not postpone our vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must not evade its responsibilities again as it did in November. Then we had the option of bringing everything to a stop, but the majority did not want to do so. Now we must take action and – I am saying this after the consultations with the Americans – this will put us in a better negotiating position and on an equal footing, which will enable us to improve security and the rights of citizens in the European Union and perhaps even in the US. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliamentary consultation and consent should not be a retrospective tool. The reciprocity of data protection should be beyond reproach, and the manner in which the agreement has been negotiated and concluded must never be repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have been reassured at least by the United States authorities and by the multi-layered data protection systems and judicial safeguards that are in place through this interim agreement. So our poor treatment by the Council should not compromise the EU’s agreement with the United States, or any future agreements on the security of Europe. We are now receiving loads of assurances and promises from the Council and from the Commission. I cannot yet judge whether these answer all the reasonable requirements we have laid down, so in my opinion, we now need some time before proceeding further with our consideration of this vital measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to focus specifically on the content of the agreement. We have big brother’s little sister waiting for our approval. Mrs Clinton believes that she can persuade the Members of this Parliament to do something which we would not accept from our own governments.</p>
<p class="contents">From my point of view, it is fundamentally wrong for alleged terrorism investigators to have such extensive access to databases, because this undermines people’s self-determination over their own personal data. Personal data will be stored for decades and no one will have any control over how it is used. In addition, the data can still be retained after the agreement has come to an end. It will not be possible to take legal action to discover the whereabouts of the data or to claim damages for its illegal use by third countries. This gives the state precedence over its citizens, who will all be reduced to the status of objects of suspicion. The Member States are allowing other governments to spy on our citizens indirectly via the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">To give some examples in Germany, should Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Bahn or the Schlecker drug store chain still be worried about collecting information on their employees? Will it now become the norm for the German Government to buy from tax investigators data that has been obtained illegally? We find ourselves in a situation in which Parliament must stand up for its beliefs and make a decision. Why should Google be able to set data thresholds in future? It is important to combat terrorism and, in particular, its causes, and I believe that we all agree on this, but not at the cost of fundamental rights. In this context, I have heard many speeches which refer to the EU as a community of values. We are just about to sweep one of these values under the carpet and my group cannot vote in favour of that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is all for the SWIFT agreement and tomorrow will vote in favour. Let me explain why: the European Popular Party is going to give its backing because its primary concern is the safety of people, the security of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The security of our citizens will be improved as a result of this agreement, and this is why we support it. This is not simply my own opinion, but it is the expert opinion of those whose specific task was to research and evaluate whether or not this agreement enhances the security of the citizens whom we all, in this Chamber, represent.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be an improvement in the level of security throughout Europe and this will be extended to the security of other citizens worldwide, including the United States. Now I agree with those who stated that the Council did not act appropriately with the European Parliament, but I believe that the message sent out by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs last week taught the Council a lesson, a lesson that was clearly understood. I also sympathise with the concerns of my fellow Members on the issue of privacy, but here we must again recall that this agreement is an interim one. This means that a new agreement will have to be drawn up that will provide better guarantees regarding security.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in your introduction you mentioned responsibility. I appeal to my fellow Members to use the powers of this Parliament, the new powers that we have, with full responsibility, in order to truly be able to face 500 million citizens and tell them that we were defending their security. If possible, in order to retain more unity in this Chamber, tomorrow’s vote should be postponed.

<p class="contents">This is not a sectarian issue for us but a factual issue. This is an issue about whether a badly drafted agreement serves the interests of security and anti-terrorism. As one of my advisers once said – and he is a lawyer, I used to be a lawyer and Mr Kirkhope was also a lawyer – quoting Benjamin Franklin: He who would put security so far before liberty deserves neither.</p>
<p class="contents">So we all agree that, for the EU citizens, a good agreement is what we want. Now in Coreper, it is absolutely true that the Council came up with all the issues that we as a group regarded as the important issues. Mrs Clinton, too, in her letter acknowledged that Parliament had a point, but neither of these documents went further and gave us a blueprint for solving this problem, and that is why a ‘no’ will, in our view, push towards a better agreement for the whole Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">So we, in our group, are appealing across the House and not just within our group, to support the rapporteur in what she is trying to do, a better agreement to fight terrorism. No one has the moral high ground here; we want an effective fight against terrorism, that means a better agreement and that is what we will be recommending to the Socialist and Democrats this evening in our group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament’s role is an essential part of the Treaty of Lisbon and it should be respected by all parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the substance of this issue: the greatest damage a democratic society can do to terrorism is to cut off its financial resources. That is why the interim agreement should remain in place while the definitive agreement is urgently negotiated. On at least nine proven occasions, SWIFT and TFTP have demonstrated their effectiveness and value in preventing and suppressing terrorist activities in Europe, Asia, Africa and America, in relation to the text of the interim agreement and data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Which report should prevail, ladies and gentlemen? That of the European Data Protection Supervisor or those of the special Judge, for both are well-founded yet contradictory. No, ladies and gentlemen, we have neither held a debate nor reached a solution on this issue. The wording of the interim agreement guarantees rights. It states that data provided shall be processed exclusively for the prevention of terrorism or its financing; that no copies of data provided shall be made; that data provided shall not be interconnected with any other database; and that only public security authorities shall have access to data.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust the government of the United States and the great democracy by which it is established. We have an obligation to strengthen our relations with that country, for we are natural, mutually reliable partners.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I support a House vote in favour of the interim agreement and I welcome the very positive move Parliament has made to assert its authority, and the fact that Mrs Clinton and Mr Geithner have acknowledged that authority as an indispensable element now and in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the Council and the Commission know what is expected of them. An interinstitutional agreement is urgently needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These attempts to threaten us can be described in one word: ridiculous. The US and the Council are not trying to rescue an essential tool; they are simply saving face.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many agreements and measures in place to combat terrorism. SWIFT could be a useful addition to these. The failed attack on 25 December has clearly demonstrated that it is not data we are lacking, but the ability to make effective use of the data which we already have. The idea is to divert attention away from this fact. The interim agreement simply could not be worse. It is full of contradictions and inconsistencies. Instead of suitable precautions being taken to ensure that only data relating to people who are actually under suspicion is transferred, huge volumes of data will be sent to the US every month. The agreement represents a flagrant breach of citizens’ rights, data protection and the principles of the rule of law. If the Council and the US were really prepared to take on board this criticism and to incorporate these points into a new agreement, then there would be no need for us to accept this dreadful agreement. In the interests of the citizens, we must say no to the interim agreement and we must start new negotiations immediately, so that we can put in place a really good agreement which acts as an additional, effective tool for combating terrorism and which preserves our fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time they were detained, we were informed that financial transactions were part of the substantial evidence against them.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to say firstly that I am very pleased to have confirmed once again during the debate in this House that Parliament, the Commission, and the Council are all perfectly in tune when it comes to defending our shared values and, as I said in my speech, to taking a determined stance against any kind of terrorism. In my opinion, this consensus is extremely important, and we should not forget it.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make a distinction between the two radically different strands of criticism that we have heard with regard to the SWIFT agreement which we have examined this afternoon: criticism on the grounds of procedure, and criticism on the grounds of substance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there has been constant criticism of the substance of this agreement, even by those Members who explicitly supported an agreement such as this. I reiterate what I said in my earlier speech, that things could probably have been done better; in fact, they could certainly have been done better. However, I also said, and I reiterate this too, that as the honourable Members know well, the time limits were as they were, so that the Council and the Commission had to take action within a very short time frame. In any case, let me be very clear that as I said earlier this afternoon, it is the Council’s wish that things be done differently from now on, and not as they have been done in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain Members have said, probably based on their experience, that this is a promise, a commitment, which has been broken repeatedly in this House. I would like to say in support of the Council that it is a commitment born out of a fundamental commitment within the Treaty of Lisbon, which sets a core objective that this House should play an increasingly important role in the institutional life of Europe, so that the citizens feel better represented.</p>
<p class="contents">This commitment from my country, which is a fundamental commitment within the Treaty of Lisbon, is the reason why I want to state here categorically that during the Spanish Presidency, the Council will do things differently.</p>
<p class="contents">In case some people do not trust the Council’s word, and they would be within their rights not to, they should remember that the treaty forces us to do things differently. Therefore, if the political will of the Council does not suffice, the treaty is in place within the law to ensure that things are done differently in the future. It is reliant on this House working with the Commission, and naturally reliant on the united spirit shown here by our Members, a spirit that seeks a balance between defending security and maintaining our core values; it is a pan European spirit, with which the Council is fully in tune.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make three comments regarding the issue itself. I will not address some of the more specific issues that have been the object of criticism, some of which is unfounded in my opinion. For example, it has been said on various occasions that the SWIFT agreement, as it now stands in this House, permits the bulk transfer of data. It has not been said, and it should be stated clearly however, that this is not the logic behind the agreement, and that bulk transfer is only allowed by the SWIFT agreement in exceptional cases, always and only when there are legal suspicions (Article 4(6) of the agreement). This is just one example. There have been other somewhat superficial accusations about the content of the agreement, which I believe would respond well to scrutiny, but I am not going to address them at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two more points on this matter. Firstly, along with the Commission and some of the Members of this House, I would like to stress that the agreement has been useful in the fight against terrorism. I have given some examples, and there are more in Judge Bruguière’s report, which has been given to the Members. I can provide another example, or even better, two, which I previously referred to from my own country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the SWIFT agreement was used to investigate the 11 March attacks in Madrid, with good results. It is also worth remembering that the SWIFT agreement was used to prevent an attack on the city of Barcelona just over a year ago. The perpetrators of these attacks are all currently serving sentences in Spanish prisons.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we can say that yes, it has worked, and yes, it has allowed us to get results. This being the case, then surely the honourable Members will agree with me that a suspension of the agreement will effectively mean at least a slight lowering in standards of security for European citizens. Surely, you must accept that if the agreement is working and has been working for us, then its suspension would leave us somewhat less secure, and I am choosing my words carefully so that no one can accuse the Council of being overdramatic. We would certainly be a little less secure; it is as simple as that.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I want to emphasise on behalf of the Council, and I think that the Commission also agrees, that it is vital not to suspend this agreement. It may be that this agreement warrants criticism, and I want to stress once again that we acknowledge the tough criticism that we have heard here this afternoon. However, the honourable Members will surely agree with me in saying that this agreement is a lot better than the protocol over data exchange that the United States and the EU have had to comply with for years.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement under debate today is probably not perfect. Improvements could certainly be made, and I can even agree with some of the criticisms made from certain quarters, but I ask you to acknowledge, as I do, that it is an improvement on what we had before. The EU, Council, and Commission have introduced several motions into the agreement, which are causing concern amongst some Members, who are trying primarily to guarantee that security is not at the expense of human rights and fundamental freedoms; and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I want to reiterate what the Commissioner said, that it is important not to suspend the agreement. I also want to reiterate to Parliament that the Council’s sincere wish is to negotiate a new agreement – which will be a definitive one – an agreement which will incorporate many of the issues mentioned here this afternoon, issues which the Council agrees with and would like to publicly endorse. The Council is making a commitment to do this. The fact is that the President-in-Office of the Council has already made this commitment in a letter to the President of Parliament, but we will still have to uphold it when the time comes to negotiate.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are debating an interim agreement today which improves the current situation. We are debating an agreement that will last for nine months, which is the time it will take for the Commission, the Council, and Parliament to reach a new agreement – which will be a definitive one – an agreement that will most certainly address all the very reasonable precautionary measures discussed in this afternoon’s debate in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council cannot ignore this afternoon’s debate. We cannot ignore the fact that this agreement has come in for a great deal of criticism. As I said, some of the criticisms have certainly been more founded than others, but criticism there has been, and I think that this deserves serious consideration. I am asking on behalf of the Council, that Parliament give us this time for reflection.</p>
<p class="contents">Time, naturally, to analyse and discuss this debate with my colleagues in the Council, time to discuss it with the Commission, and time, essentially, to explore the possibility of making a better agreement with the US, which I think is a real possibility. We are asking for time, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, to allow us to come back to Parliament within a few weeks, a few months, to be able to guarantee that we have created the foundations for the signing of a definitive agreement that adequately addresses the concerns expressed by certain honourable Members today. Concerns, which, I repeat, echo the Council’s concerns in many cases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is totally accurate because we talk about such important matters as how we can maintain the security of our citizens but also maintain good information and exchange systems with a high level of data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been, as the President of the Council said, a few questions, and a few misunderstandings, I think. Some of them are answered in the Bruguière report, so I would really encourage you to read that. But I think we need to understand and remember why we have an interim agreement. Why do we have it? Well, it was because SWIFT was moving and we were finding ourselves in a situation where we did not have a regulation on the transfer of data, so the Council and the Commission moved swiftly to arrange something. We did achieve certain concessions from the United States and some very good data protection mechanisms. Also, two member countries concerned asked the Commission to be involved in order to have a European approach on this and avoid bilateral agreements. This is important to recall.</p>
<p class="contents">Now this is an interim agreement, as I said; it can and it will be improved. It is the full intention of the Commission and the Council to involve the European Parliament under the Lisbon Treaty in the permanent agreement. We need to have more clarification concerning redress, lawful data processing and deletion of data. The permanent agreement will also include guarantees of rectification, access to information.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lambrinidis asked why the Commission does not have that. Well, Mr Lambrinidis, the Commission has been in office for 16 hours and 20 minutes. This is an extremely important negotiating mandate. We need to be able to discuss this together, within the new Commission, before we formulate the full negotiating mandate to discuss with the European Parliament. We have only very recently taken office so you could not expect us to have done this. But we will make sure – and Mr Barroso expressed this very clearly in the letter to Mr Buzek – that we are working on the negotiating mandate; we will present it to the European Parliament as soon as possible and make sure that you are fully informed the whole way on this.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be a very good idea to postpone the vote and we might need more time to discuss the mandate. You will see the negotiation mandate; you will have time to look at the papers, the reports and so on, and the Commission is willing, as I said, to work together with you and the Council for a good – and much better – permanent agreement on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the Council is also mindful of the fact that the precautionary measures, criticisms, and suggestions of the honourable Members must be the subject of serious consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I have asked for time to work with all the countries of the European Union, with all the Member States, to look at whether we need to incorporate this type of consideration into the new agreement. Even more importantly, I have asked for time to consult with the United States. I believe that the USA is willing to incorporate into the new agreement many of the precautionary measures, reservations, and restrictions expressed here today by the European Parliament. In short, it is willing to seek a greater balance between security and freedom in the definitive agreement, which is essentially what we are talking about today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like time to explore this possibility so that I can come back to Parliament and say, in a session such as this one, before proceeding to the vote, that the Commission and the Council have a commitment from the United States to incorporate these suggestions from the European Parliament into the new agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, I think that we would have a very different debate from the one we are having here this afternoon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you very much for making this possible. If I have understood things correctly, because this is a sensitive issue that we are discussing, then Mr Rubalcaba cannot assure us that the existing agreement will not come into force. In other words, if we postpone matters and give ourselves more time, it will come into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, my next question is: Can Mr Rubalcaba assure us that, for example, a long-term agreement will be in place within a month with higher standards or is the Council telling us that we must still wait nine months until the end of the period? It is very hard for Parliament to accept an unconditional assurance. Therefore, we must have clear conditions relating to the Council’s assurance, in order to be able to decide tomorrow about a possible postponement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Rubalcaba, you have put your finger on it. Most of the arguments put forward for debate in the House have been fair ones. I have great respect for everything that has been said. However, these words should have a documental and informative component, with full knowledge of the facts, and frankly, I have been very surprised to hear certain statements that suggest otherwise. Such statements give the impression that very few people have actually read the agreement that they are criticising, since having read it, there is no way they could have come up with some of these arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I want to ask you, Mr Rubalcaba, about the matter mentioned by my colleague, Mr Manfred Weber, and by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert in her letter (as you already know I am in favour of keeping the interim agreement whilst negotiating a new agreement). In her letter, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert asks the same question as Manfred Weber. Can the Council guarantee to Parliament that with the participation of this House, it will present the final text of the new agreement, in committee in June, and in plenary in July? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the timing, it is clearly not the same to bring to this House the foundations of a definitive agreement, or in other words, to bring a commitment from the United States to include some of the precautionary measures and suggestions put forward by this House, as it is to bring a new agreement to the table.</p>
<p class="contents">If the honourable Member is asking me whether we can bring a new agreement to this House in one month’s time, the answer is no. If you are asking whether, within a deadline of a few months, we can bring to this House the results of dialogue between the United States and Parliament, whose participation is very important, so that we can debate whether we are right in thinking that the definitive agreement will be much better than the present one, my answer is yes. In my opinion, we are capable of achieving this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is precisely what I am asking for. Therefore, I am not specifically referring to the rapporteur’s proposal, which I admit I have not seriously considered this afternoon after assessing the general mood and the multiple actions and speeches against the signing of the interim agreement. Let me reiterate my opinion that things being as they are, it is a much more realistic option to ask the House for a deadline of say three months, to give us time to bring forward the foundations of an agreement with the United States for debate in Parliament. In other words, this agreement would include the elements that we in the EU (Commission, Council and Parliament) and the United States believe should be incorporated into the definitive agreement that would subsequently be negotiated.</p>

Let me underline to Mr Busuttil and the President-in-Office, in particular, that by our withholding our consent on the interim agreement, the security of European citizens is not being compromised. I think it is very unfair to use that as a form of argument. Other legal instruments remain available for targeted transatlantic data exchange and, as stated by Claude Moraes, nobody has the moral high ground here.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the USA letter, that letter is obviously appreciated, there is no doubt about that, but to state that Parliament’s views will be heard, considered and responded to is a bit weak, is it not? It is very non-committal. Also, it is stated that this is only provided this interim agreement remains in force, which I consider as pure blackmail. I am getting angry and I am sorry for that, but this debate is slowly getting on my nerves.</p>
<p class="contents">TFTP is not, and cannot be considered to be, consistent with the strongest European traditions on civil liberties. It must be seen, and I want it acknowledged, as a departure from European law and practice. I said this before and I want to hear it again clearly. I also want to say that nobody doubts the necessity for continued and stronger cooperation between the US and the EU, though the EU and its Member States, in the Council in particular, must be strong in setting their own objectives. In that respect, Parliament and the Council are not in tune yet.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me stress that it is all about European responsibility, and a European solution is to be found. The Netherlands and Belgium cannot end up being the ‘dupe’ of all this. I listened carefully to your statements, to the request for more time, and I am willing to refer that request to the Conference of Presidents, but you did not give me the reassurances I was looking for: it was too vague. I will, however, refer your request to the Conference of Presidents which will meet later this afternoon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreement with the United States on the transfer of financial data rather comes down to opening and reading the personal mail of all European citizens or monitoring all their e-mail exchanges on the pretext that terrorists are likely to send each other letters or electronic messages. The agreement we are talking about does not guarantee respect for personal data and still less for the use to which they may be put. The risk of meddling in the private lives of millions of innocent citizens or in the perfectly legal financial transactions of European companies, simply on the orders of an administration, is unacceptable. I still remember the ‘Echelon’ affair, that listening system that was allegedly intended for military and security purposes and which proved to be an alarming potential commercial and political spy system directed against the allies. We can accept an exchange, that is to say, a reciprocal transfer, of targeted data on request from a judicial authority in a specific context. We certainly want to help SWIFT break the technical deadlock that prevents it from carrying out anything other than mass data transfers. However, we cannot accept this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent attempt by a suicide bomber to blow up an aircraft flying from Europe to the USA shows there are people who are ready to kill hundreds of innocent people in the name of fanatical convictions. It would, however, be a mistake to view acts of terror exclusively as the deeds of desperate individuals. For behind all terrorists is an organisation which trained them, supplied them with explosives and financed them. Terrorism has to be well organised to survive, and for this it principally needs money. We must not stop in our efforts to track financial movements and establish the source of funds used to support terrorism. Efficient exchange of information between governments and mutual assistance in identifying suspicious people and organisations is a matter of paramount importance for ensuring security for our citizens. We should make every effort to ensure that the final agreement guarantees the necessary protection of personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget, however, that our primary objective should be to limit terrorism, because terrorism is still a real threat, including in Europe. When we are talking about security, political games should be set aside. The European Parliament should not make a show of its authority by rejecting the interim agreement with the USA on the processing of financial messaging data, because this agreement improves the security of our continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin this debate by thanking Parliament for the opportunity to hold a calm debate on counter-terrorism policy, and on certain elements of counter-terrorism policy in particular. I also applaud the timing of this debate, as a reasonable amount of time has elapsed since the worldwide commotion caused by the failed attack in Detroit in December of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, when something like this happens, when it comes to tackling a threat such as the threat of terrorism, I believe in making a response, but I am much more in favour of working quietly and continuously, slowly but surely, as we say in my country. I would emphasise to the House that the threat of terrorism is still as real as it was in all of the EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the terrorists observe us, we know that they are innovative and try to change their methods to evade our strategies in the fight against terrorism. Our strategy also needs to be innovative and varied because of this; it needs to improve and, most importantly, we must learn from our mistakes, since we certainly do make mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents">This being said, we are all aware that if there had not been a failed attack in Detroit in December, we would probably not be debating this issue in the terms that we are in this House. In other words, this debate is born from the need for precautions, and especially for conclusions, which we have all drawn from examining the success in Detroit that I just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">At the core of today’s debate is also an analysis of where we failed in dealing with the alleged attack, and the measures that different countries are adopting to prevent those mistakes from being made again. Therefore, we are talking about analysing data, about counter-terrorism services; we are talking about exchanging data, and we are talking about body scanners. We are talking about mistakes made in an attack that fortunately did not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that this is the subject of our debate, I would like to mention some of the most obvious conclusions that I think we can draw from the failed attack on Detroit. There are five conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Detroit highlights the fact that terrorists continue to target civil aviation as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Detroit highlights the importance of collecting data, but also of integrating and analysing it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Detroit highlights that the associates of al-Qaeda are in a position to launch attacks outside of what we would call their own territory. This applies to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (the terrorist organisation suspected of being behind the failed attack in Detroit) or al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb countries, who represent a threat to us all.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth conclusion I have drawn is that the events in Detroit should remind us how important it is to work on reversing the process of radicalisation. In my opinion, the personality of suspected terrorists is a very significant factor in relation to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Detroit calls for us to pay close attention to failed states, or to any states that are in danger of becoming failed states due to their circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The first and second conclusions concern the ongoing threat to civil aviation and the need to integrate all of the data available to us; they lead us directly to this afternoon’s debate or debates, regarding data and its use, and body scanners.</p>
<p class="contents">I should say that this is not a new debate, nor is it the first time we have debated it in this House. Mr de Kerchove, the Counter-terrorism Coordinator, talked about information management and personal data protection in his interesting and lucid report during a debate on the subject in this House on 26 November. Data and analysis of data are a key element in the struggle to prevent and deal with terrorism, which is the subject of this afternoon’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to identify terrorists; we need to know where they are planning to attack, who is providing them with weapons; we need to know the material infrastructure supporting them; we need to know their communication systems; and we can find this out by means of databases and specialised sources. We need data exchange so that we can obtain all the available information, and we must manage it properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I hasten to add that some of the attacks that we have suffered in the past could have been avoided if the information had been made available in good time to those responsible for counter-terrorist measures; in other words, if the information had been handled in an integrated, and if you will pardon the expression, an intelligent manner, which does not always happen. This brings us to the debate on information management.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the framework of the EU within which we can exchange information appropriately. Our recently adopted strategy formed part of the Council’s conclusions last November. It aims to provide the security forces and intelligence services with the necessary data, in the interests of improving the usefulness and effectiveness of the counter-terrorist strategy. The necessary data and only that, nothing more, since bulk data sometimes has a negative effect on its own value and effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">As this strategy indicates, the decisions regarding data exchange should be of a coherent, professional, efficient, viable, reliable nature, and understandable for all the citizens and all the professionals who work with it. According to its guidelines, the strategy must bear in mind the statements and concerns that we have dealt with in this House; the need to fight against terrorism, as well as the issues of human rights, the right to privacy, and to protection of personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said at the beginning of the debate, another of the consequences that we can draw from the alleged Detroit attack is that commercial aircraft continue to be a fundamental target for terrorists. Obviously, the alleged terrorist succeeded in boarding the aircraft with a sufficient quantity of explosives to cause it to explode in the air, thus thwarting all of our surveillance systems and all of our airport security systems and mechanisms. In other words, we obviously need to review these security mechanisms, because they were clearly insufficient for preventing an attack such as the alleged Detroit attack, which fortunately did not take place.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, we must keep on improving our security services, to try to avoid terrorists or suspected terrorists boarding commercial flights. We have to prevent anyone being able to board a plane with weapons, explosives or chemical precursors of explosives. In case these two safety measures fail us, we need to do more to protect our planes and avoid in-flight incidents.</p>
<p class="contents">This is precisely the framework for the debate that we are having on an issue of concern within this House and the Council, the issue of body scanners.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Members know, in matters of air safety, the Commission holds the relevant jurisdiction to set targets and make regulations. These matters are debated in the formal and informal Council of Transport Ministers. However, I would like to mention that this matter of air security was the subject of a debate in the informal Council of Ministers, which took place a few weeks ago in Toledo.</p>
<p class="contents">We agreed on various matters in this Council: firstly, that it is correct and appropriate for the EU to hold a common position on body scanners and, more generally, on all of the protection mechanisms in our airports; it does not make sense that some airports are less protected than others, because it essentially means that we are all less protected. As such, we would be pleased if the European Union could reach an agreement, and hold a common position in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on a more difficult, delicate matter, where there are different aspects to consider: firstly and obviously, to find out how efficient this type of body scanner is in preventing terrorists from boarding planes with explosives, or chemical precursors to explosives. Secondly, we need to find out and analyse if these scanners are compatible with people’s right to privacy and intimacy, which is of concern to the Council, the Commission, and to this House. The third matter we agreed on is to find out if there could be any health risks for those who pass through this machine to board commercial flights.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to these three issues: the Commission is working on three studies regarding the efficiency of body scanners, their effect on health, and on their compatibility with people’s human rights and fundamental freedoms. These studies will be available to the Council and this House in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the informal Council in Toledo agreed to research and provide this information, so that we can have a thorough debate, and hopefully reach a unanimous position on this matter, which would be very desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">Once we have achieved this common position, we will take fully into account the Resolution that this Parliament passed on 23 October 2008, after a debate on body scanners. During the debate, we discussed the need for an evaluation of the impact on human rights, the health risks and the economic impact, as well as the need for consultation with the European Data Protection Supervisor. These considerations must be taken into account in our next debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate my thanks to this House for the opportunity to debate these issues, and my thanks to Parliament for its flexibility regarding the timing of the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Siim Kallas, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, we are here to present a combined view on certain aspects in the fight against terrorism. My priority as Transport Commissioner is definitely the safety and security of passengers. This is a major priority for our common transport policy and this is always extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">The attempted terrorist attack on Northwest Airlines flight 253 to Detroit on 25 December has again confirmed the reality of the threat to civil aviation. I would like to stress that existing EU standards on aviation security were correctly implemented on 25 December at Amsterdam Schiphol airport.</p>
<p class="contents">The incident showed first of all the failure of intelligence, a failure ‘to connect the dots’. Aviation remains a target for terrorists. We cannot ignore this fact. Aviation security must therefore be guaranteed by all appropriate means, in full compliance with fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The travelling public, the media and aviation stakeholders all legitimately ask us whether the existing security arrangements are good enough, or whether we need to take further action. In this regard, the new screening technologies, the so-called ‘body scanners’, are discussed everywhere today.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the use of body scanners at airports, aviation security experts are of the opinion that these machines have better detection capacity than current screening equipment. Some think that they are considerably better. Some think that this is not such a big advance, but how big the added value of these machines is to airport security and what the consequences are for health and privacy is not yet entirely clear today.</p>
<p class="contents">As noted previously by Parliament in 2008, the use of body-imaging technology raises a number of questions, notably in relation to privacy, data protection and health. I intend to present to you in April a report on imaging technology and its use at EU airports. This report will address the questions raised in the European Parliament resolution of 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to look at these questions seriously. We also need to make up our minds on whether these concerns are better addressed at national or European level. To my mind, an EU framework would be better. I say this based on our experience of a common approach since 9/11 and with a view to the efficiency of the single market for aviation. An EU framework guarantees uniform standards in relation both to security and to respect for individual rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to underline that airport security is a much larger question than the introduction of a new screening technology. To fight terrorism targeting civil aviation, we need a large variety of combined and coordinated measures – intelligence, profiling, different search methods and international cooperation. As the Minister just said, terrorists develop. We must develop as well, and body scanners are only one element in this variety.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to your views and thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cecilia Malmström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, this is the Commission’s new dual approach. As the former debate showed, now that we have the Lisbon Treaty, work at EU level now enters into a new phase. I am very happy and honoured that I will work together with you in the fight against terrorism and on other security-related matters. We will do this while, of course, fully respecting that it is the Member States who have the final responsibility for all operational and intelligence work in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recall to you – some of you were at my hearing a few weeks ago – that I made a promise that I would do an evaluation of all counter-terrorism policies. As a first step, I have asked my services to prepare an overview and an assessment of everything that has been achieved so far. This will be the basis upon which I will decide how to move forward. We need to evaluate and to get a full understanding of what we have, its effects, what is possibly missing and what is overlapping in order to be able to propose new measures and more thought through measures. I look forward to bringing this evaluation to you and to discussing it with you.</p>
<p class="contents">But this stocktaking does not mean that I am not fully aware of the fact that the threat of terrorism has not diminished. As my colleague, Mr Kallas, and the Council Presidency have said, we know that terrorism is still one of the greatest threats to our values and to our democracies. The Denver flight showed that recently.</p>
<p class="contents">We have statistics from Europol showing that in 2008, EU Member States reported a total of 515 failed or successfully perpetrated terrorist attacks within Europe; 359 individuals were tried on terrorist charges in a total of 187 proceedings; 50% of these were related to al-Qaeda or Islamist terrorism, and 39% to separatist terrorism, such as ETA activities in Spain. We also know that in 2008, we had the tragic events and the horrible bombing in Mumbai, which also targeted European citizens, among them Members of this House. These events and the figures from Europol speak a clear language: terrorism is still there, and it is important that we do not lower our guard and we ensure that all tools are deployed in the fight against terrorism, while of course always fully respecting fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the instruments that we do have today, we have the EU counter-terrorism strategy, developed after the attacks in Madrid and in London. This strategy highlights the EU’s commitment to combating terrorism globally while respecting human rights and to making Europe safer, allowing its citizens to live in an area of freedom, security and justice. This, of course, is a commitment that it still valid.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no freedom without security and there can be no security without freedom. That is why respecting fundamental rights in the fight against terrorism is not only a requirement of any democratic society but is a necessity in order to ensure that our policies remain credible, legitimate and sustainable. That is why the Commission will only propose measures that will continue to be subject to EU law screening, especially with regard to fundamental rights and rigorous impact assessment, including the impact on personal data and individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism is, as we know, a global phenomenon, and that is why we will remain dedicated to cooperating with our allies and partners and international organisations all over the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the internal dimension of countering and preventing terrorism, we do have in our counter-terrorist strategy some key objectives on how the Union can contribute in the fight against terrorism. I fully share these objectives, in particular the need to stop violent radicalisation, protect our critical infrastructure, support victims, improve exchange of information between national authorities and cooperate with all appropriate stakeholders. We have to react to non-conventional threats and to improve the detection of threats. We have to deprive terrorists of financial resources and to invest more in research and technological development.</p>
<p class="contents">This development on these policies has, of course, been strongly supported by the European Commission in cooperation with the Member States. Over the past year, the Commission has made a major contribution to approximating the legal frameworks of Member States in this work. We have, for instance, the European arrest warrant, which created an EU-wide common understanding on terrorist crime and facilitated extradition procedures within the EU Member States. We have also undertaken important activities to counter the terrorist abuse of the Internet, addressing conditions conducive to terrorist radicalisation, launching a European programme for the protection of critical infrastructure, and limiting access by terrorists to the means they need to commit their acts – funding and explosives.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU action plan for enhancing the security of explosives foresees important measures to raise the threshold for terrorists who want to use explosives for an attack. I would propose a legislative framework to address the dangers associated with precursors which can be used to fabricate improvised explosive devices. I will do so this year.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have the CBRN action plan proposed by the Commission last June and agreed by the Council. This Action Plan consists of 130 measures. The Commission has earmarked up to EUR 100 million which could be made available from its existing financial programmes to facilitate implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully committed to ensuring that, in the coming years, the European Commission will continue to develop its role as facilitator and catalyst for cooperation, expert networks, exchanging best practices, pooling resources, improving research and developing common approaches to transnational challenges. We will also have to revise how we use our financial resources. This might be by creating an internal security fund, which is foreseen in the Stockholm Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">On a large scale, international information exchange concerning the collection of data and storage of data concerning thousands of citizens has to take account – and this was very visible in the last debate we had – of very high data protection standards in order to prevent abuse and mishandling. We also have to make sure, as Commissioner Kallas said, that we connect the dots in an appropriate way. Together with my colleague, Viviane Reding, I will submit in the near future a combined data protection regime that would also cover police and judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">All this will be considered in the evaluation and it will be under the umbrella of the internal security strategy that we will put forward to you within a short time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me conclude by underlining that, in the long run, we can only succeed in fighting against terrorism if we remain able to communicate our values and remain respectful of fundamental rights. We have to avoid our policies being perceived as ambiguous or as applying double standards. We can only defend high moral ground and prevent alienation from our societies and our way of living if we remain faithful to our values of democracy and the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Looking back, we have to say that terrorism is a real threat to the people of Europe. We are taking positive action and I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the public authorities. The people who are responsible for security have done a good job over recent years. I would also like to thank our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we must look to the future. What will we be faced with over the next few years? In this respect, I have three specific requests or proposals. The first concerns cooperation among the authorities in Europe. Every document comes with a headline emphasising the importance of collaborating and strengthening our cooperation. These are wonderful words, but nothing has happened in practice. Once again nothing happened in Toledo with regard to practical cooperation. There is no lack of action – this has been made clear in Detroit. What we are lacking is cooperation between the authorities. That is where the problem lies. Therefore, I would like to ask the Council finally to do its job in this area and to call on the Commission to put some appropriate proposals on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that we should investigate our existing legislation with regard to the collection of data and mobile phone data, for example, in the case of the retention of data. For this reason, you have the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for this evaluation. After an interval of a few years, it is important to put it to the test.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have just had a discussion about SWIFT. I would like to ask the House why our cooperation with the United States has to be organised in this way. It has to be organised like this because we Europeans are not in the position to evaluate the data ourselves. Therefore, the question arises as to whether we are self-confident enough to evaluate it ourselves. This is another thought for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, we must take a coordinated, harmonised European approach. We must, therefore, have European rules, or else you simply relocate the security problem and you create chaos, and the President-in-Office of the Council made reference to this, but I want to point out to the Spanish Presidency that a number of Council members have, in the meantime, adopted a solo approach, and I ask you to explicitly denounce that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need a global approach to security and counter-terrorism, and that means that we need to avoid drawing hasty conclusions, that we need to stop the politics of announcements, that the potential introduction of body scanners also cannot be seen in isolation from the broader context of other existing or potential measures and that we clearly also need to see it in the context of other aspects, such as public health and the budgetary implications.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that we must also stop giving the impression that these body scanners will guarantee 100% security. You will be aware, for example, that this equipment is capable of finding explosives located on, but not in, the body.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to say that I therefore also support the Commission’s approach in first setting up trials before bringing forward a proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need more security in this area. The events in Detroit and Munich have shown that there are security loopholes. For this reason, body scanners are being introduced in a mad rush as if they were a miracle cure. They are already in place in the US, in the Netherlands and in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this raises the issue of whether body scanners will really make air travel safer. This is one of the crucial questions that we must ask ourselves. There is, in fact, a whole series of questions relating to body scanners. What type of technology is being used? What type of radiation do they emit? Can they cause damage to health? What do they allow people to see? Just a few green or red dots or the whole person who is being scanned? Finally, can we ensure that the data is being protected? Also, these scanners are expensive. If we are going to install them, who will be paying?</p>
<p class="contents">There are a lot of questions to be answered and we are in the process of doing this. You also want to do this and present us with a solution. Whatever happens, we need a solution which covers the whole of Europe. We also need to take into consideration Tel Aviv and the possibility of using another method. We need to search for the bombers and not the bombs. We cannot adopt this method wholesale, because it involves discrimination, but we must investigate all the possibilities while protecting our fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are technologies that do meet all of these requirements, meaning that x-rays, radiographs and naked images must be outmoded, which is where we are going wrong at the moment. At Heathrow Airport in London, this equipment is being used without the element of freedom of choice. New equipment is being introduced in Italy. The Dutch Minister for Justice is calling for this equipment to be introduced at all airports across Europe, not just for flights to the United States, but for all flights.</p>
<p class="contents">If we just continue to hold the same old debate about the technology, we will continue to avoid asking the real question, the serious question, namely does this actually help and is this the society we want to see? I agree with my fellow Member from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who is indeed asking these questions.

This email spoke of the ‘post-Detroit era’. No surprise there. Each machine cost EUR 250 000. There is a fortune to be made by selling body scanners, but in reading the email and thinking about this post-Detroit era, after an amateur attempt made by a terrorist who was overpowered by other passengers on the plane, I asked myself whether this attack really merited having an historical era named after it.</p>
<p class="contents">It did not, unless it refers to the era of sheer effrontery. Not everything can serve as an excuse to increase the levels of intrusion into the private lives of members of the public. European citizens also need to know that we in Parliament have a responsibility. Yes, we do indeed need to investigate terrorism. It is true that the police always need more data, as do airports, but it is also important to base research on clear assumptions, and there are many assumptions being made by the Council and the Commission. I am sorry to say that these are incorrect.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that the terrorist threat has not diminished is debatable and should be debated here. The idea that terrorism is evolving and that we should evolve too is true, but the first thing is to do our jobs well, because the Detroit attack, or rather the attempted attack, could very easily have been prevented. Now we find ourselves debating the databases and police practices of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">When they discover that terrorists can ingest the materials for making bombs, will they start doing endoscopies at airports? Is this where we want to end up? There comes a time when this House has to sit down and discuss this matter carefully, with respect for the rights of the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are facing up to this challenge on both a technical and a parliamentary level.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we have not only implemented regulations concerning the ban on liquids in hand luggage, but we are also looking closely at body scanners. I would like to say one thing first of all. We do not currently have complete security, as many of the other speakers have already emphasised, and we will not have it in future. However, we can develop natural techniques that will allow us to come close to complete security asymptotically.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take some fundamental rules into account, both outside and inside Parliament. We are already in agreement across all the groups that there should be as little impact as possible on the health of the passengers. Therefore, it is necessary for us to introduce advanced body scanners which work according to a specific principle. Of course, it is obvious that personal rights must be protected. In addition, we must not only refer to the body scanners which scan the naked body when giving examples of the type of screening to be used.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we have agreed with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that the Commission will present us with a proposal for legislation on body scanners by the end of March or early April, in any case, before the summer recess. There are a number of factors to be taken into account in this area. These include consistent cooperation between the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which is taking the leading role, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the reliability of the equipment, European certification and establishing the same conditions throughout Europe, so that we can ensure that there is security within its continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If technology can speed me through so that I am not mistaken for someone else, then that is a great thing, but for the many people I represent in my constituency who are badly treated at security, or singled out, what they want is safety. We will have that from the Transport Committee in this good, joint approach, but they want their civil liberties protected from the effects of terrorism so that there is no weak link at any airport.

I remain of the view that any measure which increases security for the travelling public must be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it must also be proportionate and give innocent travellers – the vast majority – the respect they deserve. Following the Christmas Day attempt to blow up the aircraft in the USA, we have seen what amounts to a knee-jerk reaction to impose any possible means to enhance security. In some Member States, particularly my own, the use of such machines is now mandatory with no alternative such as a ‘pat-down’ available – the so-called ‘no scan, no fly’ tactic.</p>
<p class="contents">I fundamentally object to that policy. On the privacy front, I have to say that the decision by the UK Government to overturn child-protection laws in order to introduce body scanners is nothing short of a scandal. We have to look at the fact that on Christmas Day – the issue that reopened this debate – it was not down to poor security at airports. It was, to quote the US President, ‘a failure in the system to properly exchange intelligence’.</p>
<p class="contents">Some experts have already said that the explosives used would not have been detected by such scanners.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I regrettably have to say that I now think we need to have a proper system of passenger profiling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, terrorism generates hysteria which results in the rights of citizens being restricted unreasonably, as in the case of body scanners or the current SWIFT agreement. Secondly, the war on terror has failed. It has only succeeded in increasing the problem. On the subject of cooperation between the security services in the European Union, I would like to say that the European Parliament urgently needs democratic rights of control in this area, as is the norm in every democratic Member State. In addition, I would like to recommend that the Commission supports the introduction of the Common Standardised User Interface (CSUI).

In this regard, too, the Lisbon Treaty lays the foundations for us to be able to finally develop a common anti-terrorism policy in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree entirely with the comments of the President-in-Office of the Council and would like to highlight some of the elements on which such a common policy must be built.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is to step up the exchange of information, particularly in relation to the efforts to prevent terrorist attacks and research into funding mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is to apply all of the scientific and technological advances that have been achieved to the fight against terrorism, with due respect for individuals’ fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The third is to work with third countries, especially Afghanistan, Pakistan and the countries of the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, in the debate on air safety we must ensure that technological advances, namely body scanners, are compatible with human health and privacy and, above all, that they do not affect processing times in airports or passenger comfort.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are also three institutional elements. The first is COSI, the Standing Committee on Internal Security. The second is the declaration on counter-terrorism measures issued at the last informal meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council of the European Union in Toledo. The third is the transatlantic area of security, which must provide for the development of close cooperation with the United States to combat this common threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The safety of travellers is, of course, paramount, but we should not forget the need for a sense of proportion in the protective methods used. Use of this type of equipment still leaves a series of unanswered questions. What effect do the scanners have on the health of passengers who are scanned? How will protection of the images of people who are scanned be guaranteed? Is it not better to tighten up the existing system than spend billions of euros on equipment, when it is known that the equipment does not detect explosives concealed inside the human body? We should be against the compulsory introduction of scanners at European airports until we have heard answers to these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have a comment – I have the impression that we have found a solution, and now we are looking for a problem for it to solve.

It is no longer possible for individual Member States to do what they want. This applies in particular to body scanners.

The alternative is the principle that everyone does what they want and no one does what they should, but everyone does something.</p>

We need to ask ourselves two questions. The first question concerns the extent to which this response is proportionate and can really help to achieve the objective of combating terrorism. We do not currently have any clear answers to this question. This is why I support what Mrs Malmström has said concerning the need for an evaluation of all types of scanners. I would like to see this assessment completed before we do anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question concerns the risks to health. Everyone in this room and also those Members who are currently elsewhere will have to pass through body scanners several times each week. I would have to do so at least twice a week. This is a long-term measure and I would like to know to what extent it will harm my health. No real assessments have been carried out in this area. I would like to make it quite clear that I am not prepared to expose myself to body scanners until these assessments have been made. Therefore, I am calling for clear answers and not for hasty reactions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, we should be aware that frequent exposure to low doses of radiation can cause cancers and malformations. My question therefore concerns justification of the risks.

Despite this, the usefulness of the various anti-terrorism measures has never been called into question. Instead, every attack is followed by further restrictions on civil rights and liberties. The European Parliament is only waking up to this now that EU citizens are being obliged to undress both literally and financially in front of the US. The transparent citizen is increasingly becoming a reality and all of this is based on data and information from the secret services whose role and reliability have become highly controversial, not least since the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the doubts about the benefits, feasibility and compatibility with personal rights of body scanners, it seems highly unlikely that they will divert radical Islamists from their terrorist intentions.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I have listened carefully to the speeches by all the groups and Members on this topic. We have heard some extremely interesting views, and I welcome them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you, as I did in my first speech, that I am certainly not in favour of holding debates on such a complex and sensitive topic as the fight against terrorism after attacks or apparent attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">We obviously need to examine these attacks or apparent attacks to find out what went wrong with our security systems, but there is no doubt, as has been said time and again here this afternoon, that the counter-terrorism policy must be a carefully thought-out, calm and deliberate policy and must be applied in a proportional manner.</p>
<p class="contents">If we adopt measures that will undermine our principles, we are probably making a serious mistake. As a result, we need to analyse, for example, what happened in Detroit to try to prevent mistakes, but we must not respond with a knee-jerk reaction after every attack because this would probably result in us adopting measures that, in some cases, would simply not make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has a strategy for its counter-terrorism policy. We have a good strategy for fighting terrorism in the European Union, one that has proven to be effective in recent years. We only have to look at the actions of the security forces in the different countries to see the extent to which, on many occasions, those actions were based on application of the common strategy we introduced a number of years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an important figure, a Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, whose speeches are very interesting. Once again, I would recommend that you look in detail at his last speech in this House because I believe it is an excellent speech that highlights the extent of our strategy. Indeed, we have recently been trying to give concrete expression to this strategy through prevention, unlike the early years of its application, when we put much more emphasis on detection.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the most important element in the fight against terrorism is prevention, in other words, preventing attacks. That is why we are focusing our common efforts, as I said, on prevention. That is also why we are concentrating on aspects such as radicalisation, which I mentioned in my speech, as did the Commissioner. We are keen to analyse the policies being implemented in each country to prevent radicalisation, which is undoubtedly the root cause of many of the terrorist attacks we have suffered in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also keen to ensure the correct exchange of information. This has been emphasised in the House on various occasions. The important thing is not to transmit all of the information that you have, but to transmit the information that is relevant to those who are receiving it. That is the information that needs to be transmitted. The aim is not to swamp ourselves with information, but to have information management tools that make the exchange as effective as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been significant improvements recently in the European Union in that regard. We have a strategy that, when implemented, will, for example, improve the functioning of our exchange systems. When I talk about exchange, I am thinking of Europol, I am thinking of Eurojust, I am thinking of COSI, which has been mentioned here by some Members, and, lastly, I am thinking of the exchange of information and how to make it more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, yes, the controversial body scanners are now on the agenda, and I believe, as I said in my first speech and as the Commissioners said, too, that it is an issue that we have to tackle. Ideally, we will be able to decide on a common solution at European level. Of course, if we do not, each country will be able to implement its own policies, and probably, even if we do decide on a common solution, there may be some countries that decide to go ahead with their own policies under their own laws. However, there is little doubt that a common position on this matter would be extraordinarily helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to adopt such a position, and in line with what I said at the start of this speech, we need a calm and deliberate debate focusing on three elements that are currently being studied by the Commission: firstly, the effectiveness of the scanners (whether or not they are effective, what their limits are and whether or not they can do what we want them to do); secondly, their compatibility with fundamental rights and individual freedoms; and thirdly, their compatibility with the health of the people who will have to pass through them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe these are the three topics that we need to examine. Once the reports are available, we will adopt a common position, which I believe is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to say once again how much I appreciate the speeches made here in the House, which I consider to be extremely useful for the Council’s work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not the case. We are just in a process of careful examination of these new technologies and we will come to you after April, after a substantial report which will examine all aspects of these new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself have certain doubts, especially about efficiency and, as somebody said here, the proportionality of using this new technology, but we should not reject outright new technologies. Terrorism develops and we, too, must use all technological developments to defend our citizens and passengers. So do not demonise new technologies. We will, together with colleagues Cecilia Malmström and Viviane Reding, propose a common European approach with all necessary requirements concerning all technological, legal, fundamental rights and privacy issues and aspects. We definitely will propose some common European approach, an approach on which I believe there is consensual understanding and which is preferred here and, I understand, also in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is what we will do in the near future. We will come with a report and then we will continue this discussion. Believe me, we do not have any conspiracy to introduce some kind of new machines immediately; there is no technological solution which is totally bullet-proof or which guarantees 100% security, and aviation security is an especially complex area where we need a large variety of combined measures and also very strong international cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">So after this report, we will come with concrete proposals and we will definitely propose a common European approach on what the standards might be and what the requirements might be if Member States opt for the introduction or use of new screening technologies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Counter-terrorism is an important tool for fighting terrorism. We have painful experiences within the European Union of the effects of terrorism and the threat that it presents, not only to individuals but to societies, democracy and our fundamental values.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States, of course, have the operational responsibility and the responsibility for their intelligence, but I am convinced that we can do much more at European level to coordinate and to fine-tune the tools that we have. That is why I have asked my services to, very quickly, carry out an analysis of the policies, of the framework, of the tools that we already have, in order to see what can be improved and how we can use them in an even more intelligent way. I agree with certain Members who have said that. I am also convinced that Europol, Eurojust and Member State authorities can work much better and in a much more coordinated way. There are certainly measures for doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">Events like the one in Detroit are important as they serve as a kind of alarm bell, alerting us to the fact that terrorism is still present; it is still a very important threat. There are demands and pressure on us politicians to do things quickly, to introduce improvements and to protect the citizens immediately. This is totally natural. We have a responsibility to protect security, but also to act after thorough analysis, assessment and discussion so we propose appropriate and proportional measures, as Commissioner Siim Kallas and as the Council have also said. We will do this. We will also have to give full consideration to respect for fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is how this Commission will work. We will come back to you with more detailed proposals after this evaluation has been carried out and discuss this further with you. Thank you very much for an important and very engaging debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why all Member States have stepped up their efforts to improve the tools used to prevent and combat it. The adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon offers the opportunity to respond much more efficiently in every area linked, directly or indirectly, to combating terrorism. The use of body scanners is a delicate issue. I think that there are important factors which must be examined carefully before making a decision on this. They concern the scanners’ effectiveness, respect for the right to privacy, the financial impact of using them given the particularly high cost of buying them and, above all, the way in which the use of these machines affects the health of those who are screened by them. The European Commission is due to produce three studies on the use and effects of body scanners. For this reason, I believe that it is important for us to await the experts’ conclusions and closely analyse them and only then make a decision on a common position on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although solutions are normally based on compromise, in this instance, compromises may not be possible. It is apparent that current procedures, in particular, body searches, are not sufficient. It has been established that body scanners are more effective. The problem is that they may offend passengers’ dignity. Therefore, this is the issue which has to be addressed.

I would like to draw attention to the fact that while using new technical measures, which are aimed at achieving a high level of airport security, it is also very important to set boundaries between human rights and security itself, as those measures are not only related to the protection of citizens, but to the impact on their rights and freedoms. The Commission has yet to present an impact assessment report, confirming that precisely body scanners will ensure the effective protection of people travelling by air, and therefore there are still doubts as to whether these technical security measures will really be safe, effective and sound.

I am aware that concerns exist among frequent flyers and I am concerned about subjecting other passengers, such as pregnant women and children, to body scanners. There are also considerable concerns regarding the intrusive nature of these images, and we must ensure that the privacy of European citizens is protected before we agree to the widespread distribution of these time-consuming and expensive machines. Given that the American authorities have conceded that it was a failure on the part of their security agencies rather than airport technology which led to the recent Detroit terrorist scare, I believe that, before we invest in this controversial technology, a variety of less expensive methods – such as increased intelligence, different search methods and enhanced international cooperation – should be explored.

At the same time, a number of elements of measures already taken, planned or tested to improve aviation safety already exceed the strictly aeronautical or aviation safety requirements. This is why these issues should be investigated in their overall context. Safety is a key issue in our lives – it is the most important issue. However, we only feel safe when safety measures do not restrict our rights disproportionately, do not violate our personal rights and, in some cases, do not damage our health, and when the measures taken to ensure our safety, as a whole, are not disproportionate, cannot be circumvented and have an appropriate level of efficiency. We need devices, such as body scanners, which provide efficient passenger traffic monitoring, are used on the basis of voluntary consent, taking into account, among other things, passengers who have essential medical implants (electronic pacemakers or metal implants), are not harmful to health, children, pregnant women or frequent travellers, and finally, do not record image data and are used only to provide an appropriate warning in the event of a risk. Therefore, any further debate on the introduction of test scanners is only useful when sufficiently detailed impact assessments of the conditions listed above have been carried out.

Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has tendered a contract, worth up to EUR 2 million, for body scanners at Dublin airport. The DAA said that, if the Department of Transport gives the go-ahead, which seems very likely, and the equipment proved successful, the scanners could be extended to Cork and Shannon airports. But the Data Protection Commissioner is concerned that any moves by the Irish authorities to bring in scanners goes through proper consideration and balances security needs with individual privacy rights. Manchester Airport, where one of the scanners is being trialled, insists the black and white images are not pornographic or erotic and are viewed by a single officer at a remote location after which they are immediately destroyed. Body scanners are not infallible but they are the best technology available at present and so we need to use what tools we have to hand in order to reduce the terrorist threat. We need a pan-European approach to the issue of scanners – airport security needs to be uniform.

It seems to me that this is not, however, a correct understanding of the matter. From this point of view, the problem of guaranteeing protection of human rights is not very significant, either. The fundamental question we should ask is whether the new methods and instruments proposed by the special services will be used effectively. If we give up part of our liberty in favour of security, will our security really be guaranteed? The information we are receiving about this makes us very sceptical. If the appropriate services are not even able to guarantee effective passport control, and if they cannot use the information they possess – which is so clearly shown by the incident with the flight to Detroit – what guarantee do we have that they will be able to use the new instruments effectively? History teaches us that in crisis situations, special services want to take the simplest route. They demand new powers, more money and better instruments, while they are not able to use to the full the possibilities they already have. Someone should stand up for common sense and healthy scepticism, and it seems to me that the European Parliament has a not insignificant role to play in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A decision on compulsory use of scanning equipment must be made. There is no point talking about it at all if the scans are to be voluntary. For it is difficult to suppose that terrorists will agree to being scanned. A very important question is, of course, the safety of the scanners for health. Opinions are divided on this, from the opinion of the Czech Office of Nuclear Safety, which shows that scanning equipment emits radiation which is harmful to human health, to that of the French Central Civil Aviation Directorate, which considers the equipment completely safe. Further tests are essential to show which types of scanner are safe for health and any possible side effects of their use. The research should be coordinated by the European Commission with the full cooperation of Member States. The scanners used must have a safety certificate allowing their use in all Member States. In this way, we will avoid duplication of research costs by individual Member States, and we will be sure that citizens’ health is protected equally in each Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Alongside the current forms of security, full body scanners have been brought into use. Most airline passengers are decidedly against this, seeing in this form of search a violation of fundamental human rights, including the right to intimacy and protection of personal dignity. In addition, and this is very significant, this reluctance is deepened by a lack of knowledge about what effect the scanners have on the health of those scanned.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no clear regulations on the storage and protection of data collected by scanning. It is also being argued that the scanners are nowhere near as highly effective as is claimed by their producers. One would hope that their effectiveness does not turn out to be similar to that of the vaccines against swine influenza, which, in the final analysis, were effective only in increasing the incomes of pharmaceutical concerns. Taking into account all these justified doubts, I think the European Commission should specify principles for protecting the rights of passengers which, at the same time, ensure their safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title30"></a><a name="creitem30"></a>

<p class="contents">Allow me to thank you for this very timely invitation to address you on Ukraine, which is a key partner for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware, a second round of presidential elections took place on Sunday in Ukraine. This was an important event, not just for the country itself, but for the wider region as a whole. It is important because a democratic Ukraine will serve as an important example to its neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the positive assessment made by the OSCE/ODIHR-led International Election Observation Mission that the elections were conducted in accordance with international standards and that there has been further progress in Ukraine’s already good electoral track-record since 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The statement issued by the High Representative on Monday expressed this sentiment. It also congratulated the people of Ukraine for their continued commitment to the democratic process. The high turnout on both election days was particularly encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that Ukraine’s democracy is continuing its process of consolidation. The population of the country goes to the polls, makes its choice freely, and expects to be heard. This is a significant achievement. Most importantly, it demonstrates Ukraine’s attachment to European values.</p>
<p class="contents">Elections have winners and losers. It is the electorate who decides. As we meet here today in Strasbourg, official election results have not yet been certified by the Central Election Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Preliminary election results show a very small gap between the two contestants. We have already heard about possible challenges to the results in the courts. Some local court cases have already been initiated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is logical and legitimate that any possible problems are investigated. At the same time, it is of utmost importance that the electoral process as a whole continues in a smooth manner, demonstrating both the resilience and depth of Ukraine’s democratic maturity and the candidates’ own shared commitment to the country’s development.</p>
<p class="contents">Every election is a demonstration of popular will. It is also an opportunity for a new start. It is now vital for Ukraine to move forward. The success of the electoral process in Ukraine – given Ukraine’s geographical and strategic importance – matters to the EU, and to Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past years, we have seen political instability, characterised by competition between the President and Prime Minister, exacerbated by a lack of clarity in the Constitution. Ukraine has consistently held good elections, and has a vibrant civil society and free media. Regrettably, however, the overall reform process – which is vital for Ukraine – has significantly slowed. Much more should have been done in the past years.</p>
<p class="contents">Pre-election politics also got in the way of the implementation of the IMF standby arrangement, with Ukraine failing to meet required conditions. The weakness of Ukraine’s constitutional framework has also contributed to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that I speak for all of us in saying that we look to the new leadership in Ukraine to give new impetus to its reform efforts. As a first priority, in order to address the effects of the global financial crisis and ensure future economic stability, Ukraine needs to get back on track with the IMF programme, without delay. This is also a precondition for the disbursement of possible EU macrofinancial assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">In the weeks and months to come, we will see a new administration being formed in Kiev. The EU’s message to Ukraine’s leadership is consistent and clear: now is the time to act. We expect to see concrete steps forward. Reform is essential for Ukraine’s own long-term prosperity and security. It is in Ukraine’s own interest – not just to please the international community. This message was also already conveyed at the EU-Ukraine Summit of 4 December 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">Action is needed at many levels. On the economic front, Ukraine needs to take urgent action to tackle corruption and to improve the business and investment climate. This includes efforts to strengthen the independence of the judiciary, to open up the economy and to ensure fair and transparent competition – for example, by the adoption of a public procurement law in line with international standards and the European Union <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, essential sectoral reforms in areas such as energy – in particular the gas sector – transport and the environment need to be undertaken and implemented. We have also consistently encouraged Ukraine to revisit constitutional reform, to bring stability and put in place functioning ground rules for political life. A constitution needs to stand the test of time, and its reform should not be tied to short-term political considerations. It is up to Ukraine to choose the model it wants to adopt. However, it should ensure that an effective system of checks and balances is in place which avoids the political paralysis that Ukraine has experienced in the past. The help and advice of the Venice Commission will be important in ensuring that this is done in a manner corresponding to European standards, availing of the best experience available.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above the first reform priorities, Ukraine needs to continue the extensive task of ensuring regulatory approximation with European Union standards. This is a prerequisite to ensure that Ukraine can enjoy the full benefits of the new and ambitious EU-Ukraine association agreement which we are currently negotiating with Ukraine – including a deep and comprehensive free trade area,</p>
<p class="contents">It is our task to encourage Ukraine on the way forward and to support Kiev’s own leadership in a process of far-reaching reforms and modernisation. We have many tools to do so. Through the European neighbourhood policy, we have the means to support Ukraine’s own reform efforts. Already today, ongoing and planned technical and financial cooperation with Ukraine is in the region of EUR 435 million, without counting possible macrofinancial assistance. The Eastern Partnership has brought additional tools. The comprehensive institution-building programme envisaged by the Eastern Partnership is a case in point, as it specifically targets institutions within the Ukrainian Government which need strengthening in order to deliver on reform.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, in negotiations with Ukraine on a new ambitious EU-Ukraine association agreement, we have set out our goals clearly: political association and economic integration between the European Union and Ukraine. This is a very significant undertaking, including the establishment of a deep and comprehensive free trade area involving extensive regulatory approximation to the European Union <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">But our offer to Ukraine is not a one-way street. The pace at which Ukraine and the EU come closer together in the future depends on the quality and depth of Ukraine’s own reform efforts. We look forward to working with Ukraine’s new leadership to achieve our common goals.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been in contact today through our cabinets with the High Representative and my colleague in the Commission, and let me summarise the three following messages: firstly, we both agreed that these elections testified the vibrancy of democracy in Ukraine; secondly, we are committed to deepening the relationship with Ukraine and supporting it in implementing its reform agenda; and, thirdly, we look forward to starting a constructive cooperation with the President-elect as soon as official results are announced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am one of the people who was in the tent city during the Orange Revolution in Kiev and when I look at what has been done over the past five years, I want to say to President Yushchenko that he has not brought stability to his country, he has not created parliamentary opportunities and he has brought the legislative process to a halt. He is certainly responsible for the failure of the Orange Revolution. I hope that these elections will bring new stability to Ukraine. However, despite the elections apparently being conducted in accordance with international standards, I am concerned that this is not a stable, self-confident democracy. When the legislation is amended three days before the second ballot, right in the middle of the elections, for whatever purpose, this does not demonstrate that the process has been understood. Instead, it causes us to watch Ukraine with great concern. I believe that we must become closely involved in the issue of the development of democracy and the rule of law in Ukraine, together with the related subject of stability, which is not a contradiction, but a consequence of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Füle, you have a specific responsibility relating to neighbourhood policy. However, neighbourhood policy does not simply mean going on as before. Instead, it means using the tools available to us not only for a bilateral relationship with a country like Ukraine or with other countries in the region, but instead in a multilateral approach to these countries, so that they come closer together and become more stable. We must give them perspectives. This does not involve referring every day to the enlargement of the European Union, but instead making visa facilities available to them now, considering the possibility of a free trade zone and perhaps even offering them the prospect of the same status as Norway within a European economic area. This will not harm anyone, does not represent aggressive behaviour towards anyone and, at the same time, will lead to the introduction of the European perspective and of stability in countries of this kind. I hope that the new government will prove itself worthy of taking part in this type of project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now to the matter in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">We must say that the international observers gave a very positive assessment of the elections in Ukraine, regardless of the fact that the legislation surrounding the actual elections stood on shaky ground. It can be said that the fact that changes were made at the last minute did not directly affect the result of these elections. In fact, we can say that democracy in Ukraine was the main winner because, when the current president stands again as a candidate and only receives 5% of the votes, this seems to me to be a very clear sign that democracy is working.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the rules of democracy is that you accept the result of the elections as it is. Also, you acknowledge your rival’s victory when the assessment of the actual elections is positive. This is why our message to the losing candidate must be very clear: Ukraine needs political stability and must be given the opportunity finally to initiate long-delayed reforms. Apart from these messages, we must clearly state in this House that we will help Ukraine to start moving forward again through our policy, the Neighbourhood Policy, and the Eastern Partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent presidential elections can be seen as another step in the consolidation of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a saying that a revolution devours its own children. This is true, but Ukraine remains a state even after these elections. It still has its multi-party system, and this is mainly thanks to the Orange Revolution. Likewise, the existence of freedom of speech and a free press can be attributed to the events of five years ago, when the route towards freedom and respect for human rights was taken. And all of this is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, we have to recognise the development of Ukraine towards democracy and the rule of law, towards improving economic integration and promoting relations with the European Union. I believe that, despite the official results of the elections, Ukraine will continue on the same course – it will continue to support integration with the European Union, to make the state government more effective, to make the political system more balanced – and to continue with constitutional reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine’s internal political stability and concentration on internal reform are a precondition for the further continuation of relations between the European Union and Ukraine. It is a crucial precondition for bilateral and multilateral cooperation that Ukraine’s Government continues to implement its objectives. We have to continue talks on the association agreement between Ukraine and the European Union. In recent times, the tempo has been slowing, and we must speed it up again.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to put a more concrete content into energy and environmental cooperation. Joining the World Trade Organisation is a significant achievement, which is also an important precondition for creating a proper free trade area for us and Ukraine. We also have to mention shortcomings, however: corruption has already been mentioned, and there are entrenched special interest groups and nepotistic practices. We hope that Ukraine turns round these shortcomings ...</p>

It is true that it was a very sad result for the hero of 2004, Victor Yushchenko, to be beaten in the first ballot. In my view, Mr Yushchenko is the only person to pick up the tab for the failings of all the leaders of the Ukrainian parties or blocks.</p>
<p class="contents">One important issue that we need to deal with is the fact that the people of Ukraine do not really trust any of the heads of the Ukrainian parties to lead their country on behalf of and for the benefit of all its citizens. If there is one result that has come out of the presence of the election observers, alongside the fact that the elections were conducted properly, which goes without saying, it is the discovery during the course of many discussions that most people voted for the lesser evil. None of the citizens whom I met had great expectations of this election. That is alarming in the case of such a young democracy, which has moved further away from the former Soviet system than any other country in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Füle, I hope that your presence today and the absence of Baroness Ashton does not mean that Ukraine is once again taking second place and will disappear among all the other foreign and security policy priorities. It must be one of the major priorities, because this has not been the case during the last five years.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal failings in Ukraine are mirrored by failings in the European strategy. We must not take this lightly any longer. We must give our unconditional support to Ukraine’s focus on the West, because we have a lot to lose. Gas is one subject which always causes a great deal of consternation. I only need to mention Sevastopol, where we are facing a major conflict. We cannot simply let things go on as they have before. You have taken on a significant responsibility in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the intrigues and scheming which went on in 2004, we cannot blame her, except for the fact that this time, international election observers have confirmed the results. She can stand up for her supposed rights. However, this is not a clever move in political terms, because a dispute of this kind will result in the political and economic uncertainty in the country continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">The close election result reflects the fact that the country is split into two camps. However, realistically, it will not be possible for Mr Yanukovich to reinstate the authoritarian regime that was overthrown years ago, even if he wanted to, despite the fact that the oligarchic structure in the political and economic system has undoubtedly been reinforced by the presidential elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the close result, both camps will have to make compromises. It is important that the cultural and social East-West split within the country is overcome for the sake of the people. A lot will depend on whether Mr Yanukovich appoints a prime minister whom both the Eastern and Western Ukrainians can live with and whether Mrs Tymoshenko has the democratic maturity to acknowledge her defeat and join the opposition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, several weeks ago, including in Mrs Ashton’s speech, questions were asked about whether the Ukrainians were ready for the Orange Revolution, and if they had put it all into practice? I share Mrs Harms’ regret, here, that Mrs Ashton is not with us today. There is an answer to this question: a 70% turnout at an election is, truly, a rarity in Europe, and it is a real rarity in our countries, too. In this sense, Mr Brok is not right when he says the Orange Revolution lost. It won, because it was all about having rules from which everyone could benefit. In Poland, too, we know about situations in which the beneficiary of democratic rules was someone who had formerly been opposed to democracy. However, this is good – this is how it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the time has come for our answer: have we done everything we should have done following the Orange Revolution? Have we answered that question? Apart from all the instruments which the Commissioner has spoken about – and it is good that we have created these instruments – have we answered that the door is open for Ukraine? Can far-reaching reforms be carried out in a post-communist country without that promise? Can we encourage people to make sacrifices if we tell them they will always be kept waiting outside? Should we not, rather, tell them: there is room for you in Europe, not today, not tomorrow, but there is room.</p>
<p class="contents">To say that is a great opportunity for the new Commissioner, Mr Füle. Mrs Ashton has not come, today. Commissioner, be bold and be the first person who starts to say that there is room. Not today, not tomorrow, but there will be room. This will be of great help to the Ukrainians. This may be the last moment when this can be said, and this is why all Ukrainians must be certain that integration, cooperation with Europe and changes to the law are their own personal opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">This must not just be said to the elite, to businesspeople or to students. It must be said in such a way that everyone will understand that it is still worth making sacrifices after the years of communism, that it is still worth doing something. It is an opportunity for you, too, Mr Füle. Say this clearly, and you will go down in history. You will help not only Ukraine, but all of Central Europe, because prosperity and security for Ukraine mean an opportunity for the whole of Central Europe. Everyone must feel that they have an opportunity. This is why, apart from the association agreement, which is very important, we need to relax the visa requirement for Ukrainians and, in the future, lift it. We need to say very clearly: the door to Europe is open for Ukraine. Someone must, at last, after these five years, say it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not solely the fault of their political elite. It is true that they were too consumed with conflicts of power and influence. Many reforms were never implemented, and many never left the drawing board.</p>
<p class="contents">In a democracy, it is inconceivable for electoral law to be changed between the two rounds of an election. This does no credit to those who proposed them, those who voted for them or those who made them. It suggests that there are unworthy and undesirable intentions behind it. A lot needs to change with the judicial authorities’ lack of independence, as they are subject to too much influence, not only from political powers but also from economic actors. Without a free and independent justice system there can be no law, human rights are not guaranteed, and there is no foreign investment or progress.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the blame for this disillusionment can also be laid at the door of this House, and many Member States in particular. I wish that for a few seconds, we could put ourselves in the shoes of a citizen of a European country which, due to the vicissitudes of history, is still not a member of the European Union.

<p class="contents">This election was closely fought, but it was a democratic one and, for us, that is the news of the day. Basically, the close contest has exposed how complicated this country is. Ukraine is a multi-ethnic and a multi-confessional country and one with a very chequered history, which is something we have to take into account. I think that we, both the European Parliament and Europe as a whole, should use all means to encourage some sort of productive dialogue within Ukraine, a dialogue that would strengthen the Ukrainian state and society from within.</p>

<p class="contents">However, I was, of course, disappointed by the result, because President Yanukovich is no Western-style democrat. He will now formally drop all NATO aspirations and pay only lip-service to EU membership for his country which, of course, is now also formally opposed by Russia, his close friend and neighbour. He will content himself, instead, with an FTA and a visa liberalisation regime. Mrs Tymoshenko is clutching at straws, in my view, by challenging the result of her narrow defeat in the courts and I doubt very much this will succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">The one real concern I have now is what I heard being discussed on the night: renewed splittist tendencies to break off the Ukrainian west – opposed to Yanukovich and supporters of Tymoshenko – to either join Poland or form a new western state. It probably will not happen but, if it does, it must be peaceful and by consensus. What we must do here in the European Union is to support the legacy of the Orange Revolution and our common shared democratic values with Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My contribution today will refer to an aspect which is not mentioned very much, but which is of particular concern to me when we are talking about Ukraine. More than half a million ethnic Romanians live in this country. The authorities in Kiev have hitherto shown them little interest in terms of guaranteeing basic rights. However, we saw for the first time that during the election campaign in this country neighbouring Romania, a new concept of governance was promoted. One of the candidates guaranteed Romanians in this country that he would support the introduction of Romanian as a regional language in areas where Romanians are in the majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine is currently faced with two value systems. Some citizens would like to move closer to the European Union and want our values, such as freedom and peace, to be guaranteed. Another group of citizens look at European integration with distrust. Ukraine needs support and solidarity from the EU to continue the reforms already under way in order to eliminate this division between East and West. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the most important areas of cooperation will be the issue of energy supply. This is no accident, as the European Union, with its increasing dependency, has a notable portion of energy imports coming via its easterly neighbour. For the security of energy imports, I think it is justified that the European Union should assist Ukraine by every possible means in maintaining and modernising its energy network, especially the vital gas pipeline network. At the same time, in agreement with the conclusions of the June EU summit, I think that there is a fundamental pre-requisite for financial support: Ukraine should start its reform of the industry and make its gas industry more transparent. The lack of transparency in the system of intermediary companies has resulted in disadvantages for the citizens of Ukraine, while also hindering the security of supply for EU Member States. Furthermore, efforts aimed at expanding storage capacity are also worth supporting. In fact, establishing reserves is one of the main ways to guarantee the smooth transit of gas in Europe during the cold winter period.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is expected to adopt the new gas supply regulation for the EU in spring. This regulation will require Member States to approve coordinated action plans in the event of gas supply disruptions. I think that Member States will need to coordinate such action plans not only among themselves, but also by involving Ukraine in the consultation process. Even in future, resolving the issue of disruptions to imports is not something that is conceivable without intensive talks with leaders in Kiev. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a member of the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee and a European citizen, I believe that the European Union can and should tip the balance in favour of a European and democratic path for its eastern neighbour. The European Parliament Election Observation Mission welcomed that the ballot passed off lawfully without incident, thereby guaranteeing the legitimacy of the new president and marking a particular contrast to the elections which took place in 2004-2005. The change of political hue must not affect our approach to Ukraine, which must remain just as consistent and even more effective. Although it is well known that President Yanukovich is not going to weaken ties with Russia, this does not mean that he is going to move away from the EU. In order to precisely avoid the risk of this happening, however small, we must be proactive in handling relations with Ukraine, which is the only country able to guarantee stability in the area. We must show openness through dialogue and firm commitments so as to give Ukraine the necessary encouragement towards a pro-European development.

Although the Orange Revolution to which the European Parliament so effectively contributed has disappointed most expectations, it is to be hoped that the legacy of Mr Yushchenko’s Presidency – free and fair elections, people who have overcome fear when voicing their opinions and a basically independent media – will endure. It is true that a big country like Ukraine that has been deprived of independence for a long time and has suffered a real genocide – the Holodomor – will need some time to better define its European identity and future strategic goals. But we cannot look away from the responsibility of European Union policies toward Ukraine since 2004. The EU has not been eager to offer Ukraine the prospect of EU membership. The EU’s support of Ukraine has proved to be mostly ambiguous and not convincing to the Ukrainians as it has often been dominated by a fear of irritating Russia. We need to realise that the main key to a genuinely democratic and good neighbourly Russia is an independent and Europe-integrated Ukraine. This will remain the EU’s responsibility.

Although Ukraine is in a very serious situation, changes for the better can be seen in terms of respect for the law in the period since the previous elections. I hope the legal dispute over the election results will be resolved quickly and that both sides will concentrate on work to help Ukraine come out of the economic crisis and strengthen its position in the world and, in particular, to help Ukraine develop closer relations with the European Union. In view of the newly-elected President’s promises to increase democratisation and ensure international stability, as well as the fact that he places great emphasis on Ukraine’s accession to the European Union, I am convinced that the current good cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union should not only be continued, but extended. Representatives of all EU countries hope that Ukraine will, finally, enter a period of political stability and consensus on economic policy.</p>

Ukraine needs to implement honestly and effectively a political programme guaranteeing rights to national minorities such as Russians, Tatars, Romanians, Poles, Hungarians, Greeks and others. It has to implement the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which guarantees these languages the status of regional languages. I believe that the EU must support the implementation of such measures, stressing that not a single minority should be overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, there is a Romanian-speaking minority in Ukraine numbering more than 410 000. It is a traditional national community with deep historical roots, which lives in harmony with the majority and other minorities, especially in the Chernivtsi Region (Northern Bukovina, Northern Bessarabia and the Hertsa Region), the Odessa Region (districts in Southern Bessarabia) and in the Transcarpathian Region (historical Maramureş Region). I think that the EU must encourage the Ukraine authorities to develop sections offering teaching in Romanian as a mother tongue in the vocational colleges and secondary schools currently operating in the towns in the regions mentioned above. In addition, the EU should cooperate with Kiev so that the Chernivtsi State University establishes sections offering teaching in Romanian as a mother tongue in all the current departments and specialties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The results of the presidential elections in regions with a higher proportion of Hungarian residents and the narrow margin of the final results indicate that the votes of the Hungarian community contributed to the victory of Mr Yanukovich to a great extent. In the heat of the campaign, Yulia Tymoshenko also promised to cancel the discriminatory measures affecting mother-tongue education. However, this did not sound credible coming from a politician who has been prime minister for 5 years and during that time showed no interest in the problems of the minorities. So the Hungarian and Ruthenian minority now put their hopes in Mr Yanukovich, expecting him to recognise the regional status of minorities and to create new grounds for relations between the majority and the minorities. However, if the new Ukrainian president fails to fulfil his promises, for example, in return for support from Ukrainian nationalists, he would not only lose the support of minority communities, but the establishment of the much-heralded European Ukraine may also be delayed for years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ukraine is a major partner in the Eastern Neighbourhood Policy of the European Union and it is also the most important transit state for relations cultivated with Russia. With Viktor Yanukovich elected as president, Ukraine has a strong, easy-going leader who is open towards both Europe and Russia alike. The most important task for the new president will be to overcome the deep political divide so that a stable administration can be established and the long-overdue, comprehensive social and economic reforms can be implemented. The most important thing for the European Union now is to make its presence felt more strongly than before in Ukraine, and to establish new grounds for cooperation. The Eastern Partnership provides an excellent framework for this, and the External Action Service created pursuant to the Treaty of Lisbon will provide appropriate means. I would like to emphasise that Hungary, with Ukraine being its largest neighbour, is particularly interested in political and economic stability being established in Ukraine. It is also in our interest that relations between Ukraine and Russia are consolidated. We also very much hope that Ukraine will give up its anti-minority policies, which have encroached upon the rights of minorities in the Lower Carpathians region, including those of Hungarians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title31"></a><a name="creitem31"></a>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question 1 by Zigmantas Balcytis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-7-2010-0008_EN.html">H-0008/10</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Creating an internal energy market</span></p>
<p class="contents">Creating a single internal energy market is referred to as a political priority in the agreement and long-term strategy of the troika of Spain, Belgium and Hungary. In order to attain this objective, the most isolated regions of the Community, such as the Baltic Sea region, need to be better integrated into the European energy market. The Baltic Sea Strategy contains many electricity and gas interconnection projects, which, if implemented, will allow Baltic countries to break free from their energy dependency on a single supplier. In view of their cross-border nature, implementing these projects successfully will depend not only on providing funding but also on the political will and intentions of the Member States involved. In creating an internal energy market, the Community has undertaken to speak with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">Will Spain, which holds the Presidency of the Council, take a lead role in encouraging Member States to speak with one voice in the implementation of energy projects in the Baltic Sea region, such as AmberLitPol, Swedlink and others, that would bring about an increase in energy security not only at a regional level but throughout the Community? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have gradually realised this in the European Union and energy security has therefore become one of the Union’s strategic priorities. Indeed, this became a critical issue just over a year ago, with the gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">We realised at that point that an internal energy market, a fully-functioning, interconnected, effective market, is a precondition for security of energy supply to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Security of supply is thus a key strategic element that has to be improved by ensuring greater energy efficiency, by diversification of energy suppliers, sources and distribution channels, by promoting the Union’s energy interests in relation to third countries and, finally, by creating a genuine common energy market, which we still do not have. To help us achieve this, we will have the support of the Lisbon Treaty, in which, for the first time, there is an explicit reference to that competence for the Union at primary legislation level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union therefore needs to be more assertive in its relations with third countries, and it must speak with a single voice in those relations. The Spanish Minister of Industry, Tourism and Trade made this very clear when presenting the Spanish Presidency’s priorities to the relevant committee of the European Parliament on 27 January 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, within the framework of the Second Strategic Energy Review, what can be called connecting the energy islands in the European Union to the internal market has become one of the Union’s key objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 2009, when the Commission presented the Action Plan on Baltic Energy Market Interconnection, an initiative that aims to promote the integration of the energy market and the development of energy infrastructure in the Baltic region, the European Council welcomed it as a major contribution to enhancing the energy security of the Union, and I am reading this word for word.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baltic energy market initiative now falls under the wider umbrella of the Union’s Baltic Sea Strategy, which was one of the Swedish Presidency’s main priorities. The October 2009 European Council adopted the initiative and welcomed the progress made on energy infrastructures and interconnections in the Baltic region, thereby endorsing the information in the Commission’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is certainly not a position that you could call pro-European and, in fact, that has not been the case in practice. I seem to remember that during the debate on the Regulation on measures to guarantee the security of energy supply, a European commitment on this issue was agreed. I am referring specifically to the energy projects approved as part of the programme to aid economic recovery implemented during the Czech Presidency last year. A total of EUR 425 million was allocated to three interconnection projects in the Baltic region: the Skanled/Baltic gas pipeline, the Estlink-2 electricity interconnection and the Sweden-Baltic States interconnection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Presidency will therefore urge the Member States to support the energy infrastructure projects in the Baltic region, although it will then be up to the Member States themselves to implement the specific projects in accordance with national legislation and applicable European legislation. The Member States concerned should also act as one on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also believe it is one of the main objectives of the European Union’s strategy for the fight against climate change, which we argued for at the Copenhagen Summit. We hope that by 2020 renewable energies will make up 20% of the overall European energy mix, and we would like that approach to be included in the second Energy Action Plan for 2010-2014, which we hope to see adopted under the Spanish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">That objective of the action plan is therefore clearly on the Spanish Presidency’s agenda, and is shared, of course, by the Belgian and Hungarian Trio, because it is a strategic objective.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to what Mr Obermayr has said, we also believe that diversifying resources is, without doubt, another strategic objective, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and its institutions are being very proactive, giving all their political support to projects such as Nabucco, Nord Stream and South Stream. All those projects have a very clear objective: to diversify energies, to diversify suppliers of energy, and to diversify the different channels by which energy is distributed. They are, of course, part of our strategy to become a Europe with a truly common energy market, which it currently does not have. All of this is necessary in order to establish that market and to achieve that energy security, which forms the basis for it all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The economic crisis, climate change and demographic changes are having a drastic impact on the lives of European citizens. Health, education, agriculture, the development of transport and energy infrastructure and investment in research and innovation and in the modernising of public services must be priorities, both for the Member States and for the EU. There is a joint obligation to guarantee the fundamental rights and freedoms of European citizens, including the free movement of workers. The European social model ensures the necessary support for employees who have lost their jobs, for the elderly and for the young, as well as for migrant workers. The EU’s 2020 sustainable development strategy is to be presented at the informal European Council meeting in February 2010.</p>

<p class="contents">The aim is to propose and approve a programme promoting growth and the creation of quality employment, replacing the Lisbon Strategy and focusing, on the one hand, on strengthening certain indispensable aspects which are necessary for the competitiveness and productivity of the future European economy: investing in information technologies, making Europe a space for the information society, and highlighting social aspects as well, meaning that employment should be based on specialisation and training; we are also, of course, driving for a green, low carbon economy as referred to in the content we have already discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Another fundamental element – one that will no doubt polarise tomorrow's debates in Brussels – is the issue of governance. At the informal European Council meeting, the President of the European Council is going to present an initial proposal for a debate on governance, in other words, moving towards economic union within Europe, not only monetary union, and making it essential – as stated in the Treaty of Lisbon – that our economic policies, our employment policies and our social policies converge within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This element of the strategy for sustainable development and the creation of quality employment is therefore a central objective of the Spanish Presidency and the whole of Europe. The proof of this can be seen in the fact that we have begun to tackle the matter already, at the highest level, by holding the informal Council meeting tomorrow in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You mentioned the case of Spain which indeed has suffered greatly in the property sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we need to aim towards a production model which in itself creates stronger, more solid, more stable jobs based on specialisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, we must work towards measures along these lines, measures which increase specialisation and staff training in order to place workers in knowledge-based society, information technology and specialised society jobs, upon which the production and development model for future employment should be based.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the idea which we believe each country should put into practice; however, we must coordinate this among all European countries. Furthermore, the European Union must provide support, for example, through incentives or stimuli such as the use of specific Structural Funds, for instance, the European Social Fund, thus stimulating those countries which indeed invest in this production model so as to create quality employment.</p>
<p class="contents">That, I think is the guideline which should be at the centre, at the very heart of our strategy which, between us all, must be implemented within the next few months, before the European Council in June to replace the inadequate Lisbon Strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore a structured Dialogue which gives us the opportunity to exchange viewpoints regarding matters which are of concern to us.</p>
<p class="contents">In November last year, the Council adopted conclusions about religious freedom which allowed us to once again reiterate the European Union’s position on this subject, in clear terms. Respect for religious freedom, as defined in the international instruments on human rights, forms part of the human rights clause which is included in agreements between the European Union and third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last five years, the European Union has periodically brought up freedom of religion and beliefs in its dialogues on human rights and in its consultations with third countries. It has made a number of statements regarding this and negotiations have taken place in relation to people threatened for their beliefs. The European Union has played a very active part, on a global scale, in promoting religious freedom in international fora, such as the United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards China, the Council determined a certain number of reference criteria for the human rights dialogue in 2001. I can assure you, Mr Posselt, that religious freedom forms an integral part of those criteria. We recently discussed this issue several times with our Chinese counterparts, we have met with the competent authorities in Beijing and, with the purpose of the dialogue in mind, those responsible for religious matters have visited Europe in order to increase their awareness of practices in a number of Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Baroness Ashton said in the European Parliament a short while ago: the human rights dialogue does undeniably have an effect and, of course, there are various places we can conduct it. We can conduct it with specific people, for example, in the case of the well-known human rights activist, Liu Xiaobo, or we can also conduct it on other levels, on a political level in political dialogue. In any case, we will continue to conduct it with determination so as to protect all human rights, each and every one. We must not support some more than others, as human rights are indivisible and we will strive to strengthen and improve the situation concerning human rights in China.</p>

<p class="contents">Recent press reports have revealed the existence of a secret prison in Lithuania, located in a former riding school and used by the CIA since 2004, where a number of ‘terrorism suspects’ have been tortured.</p>
<p class="contents">An Italian court has found more than 20 US agents and two Italian officials guilty of the kidnapping in Milan of Abu Omar, who was subsequently tortured in Egypt. A number of other trials are under way, notably in Poland and the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">There is evidence that other governments and, in particular, Portugal, were (in the context of a secret NATO agreement) aware of the use of their airspace and airports for maintaining the detention, kidnapping and torture network masterminded by the US.</p>

<p class="contents">The so-called secret detention and transportation programme by the United States or the alleged CIA use of European countries to transport and illegally detain prisoners has been, without a doubt, a source of concern for many Members of this House. It was the subject of a very recent debate, just a few days ago, and, as the Presidency has already said, the Council clearly shares Parliament’s view, there is no two ways about it; that the possible existence of these secret detention centres does not comply with international law. This continues to be our opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we felt it was so appropriate for President Obama to change US policy in relation to certain detentions and to the existence of prisons such as Guantánamo. What is more, we believe that, in reality, this change has occurred and a turnaround has occurred in US policy. We have always taken the opportunity to express our concerns to the United States from a European Union standpoint regarding these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be pleased that this change has taken place and because this joint declaration was made official between the European Union and the United States on 15 June last year. We therefore believe that we will remain along the lines of this policy and we will always be very clear as long as we are aware and have irrefutable proof of the existence of these cases.</p>
<p class="contents">In certain cases, we have not had this evidence, although it has been talked about, or there have been specific references made in the media; however, on some occasions, there has been a lack of proven and thorough knowledge of the existence of these cases.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is no doubt that the European Union has been very clear on this matter and has always been against these detention centres, whether they be known detention centres such as Guantánamo, or allegedly secret ones, and we have always been very open in the European Union to finding out the facts as to whether the latter really exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, however, even after that statement in July, there were new discoveries. It is known that last November, the Italian court itself convicted 23 US agents and two Italian officials of the kidnapping of Abu Omar in Milan, and one of the convicted CIA agents admitted to the press that he broke the law and that the decisions had been made in Washington. The Obama Administration merely declared that it was disappointed with the decision by the Italian court.</p>
<p class="contents">Other cases, also relating to CIA flights, are under way, such as in Poland and the United Kingdom. The Lithuanian Parliament has confirmed that there was also a clandestine jail in Lithuania, and that many flights by the CIA covered up their activities and, of course, led to people being illegally imprisoned.

It is also true that the European Union must respect the competence of Member States and so specific areas must be investigated by Member States; they cannot be investigated by the European Union. The Treaty of Lisbon, for example, makes it very clear that the supervision of intelligence services in Member States’ territory is a Member State’s competence.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to something also mentioned in the question, we are certainly not aware of an alleged secret NATO agreement. In any case, the possible existence of this agreement, of which we are completely unaware, would by no means prevent Member States from having to carry out their obligations in accordance with international law and humanitarian law. However, Mrs Figueiredo, we certainly believe the European Union is clearly one of the areas in the world where human rights are respected and the European Union is obliged, while respecting how each country chooses to govern itself, and will obviously always be obliged, to denounce human rights infringements, as we have a responsibility to humanity and not only to each of the competent States. We will continue to act and develop along these lines.

I believe that the defence of human rights is one of the crucial objectives that any democratic State and any democratic organisation such as the European Union must pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the European Parliament has a culture of defending human rights, of which we are proud and also of the European integration, in this sense, as the construction of Europe is based on human rights. The nature of Europe and what unites Europeans who speak different languages and have different traditions is precisely the fact that we share these values of defending human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I believe that the role of the press is an absolutely vital one. The press is a key feature at the centre of democracy and is undoubtedly a necessary and indispensable instrument for the defence of human rights and for denouncing cases of human rights infringements when they occur.</p>
<p class="contents">When these infringements take place but are not known about other than on a personal level, it is simply impossible for us to pursue them.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the press plays a fundamentally vital role and I also believe that the most genuine and authentic culture of journalism must be extremely sensitive to the defence of human rights and the defence of all freedoms. That is what truly ensures that life is worth living and it is what ultimately gives meaning to the coexistence of human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The pursuit of those who infringe human rights and the defence of victims is, without a doubt, one of the axes of the European integration, of the European Union, and I feel very proud to belong to an area in which those values are cherished and where instruments of legal, supranational, judicial independence have been established, such as the European Court of Human Rights which is located in this city, Strasbourg. I feel very proud that Europe preserves precisely these objectives and truths in its tradition, in its culture and in its history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The effects of the crisis on world trade indicate a possible 10% decline in 2009. This represents the biggest such contraction since the Second World War brought on by the collapse in global demand. Keeping international trade flowing is vital for the EU and other exports-oriented countries. Despite commitments made by the G20, trade restrictive and distortive measures in response to the crisis have increased within the G20, as well as globally.</p>
<p class="contents">The first sub-question is: what steps have been taken by the Commission to tackle such measures and, conversely, have any steps been taken by third countries against any other EU measures to boost economic growth?</p>
<p class="contents">The second sub-question: there are indicators that some of the emerging countries that have been less affected by the crisis are becoming drivers of growth in international trade. In this case, EU industry needs to retarget its export markets and possibly the future of its products. What strategy does the Commission intend to pursue to enable EU industry to become more competitive?</p>
<p class="contents">Third sub-question: the global crisis and subsequent fall in world trade are having multiple effects on developing countries where the most unemployment is concentrated. What adjustment measures does the Commission plan to take in its trade relations in particular for the poorest countries in the world?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth point: while, on the one hand, large trade deficits are driven by excessive spending and indebtedness in some Member States, including the United States of America, on the other hand, large export-driven economies in certain emerging countries are experiencing trade surpluses. These trade deficits have contributed to global imbalances that are at the root of the global economic crisis. What strategy does the Commission intend to pursue to mitigate such global imbalances in its trade policy?</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth and last point: the social impact of the economic crisis and the subsequent fall in world trade are set to outlast economic recovery. For example, we are seeing signs of economic recovery now, but levels of unemployment remain very high. When does the Commission plan to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of the crisis on jobs in Europe and in the developing countries? What strategy does it intend to pursue to incorporate the social and environmental dimension of trade into international WTO rules?</p>
<p class="contents">These are the five points that the Committee on International Trade would like to address to the new Trade Commissioner Mr De Gucht, whom I welcome to the floor for the first public exchange of views with Parliament and the members of the INTA Committee, in particular. Thank you in advance for the answers that I am sure you will be able to give to the questions that we are putting to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, quite a lot of broad questions have been asked which would, in fact, deserve much more time than I have.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest focusing in my initial reply on the contribution of trade policy to economic recovery. First, as regards the impact of the crisis on trade, we should be relieved that world trade only decreased by 10%. This did not happen by chance, but is a result of strong political will expressed at various G20 summits. It is also the result of systematic monitoring of trade restrictive measures by the WTO, the OECD and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">By and large, only a few countries resorted to trade protectionism. The international community thus avoided a protectionist downward spiral of the kind witnessed at the time of the Great Depression. In order to maintain this, it is important to remain extremely vigilant. Where protectionist or trade-restrictive measures are identified, we will take action against them with all available trade tools, such as our market-access strategy or even the WTO dispute-settlement mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">External sources of growth will be crucial to EU economic recovery. I therefore concur with you that European industry should target the new and fast-growing emerging markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Through our trade policy, we can help them to achieve this by further opening up these markets and reducing all sorts of barriers to trade and investment.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be achieved through the free trade agreements that we are currently negotiating and by deepening trade and economic partnerships with key trading partners such as, for example, the US and China, where the TEC and the high-level dialogue have already laid solid foundations. This will be a priority for me as Trade Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the coming weeks, the Commission will put together the EU’s new common agenda for sustainable growth and recovery via the EU 2020 strategy. This strategy will have an effective external dimension in which trade policy plays a key role.</p>
<p class="contents">In a globalised world, the EU 2020 strategy should be a vector to promote openness and constructive international economic engagement. This will also be a central theme of a communication on future trade-policy priorities that I intend to present later this year.</p>
<p class="contents">But trade policy is about more than just competitiveness and growth. It is also about projecting our values worldwide and it must also duly integrate the development dimension of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting a strong contribution to development goals is already an important part of the EU’s trade policy. The current multilateral negotiations are a development round. We have bilateral and regional negotiations with developing countries and autonomous preferences in favour of these countries. We help them to contribute to, and also tap into, the global economy so as to raise living standards in a way that delivers both greater political stability and social progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards social issues, I agree that trade must contribute to helping those people in our societies who suffered most from the economic crisis, especially those who lost their jobs. In this respect, I believe that we will need trade – and more trade – to preserve our social system of protection in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our European model of society, the combination of a free economy with a high degree of social protection, must be preserved in a sustainable way, and this will take growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In sum, the Commission’s forthcoming EU 2020 strategy will support a full recovery from the crisis while speeding up the move towards a smarter and greener economy. Open trade policy will be an important element, both as a contribution to European economic recovery and as a vector for the external projection of our principles: openness, social and environmental protection and sustainability, and constructive engagement on the world scene.</p>
<p class="contents">Putting the right strategy in place will naturally involve working closely with Parliament as well as the Council and other stakeholders, and I look forward to your cooperation in building a shared agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a pleasure to see you here. We have high expectations and hopes of you. You have an important task ahead of you.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago, I was extremely concerned. When trade crashed and we were expecting world trade to develop in ways not seen since the Second World War, the situation was very serious indeed. The World Bank stated that 17 of the G20 countries had, in total, introduced 47 new trade barriers and tariffs. Russia imposed tariffs on cars, China restricted food imports, India banned imports of toys and Argentina introduced import licences for textiles and leather goods. It was almost like a protectionist arms race – a pattern from the 1930s that was worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">However, no trade war came about. I think it is important to stop and reflect on why that was. I think the main reason was the WTO, the global regulatory authority for trade, which forces countries to behave and not to resort to protectionism and populism. I would say that it is too early to declare the crisis over. The crisis has not passed. We all know that unemployment is highest late in the economic cycle – and it is unemployment that drives protectionism and populism. If we look around us right now, we can see that a number of countries have not yet come through the crisis; perhaps they even have the worst yet to come. I am therefore somewhat concerned when I listen to some members of the Council of Ministers, who do not say much about new markets and free trade but rather criticise globalisation and talk of protecting European companies and European jobs. That is not necessarily protectionism, but at times, they are only a hair’s breadth away. It is, in any event, an expression of a mercantilism that I believe to be damaging.</p>
<p class="contents">We should instead work together and think about how we can make Europe more competitive by making it more open. That would amount to considered action and leadership on our part. We need to think about what we can do to make sure that there are fewer barriers to trade, not more – especially when it comes to making decisions on Korea and mandatory origin labelling and when there are increasing demands for climate levies. We in Parliament need to reflect on that too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even before beginning to deal with the effects of the economic crisis on world trade, which forms the topic of our debate, I wish to clarify one point: trade is not a victim of the crisis; it is also one of its contributing factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we are currently experiencing a period of huge global imbalances, fuelled, on the one hand, by certain countries’ excessive trade deficits at the cost of growing domestic indebtedness and, on the other, by trade surpluses stimulated by the exports of certain, especially emerging, countries with internal consumption that is not growing at the same rate.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the trade liberalisation policy conducted thus far has only exacerbated these imbalances, weakening, in particular, the poorest countries on the planet. These countries, which have been encouraged to specialise in export monocultures, have therefore found themselves destitute in the face of extreme fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, the volatility of which has increased as a result of international speculation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a strange world that sets as its first Millennium Development Goal the eradication of poverty and hunger but then, at the same time, speculates on the rise in wheat prices.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the very people who defended liberalisation and deregulation at any cost in the 1990s are now finding themselves in a difficult situation as well. The continual rise in job losses, stagnant, sometimes even negative, growth, and the developing social crisis are all factors that mean we can no longer afford to let jobs disappear in the name of this cult. In a period of crisis, how do we explain to employees who are losing their jobs that the main thing is to maintain deregulated trade, even at the cost of sudden and sometimes tragic relocations?</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis we are going through is therefore definitely a systemic crisis, to which we must respond with a new development model. In its current Global Europe strategy, the vision developed by the Commission is essentially based on access to the market and the liberalisation of all sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe we need to redefine this strategy, which has been on the wrong track and sometimes led to setbacks. It is not by forcing developing countries to open up even more that we will revive our industries’ exports. That would only aggravate the situation in those countries, which already accommodate 70% of the 59 million people in the world who lost their jobs in 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, it is essential to consider a new strategy that strikes the right balance between openness, protection and support. I would like to return to these ideas. We cannot ignore these developments, which lead the United States to make further use of its trade defence tool or China to take issue with the WTO over European anti-dumping measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, when we are faced with unfair practices, it is clear that protection is necessary, but the principle of it must be accepted and defended internationally and the sometimes false accusations of protectionism dismissed once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the need for support for trade policies is becoming more obvious every day, and such support depends, in particular, on the policies implemented by the Union being genuinely consistent. Consistency in policies is not an intellectual debate, but an absolute necessity if we want to redefine a new development model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, in countries like Bulgaria, exports for the first 11 months of last year fell by a whole 24% compared to the previous year, and imports by 35%. Property and tourism are sectors which have been particularly affected by this. This has an extremely powerful effect on employment. Consideration must be given to the sharp rise in business-to-business indebtedness, non-payment of national and local public contract organisations, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems presented above are typical of other countries as well. A comprehensive solution is needed for them at EU level, which requires close cooperation between the European Commission’s various directorates too. Commissioner De Gucht emphasises the importance of support for expanding European companies’ area of activity and opportunities, deploying clear preventive commercial instruments, successfully concluding the Doha negotiations, using new facilities for direct foreign investments and their protection, as well as for a new investment policy against the backdrop of a financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The achievement of these aims, along with the successful signing of the economic cooperation agreements with countries from Africa, the Caribbean Basin and Pacific Ocean region, is also closely linked to the recovery from the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a number of issues remain on the agenda, some of which have already been mentioned. Are we making effective use of European funding to combat the high level of unemployment? What can the European Union do faced with the current deficit, devaluation of the currency and high inflation, which are having a direct impact on trade? What commercial policy instruments does the European Union have available to tackle the financial crisis and its repercussions? What measures must be taken to avoid the recurrence of a crisis of such magnitude and for trade to continue expanding? What strategy do we have against countries like India and China, which are threatening to change the entire financial system? I am counting exclusively on this Europe 2020 strategy to find these answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that, in the context of a debate, it is wise of you to point out that a world war linked to the revival of protectionism is not about to break out.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I almost want to reverse the issue. For me, the issue is not ultimately about what effects the economic crisis has on trade, but more fundamentally about what effects trade, and specifically the trade policies undertaken for 20 years, have on the crisis we are experiencing today.</p>
<p class="contents">In a way, the food crisis that we experienced two and a half years ago arrived before the financial crisis, and it was indeed a crisis of the world agricultural markets. In the same way, we keep being told that liberalising trade with China is good for us. I believe that, at some point, unless we incorporate social issues, monetary issues, fiscal issues and, of course, environmental issues, China will have not just a comparative advantage over Europe, it will have an absolute advantage over it.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that, in all the national debates – and, as a key figure on the Belgian scene, you will know this – all the political parties are now discovering that it is impossible, in a globalised world, to manage social dumping, environmental dumping, monetary dumping and fiscal dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we might consider that the strategy that all us Europeans expected after the fall of the Berlin Wall, which was to say ‘social democracy will come about through trade’, is not working, as we can see with the example of China.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have cited the Lisbon Strategy, innovation, the green economy, and you know that this European strategy is now a failure. Indeed, if we do not mainstream the Lisbon Strategy before the Global Europe strategy, we may wonder what industrial sectors Europe will still have. Where is the definition of the industrial choices, the agricultural choices, the economic choices and, of course, the social and environmental choices that we are making throughout Europe, so that we can learn how trade works with the rest of the world? Until we define these choices, we shall be pursuing a strategy of failure.</p>

This, of course, is intended to produce a better standard of living. This is all very well, as long as most countries achieve a positive trade balance and a growth in GDP. The problems begin when the economy slows down, market indices fall sharply and problems start with unemployment. The opening of borders, apart from bringing a better standard of living, has caused a mutual dependence of different economies on one another. This is the other side of the coin. This can be seen clearly in the current situation. For example, the slowing down of the German economy is having a negative effect on the Polish economy, and this is because Germany is one of Poland’s key export partners. Fortunately, Poland’s GDP is showing positive growth, which is an exception in Europe, but it is worrying that the unemployment rate has been rising for several months. This example shows very clearly that governments should not only think about how to solve economic problems exclusively in their own countries, but they should also come to an agreement about how, together, they can develop defensive mechanisms so that in future, they will be protected from similar situations.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the present crisis will be a test for all of us. I am thinking principally, here, about countries belonging to the European Union. We cannot allow a situation in which some countries try to conceal their use of State interventionism, while, in the name of free competition, others are prevented from giving State aid. Of course, I do realise that particular governments may be, in a certain sense, hostages of their electorate, but if we are going to build a European Community for the good of everyone, we must make clear rules and we must keep them. We must also use our strengths – advanced technologies and human capital. Only in this way will further strengthening of cooperation between our countries be effective, and we, as citizens of the European Union, will be able to think of the future in better terms and hope that our (...).</p>

As then, it is the working class and the poor who are paying dearly for, and suffering the consequences of, this, whether in Europe or in the poorest countries on earth.</p>
<p class="contents">World Bank researchers predict that, in 2010 alone, 64 million more people will be plunged into extreme poverty by the crisis and that because of it, in 2009, between 30 000 and 50 000 children have already died in Africa of malnutrition. This crisis is having devastating consequences on world trade, but the demand of the United Nations financial summit last year, for example, that the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations is the answer, is utterly wrong. According to the respected NGO War on Want, that would threaten a further 7.5 million workers with losing their jobs, including in the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis of world capitalism is enormously exacerbated by the activities of the financial speculators on the world markets. Not content with having precipitated the crisis, these parasites now want to exploit it to rake in further billions. Did the EU Commission see the headline in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> yesterday: ‘Traders in record bet against the euro’? But what does the Commission do? It falls on its knees in front of the speculators and demands that the countries worst hit by the crisis, like Greece, make savage cuts in workers’ wages, pensions and public services.</p>
<p class="contents">What do you think such a draconian programme of cuts is going to do for trade, either in Europe or in the world? If you cut the ability of the working class to purchase goods and services, then you cut demand for those goods and services, which means you cut millions more jobs of workers who would provide them. That, concretely, is the prescription of the Commission. Therefore, the tens of thousands of Greek workers who marched yesterday were absolutely right. Capitalism can only bring more suffering and crisis. We need to replace it with a system of human solidarity, based on the values of democratic socialism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am going to focus on the third question, which is: what strategy does the Commission intend to pursue to enable EU industry to become more competitive?</p>
<p class="contents">Well, before there was the Lisbon Treaty, there was the Lisbon Strategy, and in the Lisbon Strategy, the EU intended, and I quote, ‘to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world’. Now, one prerequisite for a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy is to have a flexible work force. So what has the EU done to bring this about?</p>
<p class="contents">Well they have brought in the Agency Workers’ Directive in 2008 and this has been like pouring glue into the most flexible part of the labour market. The Agency Workers’ Directive is yet another ill-thought-out and inappropriate EU directive which has yet again disproportionately and adversely affected the UK, which has a third of all EU agency workers. And, incidentally, it is by having a flexible workforce that you raise people out of poverty.</p>

The document rightly states that the growth of the trade deficit of the European Union and the United States has contributed to the international economic crisis to a large extent. The trade deficit of the European Union grew from EUR 75 billion in 2004 to EUR 243 billion in 2008. This is a three-fold increase in 4 years. This means that the consumption of each European citizen exceeded produced value by EUR 500. Such a large trade deficit and a consumption that exceeds production to such an extent are not sustainable. Measures are required to reduce the trade deficit, because if we do not do this intentionally, the laws of economy will spontaneously enforce such a change. However, this would incur a much higher social cost. The current events in Greece illustrate this.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards energy, world trade is not only distorted by protectionism, but also by energy price support mechanisms. The use of oil is subsidised in a number of developing countries, with oil being available at prices lower than on the international market, while budget resources are also used to support the use of electricity. At the same time, European producers need to pay taxes, carbon dioxide quotas, if they want to use energy in production. Copenhagen made it clear that developing countries wish to hinder a climate protection agreement as they are not willing to accept sanctions related to cuts. Measures are required to prevent this, as several economists have now pointed out that cheap carbon dioxide gives a more competitive edge to China than cheap labour. If we do not reduce energy consumption, there is a danger that again and again ...</p>

If you believe the Commission, trade dropped by 10% in 2009. If you believe the IMF, it dropped by 12.3% in 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">The ILO itself reckons that 212 million people worldwide were unemployed in 2009, a 34 million increase from 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Sub-Saharan Africa, which had a fiscal surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2008, had a deficit of 6.4% in 2009. In other words a surplus of three billion turned into a deficit of 64 billion, taking 67 billion out of Sub-Saharan Africa’s spending power.</p>
<p class="contents">All parts of the world have suffered because of this crisis, but the third world, the developing world, has suffered the most. And that is why today Oxfam have today launched a call for what they have called a ‘Robin Hood tax’.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a variation on the Tobin Tax, which was to tax speculative trade on financial products, stocks, bonds, commodities and currency transactions. The Robin Hood tax represents a tiny 0.05% of transactions, but would raise billions for development projects in the third world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Millennium Development Goals need between 34 billion and 45 billion to be met and the banks received a trillion-dollar bail-out. Banks should do more than simply pay back that cash: they should repair the damage they have done to wider society.</p>

The EU must shoulder a particular responsibility for maintaining free and fair trade. The financial crisis is creating a global economic recession that depressed trade by 10% in 2009, as has been stated, such that trade is now at the same level as in 2005. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable when their exports fall and they have problems obtaining bank financing. For the ACP countries, for example, trade in goods represents 50% of their trade. These countries are thus extremely sensitive to crises. A 1% drop in growth results in 20 million people falling into poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, the EU must shoulder its responsibility as a rich part of the world and ensure that the financial crisis does not force more people into poverty and exclusion. The EU must work to ensure that the poorest countries receive increased levels of effective aid and debt relief where appropriate. In this context, my friends, I believe that a number of the countries that you come from could do more to ensure that the aid provided by your home countries is increased, improved and made more efficient. We should not always call on the EU; there are some things we can do on the home front.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important priority for the Union is that the Doha Round is concluded and that the EU’s agricultural policy is quite simply scrapped. It is unreasonable for the rich EU to force out poor farms in Africa through competition. A new free trade agreement would be the best way of taking the world out of financial crisis and preventing protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU can and must act as a beacon for the liberalisation of world trade. Globalisation and international trade are fundamentally positive. Protectionism is an evil and has always been an evil.

In recent years, under pressure from the World Trade Organisation, we have introduced many voluntary restrictions on the production and export of agricultural products in the European Union. We carried out, for example, a huge reform of the sugar market, which reduced European sugar production by one third and closed down many sugar refineries. Many farms stopped growing sugar beet, we increased unemployment and did not achieve any social or economic benefits. It was a present for the big sugar concerns, which moved their production out of Europe, and today we import sugar from them.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that during the crisis, we should give strong protection to our economy and our producers. I am not talking, here, about protectionism, but about a policy of equal opportunities which, at present, our producers do not have. A variety of high standards are in force in the European Union, for example, in agriculture there are standards for animal welfare. It is right to promote these standards, but we should also require that these same standards be met by those who export their products to the European Union. If, for example, we bring in a ban on battery hens, we should not at the same time import eggs from countries where this method is in use. We should act in a similar way on many other matters. We should observe a simple rule – the same requirements for exporters as for our own producers, because without this, apart from the economic crisis (...).</p>

At the same time, national governments are strongly tempted to put up barriers to protect their domestic production capacities.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2009, we observed an alarming increase in the various forms of national protection used, both in individual European Union Member States and in the new developing economies. This protectionism hampers access to international markets for small and medium-sized enterprises, which form the backbone of the European economy, adding a further burden and restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to overcome these problems and encourage entrepreneurship and trade, I think that Europe needs, above all, a strong internal market. This can be achieved if the European economy is sufficiently competitive, innovative and based on high standards of quality. As also noted by the European Commission, in spite of the progress made, we must continue the efforts to increase the capacity of the educational systems as a contribution to an innovative, dynamic knowledge society.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, stable public finances in the European Union, which will guarantee the sustainability of the national economies and the European currency, are an important prerequisite for overcoming the trade imbalances. The euro’s stability is of paramount importance to the trust of our trade partners. A further boost to reviving trade and investment is also provided by the timely implementation of the necessary structural reforms aimed at laying new stable foundations for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least in terms of importance, I believe that the internal market would also be strengthened by the prudent and prompt expansion of the euro area, which will result in the economic integration of European states and make the European economy even more influential in relation to its international partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In any case, it seems that we have managed to avoid the serious temptation of protectionism which occurred during the crisis of the 1930s, and it seems that the trend for the emergence of new restrictive measures disappeared at the end of last year. This is demonstrated in the Fifth report on potentially trade restrictive measures adopted by the Commission at the end of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, many countries have adopted these restrictive measures, countries with different economic bases such as the United States, China, Argentina, Russia and Indonesia, but also many developing countries. And it is these countries, the developing countries, which need open markets that can receive their products.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I call on Mr De Gucht, in his capacity as Development Commissioner, to work towards broader and freer trade in the world, towards the European Union taking the lead in reducing protectionist barriers in developed countries and to work towards a greater commitment to taking development into consideration in trade negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Studies have shown that the lack of financing for trade by the banks is due in large part to the slowdown in commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask two questions: firstly, what has become of international commitments on the multilateral financing of trade? And secondly, what results has the more flexible financing framework to facilitate access by undertakings to financing at European level had?</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to global trade, I should like to point out that the rules, disciplines and commitments of the World Trade Organisation have, to a large degree, prevented the use of restrictive trade measures, at the same time providing the flexibility to adopt policies aimed at economic recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we call on the Commission to closely monitor the measures adopted by our trading partners and their impact on European exports, including the ‘buy national’ policies applied by important EU trading partners. At the same time, we must not overlook the dynamic increase in exports by certain emerging economies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present case, I should like to underline in particular the issue of the competitiveness of European products on global markets, which existed before and exist independently of the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what we need, among other things, is to achieve reciprocity with our trading partners in terms of market access, restore terms of fair competition on the international markets and ensure that imported products are subject to the same rules as goods produced within the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, protectionism further hurts international trade and the EU’s interests directly.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the international trade actors which have enacted additional and counterproductive trade barriers is Russia. Since the beginning of the financial crisis, Russia has imposed a number of so-called ‘temporary’ anti-crisis tariffs on a number of imports, such as meat and milk products, furniture, and also some steel products. Another instance which may be recalled is the temporary tariff on drugs that Russia has imposed on EU exporters.</p>
<p class="contents">What is even more alarming is that, on 1 January 2010, a customs union came into existence between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. As a consequence, a total of 30% of the EU’s product lines have seen increased tariffs. The main problem is, of course, that Russia, like Belarus and Kazakhstan, is not a member of the WTO, and is therefore not bound by the WTO rules restricting the unilateral increase of import tariffs and other trade-restrictive measures. Since Russia is not a member of the WTO, we do not have a dispute settlement mechanism with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have two questions for you. How does the Commission assess the current EU trade problems with Russia, and do we have a particular strategy on how to address the issue of Russia’s membership of the WTO? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also very grateful that the European Union has played a highly effective role in this respect and has introduced hardly any protectionist measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, there is a saying that attack is the best form of defence. I would like to pick up on what Mrs Andrikienė has just said about the specific measures that Russia has taken. We need to ask what effective options we have open to us that will allow us to go on the offensive against those trading partners who have not kept to the agreements made in the G20, who have introduced protectionist measures, who have closed the markets and who have helped to bring about an even greater fall in worldwide economic performance than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we not make more proactive use of our Global Europe strategy and forcefully implement the points it contains? Is it not now the right time to address our interests proactively instead of simply preventing protectionism? I have in mind a possible new initiative which will allow us to make progress within the WTO at last. I think we should take the logical step of negotiating free trade agreements quickly. We have one result in South Korea. However, what has happened with regard to India, Canada, Colombia and Peru? Would we not be sending out a very positive signal if we could make progress on these free trade agreements now?</p>
<p class="contents">Many other Members have referred to the developing countries. Is this not the ideal opportunity to bring about some progress at last in the Economic Partnership Agreements so that the developing countries and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) could be better integrated into world trade and so that effective measures could be taken to bring about economic growth and combat poverty? Over recent decades, it has become clear that the states which have taken part in world trade have had the highest levels of growth.

When, for example, there are completely different growth rates between the Union and China, the non-tariff obstacles applied against us, which we considered to be of lesser importance when the Chinese economy was smaller, are having worse and worse results for us as China’s relative importance increases and ours decreases.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, as our relative size decreases, our negotiating power decreases as well. There is therefore a window of opportunity through which the Union can impose its policy and effectively reduce obstacles to our exports in rapidly emerging economies and limit social and environmental dumping. Time is working against us, even more than before as a result of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment is that, as the correlations change, the importance of trans-Atlantic trade relations and of promoting a more functional American market which will increase trans-Atlantic trade and give the parties on either side of the Atlantic greater negotiating power increases.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, too, there is a window of opportunity, as it will take time to build up the trans-Atlantic market, because it is a complex process. How does the US rate the importance of these relations? Unfortunately, the fact that President Obama will not be attending the forthcoming summit in Madrid is not an encouraging sign.</p>

Our economies are disoriented, and we are still struggling today to get back on an even keel in the face of determined emerging powers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now time, European Commissioner, for you to captain an ambitious and meaningful European trade policy that is unapologetically aimed at defending our commercial interests and based on mutual openness of the markets and on the exploitation of our competitive advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must first of all find a happy medium between ultra-free trade and protectionism. To my mind, this third way must be embodied by the creation of a fair trade framework. The European Union is armed with certain values: respect for the protection of intellectual property, fairness in terms of investments, access to markets, the fight against non-tariff trade barriers and respect for social and environmental standards. Consequently, it has a duty to ensure that these values are accepted as principles by India and China, emerging countries which are not only our customers and competitors, but also our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the need to establish balanced trade, you must, Commissioner, help to boost the competitiveness of our European companies. How can this be achieved? Innovation, investment in research and development, and the international influence of competitive clusters seem to be some of the key factors that will get us out of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to focus our actions on innovative companies, especially SMEs, by relieving them of any excessive administrative and fiscal burdens, and on green technologies and services.</p>

I would like to propose looking at the differences between these two guiding principles in three areas. What does global world trade mean in its current form and volume in terms of creating and preserving jobs in Europe, especially when we think about small traders, SMEs, family businesses and small farms in European countries, which are adrift and have lost opportunities to progress because of the current global, liberalised world trade?

It is estimated that world trade turnover fell last year by around 10% as a result of the crisis. In addition, the policy of protectionism adopted by many countries as a basic tool for fighting the recession is having a disadvantageous effect on trade. The advantages of free trade in a global economy ought not to need explaining to anyone. It is safe to say that the prosperity which free-market countries achieved in the second half of the 20th century was, in large measure, the fruit of free trade, which developed dynamically in this period. The fall in world trade, the rise in unemployment, especially in developing countries and, with this, the growth of poverty and social exclusion – this adverse trend can be stopped by restoring dynamic trade on fair and just (...).</p>

We are pleased to see such an astute and successful politician and a well-known Liberal on the Commission. You will need all your powers of persuasion to bring a new impetus to international trade policy in the EU. We must fight against any protectionist tendencies. History clearly shows that countries which have taken part in world trade have enjoyed better growth than those which did not.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also facing a new world order. Some of the players involved, for example, China, have State capitalist systems, but may be using quite different methods in this arena. Therefore, I call on the Commission to develop a new strategy for world trade. It is clear that we must move forward with the Doha development round, because a multilateral approach is the right one. However, we will need all our efforts to make progress in relation to China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have only two or three minutes if I understand rightly.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, let me start with a general remark. I really do not believe that protectionism is a solution. Whether you are a believer or not, looking back into history, it is thanks to international trade that our countries have become prosperous.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Europe has a transformative economy, which means that we have to import to be able to export. The idea that we could export without importing is completely false and contradictory to the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">So I staunchly believe that we should have free trade agreements with major economic partners, that we should make a success of the Doha Round and that we should further liberalise international trade, but that does not mean that we should not take into account the fact that this international trade also has to be fair and that we are entitled to protect our interests. The Commission is certainly going to do so when necessary and we will use the TDI mechanisms we have to have an impact on what we consider to be unfair distortions of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Some very specific questions have also been asked, by Mr Jadot, for example, on the meeting on 4 February at the WTO and what the result of this was. Well, the main message at that meeting was that the rules of the General Agreement on Trade in Services are not an obstacle to the right of countries to ensure effective financial regulation. The reason is that GATS has a very broad scope for financial prudential measures, so this financial regulation, be it at national or European level, is certainly not contradictory to the GATS rules.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the origins of the crisis we are going through. Hopefully, the major part is behind us. I am firmly convinced that it has had a major impact on trade, but that the origin of this crisis lies with financial imbalances which resulted from completely wrong choices by financial institutions. The financial crisis did not originate in Europe; it came to Europe and to the rest of the world from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I can agree that the food crisis of a couple of years ago, which was still not completely resolved and digested, let us say, has added to big imbalances, especially for the developing countries. You can say a lot about developing countries, about good governance and so on, but you certainly cannot lay the blame on the developing countries for being at the origin of the financial crisis. That is obvious, and they are very severely hit by that crisis, so we should take that into due consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">There have also been some questions, the last time by Mr Caspary and one by Mr Jadot too, asking what are we going to do with the TEC and with the strategic initiative for China?</p>
<p class="contents">My personal opinion is that the only good response to the economic development of China – which we are not going to stop, by the way – the only good response is to become stronger ourselves. I think that is the only good response.</p>
<p class="contents">When you look at this in terms of trade deficit, it is true that the trade deficit with China has gone up considerably, but when you look at the global trade deficit with Asia, this did not go up that much. Also, within Asia, the other Asian countries are facing very fierce competition from China.</p>
<p class="contents">So what we should do is become stronger ourselves. I believe that achieving this transatlantic marketplace, for example, is one of the best answers we can give.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a recent report, produced at the request of Parliament, which shows that, if you were able to reduce by 50% the non-tariff barriers between Europe and the United States, this would have an effect which would be much larger than the Doha Round. We should work on that, but, having said this, it is not easy at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking of the Doha Round, I staunchly believe that we should try to close that round because it has a lot of important features, among them, that the existing tariffs cannot go up any more, that we would be able to close them down. Secondly, there is a strong developmental approach in the Doha Round, provided, of course, that we can keep it as it stands now, and that should be the goal of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also the question by David Martin on the Robin Hood tax. First of all, I must say that I like the name Robin Hood much better than Tobin. But apart from that, I fear the Robin Hood tax is facing the same problems as the Tobin tax, that you can only do it if it happens on a global scale. You should also bear in mind that doing this, even on a global scale, would imply a very costly implementing mechanism to put it into place. President Barroso said about the Tobin tax that we are ready to support it as long as everybody else does, and that, of course, is the sticking point in all this.</p>
<p class="contents">A last word on – Mr Higgins, amongst others, asked a question – speculation and what came about from that, and also with respect to Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a debate on Greece so I am not going to go into the details of it, but I think, sincerely speaking, that some fault also lies with Greece itself. What you cannot have in a global economy, and what you cannot have in the European Union either, is moral hazard. Being a Member State of the European Union also implies some obligations. So Member States who get into a difficult position – and certainly we are ready to support them and help them whenever possible – should also realise that they have to obey the rules and if they obey the rules, then probably they will not get into the difficult situation they are in now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, these countries have also been hit hard by the credit crunch. Boosting exports would be extremely important to ensure that these countries are able to recover from the difficulties arising from this double pressure and the resultant social problems, such as growing unemployment. Financing for exporters seems to be a major obstacle in this area, as payment periods have become longer, credit has become more expensive and more difficult to access, while credit insurance conditions have also deteriorated. This is why programmes should be developed targeting the countries in question, especially EU Member States, to assist them in overcoming these difficulties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that jobs have been and are being created in countries with low wages has resulted in average wages falling in Central and Western Europe, which, in its turn, has caused a fall in consumption levels. The consequence of this is that European companies are no longer making the majority of their profits from producing goods, which is their core business. They are attempting to improve their results by means of financial transactions and speculation. This is the point at which we must start. We need to impose a quota on how much ordinary share capital companies can invest in stocks and shares and also on how much of their reserves they can deposit in financial packages in third countries. Secondly, we need regulations for the companies that have suffered damage as a result of the crisis. Thirdly, the economy requires not only fresh capital for the banks, which were one of the main causes of the crisis, but also and, more importantly, new regulations for money transfers, strict guidelines on the sale of credit packages and an independent supervisory body for the new and flourishing trading business, which includes areas such as short selling, that should be banned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It goes without saying that both Member States of the European Union and countries which do not belong to the Community are taking measures to increase competitiveness and overcome the effects of the crisis. Research carried out by the Centre of Economic Policy Research has shown that since the first meeting of the Group of Twenty devoted to the crisis, 425 legislative initiatives have been undertaken to combat the effects of the crisis. Some countries have resorted to protectionist practices, while others are trying to liberalise trade. In view of the fact that the economy is a system of connected vessels, is the European Commission monitoring legislative initiatives being undertaken both within the European Union and around the world? Does the European Commission, when taking anti-crisis measures, take these into account? As protectionist and liberalising measures accumulate, a situation will arise in which they are mutually exclusive and will have no effect on world trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title34"></a><a name="creitem34"></a>

That is a very good thing. However, if we look at the details of the agreement, it seems as if speed took precedence over thoroughness. I have the impression that your predecessor wanted the agreement to be signed and sealed at any price, so that she had at least one success during her period of office.</p>
<p class="contents">We are familiar with the many expert reports which were drawn up before the start of negotiations and which clearly indicated the many possible benefits for European industry and the European economy. There is likely to be a positive impact on the mechanical engineering, chemical, pharmaceutical, food and service industries. All of these sectors and many others hope to gain major benefits from the agreement. However, the main protests are coming from the car industry. There are difficulties with the duty drawback system, with the question of the amount of parts from foreign suppliers that can be used in cars from South Korea and with the issue of environmental standards which remain unresolved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see us not only addressing but resolving many of these criticisms over the next few months using the safeguard mechanisms and the safeguard regulation. The Members of this House can only vote in favour of this free trade agreement if we have dealt with the justified concerns of the car industry and can also incorporate genuinely effective solutions into these safeguard mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The text of the safeguard mechanisms was published on the Internet today, but unfortunately, I have not yet had a chance to read it. I would like to offer you the opportunity on behalf of my group to work with us in partnership to develop a suitable regulation at a European level, in order to ensure that the interests of the car industry are addressed in this free trade agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This must change our approach, cultural and otherwise, towards free trade and the tangible manifestations of the relationship between the European Union and its major competitors. This relationship is currently mediated by certain magic terms that have not yet entered into the vocabulary of the European Commission. These terms are reciprocity, European interest, the fight against dumping and the fight against tariff barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the background to the free trade agreement with Korea, which incidentally confused two Commissioners – the Commissioner for Internal Market and Services and the Commissioner for Employment – and some governments.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the real advantages of this bilateral agreement, when 50% of the trade between the European Union and Korea concerns the automotive sector, when the disparity between the 700 000 Korean cars exported to us as opposed to the 27 000 European cars imported by Korea is glaringly evident? What is the sense in providing indirect aid of approximately EUR 1 600 for each Korean car sold in Europe when some European governments find it difficult to provide incentives for buying and selling cars to stimulate consumption? How can we also fail to take into account the serious doubts over the textile and electronics industries?</p>
<p class="contents">We will not settle with hearing for the umpteenth time, Commissioner, as Mrs Ashton said before you, that there are advantages for our chemical, pharmaceutical or agrifood industries because these pale scandalously into insignificance compared to the consequences for textiles, electronics and, above all, for cars, or financial services. Could it be that Europe, even with the crisis we are in today, is yet again choosing the financial option for its development?</p>
<p class="contents">We all welcomed the birth of the new Europe in Lisbon with hope. Europe cannot however, fail to take responsibility for European interests in the world, particularly today. The United States is jumping through hoops to defend Boeing against Airbus and the Argentinean Government is threatening to expropriate Telecom.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement with Korea actually legitimises pass-through financing with China which, until now, was illegal. This is the scenario in which our major businesses are forced to operate. Behind them are hundreds of thousands of workers, of families who can see their future going up in smoke, not because they are producing poor quality services or goods but because poorly defined interests are allowed to prevail over more evident and objective interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust in your sensitivity, Commissioner, in the hope that you will avoid over-hasty ratifications, which could go hand in hand with unacceptable decisions over the provisional application of the commercial side of the agreement pending ratification, or at least decisions that will be unacceptable until the regulation on the bilateral safeguard clause has been clearly defined. The adoption of this clause is subject to the ordinary legislative procedure that should be considered a first step to any appraisal of the advisability …</p>

The right of codecision of the European Parliament that has been directly elected by the citizens of Europe gives us the opportunity to bring democracy back into decisions on trade policy. This is the right thing to do, because it will have consequences for employees and consumers in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Free and fair trade forms the basis for Europe’s prosperity. We must therefore firmly oppose any protectionist tendencies. Free trade agreements like this one with South Korea can make an important contribution to stimulating world trade, growth and employment. However, it is in the nature of agreements of this kind, that, depending on their specific structure, they bring more benefits for some sectors of industry than for others. It is our job in Parliament to weigh up carefully the impact on different industries and sectors within the EU. In order to do this, we need the relevant data and impact assessments and it is the Commission’s task to provide them. However, despite many requests from the committee and in the plenary session, we have not yet received data which we believe to be satisfactory. This is the reason why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has joined with other groups to ask this question.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information that we have received so far, the agreement offers opportunities for the service, mechanical engineering and plant construction, chemical and agricultural industries in the European economy. However, the concern is that the agreement will have a negative impact on the car industry and the textile and electronics sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The free trade agreement with South Korea is the only agreement with a developed country which does not include a ban on duty drawbacks. This may lead to one-sided cost benefits for South Korean industry. As the Commission has assured us on several occasions, the provisions on the duty drawback include a safeguard clause, which allows for a waiver on the basis of certain criteria. However, we urgently need to clarify this in the interests of the companies involved. The system must be applicable in practice. It must not be the case that the safeguard clauses are worthless because the companies cannot provide the necessary proof. As the agreement seems to contain one-sided regulations and as it sets a precedent for future agreements, for example, with India or with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, we feel that the specific wording of the safeguard clauses, the procedure for settling disputes and the other regulations relating to the application of the agreement are of central importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore calling on the Commission to submit the free trade agreement together with the provisions on its application to Parliament for approval. We want a decision quickly. For this reason, a provisional version of the agreement must not be allowed to come into force. I know from discussions with companies what an important impact the implementation has. Therefore, my question to the Commission is as follows: Will the development of the European External Action Service lead to it playing a stronger role in trade policy? In our opinion, at least, this should be included. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you, Commissioner, for your points of view on the previous debate.</p>
<p class="contents">EU exporters of consumer goods, electronics, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and medical devices are just some of the sectors which will benefit immensely from the removal of non-tariff barriers. Simplification of certification procedures, transparency and price predictability are all things that will benefit the consumer. The Korean consumer market, in turn, wants access to speciality European agricultural products, such as wines, spirits, meats, cheeses, all protected by geographical indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it would be wrong to accept this free trade agreement – and we have heard many people speak on it – at face value, and there are areas which need further clarification by the Commission. The inclusion of duty drawback clauses has been a concern for many of us, as I mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Any free trade agreement must be based on the principle of reciprocity or mutual benefit, but the potential burden on European car manufacturers remains unclear and of great concern to us. The Commission has assured us that Korea is actively liberalising its import regime. The level of duties that Korea can refund under the duty drawback are gradually being reduced. The negotiators are convinced that the economic relevance of the duty drawback will therefore diminish over time. What evidence does the Commission have to support this argument? If the Commission finds itself resorting to repeated or continued use of this safeguard mechanism, will it consider reviewing negotiations to extend the transfer period?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I look forward to working closely with you in the new agreement that is coming up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their oral question, which confirms the interest of the European Parliament in the EU-South Korea free trade agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As this will be the first major trade agreement to which the European Parliament will be asked to give its formal consent under the Lisbon Treaty, I very much welcome this opportunity to reply to the many aspects of the free trade agreement raised in the oral question. I might not be able to give detailed replies to all aspects of the question, but I am happy to address them in a possible follow-up question.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU-South Korea agreement is not only the first FTA negotiated by the EU with a country in Asia; it is also the most ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreement ever negotiated by the European Union. After more than two years of negotiations, the free trade agreement was initialled on 15 October last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the negotiating process, the Commission remained in close contact with Parliament. In this respect, the Commission welcomes the resolution on Korea voted by Parliament in December 2007. Many of the issues raised in this resolution have been addressed in the free trade agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole process was also accompanied by a constant dialogue with civil society and a comprehensive trade sustainable impact assessment. The FTA is currently being translated. By the end of March, the Commission envisages presenting to the Council the decisions to authorise the signature of the FTA as well as to conclude the FTA. The objective is to sign the agreement in April.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently completing its analysis as to whether the agreement also falls within the competence of Member States. In this case, the FTA would require the ratification of all Member States before formally entering into force. As this process may take some time, it may be necessary for the Commission to propose that the agreement be provisionally applied pending its entry into force. The provisional application is decided by the Council on a proposal by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is sensitive to the desire of Parliament to be able to give its views on the FTA before it is provisionally applied. The Commission will continue to seek out the best means, together with the Council and Parliament, to ensure that this takes place in a manner that does not cause unnecessary delays. It is of great importance that we apply the agreement as soon as is feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the regulation on safeguards, the Commission intends to present its proposal for such a regulation to the Council and the European Parliament in the coming weeks, and hopes that it will be possible to adopt this legislation rapidly so as to ensure that its application takes place as close as possible to the application of the FTA.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic benefits of the FTA are mostly in the EU’s favour. It will relieve EU exporters of industrial and agricultural goods from Korean tariffs, saving them EUR 1.6 billion in duties annually, half of these directly from the day of the entry into force of the agreement. Obviously, potential gains from these duty savings will be even higher, as trade between the EU and Korea is expected to expand over time.</p>
<p class="contents">According to one study, the FTA will create substantial new trade in goods and services of 19.1 billion for the EU compared to 12.8 billion for Korea. Existing studies have not identified any sectors that would be negatively affected by the FTA, but in case of serious injury or threat thereof, the Commission would not hesitate to activate the safeguard procedures built into the agreement. Let me also remind you that, in the event of such a necessity, we have the possibility of employing the support measures under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to intellectual property rights, the FTA contains ambitious commitments going beyond WTO rules. Besides, the Commission has been careful to ensure that no element in the FTA contradicts the EU <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">On the implications of the protocol on cultural cooperation, the FTA would set a framework for engaging in policy dialogue on cooperating and facilitating exchanges regarding cultural activities. It is, above all, a demonstration of the EU’s commitment to actively promoting the 2005 UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expression.</p>
<p class="contents">On rules of origin, the negotiations with South Korea resulted in a number of changes which are consistent with the ongoing process of reform of such rules. These changes go in the direction of simplification, thus implementing a specific request by the European Parliament. At the same time, strict rules have been maintained for all sensitive sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has paid particular attention to creating a new market-access opportunity in Korea for European fruit and vegetables. In order to encourage Korea to open up its market, European Union entry prices have been eliminated except in the case of the three most sensitive products: tomatoes, oranges and Korean citrus.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the FTA also opens the EU market to Korean products. To protect our industry against import increases causing or threatening injury, the FTA contains an effective safeguard mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">This safeguard clause can be invoked from the entry into force of the FTA. The Commission will monitor the EU market and Korean imports to assess the need to invoke the safeguard clause, and remains committed to making use of it if conditions are met.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the special clause on duty drawback, which can be invoked based on publicly available trade statistics on imports into and exports from Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of certain concerns expressed, notably by the EU car industry, about the duty drawback provisions in the FTA, but I have to emphasise that duty drawback is currently allowed and used by Koreans as well as by EU exporters. Thus, maintaining it in the FTA does not accrue any new benefit. The current economic impact of duty drawback is very small, about one eighth of the value of the Korean duty concessions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of cars, available studies show that, on average, the foreign content of Korean cars is between 10% and 15%. If foreign sourcing were to increase significantly, the special clause on duty drawback would provide for an effective remedy.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot be ruled out that implementation of the FTA may give rise to different views and interpretation between the parties. To address such situations, the FTA contains an efficient and rapid dispute settlement mechanism. The Commission will monitor closely the implementation of commitments by Korea and will not hesitate to invoke dispute settlement procedures if warranted.</p>
<p class="contents">The FTA would also break new ground in promoting the protection of the environment and respect for labour rights, containing comprehensive commitments on a range of social and environmental standards. The scope of these commitments is broader than that of any comparable agreement. To ensure that these commitments are respected, the FTA establishes a strong framework for monitoring their implementation, involving civil society, business, trade unions and NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to inform you that Korea and the EU have been discussing possible adjustments to the tariff dismantlement schedule. These adjustments would imply, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, that products classified under three years and five years would be subject to four- and six-year tariff cuts respectively, so that duties would be eliminated one year later than originally scheduled.</p>
<p class="contents">While this implies a modest sacrifice in terms of our offensive interests, we thought that such an adjustment would be appropriate, taking into account the sensitivities of certain sectors. Korea has indicated its readiness to agree to those changes on the basis that the sensitivities of both sides are equally respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We find ourselves in economically tricky times, but we know that you are not afraid of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to this free trade agreement with South Korea, as you say, there are undoubtedly many positives for Europe in this agreement, but for our car-making industry, it is, and remains, a disastrous agreement. Mr Caspary also made this point. Just take a look at the figures, Commissioner. For every car that we export to South Korea from Europe, 15 come the other way. We currently have a ratio of 15:1, and that is primarily the result of non-tariff barriers to trade in South Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also no coincidence that a manufacturer such as General Motors should reverse its decision to build the new, small SUV in Europe, specifically in its Antwerp factory, and instead move the entire project to South Korea. This forthcoming free trade agreement with South Korea is the direct cause of this decision. I do not think, Commissioner, that we can accept that, and just sweep it under the carpet by arguing that many other sectors in Europe will benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we still have plenty of time to adapt this situation for our automotive sector, and you were quite right to refer to the safeguard clause. I accept that such safeguarding measures exist, but we are asking, first and foremost, for there to be a fundamental review of the impact of this agreement on the automotive sector. The numbers and the trends are much too alarming. The reality, in any case – and you know this better than I do – is that the US Government is currently negotiating with the South Koreans about making adaptations to a similar agreement that they have.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not forget, Mr De Gucht, that the car industry is still Europe’s most important industrial sector. We are talking about an awful lot of jobs, here, that are under severe pressure at the moment. In my opinion, we must not allow more jobs to be put on the line and we therefore urgently ask you to build additional guarantees into this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">David Martin, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. </span>– Mr President, I believe that this Korean free trade agreement is important for three reasons. Firstly, as you have indicated, it is a win-win deal for Korea and for the European Union economies. It is good for consumers, it is good for jobs and, as you rightly say, it has a potential to add 19 billion to our trade flows with Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly though, given the debate we have just had, in the context of the current global financial crisis, it sets a very positive example. If two large economies like the European Union and Korea can agree a free trade agreement, it sets an impetus for other partners. Japan, for example, is showing much more interest in economic relations with the European Union than it was just a few years ago and partly that is due to the Korean deal.</p>
<p class="contents">Suddenly, on the other side, the Koreans are finding the US is now coming back, knocking on their door, wanting to get the KORUS agreement moving again.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason – more parochially, but I hope colleagues in the House will bear this in mind – is that it is important for Parliament because many of the demands we made in my report have been met by the Commission, and time does not permit me to go through them all but I want to just give you three or four examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we said in my report that we needed much better access to the Korean agricultural market. Well, Korean agricultural tariffs are going to come down by 75% over the first seven years of this agreement; we wanted our geographical indicators protected, our Whisky, our Champagnes, our wines, our hams and so on are going to be protected in Korea as a result of this agreement. And they are not, as one of my colleagues indicated, insignificant. Scottish whisky sells GBP 137 million worth a year into the Korean market already so with this deal, we could see a significant increase.</p>
<p class="contents">We called for non-tariff barriers to be tackled and this will be of particular benefit to the automobile industry. We wanted improved trade in environmental goods. Well, under this deal, environmental trade in goods and services will, after three years, have virtually duty-free access to the Korean market and their environmental goods and services duty-free access to our market.</p>
<p class="contents">We asked as a Parliament for improved social and environmental standards. Well, Korea, since the negotiations have been initialled, has signed four ILO Conventions and their trade and sustainable development forum is going to be established as a result of this agreement allowing the civil partners in Korea to ensure that greater market opening is accompanied by labour and environmental standards improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these things, Parliament asked for. It would be ludicrous and perverse for us to turn our back on them, having achieved them.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this a perfect deal? Well, of course it is not. Are there things in it that I would not want in it, of course there are, but negotiations mean that you have to come and go, but on balance, is it a good deal for Europe? Yes. Is it a good deal for Korea? Yes. Is it a good deal, potentially, for the world economy? Yes. So we should not shilly-shally on this: we should get on and sign it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A free trade agreement is always good news, a cornerstone for stability and a cornerstone for the prosperity of the planet, all the more so when it represents the first successful bilateral trade policy for the European Union after years of disappointments. Perhaps, however, for this very reason, there has been a certain amount of haste in sealing the agreement. It is almost as though the Commission were tempted to close the deal at any cost.</p>
<p class="contents">For us in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, although the duty drawback is acceptable for the WTO, even though it is already practised, it is effectively an export subsidy and a slackening of the rule of origin is a step backwards as far as transparency is concerned. These two principles will soon constitute a precedent for our other trade partners. We know that the Commission has driven a hard bargain, but, in the words of the Korean proverb, ‘even the best make mistakes’.</p>
<p class="contents">We have often heard that the Commission is losing its ability to safeguard the legitimate interests of producers, workers and consumers and something certainly went wrong in its communication with both sides of industry in a negotiation that was sometimes criticised for its lack of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Every European citizen expects all of us, Commission and Parliament, to demonstrate political sensitivity. European industry is not doing well and it is pointless for some Member States to grant the automotive sector subsidies, which I am incidentally totally opposed to. On the other hand, with this agreement, we risk introducing subsidies for Korean exports.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that these agreements are complicated and that there are also many benefits to be welcomed: the end of Korean customs duties, the recognition of European certifications, new possibilities for European services, the protection of geographical indications. Partly for this reason, I have no wish to go down the same road as in the United States, where an agreement with Korea has been awaiting ratification for years and where some even want to re-open the automotive chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the Commission’s demand: the text of the agreement must form part of an overall package made up of three documents, in other words, the free trade agreement to be submitted for ratification, the implementing measures, particularly with regard to duty drawback, and the regulation on the safeguard clause. If possible, I would also add the option of access to the global adjustment fund for areas that may be affected by this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we wish to see all the documents together and we consider, above all, under the ordinary legislative procedure established by the Lisbon Treaty, that we should rule out any kind of interim agreement, which we would oppose because we want to work together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It breaks new ground, but not necessarily in the way in which we talk about it. Perhaps for the first time, in fact, we see in the outcome of the negotiations that there are losers, which one accepts, but within the context of trade negotiations with third parties. It is not within the context of the Lisbon Strategy, it is not within the context of an industrial policy that it was decided who, in Europe, would lose out in an open trade relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this agreement also breaks new ground because, in trade negotiations, it is usually the farming sectors that resist and the industrial sectors that are satisfied. In this case, we see that the opposite is true. For the first time, it is literally major industrial sectors that are complaining about the decisions made by Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this agreement also breaks new ground because you refer to a EUR 1.6 billion reduction in customs duties from which we will benefit on the Korean market. Just what do these figures mean, however? I am an elected representative for the west of France region, and more specifically for Brittany. If you have visited Brittany, Mr De Gucht, you will know that, these days, green algae and ground water pollution associated with the intensification of pig farming are a huge problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, we are told that we shall earn a small amount of money from pigs by trading with South Korea. The reality, in the region I represent, is that this intensification of pig farming leads to a loss of jobs, a loss of added value, a loss of tourism and, consequently, in my region, we are the losers in this agreement. Perhaps in your overall calculation, people gain from it, but in a region like mine, people lose.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, this agreement again breaks new ground because, for the first time, an environmental derogation will be called for. We are continually told that Europe is the indisputable and undisputed leader in the fight against global climate change. The reality is that we are reduced to negotiating derogations with South Korea on CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions from cars because the automobile lobby has been very powerful in Europe when it comes to pushing back the deadlines for the introduction of restrictions on CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions and because now, it is obliged to obtain derogations abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore clearly see once again that, when it comes to an industrial strategy, a strategy for our businesses and the choice of economy, it will be more the case that Europe suffers this agreement than that it shapes it. You have talked about the Lisbon Strategy, the green economy and innovation. I do not see in this agreement how this will be encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, your approach to discussing issues is often very balanced, but as soon as people start talking about taxes, all of a sudden … On the carbon border tax mentioned during your hearing and now on the Tobin tax, I bet you, Mr De Gucht, that before the end of your mandate, the Commission will have to speak out strongly on the Tobin tax because it is now an essential tool for regulating the financial markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can I take the opportunity to say that it is good that we are having this debate here tonight and getting some things out in the open.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the negotiations have been long and protracted, and I certainly welcome the Commissioner’s statement that he is hoping to bring this very shortly to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be enormous benefit to both Europe and Korea on the signing of this deal. I know there are concerns and I have listened to those concerns. We have heard them here tonight about the car industry. But, you know, I think if we are going to depend on the car industry – and we are going to totally defend it – then I think we are picking the wrong particular area in which to do this, and certainly General Motors would not be the most important in my area, as far as I would be concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I share these concerns and I share some of the real concerns held by many people, and I understand them. But I believe the opportunity outweighs that concern, and I think that, if we are always to be reticent, then I do not believe we will achieve anything.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must look to the opportunities and take them, and not the negatives. We cannot forget that this deal also has a political content, because to the north of South Korea there is a very aggressive enemy, and I think we send out a message as well as to whom we support.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must do all we can to break down the barriers that are in that particular region. The agreement will show our support for progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had the opportunity to go there and I know the people in that area are very much inclined to go forward and to be progressive. There is clear and visible support for each other between the north and the south when you visit an area like Kaesong This, I believe, is a tremendous opportunity for us to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I just simply ask the Commission: firstly, how would it comment on the provision of the dispute settlement mechanism and how will this operate in practice? Specifically, how quickly will we be able to utilise this mechanism in the case of serious market disruption? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking about the destruction of productive activity and jobs, a serious impact on the capacity to create and distribute wealth, an increasing dependence on foreign markets, chronic and growing imbalances in trade; in short, economic and social breakdown.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also talking about the attacks on workers’ rights, social dumping, the ruination of millions of small producers and many small and medium-sized enterprises. These are consequences of the gradual liberalisation of international trade which their advocates cannot ignore. I recall here the clothing and textile industry, which is particularly pertinent to this agreement, and a study by the Directorate-General for Employment and the Eurofund, which presents scenarios for a decrease of 20 to 25% of Community jobs by 2020, while acknowledging a scenario where 50% of jobs in this sector would be lost. I also recall, however, sectors such as electronics and the component manufacturing industry in the automotive sector, already mentioned here. These complaints give rise to questions that continue to go unanswered.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures will be taken to safeguard these sectors, doing more than mitigating the effects of getting rid of jobs? What defence mechanisms and safeguards are there against aggressive exports? When and how will we have a way of effectively tackling the relocation of businesses? According to the proposal of this group, the budget for 2010 will provide a new budget heading for action in the textile and footwear industry and creating a Community programme for the sector. What are the key elements of this programme?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, fair economic relations must be established as a matter of urgency. These must be at the service of the people and their countries, rather than certain economic groups or those who finance the European Union. Defending every country’s right to produce in a sustainable way has been necessary for the future, in the name of a new economic, social, energy-oriented and environmental rationality that the neoliberal model not only fails to deliver but even renders impossible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I actually welcome the free trade agreement with South Korea. As far as I can see, it is clearly in the EU’s interest to foster as close a relationship as possible between Europe and the democratic countries of Asia, including South Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time, there was an imbalance in trade between Europe and South Korea because of protectionism, between the EU with its free trade and South Korea with its protectionism. A few decades ago, South Korea was an agricultural society; it has developed rapidly into an industrial society, with 81% of the population now living in urban areas. The country is now the world’s eleventh largest economy and the EU’s fourth largest trading partner.</p>
<p class="contents">South Korea is an important ally in a strategically important area. Forecasts suggest that the country will have an even more dominant position in the high-tech sector in a decade’s time.</p>
<p class="contents">South Korea has to compete with the economic and military giant to the north of it, China, which is, at the same time, the country’s main trading partner. In competitive terms, China has an almost inexhaustible resource in the form of cheap labour. Consequently, China is also the country’s main trade competitor. By imposing quality requirements on South Korea, the EU can make the country’s goods better suited for export to the US and Europe – much better than those from China, and I imagine we are all interested in bringing that about.</p>
<p class="contents">This free trade agreement will, as has been mentioned, remove tariffs worth EUR 1.6 billion a year. That may be a very good thing in general, but for me, the question is whether South Korean trade and industry has been sufficiently liberalised and whether the roadmap for the free trade agreement can be met, taking into consideration the fact that South Korea still gives extraordinary subsidies to certain industries such as the pharmaceutical and electronics sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During that time, I argued with all the top officials about the need to fine-tune the South Korea-EU FTA, so as to get on board deeply dissatisfied industries, particularly the EU automotive industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The strongest arguments were mainly in the area of DDB safeguards and non-tariff barriers. When the new Commissioner, in response to my question during the hearings, stated that DDB deserved a closer look, I felt optimistic. Even the USA has shelved its FTA with South Korea partly because of similar objections from the car industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first major FTA. This is a template. We need to do it right. There must be a level playing field for both parties. Please do not get me wrong. I am a strong proponent of FTAs. I understand their positive impact on GDP and employment, but we should also understand that, when the competitive advantage is one-sided, benefits will diminish and, in the worst case, could even be negative.</p>
<p class="contents">Employees in the EU deserve better. Perhaps we should turn to our transatlantic partner and together demand small adjustments which would at least partially satisfy these giant industries and get new FTAs to work as soon as possible. There will always be some unsatisfied elements but, all in all, FTAs must be beneficial to citizens of both sides.

Are we to believe that this decision has nothing to do with the free trade agreement that has just been negotiated? Allow me to spot a connection there. During this period of economic crisis in which the workers are the first to pay for the mistakes of the financiers, the Commission is duty-bound to consider, now more than ever, the job-related consequences of the agreements that it negotiates.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no longer possible to give a simplistic response to these employees, for whom we know full well it will be very difficult to find another job. We cannot say to them that international trade is a game of winners and losers and that, unfortunately, they are the ones who will be sacrificed and that we can do nothing about it.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect answers from you today, Commissioner. First of all, we want to know whether your Directorate-General has assessed the impact of this agreement on jobs in Europe, for I must tell you that the figure greedily announced, that is, the EUR 19 billion profit that European exporters are expected to make, does not convince us. Where does this figure come from? On what study is it based? Leaving aside the expected positive effects, however, have the negative effects also been taken into account?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has drafted a regulation on the methods for implementing safeguard measures within the context of this agreement. These methods relate, in particular, to duty drawback, an advantage that has never before been conceded, not even to our developing trade partners. The proposals put forward provide for complicated procedures for invoking and enforcing the safeguard clauses.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless I feel reassured because, for the first time ever, Parliament will soon be able to express an opinion on this text under the ordinary legislative procedure. I would, however, like to point out that Europe’s employment problem will not be solved by palliative measures taken on a case-by-case basis. That is why I, together with my whole group, am calling for a real European industrial policy, one that represents a genuine strategy for the future of our industries, to be drawn up at last.</p>
<p class="contents">In a context of economic crisis and of intensified global competition, this industrial policy must be coordinated effectively with the common trade policy so that our free trade agreements do not lead to job cuts in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A second matter on which we expect clarification is that of the protocol on cultural cooperation included in the agreement. Several Member States have reacted very harshly to the negotiations initiated with Korea, a country that has failed to ratify the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions.</p>
<p class="contents">I condemn the very principle of initiating negotiations on this topic, and I believe that cultural issues should be handled separately from trade negotiations and placed in the hands of the Commissioner for Culture so as to prevent this matter from becoming a negotiating item under the same heading as conventional goods or services.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Commissioner, you know how essential it is for MEPs to be kept fully informed of the negotiations under way and to be involved at all stages, including from the point at which the negotiating mandate is defined. Leaving aside our differences in approach, I would like to point out that better upstream consultation of Parliament would have made it easier for us to understand the strategy being pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore trust I can count on your support and on that of your Commission to assist us in our future work, with everyone acting within the scope of his responsibilities, but always for the benefit of a trade policy that is obviously more European in scope, but that is, above all, fairer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This industry and also the European textile sector have expressed concerns on specific issues such as the duty drawback system and the safeguard clause. Also, the European Trade Unions Federation has criticised this free trade agreement. South Korea has not ratified any of the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organisation. South Korea persists in repressing trade union rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we are aware that, for this free trade agreement with South Korea, there was a clear division among the European Commission college and also among the European Commission services, in particular, between DG Taxation and Customs Union and DG Trade, on the duty drawback system.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the DG Taxation and Customs Union is concerned, the duty drawback system creates economic distortion as it is actually an export subsidy. This should create a clear competitive advantage against European industry in favour of Korean industry in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The same Korean trade investment promotion agency has calculated this advantage as at least EUR 1 300 per car. Therefore, does the new Commission consider this free trade agreement a fair trade agreement? Will the new Commission provide Parliament with a full, up-to-date impact assessment and analyses about this duty drawback system? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not be pressurised into acting too quickly. I support free competition, and think its influence on stabilisation of the political situation and on economic development is unquestionable, but it must be competition which is balanced, and which is based on competition between technologies or product production costs, and not on instruments such as duty drawback, which is included in the agreement and serves the interests, quite frankly, of only one party.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an economic crisis, and we must, today, be particularly sensitive to the situation in Europe – we must take particular responsibility for the future of European industry. This is not only a question of the motor industry, but is also about the electronics and textiles industries. Numerous branches of industry, including many from Poland, are complaining about this agreement. Therefore, it is my conviction that we should act as follows. Firstly, we must be sure of the effects of the agreement, and for this we should also work with those industries which have reported misgivings about the agreement, and not only with those which think they will win on this agreement. I expect the Commission to produce a very comprehensive analysis of the consequences of bringing this agreement into force. Secondly, we must look very carefully at the safeguarding measures and at how to construct them so that the agreement will, in fact, be advantageous to both sides, and not just to South Korea. Thirdly, we cannot introduce this agreement provisionally before Parliament is sure that it is, in fact, advantageous to all countries of the European Union and does not establish any kind of unjustified advantage for Korean industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, since the launch of the Global Europe strategy in 2006, aimed at strengthening the role of international trade in the European Union’s economic strategy, this is the first and only free trade agreement that has been negotiated, but not yet ratified, in which the trade partnership has been significant.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission view its own role and the meagre results achieved in the light of the objectives of the Global Europe strategy? Does the Commission consider, then, that the credibility of its own trade policy is at stake in this treaty, and that this credibility also depends on its ratification and approval by Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this treaty involves only one country, so it is a bilateral agreement. We know that the ambitious multilateral trade agreement under the World Trade Organisation is merely marking time, with no immediate prospects. The various regional agreements proposed by the European Union have failed almost everywhere, or clearly have no real prospects. To sum up, does this mean that this bilateral agreement is testament to the failure of EU investment in bilateral and regional agreements, and that we will henceforth be condemned to bilateralism? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are firm defenders of free trade and it is certainly vital that Europe continues negotiating trade agreements with other countries because they generate new opportunities for European companies, that is to say, new jobs, which are very much required in light of the serious current economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I did very much like your words Commissioner, because I also believe that it is very important that these agreements contain sufficient guarantees to avoid signing clauses which are unbalanced and unfair for European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement with South Korea has been put forward by the Commission as the first in a new generation of more ambitious trade agreements for Europe, hence the importance of this agreement. It is not a question of whether it is a small country or not; it is a question of not weakening our capacity for negotiation in future agreements with much larger countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are not against the South Korea free trade agreement; however, we do want certain paragraphs to be studied more rigorously, which we believe create unfair competitive disadvantages for certain European industrial sectors and give Korean producers an unfair advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I want you to clearly explain to me why the safeguard clause for the duty drawback enters into force in five years. On the last opportunity I had to speak to you, you stated that the reason was that tariffs on vehicles were also dismantled after five years.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement stipulates that they will dismantle the tariffs for vehicles which weigh more than five tonnes after five years. However, for vehicles which weigh less than five tonnes, which are all standard vehicles, the 10% tariff will be dismantled in three years. What is the reason for this two-year time lapse Commissioner?</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to receive more details regarding any updates on this aspect you mentioned.

It seems fundamental to me that the core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation should be implemented and, above all, complied with. The labour clauses in the contract are good, but they do not go far enough. There have been cases in Korea, in particular in recent months, in which there have been fundamental breaches of trade union rights, such as the right to collective bargaining and the right to freedom of organisation. Throughout the negotiating process, the European trade unions and, in particular, the unions in the metal industry, have highlighted these cases, specifically with regard to the problems to be expected in the automotive sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of Opel in Antwerp has been mentioned several times. To reiterate, operations have not only been moved because of overcapacity, as the management has repeatedly claimed, but primarily in order to relocate production to South Korea. Who will benefit from this? Is it possible that this is an advance effect of the free trade agreement?</p>
<p class="contents">Another sector with problems which has not received as much attention is the shipbuilding industry. In its ten-year plan which forms part of an act of state, Korea has made it an objective to ensure that more than 90% of the companies supplying the Korean shipbuilding industry are based in Korea. This makes the situation for European competitors and, in particular, for the employees in the industry, very difficult.</p>

My first question concerns the need for fair competition conditions. The fact that employees’ rights in South Korea are restricted means that there are unfair competitive conditions, which include the question of collective action. Paragraph 314 of the South Korean Criminal Code refers to the crime of ‘disrupting operations’. This is used to prevent strikes and to limit the rights of trade unions, for example, in the case of Ssangyong. I would also like to know why we are concluding free trade agreements with countries such as South Korea and Colombia which have the most problems with the standards of the International Labour Organisation. Therefore, my first question is this: How do you propose to use the free trade agreement to ensure that there are no unfair competition conditions in South Korea caused by restrictions on employees’ rights?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question relates to the problems in the car industry, which several other speakers have also referred to. It is very important in this case that there are sensible safeguard clauses. General safeguard clauses are currently in place for major market disruptions and for the duty drawback system. I am not able to understand this fully. Mr De Gucht, perhaps you could explain the safeguard clauses to me in simple terms. I would particularly like to know who can trigger them and when.</p>
<p class="contents">My third question concerns the new contractual basis for our cooperation introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. This includes approving safeguard clauses and implementation as part of the codecision process. Can you guarantee that the free trade agreement will not be put into force until Parliament has approved this procedure and only after Parliament has exercised its rights and adopted the safeguard clauses? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You, yourself, referred to a number of impact studies, but I have never read an impact study that sets out what the impact is, sector by sector, on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people have already spoken about the automotive sector. Well, we, both I and my home region, but also still your region too, to an extent, Commissioner, have discovered, in the meantime, what that impact is. The Opel car plant in Antwerp is closing down, and the trade unions there – and these are people who have been working on this for years and years – are absolutely convinced that this trade agreement is a very important part of Opel’s much talked-about business plan, a plan which we simply do not get to see and which lies at the heart of the decision not to build the SUV in Antwerp.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two questions for you about this. Do you know what the impact of this agreement is on employment, the effect on employment for each economic sector? If not, are you prepared – and I want to press you on this – to have an impact study carried out at this point, in order to ensure that we, in Parliament, have the information that we need when we ultimately have to give our consent? My second question is, do you intend, in future – with this being the start of your term of office – to consistently carry out this kind of impact study at the social level? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it was the other way round, we might have cause for concern. Also, we cannot underestimate the political importance of South Korea psychologically in extending the hand across the oceans to Asia – something which is very important to them – and also, where we are concerned, in re-establishing our place in the world, which was somewhat undermined in Copenhagen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, we note that, firstly, there is a problem concerning the information given to Parliament, particularly with regard to the safeguard clauses, then a problem concerning the method used, since we have already been told that it might be possible to implement temporary provisions or temporarily to implement the agreement without even waiting for Parliament’s assent, and finally, a problem concerning the clarity and transparency of the trade framework – this was raised by Mr Rinaldi – since, through the duty drawback, we could in fact have an agreement indirectly concluded with China. I believe we must be particularly clear about these free trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there is a consistency problem with regard to the aim of developing social and environmental standards.

An agreement on a free trade area will lead to a significant growth in reciprocal trade. Thanks to the elimination of Korean import duties of around EUR 1.6 billion and EU import duties of around EUR 1.1 billion, there will be a significant liberalisation of trade in important sectors of industry and in services. This concerns mainly telecommunications, environment protection, transport, finance and legal services. In addition, the free trade agreement will contribute to an increase in transparency on the question of intellectual property protection and public procurement. Thanks to the agreement, Korea will also honour EU certificates and quality standards. The agreement is particularly important in the present economic situation, because it will allow for faster development in EU countries. We realise, however (...).</p>

This has consequences, I think, for the relationship between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The safeguard clauses are a proposal. The Commission adopted its proposal yesterday and it will be presented to the Council and Parliament very soon. Obviously, then, it will be a codecision procedure, so I do not understand the many remarks in which you put questions and express doubts about safeguard clauses. There will only be safeguard clauses that get your agreement, because it is codecision: it is as simple as that. So you should not be so worried about it and about ratification by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">That implies, of course, that there will be a debate in your committee. I already said during the hearing that I am not going to make a proposal for an early, provisional application unless Parliament has itself pronounced on the agreement, whether as formal ratification by Parliament or by some other procedure that we can establish between the INTA Committee and the Commission. That remains open and can be discussed, but in any case, Parliament will have the opportunity to give its political judgment on the agreement before any proposals for early application are put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question is whether this is a mixed agreement or an agreement which is only about Community competences. The Legal Service is still preparing an opinion on that, but we cannot rule out the possibility that in the end, we will have to consider this a mixed agreement, which implies that all the national parliaments will also have to ratify it, and which could also have – in reply to Niccolò Rinaldi’s question – consequences for the voting procedure in Council.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the procedure: you will have every opportunity to express yourselves, and we will scrupulously respect this – if we did not do so, I think we would get into trouble! </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> I will now deal with the issue of Opel. I understand that it is not just in Belgium, but also in other Member States, that the Opel issue arises. What I do not understand, however, is when people say ‘look, there is a direct link between the free trade agreement with South Korea and the fact that there are plans to make closures at Opel in Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">Opel announced back at the beginning of 2009 that it intended to cut capacity in Europe by 20%. It is true that this can be done in such a way that, ultimately, all the factories remain open, on condition, of course, that Opel also views it as possible, from a business point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case, however, that the decision to actually produce the SUVs in South Korea came, at any event, after the agreement with Magna had been reached but before the conclusion of the negotiations over a free trade agreement between the European Union and South Korea. The assertion made by both Mr Belet and Mrs Van Brempt thus does not fit in with the timeline. The agreement with South Korea was only concluded afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible, in fact, to argue the opposite case, I would have thought, in other words, that some Member States only agreed to a free trade agreement with South Korea on condition that they knew what was going to happen with Opel. I think, in fact, that you have to go with this opposite case if you look at the correct timeline as it developed in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, I would like to add, for Mr Belet’s benefit, that there is a small mathematical error in the comparison he quoted, where he stated that South Korea exports 15 times as many cars to Europe as Europe exports to South Korea. This may be related to policies that I was recently involved in in Belgium. The present figures are that 37 000 cars are being exported to South Korea and approximately 440 000 imported from there.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, your line of reasoning is also faulty, as you are presuming that the two markets are the same size. If you compare the two markets, you have to observe that the South Korean market, of course, is much smaller than the European one, and that means that you are comparing apples with oranges.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to market penetration, we actually send the same percentage from Europe to South Korea as comes the other way: approximately 3 to 4%. This is what really matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that I think is actually far more important in estimating the market situation is the fact that South Korean manufacturers have recently opened major factories in Europe, namely in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, which will be capable of producing around half a million cars between them on an annual basis, so the reality is perhaps that, in future, Korean cars produced in Europe will largely, in effect, be the cars that reach the market here. What you have there is a clear shift, and so what you actually see across the car market as a whole is that there is a displacement taking place towards the major markets where, in the end, cars can be bought and sold.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final thought about what is, in any event, a particularly regrettable situation at Opel – for which, in my view, a solution is ultimately on the way – I think that one must not overlook the fact that the manufacturers follow the customers, and not the other way around, and that that is one of the most important reasons for specific policy decisions in a shrinking European car market also faced with a number of car makers who have found themselves in a difficult financial situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will, perhaps, make one last comment about the tension between bilateral and multilateral negotiations, an issue also raised by Mr Moreira. Negotiations based on the Doha Round have been taking place since 2001, which is now nine years, and there is still no solution to the impasse. I am a great supporter of multilateralism, and I think that we do also need to bring a positive conclusion to Doha, specifically retaining the development elements that it contains. I believe this also because its multilateral framework also provides the greatest legal certainty for international trade. I do think, however, that while we await the conclusion of the Doha Round – which I hope will be in 2010 or at the latest in early 2011 – we cannot sit on our hands in relation to the bilateral front.</p>
<p class="contents">What I think is very important is that, when it comes to bilateral arrangements, we only conclude agreements that go further than Doha, so as not to undermine what is decided in the Doha Round, insofar as we are setting higher criteria. That, too, explains the drawing up of the free trade agreement with South Korea. It is not, in my opinion, of such a nature that it undermines multilateralism. If we were to undercut the multilateral track, then that would indeed be the effect, but that is not the intention, nor will it be in the forthcoming negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
