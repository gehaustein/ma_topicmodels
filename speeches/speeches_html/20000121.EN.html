Although I referred to the possibility of a motion for inadmissibility which my colleague, Mr MacCormick, may move, the reasons for referral back to committee were that there existed considerable political controversy, as well as practical doubts about the proposal.

Can you tell me when we will be told of these changes of vote, because obviously it is of interest to certain Members. I presume that addendum will be made in the next set of Minutes, and we will have an opportunity to comment at that time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr� President, the regulation before us today is designed to strengthen the dialogue with the fishing industry and groups affected by the common fisheries policy. The Commission wants to ensure that it duly receives information on the needs of the industry. It also wants to promote the dissemination to this industry of the Community regulations and decisions adopted as part of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the Committee on Fisheries supports this proposal for a regulation. In order to make proposals and carry out its responsibilities, the European Commission needs to be informed of the current state of affairs within the industry through dialogue with those involved.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a regulation has been preceded by the reform of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture, the consultation body created in 1971 and involving all the professional sectors. Briefly, this reform has updated this body by including other parties which have been playing an increasingly prominent part in recent years in the management of the rational exploitation of marine resources, such as non-governmental organisations devoted to development, environmental groups, consumers and also scientists.</p>
<p class="contents">This reform has also involved a more prominent role being granted to the sectors hitherto underrepresented, such as the aquaculture sector and those engaged in marketing. The number of members of the plenary committee has also been reduced and specialist working groups have been established.</p>
<p class="contents">The essence of this reform of the Advisory Committee is the priority given to organisations which are most representative at Community level, with the aim of ensuring that the committee is not merely a spokesperson for national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Fisheries of this House, and myself in particular as rapporteur, have been highly critical of the fact that the Commission did not consult us on the reform of this committee. This means that we now have to be content with giving an opinion on this proposal for a regulation which I would venture to qualify as being of minor importance.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to its objectives and mechanisms and the legislative provisions applying to the industry, we fully support the Commission proposal to promote the dissemination of information on the common fisheries policy. We would be delighted if the Commission finally decided to make an effort to improve information. The Commissioner himself, when he last appeared before the committee, acknowledged that this was absolutely essential. Mr� Fischler said that we have a marketing problem and that the information on, and defence of, our model must be improved. This involves both information provided to the fishing industry, which, in many cases, lacks awareness or understanding of its own situation, and information provided by the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Committee on Fisheries, I have frequently been surprised by this deep lack of understanding, among the general public, of a common fisheries policy which is of enormous importance to many Member States and to the EU as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the information provided to the fishing industry, we would ask the Commission to take note of the circumstances in which many fishermen are living. Not everyone has access to the new technologies which is why information campaigns must use all the media available to us, including the most traditional. In this respect, I must highlight the work of the written press, which is increasingly concerned about the future of fishing in Europe, and also that of radio and television which are democratic media available to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I must draw the Commission’s attention to the representative nature of the organisations within the Advisory Committee. Dialogue between the Commission and those involved in the industry is essential. Yet if this dialogue is to be fruitful, those involved must be genuinely representative of the various sectors affected by the common fisheries policy. However, neither the Commission proposal nor the rules governing the Advisory Committee contain mechanisms to ensure that this is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in such a fragmented industry, which is scattered over wide areas and which has little history of forming associations, it is difficult to ensure that the Commission’s partners in the dialogue at Community level are reliable representatives of the sector concerned. With a view to enhancing their representativeness, it would perhaps be desirable for the Commission to take initiatives to boost the membership of existing trade organisations as an accompanying measure alongside those it is already undertaking. The representatives of the industry chosen as partners for the dialogue with the Commission, namely the members of the Advisory Committee, must represent the common interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament have, for years now, been conducting an intensive dialogue with the fishing industry. We also accompany delegations to Europe’s fishing regions in order to ask the relevant questions on the spot. In that way, we can gain a better insight into the problems of those who have to live and work with the European regulations on a daily basis. This week, I was a guest at the Green Week, the agricultural show in Berlin, where I engaged in a dialogue of this kind with representatives from the German fisheries sector. The subject is extremely topical and highly explosive, especially as we are on the threshold of the reform of the European common fisheries policy in the year 2002. </p>
<p class="contents">Basically, the policy has to ensure that all interests are properly taken into account and, above all, that the result is the sustainable exploitation of fishing resources. </p>
<p class="contents">Communication between the fisheries sector and the institutions of the Community must be a two-way process. Industry must articulate its requirements and communicate them to the Commission. On the other hand, the Commission has to prepare and make known the relevant stipulations and decisions. What is being sought is a dialogue, not a monologue. This is something which the Commission has acknowledged, and only by being aware – as, more than anyone else, the people affected are aware – of the problem areas, the difficulties and the possible ways of solving these, will it be possible to make appropriate decisions in the future. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this goal, the Commission has taken two steps. By means of the proposed regulation in question, the Commission is aiming – quite rightly – to strengthen the European professional associations. Dialogue can, of course, only be carried on if, without compromising their independence, the relevant discussion partners in the fisheries sector are also given financial support to enable them to participate at all in the discussions in Brussels. Approximately EUR 400 000 have this year been set aside for that purpose. The success of the dialogue will, of course, depend entirely upon how clearly the Commission is able, by means of educational initiatives, to explain the complex technical aspects on the spot in the regions. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore vigorously support the Commission’s present initiative. At the same time, I must, however, point out a major reservation. In fact, this concerns the second step which Mrs Miguélez has also explained to us here. It is about the reform of the important Advisory Committee on Fisheries. This is the basis for the dialogue. Why was the European Parliament not consulted when what was at issue was the form and organisation of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture and the tasks to be carried out by this very important interface and coordinating point for the much sought after dialogue? This is a failure that we shall continue to criticise. </p>
<p class="contents">Further small reservations I have concern the difficulty of finding genuine representatives of the various sectors of the fisheries industry, given its fragmented structure with its geographical diversity and weak structure in terms of professional associations. Here, it is a question of at last creating practical conditions. However, this also presupposes our perhaps giving some consideration to a new organisational structure for the fisheries sector. Of course, that is always assuming that the fishermen concerned have confidence, on the one hand, in the policy and, on the other hand, in the European common fisheries policy in particular. </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask of you that we in future make the most strenuous efforts in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the complaints lodged by the Dutch MEPs was that this proposal does not sufficiently take into account the agreements reached in the Netherlands between the government and the fisheries sector to facilitate observance of the fishing quota on a voluntary basis. When there is a possibility to conclude voluntary agreements upon proper consultation between the government and social organisations which have the same effect as legislation, the Dutch Labour Party has a preference for such agreements over unnecessary interference from above. This, of course, also applies at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, therefore, also very pleased with the report of Mrs Miguélez Ramos. Although we had strong differences of opinion regarding the Cunha report, I fully back her proposals to give reinforcement to the Advisory Committee on Fisheries. I congratulate her on her report. I would only make one comment. The Advisory Committee can only function properly if it represents the different sectors involved in the fisheries policy and if all the Union’s fishing nations are represented in the committee. This is not yet the case. </p>
<p class="contents">Our Group will therefore vote in favour of Amendment No 3. In this way, it hopes to bring some pressure to bear on this issue. I also call upon the European Commission to ensure that the Advisory Committee is, and continues to be, representative in the sense that I have just described.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I can inform you that my Group will be voting in favour of the resolution tabled by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, since this resolution makes a major contribution to the European Union’s fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Greens/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, anything which is designed to encourage and foster closer dialogue is to be welcomed and closer dialogue with the fishing and aquaculture industry is something that must be encouraged. But not only the industry; we must widen the dialogue to include associations which are active in the environmental and development fields and allow for an increased role of specialised research bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">A two-way flow of communication must be encouraged, not just one-way communication. My party has always advocated greater consultation with the industry. Indeed, a key advantage of a regionally-based approach to the CFP would be the involvement of those directly affected, the fishermen themselves, in the decisions which affect them, thereby furthering the goal of conserving fish stocks through sustainable fishing and offering long-term viability for the fishing-dependent communities within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to any reform of the Advisory Committee as part of the current Europe-wide assessment of the CFP, we have another opportunity for Europe to find better ways to involve fishermen in the execution of fisheries responsibilities, by expanding the principle of regionalisation. Involving the industry and other interested parties in the localities would provide a system which more adequately reflects the needs of the fishing industry and promotes, rather than hampers, compliance with the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring that we have proper consultation with civil society too, in particular fisheries and environmental NGOs, will ensure that the Community fisheries policy adequately reflects the aims of conservation and sustainable development in the fisheries sector. But NGO involvement needs to be meaningful, not just token, and we need to work hard to ensure that is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Integrating those engaged in fishing-related industries into the decision-making processes and supporting the fishermen are prerequisites for the success of any future fisheries policy and an essential element of the CFP. Yesterday, we had some controversy over parts of the Cunha report, particularly the suggestion of quota penalties. If we are to have meaningful consultation then this is exactly the kind of proposal which ought to be consulted upon and I regret that my motion to allow time for that was not successful here.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can learn from these mistakes and mean it when we say – as in this report which I support – that we want to improve communication and liaison with fishing industries and those affected by fisheries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has mainly chosen as its partners organisations which are represented in the Community. We do not want the Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture to act as a mouthpiece to protect national interests. It does, however, at least from the point of view of Finland and the Baltic Sea. Membership of EUROPÊCHE, which is represented in the Community, is too costly for Finnish fishermen. They cannot become involved in the organisation, as they cannot afford the membership fees. Their interests are therefore not protected in those organisations the Commission has chosen to be its partners. The fishermen cannot afford to be represented in the EU, but the fish breeders can. They are the capitalists of the fishing industry. That casts a strange light on the EU fisheries policy in our country. We just listen to the voice of the fish breeders, the capitalists, but not that of the proletariat, the professionals that catch the fish freely in the open seas, in other words, the fishermen. Besides, we in the Nordic countries also fish in internal waters, which the EU does not take into account.</p>
<p class="contents">This representation in supranational organisations is a problematic issue, as the EU does not focus sufficient attention on it. The supranational organisation, EUROPÊCHE, is ineffectual. It is unrepresentative, and its decisions are not binding on member organisations, but it is the size of Member States and money that decide issues, and what are called supranational interests are, in fact, national interests. It is the Commission’s important task to apply this regulation in such a way that the organisations that are represented in the Community acquire a better level of representation, and that the voice of those fishermen who cannot afford to join EU-level organisations that might represent their interests is heard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must say, however, at the same time, that some of the methods used to organise this dialogue have confused us considerably. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the necessary strengthening of dialogue. The common fisheries policy is applicable to all European Union operators, but it must deal with a wide range of situations, with variations in fishing grounds, the home ports of vessels, traditions, the gear used, organisation of the market at local level, etc. This is true to such an extent, indeed, that some thinkers have wondered whether well-coordinated national policies would not be preferable to a single common policy. Whatever the case, since today there is just one policy in force and the situations of fishing sector workers are so varied, it is all the more important to establish very close liaison with them in order to better take their needs into consideration and to overcome the harmful effects of some regulations, or even avoid the failure, pure and simple, to implement this regulation, a phenomenon occasionally observed, unfortunately, due to the regulation’s total lack of regard for real conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the members of our Group will be voting in favour of the three amendments tabled today, whose purpose is to improve the operation of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture, to bring it closer to the workers of the sector and to the requirements of national states, and finally to request that the Commission presents an annual report to Council and to the European Parliament on the debates of that body. The fact is that all the Community institutions, not just the Commission, have an interest in this debate in order to be able to contribute to orientation of the common fisheries policy in line, naturally, with the interests of our fishing fleets.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, we find some aspects of the reform extremely disturbing, as the Commission is introducing a wide range of pressure groups into the Advisory Committee, generally groups with connections in Brussels, which are dedicated to extremely noble causes – development, environment, consumer issues, etc. And at the same time, alongside the fishermen, using Community financing, the Commission would like to increase the importance of European professional bodies which, for the time being, exist only on paper. It looks as if the Commission is seeking to import masses of miscellaneous participants to provide a counterbalance to the national bodies which are themselves properly structured, well established and truly representative. It is as if the Commission were trying to get out of a discussion with some negotiators that are hard to handle and to create a completely new conciliation structure that would be more kindly disposed towards the Commission, and which would reflect its own pleasant image of itself and its plans, and that is exactly what it expects.</p>
<p class="contents">On an even more worrying note, in the end one wonders how many other sectors have already been organised in this way and whether a vast network of associations or organisations with no truly representative nature, financed chiefly by Community subsidies and participating in largely artificial consultation, has not already been constructed in Brussels. The case we are examining today leads us to think that this hypothesis may well be the correct one. In such conditions, the Brussels institutions should not be surprised to find themselves losing touch with public opinion. Member States would do well to take this matter seriously if they do not shortly wish to see the national democracies they represent ousted by insubstantial pressure groups.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the sector which is of immediate concern to us, the fisheries sector, we consider it absolutely essential to ensure that the various members of the Advisory Committee are truly representative. All the Member States involved in fishing activities must be represented, as must the workers involved in those activities. These are the parties we should be relying on, not artificial organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that the Commission knows what is happening at grassroots level. We do not need a Commission which imposes rules from its ivory tower. Consultation with the sectors is necessary to avoid issuing rules which cannot be implemented in practice. A dialogue is also necessary in order to gain a clear insight into the different interests, so that balanced decisions can be taken. </p>
<p class="contents">With the present draft regulation, the Commission aims to give reinforcement to the European trade organisations. There is certainly something to be said for that. It is in the interest of both the fisheries sector and the Commission to have one European umbrella organisation in place. As regards the fisheries sector, it is an important platform for heightening the Commission’s awareness of common interests and the Commission will have a better idea where it is at if the sector uses one and the same mouthpiece. </p>
<p class="contents">We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that the fisheries sector is pre-eminently a sector with tremendous national contrasts. Talk to any ordinary fisherperson and you will find out that, in their experience, there are no European fishing people. The European fleet consists of fishing people who are Belgian, Danish, Dutch, etc. and, to a large extent, they are each other’s competitors. The average fisherperson, therefore, has more confidence in his/her national interest group than in a European one where the office mainly consists of representatives from other Member States. We should not lose sight of this reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we should not see a European organisation as a replacement but rather an addition to national organisations. The European Commission should keep the lines of communication open with these national organisations as well. </p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the amendment which my Group has submitted concerning the Advisory Committee. Admittedly, the Commission has not asked us for an opinion regarding the composition of this committee, but the Commission will hopefully excuse me for giving it an unprompted opinion nevertheless. </p>
<p class="contents">On 16 July 1999, the Commission and industry agreed on a compromise regarding the new Advisory Committee. They came to the agreement that all EU Member States, insofar as they are fishing nations, should be represented in this committee. Conflicts of interest, as already stated, make it impossible for various members of the trade organisations to give their mandate to someone of a different nationality. </p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Advisory Committee has convened in its new form. Unfortunately, however, I have to note that little is left of the agreed balance. In the committee, some nationalities are heavily over-represented, whilst a number of other Member States are conspicuous by their absence. To the former chairman of the Advisory Committee, under whose directorship the compromise came about, this was even reason to refuse to chair the first meeting of the committee. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission might well argue that representativeness is more than just fair distribution across the Member States. This is true of course. There should also be a fair distribution across the sectors. What I would like to ascertain from the Commission, however, is the following: “Why did you fail to act upon the compromise of 16 July which clearly states that there should also be a balanced distribution in terms of nationalities?” </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address the Commission with an urgent recommendation. Do reconsider the composition of the new Advisory Committee. If you want to establish a proper dialogue with the sectors involved, if you attach importance to creating a basis for your policy, make sure there is a representative consultative body. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is absurd that the Commission did not consult Parliament or the Council on reforming the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and yet it is consulting us on this proposal for a regulation to strengthen the dialogue between the Commission and the fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the Commission did not consult us on the primary regulations but is doing so on the accompanying aspects. It did not consult us on the regulations establishing the dialogue but is doing so on how to strengthen this dialogue now it has been established. Yet the Commission’s reforms of such an important body as the Advisory Committee, which is the only body to involve the fishing industry in decisions affecting it, have prompted serious criticisms and doubts in Parliament, in the Council and in the industry itself. These criticisms involve the fact that a large part of the industry actually involved in fishing is not sufficiently represented on this new committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, in short, the financial resources in the proposal are welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">It only remains for me to congratulate Mrs� Miguélez Ramos on her report and, in particular, to defend the amendment which imposes the obligation to present Parliament with an annual report on the substance and conclusions of the debates of the working groups created by this regulation. I must also applaud the request contained in the opinion by Mr� Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, for detailed reports on the distribution of funds among the various Member States and organisations which may benefit by this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support this report and congratulate the rapporteur on her work. The Socialist Group welcomes the Commission reform of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries to create a more fruitful two-way dialogue between the Commission and the industry. We welcome the inclusion in the Advisory Committee of new sectors of the industry and the greater diversity of professional sectors involved, particularly those in aquaculture and marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the reduction in the number of members in the Plenary Committee in the interest of greater efficiency. We all know the danger of proliferating numbers at the expense of efficiency. The Commission seems to have taken that into account. We welcome the increased role of the research organisations and the establishment of the four working groups on: firstly, access to fisheries resources and their management; secondly, aquaculture, fish, molluscs and shellfish; thirdly, marketing and trade policy; fourthly, economic and structural sectoral analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">We like the priority for Community-level organisations to try and avoid nationalising the debate, but we recognise that there need to be some national inputs at the appropriate levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We will give this report our support, while promising to maintain a close watch to ensure that the structural changes that promise much actually deliver in practice; and that the new Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture acts as an effective sounding board for all sectors and all sides of the industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, I represent – on the west of Scotland particularly – a very large number of fisherpersons and their families and fragile communities whose existence is dependent upon the continuation of a successful fishing industry in the European Community and upon a proper sensitivity of the Community to those fragile and often remote regions of the Community which depend most upon it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very laudable thing to say that the Advisory Committee on Fisheries should not simply be a gathering place for national interests, especially if national interests are interpreted exclusively in terms of the interests of the Member States, taken according to the principles of proportional equality in which the Member States are represented in the organs of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another kind of equality which would be proportional to the effort engaged in the industry and indeed, proportional to the amount of sea waters and seaboard that different regions of this great Community bring into it.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask Members to carry out a little experiment. Imagine expelling Scotland from the Community. How much fishing industry would you have left? Now contemplate this question: how effectively is the voice of the Scottish fishing industry represented in the institutions of the Community, as we have them just now? The answer is: not very effectively at all! Therefore, it would indeed be a good thing if this report were to achieve a much more satisfactory representation of the fishing people, of the environmental interest and of the other civil society interests.</p>

The strengthening of dialogue between the Commission and the industry affected by the common fisheries policy is very important and has many social repercussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteur, I must underline how curious it is that the Commission is consulting Parliament on aspects which we might regard as being secondary in the organisation of this dialogue. Yet it did not ask this House about the composition, organisation and functions of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries which is the key body in this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">As the direct and democratic representative of the people, the European Parliament should have been consulted on this body and on the representativeness of the various sectors involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, we will have to wait for the new committee to start work in order to assess its activity. This is why I regard as positive the contributions made by the Miguélez Ramos report on the aspects of financial control of the costs and greater transparency in management. In this way, the maximum amount of information will be provided, both to Parliament and the Council, so that the strengthening of the dialogue intended by the Commission can be monitored by everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will take note of our comments and concerns as we will be watching the development and operation of the new committee very closely.

First of all, the principle of subsidiarity is observed, the countries are sufficiently involved, and secondly, sufficient consideration is given to organisations or the social mainstream. In this sense, I am pleased that a reinforced Advisory Committee is to be set up which can possibly exert more influence on the fisheries policy. So far, so good.</p>
<p class="contents">I am less impressed, however, with the actual implementation. I have to note that the proposal is lacking in two areas at least. To start with, not all Member States are represented, which is very poor indeed. After all, this Parliament also believes in the subsidiarity of Member States. This means that Member States with a major fisheries sector cannot be left out. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if the social mainstream and organisations are to be involved in the fisheries policy, this should be done in a balanced and proper way, recognising just how important geographic distribution is. On this score, the proposal is simply inadequate. </p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that, together with other Members, Mr Van Dam, among others, I would still ask that an Advisory Committee be set up which has an important role to play, but which must represent the entire sector Europe-wide. In practical terms, this means that all fishing nations of the Union have to be represented in the committee. </p>
<p class="contents">In the former Advisory Committee, agreement was reached on this between the sector and the Commission. In my view, also from a Christian Democratic viewpoint, the fact that this was overlooked in the present proposals submitted by the trade organisations is most unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps I should say the nails, as there are two fundamental issues here, which various speakers have already commented on and which this Parliament cannot fail to note.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that we are surprised, or rather amazed, that Parliament should now be heard on procedural aspects of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture, when it was not heard at the time the Council’s membership was discussed. Last year, as we all know, the Commission approved, on its own initiative, Decision 478/99, which created this Advisory Committee. It did not listen to Parliament on a subject as important as the representativeness of fishing organisations and their importance to formulating and managing the common policy. I find it incomprehensible that Parliament should not have been heard. It is a real mystery. Sometimes people’s reasons defy reason itself. I do not know if there is some reason of which I am not aware for Parliament not being heard.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation is that we have many doubts as to how representative these bodies actually are. For example, a country such as my own, Portugal, which is a large fishing nation in European Union terms, the fifth-largest in terms of the size of its fleet, is not appropriately represented here. I am astonished. I find it a total mystery.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude the second issue, or to hit the second nail on the head, and bearing in mind these shortcomings in the Advisory Committee and in its representativeness, it is crucial that financial aid for other organisations which are not part of the Advisory Committee be earmarked and set aside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is useful to make this effort to promote better dialogue between the European Union and those involved in fisheries. In the part of the European Union I come from, a peripheral region, we have always had particular difficulty in selling the idea of a common fisheries policy to fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Mr MacCormick has brought up the subject – and I have referred to it before – the position is difficult for Ireland because if you took Ireland out of the European Union, you would take a lot of fish with you. Traditionally, Irish fishermen did not catch those fish, because as some people will know, there was a period in our history when it was forbidden by law to put fish into Irish vessels. That situation largely continued until the beginning of this century, and so people were still fishing in outdated curraghs 20 years before we joined the European Union. In any case, it is a fact of life that something like EUR 700 million worth of fish – and perhaps even more because the price of fish has changed – comes out of Irish waters. As a result of the reduction in the structural funds allocated to Ireland, because of its economic growth, the value of fish taken out of what would be Irish waters if there was no European Union will be greater in a couple of years time than the total amount of structural funds coming to Ireland. That makes this proposal even more difficult to sell.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not aware that the same is true in any other country of the European Union. Scotland, as part of the United Kingdom, takes its natural share along with the United Kingdom, but Ireland is the one country which does not. This is the only natural resource which I know all Member States concede as common property of the European Union. That does not mean that we do not need to proceed with this dialogue. The extension of the 20-mile limit, which Parliament has agreed to, might be part of the solution and might help to satisfy local fishermen, giving them more control over their lives. I do not want renationalisation, but regionalisation would certainly help the problems of Scotland and Ireland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is something which was not quite so readily reflected in the way the previous Advisory Committee on Fisheries operated and so this legislative proposal has been drafted. The purpose of this proposal is to create a more effective and genuine relationship between the Commission and the Advisory Committee on Fisheries. </p>
<p class="contents">It took the Commission three years to draft this proposal. In 1997, a survey was carried out by an independent office, from which two main ideas emerged. The first was that the common fisheries policy now extends beyond the fishing industry and concerns the whole of society. This is something we must take into account. The second was that the Advisory Committee’s mode of operation did not meet the requirements for handling complex issues. </p>
<p class="contents">The legislative proposal therefore falls into three categories. The first is the reform of the Advisory Committee, which now consists of 20 members instead of 45, with participation from fisheries organisations making up 60%, industrial and commercial enterprises within the sector 25%, and environmental organisations 15%. The Commission has thus endeavoured to consult not only professionals and entrepreneurs, but also society as a whole. The second part of the legislative proposal concerns measures to aid the representative organisations of those involved with the common fisheries policy and, in particular, European professional fishing organisations. The third part concerns improving communication between the DG for Fisheries and these groups. </p>
<p class="contents">The legislative proposal touches upon the latter two points, but I would like to reiterate that there were lengthy deliberations over the final proposal as regards the actual composition of the committee. On 26 October, the Council examined this proposal for the first time and is now awaiting the opinion of Parliament so that it can get on with its work. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to commend Mrs Ramos in particular on the exceptional quality of her report, as well as Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries for its excellent cooperation and contribution to this text. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on the amendments and to express the Commission’s view on the matter. Three amendments have been tabled by the parliamentary committee. The first concerns Parliament’s desire to exercise tight control over payments to professional organisations so that they closely correspond to the purposes set out in the legislative proposal. The Commission agrees and accepts this proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second amendment, the Commission obviously agrees with Parliament’s view as regards access to information concerning the work of the committee and the numerous debates it holds. However, drawing up an annual report of all this activity would be an extremely arduous task for the already overburdened directorate for community fishing and would not necessarily lend any added value. </p>
<p class="contents">The third amendment encompasses the second and refers to the representativeness of the Advisory Committee, that is the participation of all nationalities. We agree that, within the Committee, the whole sector must be safeguarded and represented on an equal basis, but we are uncertain as to the extent to which – and this is something which came up both in the survey and in discussions – this balance should be based on nationality. The Commission proposed to assist European organisations, which are entirely free to regulate national representation or representation of certain groups wherever they see fit. </p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I would like to say that the Commission adopts Amendment No 1 which calls on the Community to tighten its financial control, but it considers it advisable, for the aforementioned reasons, to reject Amendments Nos 2 and 3. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This result is incomprehensible, given that, in the same debate, there was widespread criticism of the Commission for not having consulted Parliament when membership of the Advisory Committee for Fisheries was being reformed. Amendment No 3 was the only one which covered this issue, and it had the vital aim of guaranteeing that this advisory structure is genuinely representative and that it moves beyond its unbalanced and largely notional character.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sauquillo Pérez del Arco (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (ES)</span> Mr� President, I do not want to over-dramatise the situation as there are many civilians suffering violence in armed conflicts around the world. However, between 1992 and 1997, 131 volunteer and humanitarian workers and human rights activists working for the United Nations in areas of conflict were murdered.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 1� January 1994 and 17� March 1997, 119 volunteer and humanitarian workers were kidnapped in 35 separate incidents. In 1992, one United Nations representative died violently every month. In 1993, one died every two weeks and, in 1994, one died every week.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first two months of 1997, 9 volunteers died. In 1996, 153 delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross were subject to security incidents, including murders and kidnappings. I must, in particular, mention the deaths of three members of <span class="italic">Médecins du Monde</span>-Spain in Rwanda in 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, as stated by the joint motion for a resolution with which we want to close this debate, the murders of Iñigo Eguiluz and Jorge Luis Mazo are simply the latest in a long line of attacks. These two men were volunteers for the organisation <span class="italic">Paz y Tercer Mundo</span>. They were murdered on 18� November in Quibdó on the Atrato river, 500 kilometres north of Bogotá, Colombia. These attacks strike not only at the integrity of these individuals but also at human rights, international humanitarian law and, within this, the right of victims of conflicts to be helped, to see the perpetrators of these acts tried and to receive the necessary reparation so that these crimes do not go unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent insecurity for humanitarian workers is due to the increase in conflicts, the exponential growth of humanitarian organisations and, in particular, the nature of current conflicts. These are no longer between regular armed forces, subject to political control, and guerrilla movements with a defined command structure and ideologies. Conflicts in which the warring parties are responsible, to some extent, for the protection of humanitarian workers, from whose actions the people benefit, no longer exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Volunteer and humanitarian workers are now exposed to banditry. The civilian population is regarded as just another element in the conflict and as part of the political and military strategy. Humanitarian action has therefore become an obstacle to the warring parties in the achievement of their objectives which often involve the elimination of part of the civilian population for ethnic, religious or cultural reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this situation, the security of humanitarian workers is a widespread problem which is of concern to Parliament. The Commission should be concerned as it finances over 180 NGOs working in areas of conflict. The Council should also be concerned as it is engaged in advancing an external policy in accordance with the Treaties, in promoting human rights and a security policy which, at the moment, is specifically confined to humanitarian actions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we ask for Parliament’s concerns to be echoed by the other institutions. The Commission should act by preparing a communication on the security conditions of volunteer and humanitarian workers and by adopting measures which guarantee this security. Before applying the measures proposed by some governments, such as military protection of their volunteers, we must examine other measures which may be more effective in situations of conflict. The Council should act through the promotion, from within the CFSP, of international humanitarian law and perhaps through the creation of a European civilian peace corps.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions on International Humanitarian Law, which protect the civilian population in armed conflicts, and which guarantee their access to international aid. These are instruments which impose a legal obligation on countries but which are systematically being breached.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask the Secretary-General of the Council to use the European Union’s incipient capacity for external action to promote these EU principles. The Secretary-General of the United Nations recently asked the Security Council to impose international humanitarian law, even by applying Chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Here today, we simply ask that we start to acquire a conscience and that measures are taken to tackle a problem which affects not only the NGOs but also the very foundations of our concept of world order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is one of those events happening all over the world on a daily basis to which Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco referred. In addition, the Commission would like, once again, to point to the courage and dedication of the humanitarian aid workers who are working in such dangerous regions all over the world. </p>
<p class="contents">In Colombia’s case in particular, the Commission has let its concerns on the matter be known to the Colombian authorities on numerous occasions. We are continuing to monitor the situation and are in constant cooperation with the Member State embassies in Bogota. As for the murders of Iñigo Eguiluz, who was working on ECHO’s plans, and the priest, the Commission and the Member States have put pressure on the Colombian authorities to hold an inquiry. The European Commission and the Spanish ambassador met with the Colombian Deputy Prime Minister, insisting that those responsible for the crime be brought to justice. Saving and safeguarding lives in these extraordinary cases constitute an integral part of humanitarian legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">ECHO’s role in Colombia and in other countries is to monitor the humanitarian situation in the country and, in Colombia’s case in particular, to monitor the situation of persons who are being displaced against their will. There are also continuous efforts to monitor the implementation of humanitarian laws. Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco emphasised the need for specific measures and action on the part of the Commission to ensure the safety of those aid workers. You referred to the existing Commission document from May 1998 on the security of aid workers, which sets out priorities and specific action to be taken. On account of the fact that the situation had worsened, the Commission’s ECHO office, together with the International Red Cross organisation, organised a seminar in Bogota on the question of security in April 1999, where all the organisations in Colombia were asked to have a Security Charter and to inform the Red Cross in advance of their movements. This was to ensure that those carrying arms were informed as to the humanitarian nature of any particular mission. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that, in addition to careful planning, action measures and training for aid workers, there is still a need for funding. Applying humanitarian aid is by no means a costless operation. For this reason, the Commission is not only urging that this humanitarian aid be put into practice but it is also funding activities to train those who take part in these missions and to increase their awareness of the dangers involved. Allow me, if I may, to mention some recent and previous examples of initiatives which have been undertaken for this purpose: they include the presentation of documents on humanitarian aid, the seminar on security between the partners in Lisbon, the workshop on security issues for staff in Brussels, the inclusion of staff security issues in ECHO’s guidelines and a conference of ECHO correspondents to be held in February-March 2000 on that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the European Parliament proposals will be taken into account, and because this is a matter which presents particular difficulties and has so many different aspects, close cooperation and innovative ideas and proposals are very important for Commission action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can only add this to the list of violent deaths suffered in recent years by volunteers who have dedicated their lives to the achievement of peace and who have also brought education to the most disadvantaged people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore logical that this Group and this House should be speaking out and sending a message of understanding and condolence to the families of these victims and of support and courage to their companions who are continuing to work in these places. At the same time, we call on the institutions responsible for ensuring justice, the Commission, the Secretary-General of the Council and the Colombian Government, to make every effort to ensure that justice prevails and that these events are punished in accordance with the law.</p>
<p class="contents">The imprisonment of a suspect is a positive sign which we congratulate. We also welcome the willingness shown by the Colombian President, Mr� Pastrana, on his recent visit to this House. However, while understanding the complexity of the problem, we would remind the Colombian Government that support for the Red Cross and the United Nations Commission for Refugees is a measure which will always receive our backing, as will efforts to rigorously apply the rules laid down in 1998 and other previous rules establishing the real, legal protection of these groups.</p>
<p class="contents">We also recognise that the systems of detection and legal protection of volunteer workers need to be improved. These volunteers necessarily work in areas of conflict, in places characterised by violence and poverty and in areas of darkness, into which the gaze of justice cannot penetrate. We therefore need to find other measures and devise new systems. Precisely for this reason, we who live in prosperity, together with the European institutions and governments, are obliged by a code of honour to establish a range of protection measures for humanitarian workers, with full support for justice. For while we try to help from the outside, these volunteers are building peace and solidarity from within. They are the ones entering shadowy places to bring healthcare and solve problems. They are the most noble side of a self-indulgent society, which is why our response must be effective and responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs� Sauquillo has highlighted, in both her oral question and her intervention, that this problem is not specific to one country. While Colombia is certainly one of the countries whose situation does not allow the security of volunteers to be guaranteed, this is also true of many other countries in Africa, Asia and other places.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution asks the Commission to draw up a communication in this respect. I am not sure if this is the most appropriate instrument but it seems that the Commission is ready to work in this direction. It would probably be useful to look at preparing a document.</p>
<p class="contents">The aspect which does not make much sense to me is the singling out of Colombia and the support for some of the amendments tabled which are aimed, for example, at suspending cooperation. The suspension of cooperation with these countries causes great harm to their people. We must not curtail this cooperation when this is unselfishly provided by people who know the risks to which they are exposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, to suggest that we might stop governmental participation in the channelling of aid is to ignore the real situation. I have visited many areas of Colombia and, apart from the natural factors – it is difficult terrain – there is the added problem of the existence of several movements of different types. We never know which one may end someone’s life. Without a minimum amount of governmental aid, cooperation would be absolutely impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that this debate is very useful as a reminder to the Commission of what is happening. To a certain extent, the Commission has reassured us by indicating that this is an issue of concern to it but we must look at the situation calmly. International cooperation must continue. This European Community has to continue setting an example in international cooperation. We have to support our volunteers and it would therefore be desirable for the Community institutions, the governments of the Member States and the governments of the recipient countries to guarantee the security of these workers. This protection could be provided firstly through prevention and secondly through legal action. The Colombian authorities assure me that they have already initiated legal proceedings based on the detention of one person. Colombia is a country in which the judiciary enjoys great independence and the executive does not have the power to judge criminals. The standard legal channels must therefore be followed.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, I encourage you to follow the course which has been set. In this way we hope that the security of our volunteer workers can be improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They apologise for being unable to be present themselves. Although I have less expertise, I am happy for this opportunity to speak on their behalf and on behalf of the Green/European Free Alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliamentarians we are often guilty of complaining about the privations of our life, travelling between two, three or four cities, occupying cramped offices and so forth. So it is a humbling moment to rise in this House to speak on this topic and contemplate the problems and dangers faced by brave people who go out as humanitarian workers in Third World countries. We can only pause and reflect upon the conditions of their lives and sometimes, alas, of their deaths. That said, my Group and I are disappointed that our colleagues in the Socialist Party – although rightly saying that this is a general problem – seem to be losing sight – in our opinion – of the need to concentrate on Columbia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to recall that President Pastrana visited this place as recently as October and gave assurances about safeguarding human rights and about the prosecution of crime and the dismantling of the paramilitary forces. These assurances have turned out to be almost worthless. Not enough has been done. The motion on behalf of my Group says that the Commission should insist, as a condition of its presence and its work in the country, on the enforcement of laws relating to the protection of displaced workers and on the provision of guarantees from the Colombian Government relating to their physical safety and material wellbeing. It is right that the Commission should insist on these requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next clause the motion says that we oppose the continuing of aid to the Colombian Government, but not to the Colombian people because the next clause says that we should continue aid through other channels and direct it to make sure that the paramilitary forces are discountenanced and that civil order returns as fast as reasonably possible to Columbia.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights workers are a critical part of the problem, but not the whole problem. The only way to stop the killing will be by dismantling the paramilitary troops and providing adequate bodyguards for human rights workers. ECHO and the Commission have to put pressure on the governments to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, on 26 October of last year, Colombia’s President, Mr Pastrana, spoke here in the European Parliament. He maintained that he wanted to work for human rights in his country and for a situation in which activists involved in issues affecting human rights are offered protection and in which those responsible for murders and crimes of violence, which are mainly committed by paramilitary groups, are not granted immunity from prosecution but are held responsible. </p>
<p class="contents">Less than a month later, the murders that form the backdrop to today’s debate took place. A paramilitary group attacked the organisation Peace and the Third World, an organisation which, with the support of the ECHO programme, works to provide humanitarian aid to farmers driven off their land. A Colombian priest and a Spanish aid worker were killed. The latter worked for the peace brigades whose presence is supposed to protect human rights activists against violence. These murders are just a few in the long list of excesses in Colombia, but this time a citizen of an EU country was also killed. </p>
<p class="contents">Murders and disappearances are part of everyday life in Colombia. Just recently, for example, two prominent spokespersons for the peasants’ movement disappeared. They had been carried off by a paramilitary group and they have not been found. </p>
<p class="contents">Behind the greater part of this terror are paramilitary groups with more or less obvious links to the country’s own military and power structures. It has been repeatedly demonstrated how the country’s military has been directly implicated in various acts of violence. The victims are the civilian population in areas where the guerrillas have support, the political Left, union activists and those who work for human rights. The legal Left in the country has been hit hard. Thousands of its representatives, including mayors and parliamentarians, have quite simply been murdered. Very seldom have the perpetrators been punished. </p>
<p class="contents">In a country like that, it is not surprising that many people turn to the guerrilla movement and the armed struggle. It should be emphasised, however, that the guerrillas too are responsible for acts of violence which it is impossible to defend. Achieving better respect for human rights in Colombia is absolutely crucial if a peaceful solution to the country’s civil war is going to be possible. The peace efforts must be supported, at the same time as the Colombian government must be put under constant pressure, especially from the European Union, when it comes to the issue of human rights. Foreign, that is to say American, military involvement must be rejected. </p>
<p class="contents">Our Group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, has not been able to subscribe to the compromise resolution which has been negotiated. We think it is quite inadequate in its criticism of the Colombian government. It is striking that paragraph D of the resolution refers to the occupation of a Red Cross office by farmers, while the thousands of political murders which have taken place in Colombia are not discussed in any clear way. </p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled two amendments together with the Group of the Greens. In the first amendment, we want aid to the Colombian government to be made dependent upon respect for human rights, and those who work with these questions to be protected. </p>
<p class="contents">In the second amendment, we want to increase humanitarian aid through organisations which are independent of the Colombian government, for example the various civilian peace corps. If these amendments are adopted, the present resolution will be somewhat better and clearer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the beginning of the 21st century, we are experiencing, however, an ever greater proliferation of new forms of war in the shape of ethnic conflicts. Militias clash, or the opposing sides in civil wars or simply criminal gangs. Governments are either implicated in the conflicts or else they are completely, or largely, powerless to resolve them. Naturally, this also greatly jeopardises humanitarian and development aid. It is therefore our task as the European Parliament to focus very strongly upon this issue. We may well admire the contributions which people are making here in the fields of humanitarian and development aid, but we must also ensure that their living and working conditions improve. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have quite a lot of catching up to do in this regard. We must see to it that the European Union in actual fact provides aid in every place where, for example, NGOs are doing so in an exemplary way. It is not only in South America that we have this set of problems. This week, we had the debate about Chechnya and, some time ago, the debate about Central Asia. Then, Mr Madelin addressed us on the subject of Afghanistan. And, again and again, we observe the same phenomenon: the withdrawal of humanitarian aid because safety is not being guaranteed. A number of NGOs demonstrate to us how, in spite of this, aid can be supplied, albeit under very perilous conditions. However, the European Union as well as other large organisations, such as the Red Cross, are all too often on the retreat. </p>
<p class="contents">We must be careful that this trend does not continue, for it is shamelessly exploited by some governments which then say that aid may only be provided to themselves and not directly, through the NGOs, at the coalface. That is dangerous because these governments are in fact not the solution to the problem but a part of it, and even the cause. We must therefore remain very firmly in control of the situation. For this reason, we are beginning, as a Parliament, to be very disappointed in our Commissioner responsible for this area, Mr Nielson.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you, Commissioner, to also convey this to Mr Nielson. For some weeks, dissatisfaction has been growing in this House. We had criticisms to make of Mrs Bonino in the administrative area, but Mrs Bonino was present. She was not only present in Parliament but had also visited the regions in crisis. The European Union had a human face where humanitarian and development aid were concerned. The Commission has a considerable amount of catching up to do in this area. We are slowly beginning here – I can detect this in all Groups – to develop a very critical attitude. I believe that we ought to move early to a situation in which we are again developing joint initiatives in this area for the purpose of stabilising the political sphere and supporting NGOs, but also of making the European Union’s presence felt, where necessary, at the coalface. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The role of the European Parliament is also very important. </p>
<p class="contents">However, I rise to speak as I would like to refer to the comments made about Commissioner Nielson. Firstly, he is not present today as he is on a trip to South Africa. Secondly, over the past three months he has become involved in many crises. And thirdly, he has worked hard and has already submitted plans to the Commission for total restructuring and for new regulations on administering humanitarian aid as well as for innovative ways of cooperating with non-governmental organisations. I understand and I empathise with many of the comments of the honourable Members on the problems that exist, but I think it is a bit much to criticise a Commissioner who has only been in office for three months and who has already carried out some important work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>Question 1: What specific provisions will the Member States submit?</p>
<p>Article 1 of the “Common Position of 27 May 1999 on negotiations of the European Union relating to the Draft Convention on Cyber Crime held in the Council of Europe”<a href="#defann_1_1" name="refann_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> expresses general support for the Draft Cyber Crime Convention, in particular for provisions regarding the investigation and prosecution of “cyber crime” offences. Momentarily, Member States contribute to the development of the Draft Convention, which is still under discussion in the Council of Europe, by supplementing the existing draft provisions where necessary. This is the case regarding provisions on substantive criminal law, but also concerning procedural law and, above all, in the field of international cooperation.</p>
<p>Question 2: Does the Council envisage a European body to monitor and oversee the prosecution of cyber crime at European level?</p>
<p>During the UK Presidency, the Council underlined in its “Elements of its strategy against high tech crime”<a href="#defann_1_2" name="refann_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the importance of joining unbureaucratic and informal practical arrangements, such as the already existing G8 24/7 points of contact network. Until now, several Member States are part of this flexible network. It facilitates, above all, the investigation of cyber crime. At this stage, the Presidency supports this flexible approach and does not envisage setting up a proper European body to monitor and oversee the prosecution of cyber crime. However, the role of Europol in this area is kept under review.</p>
<p>Question 3: Seven months after the adoption of the Common Position, can the Council say what stage has been reached with the Draft Convention on Cyber Crime and what practical measures Member States have taken?</p>
<p>As the Draft Convention is still being negotiated, it would be premature to ask Member States to already take practical measures.</p>
<p>The mandate of the relative Committee of the Council of Europe (PCCY) to negotiate the Convention has been extended until the end of 2000. Especially the provisions on international cooperation are intensively discussed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council has consistently supported peace in the Middle East, through its own political initiatives, its constructive support for the efforts of the US and other key players and considerable economic EU assistance for the Peace Process. The Council welcomes the fact that the Middle East Peace Process is not only on the move but is also gaining momentum on both its Syrian and Palestinian Tracks.</p>
<p>On the basis of this positive development, the multilateral part of the Peace Process should soon be able to resume normal activities, starting with a meeting of its Steering Group at Ministerial level in Moscow later this month. As Chair of the Regional Economic Development Working Group, which has 53 members in and outside the region, the Council and the Commission will convene that group as soon as possible after the Ministerial meeting. The group will then be able to continue laying the foundations for the economic development and integration which is a basic condition for lasting peace in the region.</p>
<p>As for the Barcelona Process, the Council does not share the honourable Member's appreciation that it is “slowing to a stop”. The Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Foreign Ministers last April in Stuttgart, as well as the Ministerial Conferences on Water in Turin and on Health in Montpellier, both in the second half of 1999, on the contrary carried forward the work. We are now preparing an informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Industry in June in Limassol. On substance, one of the particularly far reaching projects for this year, on which work is already started, is a Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace and Stability.</p>
<p>At the bilateral level, the Council is to decide, before the end of this month, on the conclusion of the Association Agreement with Morocco. During the Portuguese Presidency, four Association Council meetings with Mediterranean countries are planned: with Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey and Israel.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council will continue its work on a Common Strategy of the European Union on the Mediterranean region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0816"></a>

<p>At its session of 29 November 1999, the Employment and Social Affairs Council effectively adopted conclusions regarding the reinforcement of cooperation with a view to modernising and improving social protection.</p>
<p>These conclusions provide for establishing a high-level group responsible for looking into the questions raised in the Commission communication of July 1999 regarding the modernisation of social protection, and preparing a report for the Council.</p>
<p>The Commission has expressed its intention to make a proposal in the near future regarding the establishment of this high-level group. At this stage, there has been no mention of the involvement of the European Parliament in the operations of this new body.</p>
<p>In the interim period, before starting a debate on these questions and until the high-level working party has been set up, the Council conclusions stipulate that Member States and the Commission should appoint senior officials who would be able to present an initial report to the European Council in June 2000.

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Despite repeated declarations by the Council in support of the abolition of the death penalty throughout the world, the campaign pursued by the Council in Autumn 1999, which advocated the adoption by the UN General Assembly of a resolution calling for the introduction of a universal moratorium on the carrying out of death sentences, ended up as a complete shambles.</p>
<p>In order to avert another political and diplomatic fiasco for the Union and another defeat in the international campaign in support of the universal abolition of the death penalty, does the Council not feel that it should, with immediate effect, entrust the High Representative for the CFSP with responsibility for this issue and, in particular, with preparations for a new initiative at the forthcoming UN General Assembly in support of the introduction of a universal moratorium on the carrying out of death sentences?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The worldwide abolition of the death penalty is a key objective in the EU's human rights policy. The EU undertakes initiatives, in bilateral contacts and in multilateral fora, to encourage States to abolish the death penalty. If States are not yet prepared to abolish capital punishment, the EU calls on them to introduce moratoria and to respect minimum human rights standards.</p>
<p>The EU notes with satisfaction that its call for the worldwide abolition of the death penalty is supported by civil society representatives and NGOs within and outside Europe. It also notes that the number of countries that have abolished the death penalty has been growing over the last few years.</p>
<p>However, and in spite of the significant support it received from many UN Member States, the EU's initiative encountered fierce resistance from retentionist countries. The only way to get it adopted would have been to accept amendments which would have run counter not only to the immediate objective but also even to the principle of action on human rights in the UN. The EU accordingly decided after close consultation with the co-sponsors to freeze the initiative and postpone its introduction.</p>
<p>It is important to underline that decisions on the objective and tactics were taken by all EU Members jointly, in cooperation with other pro-abolition members of the UN. The former Presidency played its normal role in coordinating and leading on the EU's position, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the arrangements for representing the EU at the UN. Worldwide abolition of the death penalty will obviously take time; initiatives to that end can achieve much in raising consciousness about this issue, even though they may not be wholly successful in the short term. The Union's commitment and determination to pursue, within the UN and elsewhere, its long-term policy for the universal abolition of the death penalty remain unchanged.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0824"></a>

<p>The Council wishes to emphasise that it is firmly convinced that the establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice cannot be achieved in a harmonious fashion unless there is close interinstitutional cooperation, particularly between the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p>This is the spirit in which the Council has always been concerned to consult the European Parliament, pursuant to the terms of the Treaties, regarding proposals put forward by the Commission or initiatives from Member States.</p>
<p>Like the procedure for all other proposals put forward in other areas, the Council consults the European Parliament as quickly as possible and, in most cases, virtually as soon as it receives these proposals itself. This is the result of its desire to keep the European Parliament informed at the earliest possible stage of work in progress and to give Parliament the opportunity to give the Council’s operations added value in due course.</p>
<p>As regards the proposed convention on judicial cooperation in criminal matters mentioned in the specific question which the honourable Member has asked, the Council wishes to state that, following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, it consulted the European Parliament by asking it to issue an opinion within an appropriate time limit, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaties.</p>
<p>Following the requests made by the European Parliament, the Council issued a new text to the European Parliament, following the Council meeting of 2 December 1999, regarding the proposed convention and is now awaiting the opinion of Parliament.</p>

<p>The Council has no detailed information about the particular case to which the honourable Member refers.</p>
<p>In its various contacts at every level, the Council has been attempting for some years to impress upon the Tunisian authorities how much importance it attaches to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Difficulties have arisen in the past because the Tunisian authorities have refused to meet Union representatives.</p>
<p>However, a number of developments in recent months have been sufficiently encouraging to warrant attention. In the first place, the Association Agreement entered into force on 1 March 1998, providing a basis on which to pursue the necessary dialogue at ministerial level. The EU-Tunisia Association Council held its first meeting on 14 July 1998 and at the dinner given immediately afterwards, the Austrian Presidency raised the question of human rights. The second Association Council meeting will take place on 24 January 2000 and likewise be followed by a dinner at which discussions will focus on the next stages of the political dialogue. The Union will also take the opportunity to voice its specific concerns about respect for human rights. The case mentioned in the honourable Member's question could accordingly be dealt with on that occasion.</p>
<p>In addition, several breakthroughs appear to have occurred where human rights in Tunisia are concerned. First of all, a Minister whose brief includes human rights was appointed in November� 1999. Initial contacts have been made with the Minister, who has said that he wishes to foster progress in the sphere of human rights, freedom of the Press and freedom of expression. He has given to understand that he is ready and willing to conduct an ongoing constructive dialogue with the EU on all of these sensitive matters, marking a departure from the previous attitude. Furthermore, after years of efforts to bring such talks about, the UN special rapporteur on promotion and protection of the rights of freedom of conscience and expression, Mr Hussain, has just visited the Tunisian authorities and will report to the next meeting of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0012"></a>

<p>As the honourable Member points out, the new treaty attaches greater importance to matters relating to respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the combating of discrimination.</p>
<p>On the basis of this new treaty, a number of actions have been undertaken by the Council pursuant to Articles 6 and 13.</p>
<p>Article 6 of the EU Treaty stipulates that:</p>
<p>1.	“The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States.</p>
<p>2.	The Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed in Rome on 4 November 1950 and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.” </p>
<p>In accordance with the new powers thereby conferred on it, the Council has adopted a first annual report on human rights, both in the European Union and internationally. This report has, in fact, been published by the General Secretariat of the Council.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the European Council in Cologne decided that a Community Charter of Fundamental Rights would be drawn up in accordance with the terms specified by the European Council in Tampere, which make the procedure the responsibility of both the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission has just presented the Council with a raft of proposals based on Article 13. According to Article 13 of the EC treaty, “Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty and within the limits of the powers conferred by it upon the Community, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may take appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.” The European Parliament has been consulted on these proposals. The underlying principles which the Commission used in drawing up the two directives and the programme are explained in a communication. In the same document, the Commission mentions the great amount of consultation work carried out within Member States, particularly involving civil society, whether it be NGOs or both sides of industry.</p>
<p>The first directive, which targets discrimination of all forms, with the exception of sexual discrimination, is a directive with a view to the creation of a general framework in favour of equal treatment in employment and at work.</p>
<p>The second directive concerns the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of peoples regardless of race or ethnic origin. This is a legal framework intended to enable Member States to intensify the fight against discrimination in all forms.</p>
<p>As for the programme, it sets itself three objectives, which are as follows:</p>
<p>“(a)	improve the understanding of issues related to discrimination through improved knowledge and measurement and through the evaluation of the effectiveness of policies and practice;</p>
<p>(b)	develop the capacity of target actors (in particular Member States, local and regional authorities, independent bodies responsible for the fight against discrimination, the social partners and non-governmental organisations) to address discrimination effectively, in particular through support for the exchange of information and good practice and networking at European level;</p>
<p>(c)	promote and disseminate the values and practices underlying the fight against discrimination.”</p>
<p>This programme will therefore make it possible to monitor breaches of the principle of non-discrimination more closely.</p>
<p>The proposals based on Article 13 are, in the opinion of the Council, of considerable political importance, and the Portuguese Presidency has made it clear that this is one of its priorities. The Presidency intends to take the examination of these proposals as far as possible during the first six months in order to achieve the adoption of these measures, if possible.</p>
<p>These proposals are also representative of the way in which Community institutions may give substance to a general principle. This process will contribute towards giving the Charter of Fundamental Rights greater credibility.</p>
<p>Finally, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, which was also created by Council Regulation No 1035/97, has just published its first report. At this stage it does not seem the right time to extend its mandate to make it a monitoring centre for human rights. This idea, although very interesting, seems premature in view of the short lifetime of the monitoring centre in its present form and in view of the fact that the process of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights is still in its initial phase.</p>
<p>The Council would like to assure the honourable Member once again of its deep commitment to this issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0017"></a>

<p>In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 12 May 1998, the Commission informed the Council and Parliament that the territorial scope of the EC-Israel Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade-related matters currently in force is confined to the territory of the State of Israel which, under applicable international law, binding on all of the Community’s Member States and on Israel, does not include the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely the West Bank, together with East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. Apparently, the territorial clause establishing this scope in the current Agreement is repeated in the EC-Israel Association Agreement initialled by Israel and the Council and now undergoing ratification by the Member States.</p>
<p>Have the current or previous Israeli governments instructed Israel’s customs services to apply the rules of origin as laid down in the territorial clause of that Agreement, as the Agreement requires?</p>
<p>Does the body of international law governing the application and interpretation of all EC bilateral agreements permit Israeli settlements, or any part of the Occupied Territories, to be treated as a part of the State of Israel?</p>
<p>Is the territorial clause and the obligation to apply it in certifying the origin of exports to the EC under that Agreement an essential element of the Agreement?</p>
<p>If this territorial clause and the rules of origin are being breached as a matter of official Israeli policy, what does the Council intend to do about it?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to Article 38 of the EC-Israel Interim Agreement, it applies “to the territory of the State of Israel”. In addition, Protocol 4 on Rules of Origin provides that the term “Israel” shall also cover the territorial waters, which surround Israel, and under certain conditions also some sea-vessels. No further definition of that notion is contained in the agreement. The EC has always considered that the agreement applies solely to the territory of the State of Israel within its internationally recognised borders in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions. This issue is thus linked to the final settlement of the Middle East Peace Process.</p>
<p>Responsibility for monitoring the implementation of all international agreements entered into by the Community lies with the Commission. This applies also to the Agreements concluded with Israel and with the PLO.</p>
<p>In a Communication, which was also addressed to the European Parliament, of May 1998, the Commission pointed out the following: “Evidence suggests that the practice of exporting Palestinian products as “made in Israel” under Israeli certificates of origin applies to a substantial proportion of total exports into the EC of Palestinian originating products”.</p>
<p>The Council took note of this Communication and considered that these issues should be resolved on a technical level in a constructive dialogue with Israel. It asked the Commission to report back on the outcome of its talks with the Israeli authorities and to keep it fully and promptly informed of all relevant developments, including of further measures which might be under consideration.</p>
<p>Since then, the Commission held several such technical discussions and reported to Member States in the Customs Committee on a regular basis, and at a more political level last December. It appears that all these issues are still being discussed. I am sure that the Commission will also keep the European Parliament fully informed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0779"></a>

<p>The British Government is reported to be planning later this year (by amending the UK Opticians Act of 1989 through Section 60 of their proposed new Health Bill) to restrict the right to supply the public in Britain with ‘fashion contact lenses without power’ (which merely change the colour of the wearer's eyes) to sales by registered opticians only. It will, however, still be possible to purchase these products face-to-face over the counter of a fashion-house in the rest of the European Union, via mail-order or via the Internet.

<p>The honourable Member is asking whether the planned UK measure to restrict the sale to the public of “fashion contact lenses without power” by registered opticians only, is contrary to the rules of the single market. He points out that the sale of these products in the other Member States is made over-the-counter, or via mail-order or via the Internet.</p>
<p>It has to be examined, therefore, whether such a measure would infringe Article 28 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits all quantitative restrictions on imports of goods between the Member States and measures having equivalent effect.</p>
<p>The European Court of Justice in its Judgement Keck of 24 November 1993 (C-267 and 268/91) ruled that national provisions restricting or prohibiting certain selling arrangements of products, fall outside Article 28.</p>
<p>It follows from the jurisprudence of the Court (Commission v. Greece C-391/92) that measures determining by whom or where goods may be sold are considered as selling arrangements.</p>
<p>As declared in the Judgement Keck, national measures on selling arrangements do not hinder trade between Member States, so long as they apply to all relevant traders operating within the national territory and so long as they affect in the same manner, in law and in fact, the marketing of domestic products and of those of other Member States.</p>
<p>Consequently, unless there is going to be discrimination in favour of the sale of nationally produced fashion contact lenses in the UK, such provisions would escape the scope of application of Article 28 of the Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0789"></a>

<p>The Operational Programme for Afforestation under Regulation (EEC) No 2080/93 and the Operational programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-1999 provided funding for a number of measures to complement this latter programme for such activities as training (IR£ 7.054 million), afforestation of agricultural land and its maintenance, Forestry Development including Woodland Improvement, Reconstitution, Downstream Development Supports, Harvesting Equipment, Forest Roads and Research and Development from which Coillte would have benefited either directly or indirectly.

<p>Cutting the school drop-out rate is one of the main aims of the Member States' educational systems.</p>
<p>The school drop-out rate – in other words the proportion of young people aged from 18 to 24 who have completed lower secondary education or who have not attained that level and are not undergoing training – stands at 14.5% in the Community as a whole, but varies considerably from one country to the next, ranging from 6.5% to 34%.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of early school-leaving has been explored in a 1995 study entitled 'Dropping out and secondary education', produced for the Commission by the Milan-based IARD Institute.</p>
<p>In 1998, the Commission published a study on the opportunities for continuing in the educational system ('Poursuivre sa formation'), which lists and surveys the measures being implemented by the Member States to reduce the scale and consequences of early school-leaving. (These documents are available on the Commission's Europa site).</p>
<p>The employment guidelines adopted every year to give effect to the concerted employment strategy laid down at the extraordinary Luxembourg European Council in November 1997 call on the Member States to take steps to reduce the school drop-out rate. The national action plans for employment, drawn up on the basis of the guidelines, specify the measures to be taken to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>By virtue of the subsidiarity principle, educational policy matters still fall within the responsibility of the Member States. However, the Commission produces an annual report on education and employment setting out and summarising activities of the Member States intended to implement the national action plans for employment. The report serves to identify best practices such as the Irish attempts to help young people obtain qualifications.</p>
<p>The modernisation of vocational education (Austria), the growing links between school and the world of work (Finland and Luxembourg), and the implementation of the 'Invest in Youth' programme (United Kingdom) are other examples of good practice. The report has been submitted to the Ministers for Education meeting within the Council, and the Member States have been asked to consider what best practices should be adopted and how they might be disseminated.</p>
<p>Given the well-established link between early school leaving and social exclusion, this would certainly be an issue which could potentially be taken up in the context of the programme, currently in preparation by the Commission, to give effect to the provisions of Article 137 of the EC Treaty which provide for “measures designed to encourage cooperation between Member States through initiatives aimed at improving knowledge, developing exchanges of information and best practices, innovative approaches and evaluating experiences in order to combat social exclusion.”</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0802"></a>

<p>Commission Decision No 3632/ECSC on the Community rules for State aid to the coal industry stipulates that the Commission should examine the compliance of aid action, notified to it annually, with the plans for modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and reductions in activity which it authorised previously, and with the objectives of this decision.</p>
<p>The Commission can assure the honourable Member that the only purpose of this examination, which is undertaken with the utmost discipline and professionalism, is to make it possible to legislate on this aid.</p>
<p>The specific purpose of the request for information sent to the Spanish Industry Minister is to provide information for the file on the aid which the Spanish Government plans to grant its coal industry for the year. This request for information concerns the objectives included in the Spanish coal plan, drawn up jointly between the government and the trade unions, specifying that “businesses which cannot maintain their activity unaffected in the context of a reduction of the aid must follow Article 4 of the decision in order to initiate adequate processes of restructuring and rationalisation…” or that “overall aid for the operation of underground mines shall be reduced by 4% annually and aid to open-cast mines by 6% annually per business.”</p>
<p>In view of the above, the Commission considers that the information requested complies with the terms of this decision.</p>

Twenty-six judgements have been delivered; these concern, inter alia, the unjustified duration of trial proceedings and the impartiality of judges.</p>

<p>Six years after the Thessaloniki underground railway project was included in the operational programme for ‘Urban Development’ within the second CSF for Greece (1994-1999), and almost two years after the Commission’s rejection of the accusation that Community law relating to public contracts for the project in question had been breached, the Greek Government is continuing to stand in the way of the project’s completion, depriving the city of Thessaloniki of a project which is of vital importance for the region’s development.</p>
<p>In the light of this, what is the Commission’s view of the failure to complete the project? Has it been asked by the Greek Government for the commitment of appropriations from the Urban Development subprogramme for the Thessaloniki underground railway under the second CSF which is, of course, expiring? Has the transfer agreement to the second Thessaloniki underground rail contractor been registered with the Community institutions’ departments and is it consistent with the requirements of public contract-awarding and also with Community legislation? In the context of the investigations which the European Ombudsman is conducting, has the file of complaints examined concerning the Thessaloniki underground railway revealed any liability on the part of the Commission?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that, on 30 December 1999, it approved the co-financing of the Thessaloniki metro project as part of the “Community Support Framework 1994-99”, and more specifically of the operational programme “Urban Development 1994-99” for an amount of up to EUR 5.8 million to be contributed by FEDER. The amount in question should cover co-financing expenses for the preliminary works of the project for the period up to April 2000. As regards the remaining part of the project, it will, in principle, be co-financed in the context of the 'Community Support Framework 2000-2006'.</p>
<p>As regards the management of the project, it has been agreed with the Hellenic authorities that a limited share company will be created to ensure the management of the concession contract as well as any other aspect relating to the project (studies, works-complementary projects, etc.).</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to inform the honourable Member that it has not received from the Hellenic authorities a copy of the concession contract, as finally signed, for approval. In any event, such approval is not required under community legislation. However, the Commission has received a new complaint from the Macedonian Metro Consortium claiming that the concession contract, as finally signed, infringes Community rules on public procurement since it departs from the tender document requirements. The Commission is currently examining the complaint in question.</p>
<p>As for the involvement of the European Ombudsman in this case, to the Commission's knowledge, he is still considering the case and has not reached his decision thus far.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0013"></a>

<p>The Commission Delegation in Beijing, together with the Union Embassies, monitors closely the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in China. The Union has, on several occasions, and most recently in January 2000, undertaken formal démarches to express concern about reports of torture and ill-treatment of arrested followers of the Falun Gong movement, and the harshness of sentences given to these members. It has also sought information about the number of arrests of members of the Falun Gong movement. In accordance with the international human rights covenants signed by China, the Union urges Beijing to review harsh sentences imposed on Falun Gong practitioners and to ensure that safeguards of a fair trial, including adequate legal representation, are fully respected with respect to all individuals. It calls on China to comply with the provisions and the very spirit of the UN human rights covenants it has signed even before ratification occurs. The Falun Gong issue will also be raised during the next round of the human rights dialogue between China and the Union on 17 February 2000 in Lisbon.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0018"></a>

<p>In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 12 May 1998, the Commission informed the Council and Parliament that the territorial scope of the EC-Israel Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade-related matters currently in force is confined to the territory of the State of Israel. In that same Communication, the Commission also indicated that it had grounds to believe that the Interim Agreement’s Protocol on the Rules of Origin as governed by its territorial clause was being reached and that it was investigating this matter.</p>
<p>Has the Commission since confirmed that goods wholly or substantially produced in illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories have been, and are being, certified by Israel’s customs service as products of Israel and then fraudulently imported into the Community under the preferences provided for in the current EC-Israel Agreement?</p>
<p>Does the body of international law governing the application and interpretation of all EC bilateral agreements permit Israeli settlements, or any part of the Occupied Territories, to be treated as a part of the State of Israel?</p>

<p>Since the May 1998 Commission communication, there have indeed been further indications that products which could have been produced in Israeli settlements may have been irregularly exported to the Community under the preferences established in the EC-Israel Agreement. As the honourable Member may know, the agreement establishes a verification procedure for cases of this kind, with checks carried out by Member States customs authorities. At this stage, it has not been possible to determine with certitude the origin of the products concerned.</p>
<p>As already explained in the communication, Israeli settlements or occupied territories cannot be considered by the Community as part of Israeli territory for implementation of the EC-Israel Agreement. This issue is highly sensitive, in as far as it relates to the broader question of borders, to Israelis and Palestinians alike.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, the Commission has taken a number of steps to find a viable solution to this problem, with meetings at officials level in both 1998 and 1999, and with a number of ideas on how to gain clarity on the origin of export products without prejudicing the position of any of the parties.</p>
<p>These extensive efforts to find a solution to this issue have not yet yielded a satisfactory result, but discussions are still under way. It is to be hoped that the new Israeli Government, in the context of the revitalised peace-process, will be as eager as the Community to overcome these problems. Indeed, by far the best way forward for all, Israelis, Palestinians and Europeans alike, would be that a mutually satisfactory solution is found in the coming months within the framework of the permanent status negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
