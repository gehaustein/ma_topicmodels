<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicholson of Winterbourne (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, I am honoured to present the Committee on Foreign Affairs report entitled ‘Kashmir: present situation and future prospects’.</p>
<p class="contents">This report correctly contrasts the situation between the world’s largest secular democracy which has devolved structures at all levels – India, including Jammu and Kashmir – and Pakistan, which still lacks full implementation of democracy in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and has yet to take steps towards democracy in Gilgit and Baltistan. It also highlights the fact that there is considerable evidence that over many years Pakistan has provided Kashmiri militants with training, weapons, funding and sanctuary and has encouraged militants to commit atrocities on the Indian-administered side. It takes a firm line on human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also constructive as it highlights the common heritage shared by India and Pakistan, exemplified in the ancient culture of Jammu and Kashmir, and recognises and values the pluralism, multiculturalism and multi-faith nature and secular traditions of the peoples of Jammu and Kashmir, which have been kept alive in the Indian part of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an enlightened and balanced report, which denounces terrorism and those who support terrorism; it promotes a vision of peace, coexistence, friendship and economic integration and commerce between peoples on both sides of the border and in Gilgit and Baltistan along the lines of the European Union model.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge this House to adopt it in its entirety, with certain amendments, so that an unambiguous message is sent to the disturbers of peace in that part of the world that the international community will not tolerate extremism or terrorism any more and that we respect and uphold the rights and ethnicity of the Kashmiri people.</p>
<p class="contents">I have with me a strong statement – of this morning – by Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, Chairperson of the Pakistan People’s Party, in which she welcomes this report for drawing attention to the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people; for reaffirming the EU’s commitment to the settlement of dispute by peaceful means; for taking note of the impact of the earthquake and urging the European Union to help and support the Kashmiris; for supporting the role of the composite peace process in moving towards a durable settlement for the Kashmiris based on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights; for urging the Indian and Pakistan Governments to facilitate the ceasefire on the Line of Control by calling further on militant armed groups to enrol in a disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation process; for encouraging the Pakistan Government to transform the ceasefire in place in Siachin since 2003 into a lasting peace agreement; for urging both governments to allow international human rights organisations immediate and unrestricted access to all parts of the former princely state in order to investigate the human rights situation there; for calling on the Indian Government to put an end to all practices of extrajudicial killings, ‘disappearances’, torture and arbitrary detentions in Jammu and Kashmir; for calling on the Indian and Pakistani authorities to ease restrictions on travel between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad; for urging Pakistan to revisit its concepts of fundamental rights of freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of religious practices in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit and Baltistan; for calling for the first-ever elections to be held in Gilgit and Baltistan and for seeking higher democratic representation in the Northern Areas. She firmly supports this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am proud to inform the House that Imran Khan MP, former captain of the Pakistan cricket team and now head of his political party Tehreek-e-Insaaf, today pledged his full support for this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The plight of the Kashmiri people has been of concern to the international community for nearly 60 years. The European Union strongly supports regional integration, trade liberalisation and economic cooperation. The European Parliament is keenly interested in all aspects of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me draw your attention to the hundreds of young people who demonstrated in favour of this report, calling for the democratic freedoms that we recommend. They were beaten up by the police, their banners and petitions to the UN were destroyed. They demonstrated again. Two hundred of their relatives were kidnapped and have not been heard of since. Subsequently, many thousands of citizens of Azad Jammu and Kashmir have held meetings and pledged their full support for the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the border in Jammu and Kashmir, India continues to be criticised for her large military presence. The report is strong on human rights in Jammu and Kashmir, as in the other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In Gilgit and Baltistan, the people are kept in poverty, illiteracy and backwardness.</p>
<p class="contents">The report makes clear its support for the current peace process. It recognises the ancient and unique heritage of the Kashmiri people. It reflects many principles of the European Union. I earnestly hope that this House will support the report as wholeheartedly during the vote today as it was supported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Benita Ferrero-Waldner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, I followed with great interest the very lively debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Kashmir report by Baroness Nicholson. There is much food for thought in this report. It is too comprehensive for me to be able to respond in detail today, but I should like to reflect on some of the issues which it raises.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus on Kashmir is timely. On the political front, there have been many positive developments, which, for the first time in many years, give some hope that this long-standing issue is getting closer to a solution. Both India and Pakistan have indicated that the Line of Control could become a ‘soft border’.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has expressed its firm support for the reconciliation process between India and Pakistan. But the road is still full of pitfalls. It is encouraging that the composite dialogue process remains on track despite terrorism. I was in Delhi when the terrible attacks on the daily Lahore-Samjhota Express train took place last February.</p>
<p class="contents">It would indeed be tragic if the peace process could be taken hostage by terrorists. I see no alternative to both countries addressing their differences through dialogue. This will, hopefully, lead eventually to settlement of all bilateral issues. I also feel it is important that the Kashmiris themselves have become more involved in the arrangements for the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words about the terrible earthquake that struck Kashmir on the morning of 8 October 2005 and which, as Baroness Nicholson’s report describes, had a devastating impact on the lives of the Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control, especially in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the North West Frontier Province. I had the opportunity to visit the earthquake-affected areas in person when I visited Pakistan to represent the European Commission at the earthquake reconstruction conference in November that year.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission responded to this tragedy by providing humanitarian aid of EUR 48 million and by committing, in December 2005, a EUR 50 million programme on ‘Earthquake Recovery and Reconstruction support to Pakistan’, which covers rehabilitation of education and health facilities in the affected areas, an emergency education programme and community-based livelihood recovery schemes. Thus, we are aiming to do what the report recommends, namely help the most vulnerable and restore economic activities in the affected area.</p>
<p class="contents">This earthquake response comes in addition to other development programmes in Pakistan under our country strategy. Although the Commission has been quick to react to this challenge, I nevertheless expect that the reconstruction effort will still take a number of years. The Commission’s reconstruction programme will be implemented over a period of five years.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Northern Areas of Pakistan are concerned, the Commission has been active there over many years in developing human resources especially, in improving the public school system and in cooperating with the Aga Khan Education Services. While implementing our programmes there, we have ensured that all communities – and government schools – benefit from project activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I conclude, I would like to thank Baroness Nicholson for the encouraging words she found to recognise the work of the Commission’s delegations in Islamabad and New Delhi. This is much appreciated.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to add that I would have loved to have stayed for the whole debate but, as communicated, I have to leave before the end due to long-standing commitments which I could not alter after Parliament’s change to the agenda, but my colleague Mrs Grybauskaitė will take over and stay on in the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I strongly support the Nicholson report, and I congratulate the rapporteur on its content and quality, after considerable rebalancing during the committee stage, both in tone and in terms of its approach. The report is accurate and primarily recognises that current ongoing bilateral confidence-building talks between the Indian and Pakistani Governments remain the best strategy to achieve a just and enduring peace between these two nuclear-armed states. My British colleague, Mr Bushill-Matthews, who alone voted against it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, informs me that he will now be supporting the report, which indicates how it has progressed during its various stages.</p>
<p class="contents">Mercifully, since the agreed ceasefire on 25 November 2003, we are now witnessing one of the most peaceful periods in terms of military action since the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war: a ceasefire that has survived serious provocations to the Government of India, including the Mumbai terrorist bombings. Nevertheless, Kashmiri Pandits still continue to claim that cross-border infiltrating terrorists are attempting a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the local Hindu population, albeit it on a vastly reduced scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the report rightly calls for restraint by the Indian military, with full respect by the security forces for human rights, the wellbeing of civilian populations and observance of issued court orders.</p>
<p class="contents">The report highlights the lack of genuine democracy in Azad Kashmir and, in particular, for the first time, the plight of the inhabitants of Gilgit-Baltistan. There are also general concerns expressed in AJK over a number of issues, including women’s rights and religious minority rights. I, and many colleagues, warmly welcomed in 2005 the launching of a bus service across the line of control between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad allowing divided families to be reunited after nearly 60 years, and it is my hope that, eventually, the borders, including the line of control, will be just a line on the map and become increasingly irrelevant.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the EU have already proved this with our four freedoms of movement of people, goods, services and capital. A similar future vision of a south-Asian economic community by 2025 will require free trade across the line of control. Both India and Pakistan, much to their credit, cooperated positively after the October Kashmir earthquake to provide humanitarian aid to thousands of victims and displaced people. But much remains to be done to resettle the displaced populations permanently.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s role, in my opinion, is to support a peaceful settlement of the problem over the former princely state, with the EU willing to act as an honest broker for peace, but only if both sovereign governments ask for our help, as, ultimately, we regard the Kashmir dispute as a bilateral matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to repeat my appeal to all parties that support the militants waging a violent Jihad to stop their activities immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This very much reminds me of the dispute between Germany and France over the Alsace–Lorraine region – where this sitting is being held. Three wars were waged in this region, too – but Germany and France decided after the Second World War to put an end to the confrontation and make cooperation the maxim of their policy. The successes of this policy can be seen in the European Union today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group in the European Parliament would like to see India and Pakistan, too, moving on from confrontation and making cooperation the maxim of their policy. People in the Kashmir region would benefit tremendously and the whole region would blossom. I believe SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) has the potential to be a similar success story to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, peace thrives best where democracy prevails. In this report, we are very critical of the absence of democracy – the democratic deficits – in the Kashmir region, and also of the many human rights violations. People are suffering on both sides of the Line of Control. All parties involved are called on, therefore, to introduce democracy and respect for human rights there once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see that there is a tremendous amount of violence there – consisting of violence within the region and also infiltration from outside – and 80 000 people have lost their lives. There must be an end to the arrival of violent groups in the region from across the border. Naturally, we call on the military, too, to respect human rights. We also call on human rights commissions to penalise, including in court, violations of this kind taking place in both countries. It is unacceptable that people are being kidnapped, tortured and killed with impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the EU should support the region’s environmental and economic rehabilitation. Excellent work has been done there in the field of humanitarian aid, as I have been able to see with my own eyes. This commitment must continue. This report is evidently the first in the world to deal with Kashmir. I wish to thank the rapporteur for her courage in including quite a few things in her report. We have been struggling over this for months. I believe that this report will help the people in the region and also assist the India-Pakistan peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that she was under all sorts of pressures but that she was able to withstand them. I am aware that it is not easy for a British deputy to free herself from domestic political considerations, and that she was successful in doing so. Therefore she deserves all our respect, and I support the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is taking on a serious commitment to repair the damage caused by the earthquake in Kashmir. We have agreed to provide support in the amount of EUR 100 million, and in the coming years will be offering 200 million to Pakistan and 470 million in the form of development aid. This means that we have a moral basis for expressing an opinion on these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all very concerned that on both sides of the ‘Line of Control’ serious violations of human rights have taken place. But it is very encouraging that Prime Minister Singh of India has announced a policy of zero tolerance, and over the past few years there have visibly been very positive steps forward in Indian-controlled territory. We expect the same from Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">We also expect Pakistan to take much more decisive action against extremists and terrorists, and not to allow them to drift across the border into Indian-controlled territory. The conflict is not simply a question of boundaries. It cannot be resolved from one day to the next. The first prerequisite for building confidence is for the conflict to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Nicholson’s report shows that real improvement is needed in the current situation. The necessary social and economic conditions must be created. Family reunification must be made possible. Commercial ties need to be fostered, the infrastructure developed, new education institutions established and jobs created. But all this is not enough. It is necessary, but not sufficient. It is important for political dialogue to begin, with the Indian Government, the Pakistani Government and the whole spectrum of Kashmiri political life, with all those authorities that are willing to give up the use of force.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important for the Kashmiris to be involved as well in finding a solution to the problem, for there will be no durable solution to the problem in Kashmir as long as freely and democratically elected Kashmiri leaders are unable to take part. In my judgment, India has shown a high degree of flexibility in recent times, and for this reason we expect the same from Pakistan as well, since there are close ties linking us to both countries. Both countries are important partners to us, and it is in our greatest interest that the two countries finally put an end to their conflict in a peaceful, constructive manner, and that in the meantime everything be done in an atmosphere of trust and dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to thank those Members who helped steer this difficult and very controversial report clearly in the direction of a compromise, and thus helped us all make considerable progress. I do think, however, that we have some way to go in today’s vote before we have a report that – without also attracting censure from India, Pakistan or anyone else – ultimately serves our common aim of helping Kashmir to finally become a region characterised by peace, prosperity, and respect for the environment and human rights. We can make an important contribution to this today, if together we find the willpower and focus on the heart of the matter. This is a report on Kashmir, not one on India or Pakistan. We are perfectly justified in drawing up similar reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that much of the criticism levelled at India or Pakistan in the report is undoubtedly legitimate – in the case of Pakistan, in particular, much more could have been said. Yet this is not the place for a debate on Pakistan, as we are talking about Kashmir. Since time immemorial, Kashmir has been a bridging point and intersection between the Near East, Central Asia and South Asia. The region, which has even been the subject of a rock song by Led Zeppelin, can once more be a region in which people from all parts of Kashmir can live together in peace and prosperity. Let us contribute to this today. This would be the best contribution we could make towards the fight against terrorism. The region does not need more armed forces; it needs fewer arms, fewer armed forces. Parliament would then send out a signal to India and Pakistan today that they should continue to go down the route of peace; that they should do everything to increase the irrelevance of the border, so that Kashmir may one day be a region of prosperity and peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the effects this had is that all the states in a large part of South Asia were combined into one enormous British colonial empire, some parts of which were governed directly by colonial officials, and some indirectly by the successors of traditional sovereigns who had submitted to the colonial supreme authority.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1947, the future of the states formerly ruled by those sovereigns was in the hands of the sovereigns themselves. They were able to join one of the two new states that had gained independence during that year and into which the colonial empire had been carved up: India, which was large and secular and Pakistan, which, while in those days also comprising Bangladesh, was small and Islamic. The earlier states were unable to regain independence and there was no referendum about whether they wanted to join India or Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In most areas, this did not lead to any insuperable problems, for the preference of the sovereign and most inhabitants happened to coincide. Kashmir was the exception to the rule. The people would probably have opted for Pakistan, while the sovereign went for India. This goes some way to explaining the problems of the past 60 years.</p>
<p class="contents">India may be the world’s largest democracy, but that democracy is being dealt heavy blows because of the overlap with Indian territory of a large section of Kashmir. Without any majority backing from its inhabitants, Kashmir can be kept under Indian control only by the army and the police.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy there cannot function as it should under such conditions. India, being a secular democracy, has considerable advantages over Pakistan, where religious fanatics and the military have always had far too much influence. It is to precisely those benefits that India can offer that the inhabitants of Kashmir are blind.</p>
<p class="contents">In the contacts between the European Union and India, instead of sweeping this problem under the carpet, we should draw attention to it, and it was this idea that I found absent from the rapporteur’s original text, which was very much focused on three components: recovery following the earthquake, cementing relations between the European Union and India and more trade and transport as means of improving relations between the leaders of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Kashmir did not, however, have any role in this. Their long-term desire for a referendum about the future, and international support for this, were explicitly omitted, although it now looks like the final result will be more balanced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that European aid be offered to all victims within Kashmir.</p>
<p class="contents">Humanitarian aid, however, does not involve political interference. The United Nations found out earlier this month how difficult aid operations are to manage in the region, when eighty-three of their staff had to be evacuated because – according to a UN spokesperson – local groups that had not managed to secure reconstruction projects had been pitting the people against them.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is also right to note that the European Union has not been asked to act as an external mediator in the Kashmir conflict, although the space given in the report to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is in stark contrast with this view. The EU should not lose sight of the value of international intervention, aid and mediation. It is an omission that this value should be given such scant attention in this report.

It is important that the channels of communications between all interested parties are opened, and indeed kept open.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I might touch on one of its many aspects, that being the problem of terrorism. It is a fact that many acts of terrorism are committed by groups that either operate from Pakistan, or are supported by it, Lashkar e-Taiba and Hizb ul-Mujahideen being two examples. President Musharraf has on several occasions committed himself to tackling the problem of terrorism, but I am afraid that he has a long way to go yet.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said of the extreme Islamism that is promoted on a large scale via the notorious schools called madrassas. If Pakistan does not manage to get this problem under control, the peace process is bound to founder in the longer term. This is why the European Union should no longer content itself with promises from Pakistan; it should also expect concrete action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the culmination of a long process which started in March 2000 when the House voted overwhelmingly for a factual report on the question of Kashmir. It has thus become not just a British problem, but is seen increasingly as a European one, as our debate this morning shows. We have had vigorous discussions in committee and we now have a more balanced report than when we started out this morning. Some 450 amendments have been tabled, around 180 of those amendments have now been included in this document and so there has been a substantial revision.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still some areas where I remain unhappy, in particular regarding Amendment 21 which refers to the question of machine-readable Pakistan passports. I understand there is no such concern in AJK. We have to be careful to keep the report factual. There are, however, three amendments in particular to which I would like to draw colleagues’ attention and which I shall be supporting. The first is tabled by Mr Tannock on behalf of my group – and I thank him for having done so – where in order to create an atmosphere of confidence and goodwill it is vital to remove all obstructions and hindrances for all Kashmiris to travel freely in the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this particularly relates to the financial aspects of the earthquake. We all know what terrible suffering there was. There has been a request for further funds from the Government of Azad Kashmir, but I understand that they have not yet had a full reply, therefore Amendment 41 is asking for a clear reply from the Commission so that we know what we have to do in budgetary terms. The last aspect refers to demilitarisation and that is why we have tabled Amendment 55 together with Mrs Lambert.</p>
<p class="contents">The article in <span class="italic">The Economist</span> of 7 April was very clear and I commend it to the House. It says that there are three fundamental reasons why we should now be pressing for demilitarisation. First, the present numbers are not needed. We now have a process of nearly three years of a ceasefire and the dangers of militancy have significantly decreased. Second, this would be hugely popular in Kashmir where, to quote from <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, there is an alienation ‘from Indian rule which runs deep, the withdrawal of the army would be widely seen not as a removal of a protective shield but as a lifting of an oppressive curse’. Third, withdrawing troops from Kashmir would be a great boost to the painstaking rapprochement between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to draw attention, as one or two other colleagues have done, to the work of my colleague Mr Bushill-Matthews. I will be voting in favour of this report because it has a positive message of shining a light on the problems which are faced on a daily basis by the people of Jammu and Kashmir. We should keep that spotlight shining brightly and we should associate everybody possible with the process to find a resolution to the problem for the Kashmiri people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our own Labour amendments to this report concentrated on advancing the withdrawal of troops on both sides, extending development aid, encouraging the practical involvement of the Kashmiri people themselves: balanced, constructive, diplomatic in our approach.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was in Kashmir in March at the same time as the Commissioner, I saw an AJK more open than ever before; the Indians willing to talk with the secessionists and both governments optimistic about their composite dialogue and when that bomb on a train from New Delhi to Lahore killed 68 people in February, the politics of blame was replaced by a mutual solidarity to defeat the terrorists who had planted it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the support the Liberal Democrat rapporteur claims for her report this morning is possible only because at parliamentary committee level we defeated her proposals to cut off trade relations with one side, not the other; to provide economic aid on one side only; to overturn the UN resolution in favour of self-determination; and, most offensive of all, to score political points about the sixth worst earthquake in the history of humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">I note today the Liberal Democrat Amendment 58 to blame one side for preventing a plebiscite and the Conservative Amendment 5 to resist a plebiscite in the future. Labour and Socialist MEPs will oppose both.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, I regret to say we have seen a rapporteur who claimed to uphold the principle of <span class="italic">primum non nocere</span> – do no harm – yet she has done only harm. I caution others in this debate and in our vote: do not speak today for India or for Pakistan; speak for Europe, for peace and for human rights and you will do a greater service for the people of Kashmir and for the honour of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In October 2005 the catastrophic earthquake opened the eyes of the world to the desperate plight of the Kashmiri people. This tragedy offered India and Pakistan a window of opportunity to make peace out of disaster. It also gave the international community the prospect of engaging in a previously closed region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has stressed that India and Pakistan must find a durable settlement for Jammu and Kashmir which takes into account the wishes of all the people of Kashmir. This is a just and responsible approach and one which this House must follow if it is to contribute constructively to the Kashmir debate.</p>
<p class="contents">As Liberals, whose forefathers shaped the concept, my group’s passion must be self-determination, self-determination and self-determination. It is an absolute right enshrined by the UN and respected and protected by the European Union. It is a democratic process that as a House we have a duty to support.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must support the positive ideas now coming forward – systems of self-governance, making borders irrelevant, and joint management across the Line of Control. It is not for us to take any options off the table. We must, however, insist that they are explored through full consultation with the Kashmiris and, if the conditions are right, we must support their desire to determine their destiny through a democratic plebiscite. With a history of human rights abuses, a sustainable solution is impossible without ending impunity and ensuring that human rights are the building blocks of peace. India and Pakistan are now both members of the UN Human Rights Council. With membership comes a responsibility to lead.</p>
<p class="contents">Women and children have born the brunt of the conflict and the earthquake. Women have been widowed and children left orphaned. All are struggling to rebuild their lives. The EU, through its trade and economic relations with both India and Pakistan, must protect the most vulnerable in the short term and secure their livelihoods in the long term. The greatest tragedy of the earthquake was the loss of a whole generation of Kashmiris. We must mourn their deaths. For those who remain, our core goals must be peace, justice and self-determination for the generation of Kashmiris to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The environment is of common concern to peoples on whatever side of the Line of Control, and can be a valuable peace-builder.

Throughout the years, the conflict in Kashmir has left thousands of victims in its wake, including thousands of victims torn from their families and thousands of others forced to leave their country to seek a better life elsewhere. Therefore, I believe we can all agree that the time has come for the European Union to do all it can to seek a long-term solution that is devoid of violence - one that is beneficial to all those involved. Surely everyone will accept that after years of insecurity, spilt blood and unfulfilled promises this is no easy task, even though there may seem to be consensus on an official level. Yet, we must ensure that what we have achieved up till now is not lost, and we must also see to it that permanent dialogue between India and Pakistan is given our full support and assistance. Both India and Pakistan must be given the chance to persevere with their confidence-building measures and to continue to allow people to cross control lines. This step was greatly welcomed after so many years of division. I am certain that the European Union will lend all its support to any initiative that could bring about peace, even if this could turn out to be a slow and lengthy process. As the Commissioner said, we must ensure, on a humanitarian basis, that people in refugee camps are provided with all the humanitarian aid they require, especially following the devastating earthquake that left so many people in a desperate plight. Aid has to be increased and the camps that have been in existence for so long must be given some form of official status. I strongly appeal to all Indian and Pakistani authorities to honour their obligations and to bestow upon the Kashmiri population the dignity it deserves, because every single person in the world has a right to such dignity. Last but not least; I believe we need to take action in order to protect the unique history of this people. The Indian, Pakistani and Kashmiri population must focus on the factors that bind them together. It is only in this way that the peace process can be successful. Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for all the work she has put in to making this report a successful one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When I led a delegation to Pakistan last December, this report was raised with us almost everywhere, and, having followed the progress of the report closely, I do not underestimate the challenges there have been in bringing the basic facts about these issues into the open. I am sure that, in time, it will become an authoritative report on the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, have visited one part of divided Kashmir and empathise with the plight of the Kashmiri people, especially following the tragic impact of the earthquake. This report has also brought out into the open for the first time the conditions prevailing, not only in Kashmir but also in the northern areas. Whilst in Pakistan, I met many people who expressed a strong desire for greater democracy and a greater voice. Therefore, I hope one outcome of this report will be more democracy and greater democratic structures, especially in Gilgit and Baltistan, in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues that has most divided the Members of this House has been the question of a plebiscite. However, I welcome the consensus that has now developed on this issue in the report, and it is important to remember that the UN resolution that called for a plebiscite to be held clearly stated that it should happen only when the conditions have been met. It is therefore unfortunate that the conditions under which this might happen have not been met so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Having chaired the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia and the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation, and now the Delegation for relations with India, I recognise that this issue has hindered proper development between neighbouring countries and the region as a whole. Therefore, I strongly welcome the confidence-building measures that both India and Pakistan have committed themselves to in the past few years. I urge them to continue along this track with soft borders and more trade, because this has already paid dividends as regards regional prosperity, and I sincerely hope it will eventually lead to improvements on all fronts for the people of Kashmir. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report is not about India and it is not about Pakistan. I am pleased that the report was amended substantially in committee. I have, however, sought to amend it further and many of the amendments tabled by my group – though not all – are the ones I hope you can vote for.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 18 calls for the Kashmiri people to exercise their right to self-determination through a plebiscite in the future. This, to my mind, is the bottom line. I believe all people should have a right to determine their own destiny. This is what the Kashmiri people have been calling for for many years. Sixty years ago the resolutions were passed by the UN and they still have not been brought into effect. How can we be so selective about which UN resolutions we adhere to? I would like us, however, to go further and for any plebiscite to have the three options: governed by India, governed by Pakistan or independence. Hence Amendment 57.</p>
<p class="contents">Another concern I have about this report, although it is now much better than it was, is that it seems to be concentrating a great deal on the shortcomings of the Pakistan Government within Pakistan, rather than taking a balanced approach relating to both India and Pakistan’s failures in Jammu and Kashmir generally.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must build on the positive steps taken by both India and Pakistan and not undermine them. However, no solution can be achieved without the Kashmiri people having the final say themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The civilian population has been in a difficult situation for many years and has received virtually no aid or protection from the international community. There is almost continuous fighting in Kashmir. Human rights organisations report that, since the Mujahadin insurrection in 1989, over 30 000 civilians have died in Kashmir.</p>
<p class="contents">Kashmir should weigh heavily on our consciences. All European democracies that pride themselves on a tradition of dialogue and freedom, especially concerning matters of faith, seem not to notice or to ignore the tragedy facing the civilian population in Kashmir. The European Union has to take part in spreading and promoting democracy by all possible means, especially in areas which have been affected by armed religious or racial conflict for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, in view of the talks that are being held between India and Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir and which are, unfortunately, unlikely to end in success, we need the European Union to show a strong will to support the civilian population in Kashmir. We need the European Union to show the same sort of active attitude in supporting the peace process in Asia as it did when it backed the Orange Revolution and supported Aleksander Milinkiewicz by awarding him the Sacharov Prize.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that Asia will be the European Union’s most important partner in the future, thanks to its natural resources and manpower. Ignoring conflicts is a sign of ignorance and foolishness, something we cannot afford in the twenty-first century, knowing that weapons of mass destruction may be used in these conflicts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

India, Pakistan and Kashmir do not constitute a traditional issue for me as a Swedish Social Democrat and Member of the European Parliament, but I felt very committed when I read the first draft and heard different parties’ representatives, mainly from the United Kingdom, engage in debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task is not to live in the past or to adopt a position in favour of, or against, India and Pakistan. We have a responsibility for what is happening in Kashmir and for the human rights situation there. Our task as Members of the European Parliament is to see if we might play a role of some kind and then to offer our support and experience and in that way help resolve the conflict surrounding Kashmir.</p>
<p class="contents">What is going on, and has been going on for such a long time, is a scandal. I believe that two civilised countries such as India and Pakistan should be able to take greater shared responsibility, devise a timetable for achieving practical results and, naturally, help each other to combat terrorism. If that does not happen, the United Nations and the European Union will have to intervene more seriously than in the past. The EU’s strategy is to exert pressure via agreements, aid and contacts. I should have liked us to have gone further and been prepared to support a referendum, but I appreciate that we are not yet in a position to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">Kashmir’s wishes must be our guide in our future work and a guide for all those who wish to accept responsibility for the region. I want to call on everyone to think in terms not of prestige but of peace and in terms not of history but of the present and future. As Mr Leinen said, if France and Germany were able to create peace in Europe and found the EU, I am convinced that India and Pakistan have it within them successfully to bring about freedom and peace in Kashmir. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have not had any additional claim from either government for additional resources, but we are open to discussing this in due course if such requests come.</p>

On behalf of the Commission, and replacing my colleague, Commissioner Dimas, who is unable to participate today because of serious health problems, I would like to make a presentation on the situation and to explain why the Commission applied to the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Polish authorities gave the green light to the construction of the Augustów bypass, which cuts through the unique Rospuda valley in a forested Natura 2000 site, despite the initiation of previous infringement procedures. A letter of formal notice, covering the Augustów bypass among other things, was addressed to Poland on 15 December 2006, while the decision authorising the start of the works was issued by the Polish authorities on 2 and 9 February 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The Rospuda valley is the last peat bog system of its kind in Europe. Therefore, the Commission is of the opinion that, if the project is executed in its current form, it would be in breach of the directives on birds and habitats. On 28 February 2007, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion on an urgent basis requesting Poland to comply with EC environmental law within a week. Having found the response of the Polish authorities unsatisfactory, the Commission decided on 21 March to refer the case to the Court of Justice. The decision provides for a request for interim measures, which means the suspension of construction works until the judgment of the main case is delivered, in order to avoid irreversible damage to the Natura 2000 site concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, let me say to my Polish friends that this is not an issue which is getting at Poland. There are many Member States who have been subject to pressure from Parliament and the Commission when a development proposal is potentially damaging to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I think in this case, though, we have a serious case which is going to be a test of will of the Commission, of the policy and certainly of this Parliament too. We have irreversible damage in prospect for the habitats of a large number of species from eagles to woodpeckers, to capercaillie, wolves and lynx. I welcome the Commission taking the steps of going to the ECJ and I certainly welcome the subsequent decision to seek a special procedure from the ECJ to make an order urgently requiring Poland to stop the works pending the proper full decision. That is sensible. The ECJ President granted that on 18 April and I hope that is a very strong message to the Polish authorities who are involved with this scheme. But regrettably, it appears that Poland is ignoring that and proceeding, at least in part, with construction works for two of the projects in north-east Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">So my request to the Commission is to insist that we look seriously at alternative routes, because we believe, and my committee believes, that there are alternatives which would be much better for the environment. We believe that they must be fully explored, they must use the strategic environmental assessment principles and that only if those are complied with should we agree to this road corridor proceeding.</p>

<p class="contents">With its environmental directives, including the Habitat Directive and the Bird Directive, the European Union has made a vital step towards the sustainable development of our continent. The directives are a great success. The areas where they apply often form part of Europe’s Natura 2000 network, which network of protected nature conservation sites located in the Member States is at the heart of the EU’s environmental policy and of the preservation and recovery of biodiversity. They give the protection of nature and the environment an enormous boost.</p>
<p class="contents">In some cases, this goes against the local and national grain. Politicians easily yield to pressure on the basis of short-term economic interests, instead of standing up courageously for a clean environment for the sake of future generations. </p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the Via Baltica is of major economic importance. This is beyond dispute. Moreover, it is essential to open up Northern and Eastern Europe, and to link up the Baltic states with the west of Europe. Increased prosperity and wellbeing in Poland are in the interest of the whole of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why billions of euros from the Structural Funds are being invested in that country, and everyone will understand that the residents of the city of Augustov are keen to see the end of the dangerous, noisy traffic pollution caused by lorries. </p>
<p class="contents">Traffic will need to be diverted away from the city centre. At what cost, though? The Rospuda valley is a unique area, a special protection zone under the Birds Directive, and it should, on account of its extraordinary value, also fall within the scope of the Habitat Directive. Poland has enormous natural resources, with a landscape of outstanding natural beauty. It is these resources that hold the key to Poland’s economic future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, we faced a similar situation not so long ago, with the construction – that was subsequently turned down – of a new motorway cutting across some of the Naardermeer, the Naardermeer being the oldest nature conservation site in our country which falls within the scope of the European Birds Directive. This situation was comparable to the Polish nature conservation area where the Via Baltica is planned. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was right to warn the Polish Government against the construction of this section of the motorway. As a European Member State, Poland has the duty to protect the Rospuda valley, and, whilst it has proposed measures that are intended to compensate for the destruction of part of the nature conservation area, this compensation is inadequate. </p>
<p class="contents">The study into possible alternative routes has not been carried out fully. There are other routes conceivable that could prevent irreparable damage being done to the area.</p>
<p class="contents">In mid-June, this House’s Committee on Petitions will be sending out an inquiry mission that will be looking into the complaints by Polish citizens who do not want to see the valley destroyed. </p>
<p class="contents">Although we will hear all parties and weigh up all arguments, one thing will be paramount: that the Via Baltica should not be allowed to damage one of Europe’s most attractive nature conservation sites. The construction of this road should not contravene European environmental laws which Poland has also signed. <span class="italic">Pacta sunt servanda</span>: treaties are there to be complied with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first point of view is a practical one, involving the people who live there and who use those roads. It is not only Poles who are affected, but also the inhabitants of the Baltic states and Scandinavia. It is a real problem which we cannot ignore. Many people die on these roads. These people have a right to roads that are built to the highest standard possible and they have a right to travel in comfort and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue at stake here is that of the authorities taking responsibility for decisions that they make. It is not true, in spite of attempts to prove to the contrary, that there is no alternative route. There is an alternative. It is possible and practical to implement and needs only the necessary political will. In Poland, this issue has been debated for many years. We, together with a group of Members of the European Parliament, drew attention to this problem last year when we tabled a question to the Commission and appealed to the Polish Government to stop this project from going ahead, as it would be a good idea for the project to already comply with European standards at the planning stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that of lessons learnt. This is the first case of its kind in Poland, and sets a precedent. We, as Members of the European Parliament, and the European institutions should take care to ensure that, for the good of citizens and in order to improve their safety, all Member States plan their investment projects properly, in line with European Union directives and environmental protection standards.</p>
<p class="contents">This can be achieved. There are no contradictions. This lesson has to be very effective. We, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, therefore strongly support a solution that will allow the Via Baltica to be built as soon as possible. However, this solution also needs to quickly lead to a breakthrough based on the fact that it is pointless to insist on bad decisions that damage the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I would like to say that, on becoming acquainted with the history of this section of road, it certainly seems to me, as a Latvian citizen, that it has been known for several years that this stretch of road was going to be built. It is possible that the agreement of the Natura 2000 territories by the previous Polish Government was perhaps not conducted in the best manner. As a result, however, this delay is causing not only residents of Poland to suffer, particularly those in the eastern region, who may use this stretch of road every day, but also three entire European Union Member States — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — and not only citizens travelling to the European Union but also a large section of industry, since 4 500 lorries pass through the town of Augustów daily via this stretch of road. I would really very much like a compromise to be reached that would not further delay the already delayed construction of this road. It worries me that these three Baltic States are in fact not connected with the European Union via a normal, modern highway. These three Baltic States are not connected with the European Union through Poland by rail, since it seems that the <span class="italic">Rail Baltica</span> section in this region will encounter the same difficulties in complying with environmental requirements. Nor are these three Baltic States even connected with the European electricity market at the Poland-Lithuania border. So I call on the Commission and all other parties, including the Polish Government, which can reach these decisions within a reasonable length of time, to reflect upon this issue not only from the viewpoint of Poland and Europe’s environmental needs, but also from the point of view of the interests of these three European Union Member States. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">European environmental legislation must be applied. The directive on natural habitats is there to be applied. The way we deal with this issue will be crucial. We must either take Community law seriously, and take the application and use of European funds for great infrastructures seriously, or the whole thing will gradually become pointless.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had the pleasure of visiting the beautiful and unique area of the Rospuda Valley, and I can state that this project is absurd. It is also practically impossible from a technical point of view, given the marsh area that it has to cross. At the same time, I can state that there are clear alternatives which are more viable, more economical and which could serve the same purpose as this road.</p>
<p class="contents">People suffering from lorry traffic in Eastern Poland, in Augustów, are hostages to the political game being played by the Polish Government in relation to other issues. It is a political challenge to the European Commission, which is combined with other political issues. It is the inhabitants of the area and nature that are going to suffer as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the alternatives to this road which runs through the forest have the support of the preliminary study, the strategic environmental study, carried out by the Scott Wilson consultancy, which is a highly prestigious international consultancy. It is not true, therefore, that the option of this road via the Via Baltica through the Rospuda Valley is the only possibility. Not at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The seriousness of this Parliament and the seriousness of European environmental legislation is at stake. I hope that the European Commission will stand firm, and that means not sending any more regional funds until Poland realises that being part of the European club means obeying the rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this railway network has, in the last 15 years, been pared down, and there have been cutbacks also in the maintenance of it. Moreover, in many cases, the old railway companies have not received from the state the compensation they thought they could count on beforehand for their operating shortages, and this has the effect of deterring new enterprises that would otherwise be keen to take part in tenders, and so the likelihood is that the railway network will be used less and less and that rolling stock will become unusable.</p>
<p class="contents">These countries once had a huge head start over the west of Europe in the area of rail transport, but it has thus been lost, and their environment is particularly vulnerable too.</p>
<p class="contents">Fewer tracks does not mean less traffic. In order to channel this traffic elsewhere, all attention is now focused on investments in motorways. Roads like these were around 15 years ago, except that they were limited to the busiest routes, particularly around the big cities. New roads of this sort will now be built very quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">In an effort to limit costs, the interests of nature and the landscape are often overlooked. The shortest possible route cutting through areas considered empty is preferred, and there is no money for diversions, tunnels or bridges for wildlife.</p>
<p class="contents">Poland is not the first, or only, country to face this problem. The same thing occurred years ago in the Czech Republic, which planned a connection from Prague to Dresden and also in Bulgaria when a link was planned between Sofia and Thessaloniki.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which valuable nature conservation areas are handled does not only make the national, but also international, news, as international nature and environmental organisations draw attention to this. They also point out that the European Union is partly responsible for destroying the environment if it helps to finance bad projects of this kind. I have been urging the European Union to refuse any responsibility in this matter for years.</p>
<p class="contents">On 2 July 2002, Commissioner Wallström stated by way of response to my written requests that Poland should adapt its Via Baltica plans. I would remind her that, according to the original plan, the Via Baltica avoided this vulnerable area, but that these plans were subsequently reviewed in a bid to better serve other cities. What the European Union should insist on is a return to the original plan that was drawn up a long time ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These areas form part of the Natura 2000 network, which does something very important by ensuring that nature in the European Union is accorded a protected status, and, for example, by helping to maintain biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">We approved Mr Adamou’s proposal only this week, in which a stand is made for maintaining biodiversity. Moreover, the Natura 2000 status ensures that the nature conservation areas remain intact for posterity.</p>
<p class="contents">At least, that is how it should be. Not every government appears to realise this, as was evident last year. The Polish Government seeks to build the new road, the Via Baltica, right across the Natura 2000 area of the Rospuda Valley.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with a delegation of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I have visited the Rospuda valley and was able to see for myself how unique and valuable this Polish nature conservation site is. It is totally beyond me that it is the Polish Environment Minister, no less, who is in favour of this project, even though sound alternatives are available. He, of all people, should surely realise what disastrous effects this project could have.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of compensation for the construction of the road, it is intended to plant a million trees to the north of the region, despite the adverse effects this will have on nature. I know that this is a very sensitive issue in Poland. For traffic safety, it is necessary for the Via Baltica to be in place soon, provided it is tailored to regional circumstances with minimum adverse effects on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the Commission has issued warnings to the Polish Government, and that, when it received no response to its demands, it brought the matter before the European Court of Justice. It is to be hoped that the Court’s ruling of 18 April, according to which the Polish Government should stop the compensation measures with immediate effect, will be a message for the future – a message that Member States cannot simply tamper with valuable nature conservation sites. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having studied the Commission’s statistics on the subject, it is clear that a number of Member States have considerable problems related to planning infrastructure projects in the areas covered by the Natura 2000 network, namely Austria, Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the Polish Government still wants to continue the construction of the Augustów bypass which will pass through the Rospuda Valley. It argues that the decision regarding the project was made before Poland joined the European Union, when Poland was not bound by the strict requirements of the European Union directives on birds and habitats. The European Commission is accusing Poland of infringing these directives as a result of its investment in the road building project. For Poland, road safety is the argument that speaks in favour of constructing the bypass. However, the environmental criteria that need to be fulfilled in the implementation of this project, seem to have been forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in spite of the current situation, we cannot allow talks on the issue of the ring road to stall. The problem has to be solved in the form of a compromise which will be satisfactory for both sides. Both arguments, namely those concerning environmental aspects and road safety, are equally important and will affect hundreds of similar projects in Poland and elsewhere. We should make cooperation mechanisms more efficient at various levels and adapt the regulatory criteria to the current environmental and social situation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would appeal for similar requests for debate to be treated equally in the future. To this day, in spite of the support of over 60 Members, no permission has been granted for a debate on the biggest environmental threat resulting from the construction of the North European Gas Pipeline under the Baltic sea. I would like to remind you that over 10% of marine areas are part of the Natura 2000 network and no one, literally no one, has taken this issue up in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, when important areas of biodiversity are being destroyed before the very eyes of environmentalists and the whole of Europe, there seems to be no will to discuss the issue of the environmental threat to our only internal sea, namely the Baltic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the chosen construction plan for the new road, which will pass through the Rospuda Valley, will certainly have a negative impact on the ecosystem, which is unique in Europe and is located in an area that is protected by the Natura 2000 programme. Allowing the Augustów bypass to pass through the valley will cause irreparable damage to the natural environment, including the destruction of 20 000 trees and the disappearance of extremely rare plants and animal species. Sadly, we need to be aware of the fact that any alternative to the ring road will have an impact on the natural environment in that region. We should opt for the project whose negative impact on the unique fauna and flora in the Rospuda Valley will be as small as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Representatives of the Law and Justice party, which currently governs Poland, assured us before the elections that the Via Baltica, which includes the Augustów bypass, will avoid the most precious natural areas. Now they are breaking their promise. The Polish authorities have had time to reconsider the location of the bypass. However, they have ignored the environmentalists’ suggestions that changing the route of the motorway would avoid damaging the environment and would save money. The Minister for the Environment did not take advantage of opportunities to reconcile the interests of the residents of Augustów, who are campaigning for a motorway, and those who seek to protect the environment. The Polish Government is ignoring the problematic fact that this investment will be incredibly expensive and will place a large burden on the Polish taxpayers, as the European Union will not contribute to the construction of the road in an area where, according to the habitats directive, it is forbidden to destroy the environment. Moreover, given the European Commission’s negative assessment of the project, further work on the construction of the road may make Poland liable for fines amounting to millions of euros. This will be a burden which Polish taxpayers will have to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Prime Minister Kaczyński’s proposal to hold a local, regional referendum on the Augustów bypass, and its route through the Rospuda Valley, is simply a sign that the Polish Government wants to shirk its responsibility for home affairs and is an unnecessary bone of contention for Polish society. The referendum was held because local government elections were being held in the Podlasie Voivodship at the same time. However, it was obvious from the start that the result of this referendum would not be binding for the European Court of Justice, which is currently dealing with the matter. It is therefore irrelevant and these kinds of activities only serve internal political ends. In addition to this, I would like to point out that, according to Polish legislation, a referendum is only valid if the turnout is over 30% of those eligible to vote. The turnout on Sunday did not exceed this threshold.</p>
<p class="contents">The natural environment is one of our greatest treasures, and yet we do not do enough to protect it. I think that the Polish Government should make a real effort to draw up alternative solutions to the problem as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is very important to the city of Augustavas, where about 1.5 million vehicles annually drive through the centre of the city.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has appealed to the European Court of Justice against Poland's building of the Augustavas bypass on the Via Baltica, which was commenced before Poland joined the EU. The appeal is based on claims that the environmental protection requirements of the Rospuda Valley, through which the projected viaduct must pass, will be violated. The territory is protected by the Natura 2000 programme.</p>
<p class="contents">However, no such environmental protection issues have been raised concerning the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which is projected to pass through Natura 2000 territory and which may lead to unpredictable ecological consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Poland is seeking ways of solving the problem, perhaps by building a considerably more expensive tunnel. However, the people of Augustavas want to live quietly. No one is concerned about the residents suffering from pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">I have asked the Commission what solution there might be, apart from a prohibition on building the bypass, and what help Poland might get. It was explained to me that in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission is not empowered to dictate concrete solutions to Member States nor to prescribe expenditure.</p>

Indeed, it is one of the most important issues today. The natural world is an independent part of our surroundings. We did not create it and we should certainly protect it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, protecting the environment cannot become an alibi for certain small groups of environmental activists who resort to blackmailing specific regions and governments. For reasons that are rather more political than environmental, and due to expected material gains, these groups are trying to block the construction of roads, bypasses and airports. A classic example of the misuse of environmental arguments is the campaign against the construction of an airport in Świdniku, near Lublin, in Poland. The colony of marmots is the reason given. However, no mention is made of the fact that this was not their original habitat and that, according to experts, they could be safely relocated to another site.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly dubious arguments are used by environmentalists to argue against other planned investments in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Via Baltica. No mention is made of the fact that a referendum in Poland produced a definite majority in favour of the project in the region where the bypass is supposed to be built.</p>
<p class="contents">European environmental regulations cannot be applied automatically, without acknowledging that specific cases exist. We should use our common sense and not be led by ideological feelings. Use of the environment as a scarecrow could be prevented by more investment in infrastructure in the new Member States. Let us not forget that these investments really do influence peoples’ quality of life, and that their right to good quality infrastructure is at least as important as environmental considerations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a fact.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now quickly trying to make up for lost ground, although this is clearly far from easy. One of the hurdles in our path consists of environmental restrictions. We should bear in mind that when Western Europe was building roads that covered a significant proportion of its territory, no such restrictions existed on the construction of transport networks. Now, a conflict has erupted.</p>
<p class="contents">However, nature is not mute in this conflict. Various environmental groups speak on behalf of the environment. Indeed, they often speak too loudly, forgetting that man is also an important, if not the most important, part of this ecosystem. Indeed, it is man who needs to be protected, first and foremost.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that the conflict surrounding the construction work in the Rospuda Valley has escalated to such an extent and that it has become so complicated, including its political dimension. Is there a way out? Is there a sensible solution which could satisfy both sides? I am afraid that the answer is no and that the Commission has to choose. A decision has to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally think that the road should be built. However, permission for the work should include a strict list of conditions that have to be met in order to minimise damage to the environment. This is because, let us admit, losses cannot be avoided. They accompany civilisation, as progress is never free. Everything has its price. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important in terms of decreasing the temporal distance separating the Baltic states, namely Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and indirectly also Finland, from the rest of the European Union, by means of access through Poland. The benefits for the Union and for Europe seem to be significant and measurable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also aware of the very difficult situation in which the inhabitants of Augustów find themselves, as an increasingly large number of lorries, passenger vehicles and buses continues to pass through the town. Those people cannot continue to live like this. This region of Poland is very rich in natural resources: flora, fauna, lakes, forests and the entire landscape. Any road in this area will have a negative impact on the environment. However, it is simply impossible to avoid this region altogether. The road will give Europeans access to these landscapes and bring them closer, while not building the road will mean that the region will remain an inaccessible fortress.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the fact that the current Polish Government’s stance has sometimes been less than professional, I would like to ask the Commission to take these aspects into account. It is possible and necessary for the Commission and the Polish Government to effectively seek a solution that will be beneficial to the Union, the citizens and bring relief to both the inhabitants of Augustów and the drivers of the vehicles passing through the area, without causing too much damage to the environment. During the mid-1990s, I was the Minister of Transport in Poland. I supported the project then, as I thought that it was necessary. Today, I continue to support the construction of the Via Baltica. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is environmental and the other is political.</p>
<p class="contents">The worst thing in this case is that the European Commission has also become involved in local electoral conflicts. I would like to take this opportunity to mention the fact that the European Commission has recently become too frequently and unnecessarily involved in matters which fall within the remit of Polish national and local government. That is why we will soon be hearing a lot about the E-19 road.</p>
<p class="contents">This begs the question: what does the Commission want? In Poland, people say that it wants to block resources allocated to Poland for the construction of motorways. Perhaps it would be better for the Commission to deal with issues such as GMOs in Europe, as this is the reason why we are facing the threat of an environmental and biological disaster, or perhaps the Schmidt farms, whose increasing pollution of the environment continues to go unpunished. There is much to do and there is no need to interfere with those who are doing an honest job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current state of the road is so appalling that residents have dubbed it the ‘road of death’. In 2006 alone, 14 people died and 25 were injured on that stretch of road near the small town of Augustów. Postponing the construction of the road by three to five years, as this is the minimum amount of time that the Court will need to deal with the case, and perhaps having to start from scratch with the investment process, may lead to another 40 to 70 deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the noise pollution created by the thousands of lorries which pass through Augustów and the potentially lethal threat of accidents involving lorries transporting dangerous goods through built-up areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The habitats directive permits investment in projects on Natura 2000 land in exceptional circumstances, if compensation is offered. Last Sunday, nearly 92% of local residents voted in a referendum in favour of the designated new route. Is this stance on the part of the residents not enough reason to withdraw the case filed at the European Court of Justice?</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission does not decide to withdraw its complaint, it will show that it has not been able to fairly balance the opinions of a small but significant minority in the Directorate-General for the Environment, environmental groups and eco-terrorists, as well as the expectations and needs of the inhabitants, which both the mayor and the Marshall of the Voivodship presented to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, if the alternative methods for building a bridge across the Rospuda Valley do not satisfy the Commission, a serious conflict may erupt, which threatens to permanently paralyse and block the road that is currently used. In view of how determined the local residents are, and I know that they are because I, unlike the others here, actually live in that area, anything is possible. If the aforementioned road is not going to be built soon, we should perhaps consider opening negotiations with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, with a view to diverting transit traffic from the Baltic states through these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Historically, this has, for us, been an important connection with European countries, and it must be developed so that it becomes quick and safe. Today it is neither.</p>
<p class="contents">This spring, for instance, it took more than 12 hours to get from Tallinn to Warsaw by car, and this is not as it should be. Thus we wholeheartedly welcome the opportunities offered by the Tenth Framework Programme for the construction of the motorway.

I would like to reiterate the importance of all connecting links between the Member States of the European Union – whether they be roads, railways or power lines.

It has even forced a local referendum, which it is difficult to view as anything other than an attempt to use the issue of the route of the Via Baltica for their own purposes as the referendum took place at the same time as the regional elections. Furthermore, the referendum is not binding either for the European Court of Justice or even for the Polish authorities.</p>

It entered into force in Portugal in March 1981.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the vulnerability of many species, CITES is of acute importance.

<p class="contents">I voted in favour, since the rapporteur has done a difficult and necessary job on an issue that is crucial in terms of achieving the Lisbon objectives, but which we have yet to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to become an advanced knowledge-based society, not only do we have to be strong on technological research and development, that is to say on our capacity to generate, absorb, assimilate and communicate new knowledge and capacities to society and to companies, but we also have to be strong on the capacity to convert this knowledge into wealth and social well-being. That is innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all of the EU’s countries are at the same level in terms of the indicators defining a knowledge-based society, nor in terms of innovation efforts. Reducing these differences would benefit everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">Innovation is probably the only instrument that can enable us, within a reasonable space of time, to achieve such important objectives as:</p>
<p class="contents">1) Improving the quality and competitiveness of our companies;</p>
<p class="contents">2) Making economic growth compatible with preserving the environment, and with quality of life and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">3) Innovation makes it possible to maintain traditional sectors;</p>
<p class="contents">4) Naturally, innovation can contribute to substantially improving working conditions and also the integration of certain groups, such as disabled people.</p>

<p class="contents">At the moment, there is a great innovation divide in the world. On the one hand, there are countries who create ‘innovation fronts’, which group together the great majority of the scientific, research and development sectors, while on the other there are the sidelined countries, which can only participate as importers or countries where innovation is diffused. The world leaders in terms of innovation are the USA, Japan and the countries of the European Union, and the competition between these economies provides a stimulus for further innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the European Union, there has recently appeared a so-called ‘innovation paradox’. Economic results for the Community can be seen as disappointing in view of the opportunities that the single European market offers. The plan to transform the EU into the ‘most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world’” is, on the one hand, a sign of the fact that the Union is aware of the need to fundamentally reform its social and economic system and, on the other hand, a sign of the ambitious and optimistic view that such change is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, the rapporteur very aptly points to the main reasons for this situation in the EU and, above all, highlights the need to develop an effective innovation strategy for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is proof that the Union is fulfilling its central role in an area that requires the closest possible international cooperation. Such cooperation is already working extremely well, but it is no longer enough. Terrorism and other forms of organised crime know no boundaries and are also, quite literally, exploiting the benefits of our democratic system. We must therefore weigh up what are the most important values in any given situation: combating crime or unfettered freedom. The time has come for us to cut back on our wonderful unlimited freedom in situations where that freedom prevents us from protecting the most precious thing of all, namely life itself. The time has definitely come to change tack and to remove some internal obstacles, including those which protect illegally acquired economic and financial resources. The Council must provide Europol and Eurojust with greater independence and authority. This is a new strategic task, and it is a responsibility that we have towards the 500 million citizens of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The abolition of internal borders between the Member States belonging to the Schengen area is certainly a major advance for our fellow citizens, but it is also helpful to organised crime, and so the European Union has a particularly important part to play in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">One fundamental and urgent requirement is that a policy of prevention be implemented and effective instruments put in place. If there is to be greater trust between states, and between their respective police forces in particular, then a great deal of progress needs to be made, and the countries from which we all come need to be pressed to set aside sufficient budgetary resources for their exchange and training programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this House of ours has highlighted the need not only for victim and witness protection schemes to be reinforced, but also for the promotion of campaigns making public opinion more aware of the traffic in human beings.</p>

Today's vote in the European Parliament showed that EU common foreign and defence policy is not just a declaration on paper or a collection of slogans. It showed that it is an operating policy. Today the European Parliament demonstrated something else too; namely, that solidarity in the European Union is alive and an operating principle. It is easy to declare and demonstrate solidarity when there are no problems and everything is fine. However, it is much more important and more complicated to implement solidarity at critical moments, in times of crisis. Today the European Parliament also showed that there is no disjuncture in the European Union between old and new, or large and small European Union Member States, and that there are no important or less important Members whose interests can be sacrificed for the benefit or interests of the large countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately it is not.</p>
<p class="contents">Things are increasingly moving in the opposite direction to freedoms, fundamental rights, pluralism and social harmony.

<p class="contents">We know that the Venezuelans have paid a high price to win democracy over the last fifty years, and we want it to be maintained. We also know that political and social stability is valuable for democracy, freedom and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are focussing on the <span class="italic">Radio Caracas Televisión</span> case and on the threat that it represents to freedom of expression, a universal fundamental right. I shall not go into details, but it was his Excellency President Chávez who, on 28 December, announced the decision to close down the broadcasts of <span class="italic">Radio Caracas</span>, making extremely serious political accusations against it.</p>
<p class="contents">The competent authority did not issue the administrative act until three months later, on 28 March, and that act does not mention any of the serious accusations that the Venezuelan Embassy in Brussels has also communicated to us. None of these accusations have been brought before a court and the administrative act of the National Telecommunications Council (CONATEL) mentions other intentions involving the creation of a public service channel, in a process which, in our countries, we would consider illegal and arbitrary.</p>

There is a direct relationship between today’s debate and this international campaign; even the European Parliament is inappropriately debating an issue that is for the Venezuelan national government alone to decide. What is more, our debate focuses on an inappropriate sector, that of human rights violations, when in fact we all know that no human rights have been violated.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that this represents a political move; it is no accident that this agenda item was put forward by a group of MEPs and not by an official European Parliament delegation as some have tried to claim, to be precise, by a group of MEPs who went to Venezuela and met with members of the opposition only.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the non-renewal of the licence for Radio Caracas TV is a matter for the Venezuelan Government alone, and their decision respects the country’s laws and constitution. Radio Caracas TV will be able to transmit via cable, satellite and the Internet, and therefore those who claim that the decision represents an act that is hostile to freedom of expression know this to be a lie. There are a great number of cases in Europe in which frequency licences are not renewed and yet this Parliament has never spoken of human rights violations and curbing freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that freedom of expression and pluralism of information and television broadcasts are guaranteed in Venezuela. In the particular case of Radio Caracas TV we are talking about a television station that played an active role in supporting the coup in 2002 and the oil blockade in 2002 and 2003. Any accusations of subversive activities should therefore be made to those who have encouraged the breakdown of Venezuela’s democratic and constitutional regime through a terrorist campaign and by manipulating information, and certainly not to a democratically elected government actively demonstrating its social commitment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Against this position, one has to set the upholding of the principle of freedom of the press and of media plurality. I admit the situation here is not black and white and the line separating one side of opinion from another is very fine, but only by a tiny margin we consider the freedom of the press prevails and any alleged ill-doing by the RCTV station must be properly substantiated in a court of law.

In our opinion, dealing with such matters in an atmosphere of urgency, in a situation in which there is no opportunity for background work on freedom of expression, not only in Venezuela, I might add, but also in various other countries of the European Union, does not enable our Parliament to work on these issues in a credible manner.</p>

We agree that freedom is not absolute, that it is restricted for the good of others, that it is limited by moral principles and that it may be restricted by legal principles. Freedom must serve a purpose. The freedom of the press is the very cornerstone of useful freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am surprised that here, in this Chamber, there are those from the Left, as is often case, who are attempting to justify the fact that freedom can be limited simply because the freedom in question is that of political adversaries. Freedom for us, according to one of the previous speakers, is a good thing, but freedom for our adversaries is not. This kind of freedom is no freedom at all. This is something we have experienced and observed. We lived in a communist state where people said that freedom should exist, but only for us, and not for our adversaries, in keeping with the famous motto that ‘there is no freedom for enemies of freedom’.</p>
<p class="contents">Communism fell and it seemed that we would have peace. Meanwhile, it turns out that Communism is like a hydra which springs back to life in various parts of the world and that there are those who defend it even here in this Chamber. They say that Mr Chavez is doing the right thing by silencing those he does not like, as it turns out that those people are also disliked by some of those present here.</p>

They take form through a thousand small subversions of the democratic order – the targeting of opposition leaders, the subversion of the electoral commission, the vitiation of the judiciary, the dissolution of the national assembly and, not least, the silencing of independent media.</p>
<p class="contents">Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela has something of the feel of Eastern Europe in the late 1940s. There are still elections, there are still opposition parties, there are still free newspapers, but the direction is unmistakable. True, President Chávez has not annulled the electoral process, but then there were elections every four years in the Comecon states throughout the Cold War. There are elections today in most of Mr Chávez’s closest allies – Iran, Byelorussia, Zimbabwe – it is simply that opponents of the regime find it hard to contest those elections, and that is why we should be so alarmed by the harassment and expropriation of Mr Chávez’s critics.</p>
<p class="contents">Venezuela is not Cuba, at least not yet, but the complacency exhibited by some in this House is at best naive, and at worst shameful.

<p class="contents">Venezuela is currently split in two and the last thing we should do is contribute to a confrontation amongst Venezuelans.

However, we are not here to discuss the rights and wrongs of his socio-economic policies or indeed the internal politics of Venezuela. This motion for a resolution is an expression of worry about a suppression of pluralism and dissent, and that is our business. It is a shame if the elevation of President Chávez to an icon of anti-globalisation and anti-capitalism blinds some in this House to the drift towards an authoritarian and anti-democratic system. I find myself in rather rare agreement with Mr Hannan.</p>
<p class="contents">This has happened to the Mayor of my city, London, Mr Livingstone, who belongs to the Labour Party. A year ago he said: ‘For many years people have demanded that social progress and democracy go hand in hand, and that is exactly what is now taking place in Venezuela. ... With Chávez the choice is not difficult at all. He is both carrying out a progressive programme and doing so through the mandate of the ballot box.’</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, as Mr Hannan has said, that there are still elections, but there is an undoubted drift towards autocracy and a suppression of opinions that do not fit with the regime. We had some amusement when six months ago Mr Livingstone went 5000 miles to try to see President Chávez but unfortunately got stranded in Cuba because the President could not find the time to see him. We had a laugh about that. However, it is quite serious when somebody who is democratically elected as the Mayor of, I would say, Europe’s premier city, finds himself wishing to cosy up to someone who is not only populist but increasingly authoritarian. It is because there are breaches of human rights in Venezuela that we have this motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are aware that they will soon be prisoners in their own country, just like the Cubans, without independent information, because they are losing the opportunity to decide their affairs through democratic means. Chávez is planning to silence the media and to crush the opposition, which is warning that nationalisation and autocracy are bringing to the country not development, but food rations for poor people on the one hand, and luxury and unlimited power for the communist oligarchy on the other. Venezuela, Cuba and Bolivia: this is a dangerous alliance of autocratic regimes spreading anti-democratic ideologies around Latin America and the Caribbean. Europe will not remain silent.

Commitment to Syria and friendship with it also imply, however, that we do not mince our words when fundamental rights are violated, and that is why I take a critical line on, and indeed denounce, the political repression under which all the opposition, of whatever tendency, currently labour.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the prisoners for whose release we are calling today are people we have met; they are almost friends, and none of them, when speaking with us, talked in terms of recourse to any means other than legal and peaceful ones in democratising the country that they all love passionately. When a country turns on those who love it passionately, when it stifles freedom of expression, it puts itself in danger, and I would not want to see Syria doing that to itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are calling for the release of Michel Kilo, Mahmoud Issa, Suleiman Achmar, Faek El Mir, Aref Dalila, Kamal al-Labwani and Anouar Bunni, who must be set at liberty. I would therefore appreciate it if the Council and the Commission were to pass this message on to the Syrian Government and if that body were to give it a very great deal of attention, for the message is a serious one.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it would be good if Syria were to firmly declare itself in favour of there being an international criminal tribunal under Chapter 6 to try Hariri’s assassins; the international community would appreciate such a gesture, which would facilitate an exit from the political stalemate with which Lebanon is struggling, a stalemate that encourages recurrent bloody conflicts and offers forebodings of a period of violence and instability. It is common knowledge that Syria’s adopting such a position, far from being an interference in Lebanese affairs, would, on the contrary, make it possible to break the deadlock and, above all, to put a stop to the rumours that give people cause to think that Syrian could, in an underhand way, frustrate the establishment of such a criminal tribunal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union is keen to strike up good and intense relations with that country in the framework of the Neighbourhood Policy involving countries around the Mediterranean. The chaos in its neighbour, Iraq, is yet another reason why stability in Syria would be valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">Syria, however, is a dictatorship that does not tolerate internal opposition. For Christians and Kurds, it is, to say the least, an unpleasant place to be. Although it is not a theocratic state with sympathies towards Muslim fundamentalism, it does consider Iran – which is a theocratic dictatorship – as an ally.</p>
<p class="contents">In Lebanon, it gives its backing to Lebanese and Palestinian Muslim fundamentalists, as long as they help to build up Syrian influence in its small neighbour. Lebanon is considered – albeit wrongly so – as an area that has been cut off from Syria as a result of European intervention. The conflict with Israel is being carefully nourished, because the tension that this brings with it means that the Syrians could well consider the continued existence of the regime as the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no improvement in sight. Both an aggressive attitude towards Syria and friendly relations with this regime are counterproductive. The only thing that can contribute to long-term improvement is support for Syrian refugees and Syrian opponents in prison and in exile.</p>

Mr Dess and I are particularly involved with the dialogue between these religions, which certainly has a good chance of success in that country – being an Arab country that is not Islamist and is very important throughout the region. All the more regrettable, then, that a regime has established itself there that, under Ba’athist national socialism, is victimising, persecuting and repressing people, subjecting them to show trials and taking political prisoners – and this at a time when our need for Syria’s help in achieving peace in the region is more pressing than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not one of those who believe in the complete isolation of Syria. The country has an ancient tradition; one that should be harnessed to build peace. Without Syria there can be no peace in the Middle East, no peace in Lebanon and no resolution of the Iraq problem. For this very reason, however, we cannot accept violations of human rights, such as the repression of Kurds and others on the flimsiest grounds, and so we would appeal to Syria to return to a policy of dialogue and cooperation. We are prepared to engage in this, but not with a regime that lacks the fundamental will to respect democracy and the rule of law. It is impossible to conduct a reasonable foreign and security policy and reasonable economic relations with a country that shows contempt for fundamental human rights. This should be a clear signal to Syria, therefore, to change its course and return to the path of cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since our last debate at the June 2006 part-session there have been a few positive developments. I would like to point out that a human rights contact was appointed in January 2007 in the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We also consider it positive that the EU is granted regular access to trials at the High State Security Court, the Military Court and the Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we regret that none of the promises of political openness have been transformed into action – for instance, the relaxation of the emergency law, the adoption of a multi-party law, the granting of citizenship to stateless Kurds or the declaration of the National Council for Human Rights. We also deplore the disproportionate sentences pronounced against prominent civil society activists in recent weeks. We cannot accept that they are jailed only because they have expressed themselves freely.</p>
<p class="contents">We call again for the release of all political prisoners in Syria. To give an example, all our attempts to help Mr Anwar al-Bunni have led to a dead end. Today Mr al-Bunni was sentenced to five years in prison merely for denouncing torture and poor prison conditions in Syria and fined EUR 1500 for allegedly not respecting Syria’s law when setting up the training centre, also financed by European Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">For several years the Commission has been supporting the modernisation process in Syria through a range of activities. We have seen very encouraging results in the economic field. We sincerely hope that these will spread to the political sphere. We will continue to encourage Syria to respect this obligation and the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights and Torture.

Both women had been found guilty of adultery by a criminal court in Managil province, Gezira state. According to reports, the women did not have a lawyer during the trial, and could not even conduct their own defence because they only speak the language of their respective ethnic group. The trial was conducted in Arabic, but the women were not provided with interpreters. There was an appeal against the verdict.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Sudanese Embassy in Brussels, the court quashed the death sentence on grounds of lack of legal assistance. We welcome the quashing of the death sentence if the court really confirms this, and we call on the Sudanese Government to ensure that the two women are not harmed physically or mentally.</p>
<p class="contents">On 3 May, two 16-year-olds were sentenced to death for murder and robbery. The imposition of the death penalty on young offenders is prohibited under international law. Sudan has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and accordingly committed itself to refraining from executing any persons under 18 years old. The Sudanese Government is called on to lift the death penalty imposed on the two minors and guarantee they are not harmed physically or mentally.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to condemn the death penalty, whipping and all other cruel and degrading punishments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In an ideal situation, from the point of view of the Sudanese people, there would be no need for our involvement. I welcome the fact that the six largest political groups in Parliament have come to an agreement on the matter of Sudan, and that we have a joint position. Paradoxically enough, one could say that the suffering and terrible verdicts handed down by the injustice system, I repeat – the injustice system, in that country seem to unite us in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable in the twenty-first century for a situation to continue where women are sentenced to death by stoning for adultery or where sixteen year old children are sentenced to death by hanging. Yes, we have become involved in Sudan’s internal affairs. Moreover, we should be involved for moral as well as other reasons. One of these reasons is that we have already earmarked EUR 85 million for humanitarian aid to that country this year alone. That figure was increased two months ago, as it initially stood at EUR 40 millions. We also have to loudly denounce cruel practices, such as the mutilation of young women, which also occurs in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">On a personal note, there is no point hiding the fact that there is a debate taking place in my country on the subject of the death penalty. Personally, I am against the death penalty. Events in Sudan confirm my convictions, although the cultural context is, of course, entirely different.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the fact that we have to show solidarity in this matter. We have to act together, as it is only our solidarity, the solidarity of the whole European Union, that can put an end to these absurd verdicts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, Sudan is also a state where respect for human rights in general is seriously lacking throughout the country.</p>
<p class="contents">This motion for a resolution reminds us again of the anachronistic and primitive judicial system applicable in Sudan, a system that allows the sentencing of women to death by stoning if found guilty of adultery and the sentencing of children to death. It is truly hard to believe that in the 21st century there are still governments that continue to tolerate and support such extraordinarily barbaric systems.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand that Sudan is a very poor country, with many political and economic problems, but such problems should not be an excuse for not following a course of common-sense-guided progress towards upholding universal values of justice and democracy. Furthermore, we find it difficult to accept how religion can interfere to such drastic and occasionally sadistic effect in matters of criminal and civil law.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to send a strong message to the Sudanese Government that our patience is running out and the limits on our tolerance have long been exceeded. We demand that they implement an urgent revision of their judicial system, taking into consideration international law, UN conventions and respect for the human rights of the Sudanese people. We trust this will be done speedily, in order to avoid having to resort to more drastic persuasive measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He states that Sudan is a poor country – which is true, but, with its oil wealth and much more, it has the potential to be an extremely rich one. Yet it is being exploited, and international forces and companies have certainly fanned the flames of the war in Darfur and elsewhere to promote their energy interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Sudan, with its defective political system, is also inflicting infinite harm on itself, however, not only as a result of the conflict between north and south, east and west, Christians and Muslims – as the generalisation always goes – but also as a result of a host of individual conflicts. For this reason, we must insist on respect for fundamental human rights there. As has just been said, rightly, Europe rejects the death penalty. The debate in Poland has been mentioned. As we know, the death penalty is incompatible with membership of the European Union and also of the Council of Europe; but similar standards are having to be developed slowly in Africa, of course. The still fledgling African Union is particularly called upon in this regard to not only develop, but also implement and enforce politically the relevant human rights standards little by little – we know that this cannot be done overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we appeal to the Sudanese Government to not only discontinue the death penalty – particularly its particularly scandalous use on minors – but also to refrain from a) misinterpreting Sharia law as it is doing, as the barbaric customs practised there have nothing to do with real Sharia law, and b) extending Sharia law to non-Islamic communities. The country must comply with normal civil law that is in line with the human rights standards of the United Nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The case we are discussing today, the sentencing to death by stoning of Sadia Idris Fadul and Amouna Abdallah Daldoum, has two equally important dimensions. On the one hand, it obliges us once again to state our opposition to the death penalty as a form of punishment under any circumstances, and, on the other, it brings us face to face with another case of flagrant gender discrimination, since the sentence in question is based on an alleged crime – adultery – that is only classed as such in the case of women, and not in the case of men.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not sufficient, therefore, to call for compliance with the international legislation regarding the death penalty against minors, nor even to urge all of the countries maintaining that practice to consign it to judicial and political history. In this case, we must also present this situation as one of blatant sexism, or one of selective killings on behalf of a patriarchy, which comes to the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are dealing with when it comes to this kind of sentence that only affects women is a situation in which less value is attached to the lives of women compared to those of men. That is not acceptable in Sudan or in any other country of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore delighted with the extremely high degree of consensus on this resolution and I hope that it will contribute not just to putting an end to the death penalty but also to the practice of valuing the lives of men and women differently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A united state would mainly be the state of the Arabic people in the north, the east and the centre, because it would be difficult for the black Islamic people in the east and the black Christian and animistic people in the south to secure an equivalent position.</p>
<p class="contents">These areas, which were far less developed, were at a fair distance from the sea and were largely unknown to the international community. Eventually, they were ignored by everyone. After years of war, a compromise appeared to have been struck for the non-Islamic south that had been given self-government and a representation in the central government. As we know, this is not the case for Darfur that is located to the west.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamentalism is a prevailing force among the dominating Arabic people, and particularly among those who wield power and administer justice, with capital punishment, even stoning, for offences including adultery being the worst outward signs of this. The resolution rightly draws attention to international agreements and the need to abolish capital punishment. Sufficient attention must be given to this area, for the situation facing Sudan is a terrible one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The breakthrough in one of the bloodiest wars in contemporary Africa came when a peace agreement was signed in Nairobi in 2005. However, the conflict continues in Darfur, in the western part of the country. To date, this conflict has resulted in 400 000 deaths and has displaced 2 million people. The inhabitants of this province are victims of the most serious crisis in the world today. They have no food, water or healthcare. The situation in Darfur has been critical for four years. The European Union has yet to take any effective steps to force the government in Khartoum to stop committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest reports on the execution of minors in Sudan is additional confirmation of the fact that this country has, once again, infringed human rights.

We can no longer simply express our concern regarding the situation in Sudan, as European foreign ministers have done for the last three years in nineteen declarations on this issue.

Almost two years after signing the comprehensive peace agreement, the Sudanese Government is falling far short of many of the human rights commitments made under the CPA and the internal interim national constitution, signed by the President of the Republic in July 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the international community, European efforts to improve civilian protection in Sudan focus simultaneously on both security and political civilian actions. Since 2005 the Commission has funded approximately 35 projects aimed at promoting human rights and democracy in Sudan with a total budget of about EUR 6 million.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the cases of the two women mentioned in Parliament’s resolution, I can assure the honourable Members of Parliament that the European Union and the Commission are following the case very closely. This case was first raised by the heads of missions meeting in the Netherlands in mid-March and it was followed by the EU Troika on 27 March, composed of representatives from Germany, Greece and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">More recently the EU raised the issue at the last Advisory Council on Human Rights meeting on 16 April. The Court of Appeal ordered that case be returned to the court of origin – the al-Gezira State Court – to be looked into again. Although we remain firmly opposed to the death penalty, the fact that the case has been sent for retrial is at least positive and we hope that the women will be given a fair trial in line with international human rights standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The last case which we are discussing now is the case of two boys aged 16 years old sentenced to death by hanging. Various Member States and the Commission have raised this issue with the German Embassy and are waiting for the EU Presidency to take the lead on this issue in the days to come. If not, the Commission intends to raise this issue directly in a letter to the Sudanese authorities such as the Minister of Justice and the Advisory Council on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The next meeting of EU-Sudan political dialogue with the Advisory Council on Human Rights will be in early June and this could be a good opportunity to raise this case again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my own country of Ireland we have been able to silence the gun and bring communities together that we never thought imaginable. So why are we so unable to make headway in this part of the world?</p>
<p class="contents">To answer this question, we need to look at the situation in Darfur in a different way. If the world’s sympathy and our resolutions could bring peace and relief to the people of Sudan it would have arrived long ago. We can continue to call on an unresponsive government in Sudan to change its ways, or we can look at why the support for its intransigence continues. We must cut the lifelines that are fuelling the destruction in Darfur, lifelines like Chinese oil money and Russian weapons. Until we are willing to stand up to these powers our resolutions will remain impotent and ineffective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

Two years after Mr Wolfowitz’s arrival at the World Bank – and we all remember the conditions under which he was appointed and of which the previous speaker reminded us, whereby Mr Wolfowitz was obliged to come and explain himself to EU representatives meeting at Ecofin – it could be said that Europeans made the mistake of being right too early. Two years on, we find ourselves in a situation that has weakened not only the World Bank but also the entire international regulatory system, at a time when we really need it to be equal to its tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the EU – and this is the point of the resolution we are proposing – in future to meet its responsibilities in full and prove capable of proposing changes to the Bretton Woods system, in order to enhance the system of nominations, which currently ensures neither the legitimacy, transparency nor credibility of the person in charge of an institution as important as the World Bank. In this regard, the International Monetary Fund, for example, operates a system in which there is a degree of competition between the candidates and a certain amount of publicity, and this strikes me as a more acceptable system. In order to obtain something similar, we need to hold exhaustive negotiations with our US partners, covering all aspects of the issue. We made this point in the resolution we adopted last month and, with this in mind, we call on the current German and forthcoming Portuguese Presidencies to consider proposals that the EU might like to put on the table. For the appointment of Mr Wolfowitz’s successor, Europeans will hopefully have the opportunity to hold a hearing with the selected candidate, prior to that person’s confirmation.</p>

Needless to say, during this fight he had the full backing of President Bush, himself not unaccustomed to shameful behaviour.

<p class="contents">Events have proven that initiative to be right, unfortunately it remained isolated within the European Union, given that neither the Commission nor the members of the Council have ever had a real desire to commit themselves to developing a European position on the Bretton Woods institutions.</p>

The impetus for his resignation came primarily from Canada and Europe, as we justifiably feared a loss of confidence in the World Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles of democracy, transparency and accountability of public institutions called for time and again by the outgoing World Bank President must also apply to the operations and decision processes of the World Bank itself. Like many of my fellow Members, I welcome the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz, a leading neoconservative and one of the main proponents of the war in Iraq. Like many others, I regret that this decision is somewhat belated.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, today’s discussion and resolution do not concern only Paul Wolfowitz personally. What is more important is to avoid making the same mistakes in future and to seek much better selection procedures. We would ask the German and Portuguese Presidencies to present proposals on behalf of the Union for making the selection of executives of the Bretton Woods Institutions more democratic, more transparent and more responsible in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What utter humbug! Any standards of transparency and democracy in the world are practised on a strictly limited basis, and the European Union hardly sets an example.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wolfowitz has been hounded out of office by those opposed to his anti-corruption agenda. The worst thing that the executive directors of the Bank could find to say against him was that ‘a number of mistakes were made’. If Mr Wolfowitz’s worst offence was giving his girlfriend a job, then it would hardly qualify as a minor error of judgement compared to the legendary levels of nepotism and corruption that the European Union has been guilty of over the years and the usual levels of corruption associated with the World Bank. Mr Wolfowitz wanted to clean it up and now he will not be able to, but it is an ill wind that cannot be used by the European Union to its advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to paragraph 6 of the resolution that calls for the Commission to have observer status at the Bank and for it to attend and intervene at certain councils. The key phrase here is ‘pending legal personality for the Union’. That legal personality depends on the ratification of the European Constitution that the European Union intends to stuff down the throats of the peoples of Europe whether they want it or not.</p>
<p class="contents">President Bush should nominate a new head of the World Bank whose girlfriend or boyfriend already has a job and who will either clean it up or close it down, and he should make sure that the European Union is let nowhere near it in the meantime! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to highly respected human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch, it is a well-established fact that of 75 political dissidents, independent journalists and human rights advocates who were summarily tried in April 2003, 60 remain imprisoned. Serving sentences of on average 20 years, the incarcerated dissidents endure poor conditions and punitive treatment in prison.</p>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not presented orally at Council Question Time at Parliament’s May 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council has condemned the extremely harsh punishments imposed in 2003 on 75 Cuban citizens. The EU has repeatedly made representations to the Cuban authorities about the unsatisfactory human rights situation in Cuba and demanded the release of all political prisoners. The Council regrets the fact that only a few prisoners have been released, and even then, in some cases, only on account of severe health problems. It also condemns the fact that, purely for exercising their right to freedom of speech and expression, other Cuban citizens have recently been sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment.</p>
<p>It is up to Cuba to put matters right, especially in view of its membership of the Human Rights Council and the resulting obligation to apply and advocate particularly high standards. On high-level visits human rights issues are invariably raised, including the fate of political prisoners. The Council notes with satisfaction that this approach is clearly and unreservedly endorsed by the vast majority of MEPs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0347"></a>

<p>This is all the more so given that it is the EU – and not Cuba in relation to any Member State – which has a 'common position' adopted in 1996, which explicitly states that its goal is to 'encourage a process of transition' and 'facilitate peaceful change in Cuba'. If this is not interference, what is?</p>
<p>The German Presidency goes on to claim that EU policy on Cuba is independent of the USA. How then does it explain that at the recent EU-US Summit on 30 April in Washington, it was claimed that 'throughout the year, we have consulted on Latin America, and in this context also on Cuba, including the prospect for democracy in the future. In mid-2006, the EU renewed its Common Position on Cuba. Meanwhile, the United States released the second report of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba (CAFC)'?</p>

<p>Scientific data concludes that, if used as the front-line primary test, HPV DNA testing is the next logical advance in best practice for cervical cancer prevention. It not only offers a higher level of sensitivity and increased disease detection rate, but also allows for less frequent screenings, ultimately saving time and resources within a health system. Despite the introduction of new vaccines, if countries do not offer more organised and better quality screening programmes using the most advanced technologies, Europeans will face an increase, not a decrease, in the incidence of cervical cancer. Since the adoption of the 2003 Recommendation on Cancer Screening, a new wealth of European data provides overwhelming evidence to favour HPV DNA testing over cytology (smears) as a better predictor for identifying women at risk for developing cervical cancer.</p>
<p>What steps will the Council take to ensure that in its considerations of the Commission’s upcoming review of the 2003 Recommendation on Cancer Screening it will adequately reflect current advances and developments and update the Recommendation to reflect newly published evidence and recent European clinical guidelines to ensure rapid advances towards eliminating this preventable disease across Europe?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the May 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Comparison of the measures taken in relation to Sudan and Belarus is, in principle, possible and reasonable only to a limited degree, since the political circumstances of the two countries are completely different.</p>
<p>The EU imposed an arms embargo on Sudan in 1994, and it is still applicable. The sanctions (restrictions on travel and the freezing of assets) specified in UN Security Council Resolution 1591 (2005) as being applicable to persons obstructing the peace process and/or committing offences against international law or human rights or committing other acts of cruelty in Darfur were incorporated into EU and EC law. In accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1672 (2006) of 1 June 2006, the Council decided to impose sanctions on four persons.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly stressed its willingness to take appropriate action – including targeted sanctions – against all the parties to the conflict in the event of failure to make visible progress in Darfur, and has furthermore expressed its support for the use of sanctions in accordance with Resolution 1591 against anyone obstructing the peace process, committing violations of human rights or breaching the agreed cease-fire or the arms embargo, while applying the measures described in the Resolution to their fullest extent.</p>
<p>The Council has argued that the Security Council should, as a matter of urgency, examine the possibility of further measures of the kind provided for in its own Resolution 1591 of 2005, and is itself willing to consider additional measures, in particular under UN aegis, against any party obstructing the implementation of the UN’s package of measures in support of the Mission of the African Union in Sudan (AMIS).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0304"></a>

<p>It is not open to the Council to express views on public statements of this kind. Although it is following closely developments in the area to which the honourable Member refers, no official statement has yet been made.</p>
<p>It needs nevertheless to be pointed out that Turkey, as a country applying for accession to the EU, and engaged in negotiations to that end, is required to endorse the values and objectives of the European Union, as set out in the Treaties. Turkey is therefore required to demonstrate beyond all doubt its commitment to good neighbourly relationships and to the resolution of outstanding border disputes by peaceful means in accordance with the UN Charter.</p>
<p>This, together with the principles in accordance with which negotiations are to be conducted, is stipulated in the negotiating framework for the accession negotiations with Turkey, and the peaceful settlement of border disputes is also listed as a short-term priority in the accession partnership with Turkey adopted by the Council on 23 January 2006.

<p>With regard to other conditions governing entry to the profession, Member States may adopt additional legislation within the boundaries set out in the Treaty.</p>
<p>However, if national legislation, in whatever form, bars European Union citizens from other Member States from entering the profession or makes it unnecessarily difficult for them to do so, the Commission will then bring infringement proceedings, in line with Article 226 of the Treaty, in order to enforce Community law, or will take the necessary legislative steps to remedy any shortcomings in the aim of ensuring the smooth operation of this area of the internal market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Following an interruption of many months, peace talks between the Government of Uganda and the ‘Lord’s Resistance Army’ (LRA) rebel movement were resumed on 26 April 2007 in Juba (Southern Sudan). Both sides agreed to extend the ceasefire until 30 June 2007, and so it is that no further acts of violence on the part of the LRA in Northern Uganda have been confirmed since August 2006. An agreement on comprehensive solutions to the conflict in Northern Uganda was signed on 2 May 2007. This agreement, however, addresses only the second point of negotiation on the two parties’ common agenda.</p>
<p>Since talks on how to resolve Northern Uganda’s political problems are continuing, there are encouraging prospects of an end being brought to the conflict that has been going on for 20 years now, and internal refugees are now beginning to return to the areas from which they originate, in which process they are being supported by humanitarian measures put in place by the EU and by many individual states. The International Criminal Court’s warrants for the arrest of the rebel leader Joseph Kony and a number of his commanders on charges of grave violations of human rights remain in force.</p>
<p>Several ambassadors of EU Member States participated in the latest talks in Juba as observers and had additional talks with Joachim Chissano, the UN envoy for the conflict in Northern Uganda, in order to stress the EU’s great interest in a resolution of these issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0329"></a>

<p>The promotion and protection of the rights of the child are a priority concern in EU human rights policy. By adopting the EU guidelines on children and armed conflict in December 2003 the European Union has signalled its aim of focusing more closely on measures in this area. The guidelines make it incumbent upon the European Union to take account of the short-, medium- and long-term effects of armed conflict on children through monitoring and reporting by heads of missions, military commanders and EU special representatives, as well as through representations, political dialogue, multilateral cooperation and crisis management operations.</p>
<p>The European Union has expressed its concern about children affected by armed conflict in a number of different forums and has referred to this problem in several declarations. The EU Troika has made representations in a number of States, including Burundi, Uganda, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberia.</p>
<p>The Council has tabled a strategy for implementing the guidelines (Doc. 8285/1/06 REV 1) which is based on UN Security Council Resolution 1612. The EU special representatives have received specific instructions on this issue, and in June 2006 a checklist for the integration of the protection of children into ESDP operations was published (Doc. 9767/06).</p>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the May 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member has already stated, the Commission proposal for a Regulation on roaming on public mobile networks within the Community is currently before Parliament and the Council for their examination. In its current version, the future Regulation’s provisions on charging structures cover only roaming services for voice calls, and there are two principal reasons for this, which are as follows.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Commission had taken this initiative not only because charges for roaming services were unacceptably high for both end customers and wholesale customers, but also because this problem is not susceptible to effective solution by the national regulatory authorities at the level of the individual Member States. Although the occurrence of unjustifiably high prices in the field of data communication services, for example in short message services (SMS) and multimedia message services (MMS), was noted in the course of the consultations carried out by the Commission, the national regulatory authorities have not as yet been able to observe such problems when conducting their own investigations into SMS services. Secondly, it is, at the present moment, difficult to see what shape development in the MMS field, in other similar data communication services and in the sphere of internet access is likely to take, and there is very definitely a considerable danger that the development of this market might be hindered by the application of inappropriate regulations. It would be helpful in this respect if the Commission were to draft an assessment of the economic and legal impact of such regulation.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is no doubt aware, both the co-legislators wish to give the Commission a mandate to join with the national regulatory authorities in monitoring the market for roaming services in the field of data communication, including SMS and MMS. It is planned that the Commission should, in its report on the application of the future regulation, also discuss the development of charges for the provision of speech and data communication services, including the forwarding of SMS and MMS, to roaming customers, whether they be end customers or wholesale customers, and that it should, where necessary, make recommendations as to what regulatory measures are needed in this area.</p>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the May 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council wishes to thank the honourable Member for her question.</p>
<p>Since the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, the EU has bordered on the Black Sea region, which includes the Eastern European Neighbourhood Policy countries of Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and whose ‘frozen conflicts’ have considerable potential for bringing about political crises. The region does, however, also have considerable – and as yet unexploited – potential for economic cooperation and growth, and so it is very much in the EU’s interests that its development should move forward.</p>
<p>There are, then, many arguments in favour of the EU having a more active policy in respect of the Black Sea Region, in which, although it is already involved in it, it can today assume an even more prominent role than it has done in the past by promoting cooperation in the region. The EU has therefore embarked on the drafting of a coherent and comprehensive policy in respect of the Black Sea Region aimed at strengthening regional cooperation and developing the region’s relations with the EU at every level.</p>
<p>The Presidency is also able to inform the honourable Member that the Council, on 14 May, adopted the following Conclusions on the Black Sea synergy initiative:</p>
<p>‘The Council welcomed the Commission's Communication “Black Sea Synergy – A new Regional Cooperation Initiative”. The Council underlined that following the accession of two Black Sea littoral states, Bulgaria and Romania, the EU’s interest in furthering stability and prosperity in the Black Sea area has become even greater.</p>
<p>The Council looked forward to further examining the Communication and invited the future Presidencies and the European Commission to continue work on an enhanced and coherent EU engagement in and with the Black Sea area, particularly in the framework of a strengthened European Neighbourhood Policy and building on synergies with regional bodies and initiatives. The aim should be to intensify the regional cooperation in sectors of cross-border relevance such as energy, the environment, transport, telecommunications, science and technology, freedom, justice and security, as well as democracy, human rights promotion, respect for international law and civil society cooperation.</p>
<p>Given the strategic importance of the Black Sea area to the EU, the Council invites the Commission to carry out a review during the first half of 2008 of the development of the Black Sea Synergy Initiative, as a basis for further consideration by the Council of its engagement towards the region as a whole.’</p>
<p>Long-term successful development in the Black Sea Region will be possible only as and when the conflicts in Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh – currently regarded as ‘frozen’ – have been resolved and normal and cooperative relationships have been established between all countries in the region.</p>
<p>The presidency takes the view that the closer regional cooperation envisaged in the Black Sea Synergy Initiative will not only bring economic benefits but will also be able to help build political trust and thereby create an environment in which the resolution of difficult political issues is made easier.</p>
<p>The Council has given its attention to the issue of the unresolved conflicts and has appointed EU special envoys for Moldova and the South Caucasus; it has also established both the EU Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EU BAM), the head of which is also a high-level political advisor to the EU special envoy for Moldova, and the Border Protection Support Team in Georgia. These instruments need to be in continually active and flexible use if the EU is to make a substantial contribution to the region’s stability, and the EU BAM’s mandate has just been renewed for another two years up to the end of November 2009.</p>
<p>The three ENP action plans for Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia were adopted on 14 November 2006, and each of them include among their main priorities the settlement of the internal conflicts in Georgia and the peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.</p>
<p>The EU-Moldova action plan, adopted in February 2005, lists as a priority the peaceful resolution of the Transnistria conflict.</p>
<p>In 2007, the European Union’s special envoy to the South Caucasus will be continuing to endeavour to create the conditions for the settlement of conflicts in the region, in which his first step will be to establish channels of communication between the parties to the conflicts and to take action to foster trust between them and him. In settling the conflicts, he will, in accordance with his mandate, liaise closely with the existing machinery for the resolution of conflicts. Two of the joint chairmen of the Minsk Group, Ambassador Bernard Fassier and Mr Matthew Brysa, reported to the Council in April on the current state of negotiations on Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
<p>In the course of 2007, the EU special envoy for Moldova will also be working on a solution to the Transnistria conflict, representing the EU in conflict resolution talks and actively engaging in bilateral consultations with Moldova and other partners including Russia.</p>
<p>2007 will also see the Council endeavouring to bring about settlement of the ‘frozen conflicts’, and it is prepared to play its part in implementing any solution to them. It has held an internal discussion on the results of the special envoy’s and experts’ mission sent by the Commission to Georgia and the breakaway regions in January 2007 and will now embark on putting into effect the measures agreed on.</p>
<p>The Council is also ready and willing to help with Nagorno-Karabakh, although precisely what form the EU’s contribution will take will be determined only as and when the political parameters for the resolution of the conflict are known.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0337"></a>

<p>On 1 May, demonstrators were arrested en masse and dozens of others injured in a barbaric attack by Turkish riot police in Istanbul.

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the May 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The presidency is following developments in Turkey with close attention.</p>
<p>In a more general context, however, it should be borne in mind that the negotiating framework adopted by the Council in October 2005 states, in its ‘outlines for the negotiations’, that negotiations are opened with Turkey on the presupposition that Turkey will comply sufficiently with the political criteria laid down by the European Council in Copenhagen in 1993 and later largely incorporated into Article 6 (1) of the Treaty on European Union and promulgated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p>It is quite clear from this that what the EU expects of Turkey is that it should press on with its process of reform and work to bring about further improvements in the fundamental areas of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and basic freedoms, including the relevant European case law, and that it should consolidate and extend its legislation and implementing measures with especial attention to a zero-tolerance policy in combating torture and mistreatment and the application of provisions relating to the free expression of opinion, freedom of religion, the rights of women, ILO standards – including the rights of trade unions – and the rights of minorities. The Council, furthermore, in its conclusions on 11 December 2006, noted that further considerable efforts would be needed in order to extend, inter alia, free expression of opinion and the rights of trades unions. All these issues are regularly raised in the course of political dialogue with Turkey.</p>
<p>The presidency will continue to monitor developments in Turkey and will address all issues arising in an appropriate manner.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0313"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is strongly committed to preventing incidents in which sporting passions turn into disturbances and violent conduct. Our aim is that football matches with a European dimension should not just be regarded as a potential source of ructions relating to breaches of law and public order and security. It is not acceptable that groups of determined hooligans have tarnished the image of the majority of peaceful football fans.</p>
<p>Based on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the EU should collect national experiences, generate synergies and develop further data exchange among national services. For the Commission, European added value can be achieved through:</p>
<p>Developing legislative instruments where necessary</p>
<p>Enhancing practical exchanges of experience and best practice between Member States, including law enforcement authorities, in order to establish common standards of safety and public order</p>
<p>Reinforcing operational cooperation at EU-level, particularly information exchanges on disorder assessments and on football supporters, their movements between countries and their classification as peaceful or violent supporters; developing further the National Football Information Points</p>
<p>Supporting the coordination and development of these and other activities through financial programmes.</p>
<p>To meet these objectives, the Commission intends to:</p>
<p>Develop a multidisciplinary approach based on prevention and law enforcement, including socio-educative activities for supporters and cooperation with international and national football bodies, supported by EC funding</p>
<p>Look into the possibility of developing further binding regulations or recommended standards</p>
<p>Support the development of existing CEPOL training courses on public order/crowd management and crowd control/hooliganism</p>
<p>Promote the use and dissemination of best practices including the Handbook on police cooperation in major football matches</p>
<p>In this perspective, the Commission with the Council Presidency and UEFA<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> will organise, at the end of 2007, a large EU high level conference with all stakeholders to consider the development of a European policy to prevent sport violence.</p>
<p>As regards the use by Member States of banning from stadiums all the individuals previously guilty of violent conduct at football matches, the Council already adopted a resolution on 17 November 2003. The Member States are invited to examine the possibility of introducing relevant provisions in their legal system and take appropriate steps ensuring their recognition in another Member States, hosting football matches. Following this Resolution, only few Member States adopted criminal or administrative provisions allowing banning orders. It can also be recalled that the Council has recently adopted, on the 4<span class="sup">th</span> of December 2006, a Resolution concerning an updated handbook with recommendations for international police cooperation and measures to prevent and control violence and disturbances in connection with football matches with an international dimension, in which at least one Member State is involved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The transfer of personal data to which the Honourable Member refers is made to an entity in the United States (US) which has adhered to the Safe Harbour scheme.</p>
<p>The Data Protection Directive contains specific provisions with respect to the transfers of personal data to third countries. The Directive provides that an international transfer of personal data may lawfully take place when the third country in question ensures an appropriate level of protection. With regard to transfers of personal data to the US, the Commission declared in 2000 that transfers to the US organizations having joined the Safe Harbour offer an adequate level of protection in accordance with the Data Protection Directive (Decision of 26 July 2000).</p>
<p>The Safe Harbour is a specifc scheme put in place by the US in order to facilitate transfers of EU personal data to US entities and meets the requirement of the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC to ensure an adequate level of protection level for a transfer to a third country. Safe Harbour sets out privacy principles (i.e., access, notice, choice, onward transfer, enforcement, security and data integrity) that US organisations wishing to join this scheme must commit to observe and publicy disclose before they are certified by the US Department of Commerce. The US Federal Trade Commission is the main body of the US Government competent to enforce compliance with Safe Harbour privacy principles by Safe Harbour organisations.</p>
<p>Transfers of personal data to a US organisation in the field of employment and human resources are covered by Safe Harbour. In this case, Safe Harbour contains specific provisions aimed at ensuring the protection of personal data of employees of EU entities, as well as their sensitive data. Any US Safe Harbour member which receives personal data must commit to cooperate and comply with the advice of competent EU data protection authorities. A panel of EU data protection authorities has been set up by Safe Habour. It is the competent body to examine and resolve complaints lodged by individuals for alleged infringement of Safe Harbour principles. If the entity in question fails to comply with the advice of the EU data protection authorities panel, the latter will inform the US Federal Trade Commission to take enforcement action over the entity or to inform the Department of Commerce so that it can be removed from the register of Safe Harbour members.</p>
<p>The US entity receiving personal data from the EU is included in the the official register of entities members of Safe Harbour held by the US Department of Commerce. The inclusion in this register indicates that the US Department of Commerce has certified that this entity has taken the necessary measures to comply with the privacy principles required to join the Safe Harbour with a view to accepting transfers of personal data from the EU.</p>
<p>An EU entity that transfers personal data to a US entity that adheres to the Safe Harbour scheme is not in breach of the EU Data Protection Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission informs the Honourable Member that data subjects may in any case address their complaint to their EU national data protection authority which shall examine whether the EU entity complies with national data protection law as regards its processing activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0345"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission does not collect specific information regarding living conditions for prisoners, including pre-trial detainees in the European Union - such as statistics regarding cell space, the ratio of prison wards to inmates etc – since this falls under the responsibility and competence of the Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission has, however, gathered some statistical data on detention in the Member States in connection with the drafting of the Proposal on the European supervision order (for instance, statistical data on the prison population, including pre-trial detention that the Commission drew up in 2003 at the request of the Italian Presidency, show that there are considerable differences between the EU Member States both as regards the rate of pre-trial detention per 100 000 inhabitants and the proportion of own nationals in relation to foreign detainees )<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><a href="#defann_21_2" name="refann_21_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It should be pointed out that the Commission is aware of the fact that when action in the field of prison policy is considered, the possible impact must be analysed in the light of available statistics. On 7 August 2006 the Commission presented a Communication<a href="#defann_21_3" name="refann_21_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> developing a strategy to measure crime and criminal justice – an EU Action Plan 2006 – 2010, which also aims at including background information on nationality and residency for prison populations, which is urgently needed for EU policy on criminal justice.</p>
<p>A recent study on prison overcrowding in 24 European countries demonstrates that overcrowding exists in 50% of these countries. Overcrowding seriously undermines reintegration of prisoners into society. The Commission, in cooperation with Member States, has thus proposed a series of measures to reduce the number of prisoners, including pre-trial detainees.</p>
<p>First of all, on 29 August 2006 the Commission adopted a "Proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the European supervision order in pre-trial procedures between Member States of the European Union"<a href="#defann_21_4" name="refann_21_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. This draft Framework Decision, once adopted, would allow judicial authorities in the different Member States to release persons suspected of having committed a criminal offence but who are not resident in the Member State in which they are suspected from custody and transpose it into a non-custodial pre-trial supervision measures, which could be transferred across the borders into the Member State where this person is normally resident. As many as 8,000 persons could be affected by this measure, which corresponds to the total pre-trial detention population of the United Kingdom some years ago.</p>
<p>Moreover, in February 2007 Germany and France took an initiative with a view to the adoption by the Council of a Framework Decision on the recognition and supervision of suspended sentences and alternative sanctions. This Framework Decision, once adopted, would facilitate social reintegration of sentenced persons, who will be allowed to return to their home State. Moreover, it would diminish the risk of recidivism thereby reinforcing public security and the security of victims. And last but not least, it would reduce prison overcrowding.</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that the Council and Commission Action Plan implementing the Hague Programme<a href="#defann_21_5" name="refann_21_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> provides that an "analysis of minimum standards in pre-trial detention procedures and the routines for regular review of the grounds for detention" should be undertaken before the end of 2007.<a href="#defann_21_6" name="refann_21_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> A study will be launched soon to examine this question and should be completed in 2008.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to facilitate the re-settlement of (ex)-offenders, and reduce recidivism, more than 100 projects under the 2000-2006 EQUAL Community Initiative have tested new approaches to preventing re-offending through re-settlement support, aftercare or assisting inmates while in prison. Some of these innovations are structural and relate to the management of change in prisons, the introduction of quality systems and the motivation of staff to adopt a more creative, pro-active attitude to the rehabilitation of inmates. Others are concerned with the development of new forms of education and training. Many of these initiatives involve the opening up of prisons to agencies and individuals, including employers, so that offenders are empowered and prepared to play a more positive part in society on their release.</p>
<p>A European Mainstreaming Programme is currently being implemented with the objective to convince key actors who are responsible for penal and/or resettlement policies, to adopt the good practices that are emerging from the EQUAL projects.</p>
<p>The three main foci of this Programme are:</p>
<p>- An Exchange Event of EQUAL DPs held in Portugal, during October 2006, that agreed on a set of topics to be presented at the subsequent Policy Forum;</p>
<p>- A Policy Forum in Poland, in June 2007, to confront policy makers with the good practices that are emerging from EQUAL and to engage their interest in taking some of these forward;</p>
<p>- A Transnational Network, later in 2007, to ensure the continued transfer and the sustainability of relevant EQUAL outcomes, and of relevant outcomes from the new programming period for the Structural Funds, provided there is sufficient interest in the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council and Parliament are currently finalising an opinion on the Commission proposal on reducing charges for making mobile phone calls from and to abroad in the EU, and making them more transparent. Following a proposal by Parliament, data communication (SMS and MMS messages) is also likely to be included in the measures.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the view that the rapid deployment of competitively priced mobile internet services is important for EU social and economic growth.</p>

<p>From the discussions which are currently ongoing between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission, it seems clear that monitoring of developments for data roaming prices will be an important element of the final regulation.</p>
<p>In addition, the final regulation is likely to include provisions aimed at enhancing the transparency of data roaming prices for consumers. The Commission is supportive of this approach and intends to monitor this market very closely and will report developments to Council and Parliament.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission has had the opportunity to express itself on the subject on several occasions in plenary session. It wants to emphasise again that the Commission, the Member States and the Parliament share the view that there is a real threat to civil aviation from home-made liquid explosives.</p>
<p>As regards the question of Mr Guardans Cambo, the regulation on restrictions on liquids does indeed have an unpublished annex which is classified as "EU Restricted" and thus not published in the Official Journal as required by article 8/1 of the Framework Regulation 2320 adopted by the Parliament and the Council in 2002. The Regulation is addressed not directly to citizens, but rather to the appropriate authority of each Member State.</p>
<p>However, passengers should be informed about items that are prohibited. Information is displayed in Community airports telling passengers about the rules on liquids, as well on airline websites, it is fair to say that Community airports and airlines appear to be meeting their obligations to inform the public and that the necessary information is in the public domain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the main stakeholder organisations representing airports, airlines and airport shops all confirmed that they had been involved by the Commission during the development of Regulation 1546/2006. The measures contained in this regulation were approved by the Member States and the Parliament following the correct procedures. They have not been adopted in secrecy and the possibility of juridical review exists like in every other case.</p>
<p>Turning to the question of Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, the Commission sympathises with the issues she raises. It is unpleasant for any passenger to have any item – no matter its value – confiscated. The provision of free drinking water is, indeed, desirable and concerns about the environmental effect of plastic bags are laudible.</p>
<p>It is the normal practise of airlines, on long-haul flights at least, to make non-alcoholic refreshments freely available to passengers in order to avoid deshydratation. Community legislation does not regulate prices at airport shops. Nonetheless, the Commission is looking at this issue very carefully and is encouraging airports and airlines to take all appropriate measures in order to ensure that free drinking water is available cheap, free or market-priced and that passergers are informed of any available sources of free drinking water.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Commission can assure the Parliament that the respect of passenger rights is a cornerstone of our legislation in the field of aviation security. But it should also be noted that one basic right is the right to travel safely, as much as possible free from the threat of terrorist attack.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission agrees with the honourable Member that there is a need to have harmonised rules for aviation security throughout the European Union. For almost five years, since the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> there has existed common rules in the field of civil aviation security. Futhermore, under the Regulation the Commission undertakes inspections of Community airports in order to ensure a correct and even application of the common rules throughout the Community.</p>
<p>Any differences in levels of security that apply today are as a result of Member States choosing to apply more stringent measures. These can result in passengers whose journey started within the Community being subject to rescreening when transferring flights at another Community airport, even though the legislation does not require this. However, it should be noted that all transfer passengers at Community airports who arrived on flights from outside the European Economic Area shall be subject to rescreening, in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 2320/2002.</p>
<p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was established by Regulation No 1592/2002<a href="#defann_28_3" name="refann_28_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which entered into force in September 2002, with the aim of promoting a uniform and high standard of safety and environmental protection in the field of civil aviation and does not play a direct role in security issues. The Agency provides the Commission with all the technical expertise the latter requires and assists it, among other things, in carrying out its legislative and regulatory tasks. It also implements a system for monitoring the application of Community legislation, evaluating its effects and making any useful suggestions on the matter. In this context, EASA plays a part in implementing Regulation 2111/2005 by passing on to the Commission information that is of relevance when it comes to updating the Community list of airlines subject to a ban on use and by helping to distribute this list to the public.</p>
<p>In November 2005, the Commission submitted a proposal for a regulation aimed at extending its powers to air operations and to pilots’ licences. The Commission is confident that this proposal will be adopted by Parliament and by the Council over the next few months. Furthermore, in an effort to promote a fully integrated approach to aviation safety in Europe, the Commission is already making preparations for EASA’s missions to be extended to the areas of airport operations safety and air traffic.</p>
<p>There are no plans at this stage to extend EASA’s powers beyond aviation safety to security, that is to say, to the prevention of illegal acts in the field of aviation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In 2006, the Group continued playing a central role in driving policy initiatives of the Commission for the active promotion of fundamental rights, non-discrimination and equal opportunities, with due regard for the Community competences and the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p>In particular in 2006, the Group contributed to the finalisation of the Communication on the rights of the child and the Green Paper on diplomatic and consular protection before their adoption by the Commission; contributed to on-going work in view of the European year for equal opportunities for all 2007, and raised inter-cultural dialogue – including issues related to different beliefs – in the context of the preparation of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008. The Group considered the creation of the European day against the death penalty and launched the preparations towards a European day against trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p>The Group raised a number of recurrent issues, such as the state of play of institutional negotiations in view of the creation of the Agency on Fundamental Rights and the European Institute for Gender Equality, and of dialogue with the Council of Europe on the accession by the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights. The implementation of the methodology for monitoring fundamental rights compliance in EC legislative proposals was also highly considered.</p>
<p>The Group monitored the implementation of the non-discrimination directives and took stock of the negotiations at United Nations level in view of an International Convention for the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Disabled People. Minorities, racism and xenophobia were on the Group’s agenda too.</p>
<p>The Group held an extraordinary session on the occasion of the International Women’s Day – 8 March 2006. This meeting involved members of the Parliament and was devoted to the presentation and discussion of the main aspects of the Road Map for equality between women and men 2006-2010, which was prepared by the Group and adopted by the Commission on 1 March 2006. In addition, the Group considered gender-related issues, such as the objectives for the recruitment and appointment of women to management posts and other A*/AD posts within the Commission in 2006 or the role of women in science and technology.</p>
<p>As regards the alleged CIA use of European Countries to transport and hold prisoners, the Group has closely followed the work done by the Parliament and the Council of Europe and supported the Commission’s line on this important and sensitive issue. However, the Group held no meetings after Parliament’s adoption, in February 2007, of the resolution on the temporary committee’s final report. In this text the Commission stressed very forcefully that it was essential to fight effectively against terrorism using all the legal instruments available, and that any anti-terrorist measure must at all costs respect fundamental rights and international humanitarian law. The Commission, within the framework of its powers, supported the work of the temporary committee. Like the Parliament, the Commission takes the view that it is essential that the Member States concerned carry out inquiries, and welcomes the fact that judicial or parliamentary inquiries are under way in some countries. The Commission will give careful consideration to calls for action that fall within its remit; to this end, it will carry out a comprehensive evaluation in the light of the results of the various national inquiries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0292"></a>

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Member is aware, a Commission investigation was initiated in July 2006 to assess whether maintaining anti dumping measures on imports of CFL(i) lamps, originating in the People's Republic of China, would be justified for a further period of five years. The case is still under scrutiny by the Commission and no conclusion as to the final outcome of the case can be drawn at this point in time.</p>
<p>The aim of this investigation is to verify whether unfair competitive distortions which favoured exports originating in China still exist, or, whether they risk reoccurring in the future if anti-dumping measures are removed. In this respect it should be borne in mind that the purpose of anti-dumping measures is neither to prohibit imports nor to hamper supplies to the Community market, but rather to re-establish conditions of fair competition on the Community market.</p>
<p>More generally and without prejudging the final outcome of the case, available statistics show that imports of CFL(i) lamps, originating China, have more than trebled in the period 2001 – 2006. During the same time, consumption in the Community has more than doubled and the Chinese market share is therefore higher than before measures were imposed.</p>
<p>It follows from the import statistics that the measures in place have not restricted trade flows of CFL(i) lamps, but rather they have ensured that they are now traded at prices which should eliminate the injurious effect of the dumping previously found.</p>
<p>It would however be difficult to provide any useful estimation as to how this market will develop in the future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0295"></a>

<p>The Commission has fully supported the recently issued Council Conclusions welcoming the mandate given to President Mbeki to facilitate a dialogue between the opposition and the Government, and the engagement of President Kikwete as chair of the SADC organ, and standing ready to support the SADC initiative.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that, at this stage, the SADC initiative is the best option available to overcome the Zimbabwe crisis.</p>
<p>This SADC initiative has also been welcomed by some Resolutions adopted this month at the European Parliament Plenary session.</p>
<p>Concerning the information on the deployment of 2 500 Angolan paramilitaries in Zimbabwe, the Commission is aware that there have indeed been reports in the press about it but so far there has been no confirmation or even indication that this has occurred or is intended by the Angolan Government.

<p>The Commission does not consider that the SADC Statement of 29 March in any way constitutes violation of the articles of the Cotonou Agreement referred to by the Honourable Member.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the problem of large sea-going ships producing a lot of air pollution in ports. This is true not only for cruise ships and passenger boats, but also for cargo ships like tankers and container ships. It is for this reason that the European Commission looks for solutions covering both passenger and cargo ships.</p>
<p>The Commission has published a recommendation on shore side electricity<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the solution suggested in the Honourable Member's question. It recommends Member States to consider the installation of shore-side electricity for use by ships at berth in ports; particularly in ports where air quality limit values are exceeded or where there is public concern about high levels of noise nuisance, especially in berths situated near residential areas. It also asks Member States to consider financial incentives to promote these installations and to take steps towards the harmonisation of shore side electricity facilities. Nevertheless, the environmental benefits and cost-effectiveness should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. It is primarily the Member State or the local authority that should decide in individual cases if this option is effective, taking into account the local air quality situation. This situation differs from port to port. European legislation obliging such facilities is therefore not considered appropriate.</p>
<p>A measure already taken is Directive 2005/33/EC of the Parliament and the Council of 6 July 2005, amending Directive 1999/32/EC as regards the sulphur content of marine fuels<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This Directive requires the use of fuel with less than 0.1% sulphur for ships at berth as of 2010 and will contribute to reduction of air pollution in ports as of 2010.</p>
<p>At international level (the International Maritime Organization, IMO) the negotiations on reducing air pollution from seagoing ships, including cruise ships and passenger vessels, are now at a decisive stage. The aim is to reduce the air pollution at source, by improved engine technology, emission abatement and/or improved fuel quality. The Commission is pushing for an ambitious reduction of air pollution from ships. Should this not be possible, or not be possible within an acceptable time frame, the Commission will consider coming forward with a proposal for tighter standards in line with the provisions of the Thematic Strategies to reduce atmospheric emissions from seagoing ships of 21 November 2002<a href="#defann_32_3" name="refann_32_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and on air pollution of 21 September 2005<a href="#defann_32_4" name="refann_32_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and the subsequent conclusions to these strategies by Council and Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 6 February 2007, I tabled a Written Question (<a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2007-0662_EN.html">E-0662/07</a>) to Commissioner Fischer-Boel on the reform of the fruit and vegetables sector, with particular reference to the solutions proposed for the new Member States. In her reply of 23 March 2007, Ms Fischer-Boel wrote: '(...) in regions of the European Union where the degree of organisation of producers is particularly low, Member States may be authorised, under certain conditions, to pay producer organisations national financial assistance (...)'. In Poland, the lack of interest in forming producer organisations derives from the fact that such groups are subject to corporate income tax and their assets to property tax, whereas individual farmers are subject only to agricultural tax, which is substantially lower.</p>
<p>Could temporary exemptions from income and property tax for producer organisations be recognised by the Commission as national financial assistance of the kind mentioned and accepted by it without challenge?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In the Commission proposal for the reform of the fruit and vegetables regime, adopted on 24 January 2007, there is a specific group of measures aimed at increasing the concentration of supply through producer organisations (POs) and producer groups (PGs) in the Member States which joined the Community as from 1 May 2004. Among these specific measures a national financial assistance, equal to a maximum of half the financial contribution of producers, could be authorised, under certain conditions, in those regions of the European Union where the degree of organisation of producers is particularly low. This assistance shall be additional to the operational fund.</p>
<p>As far as the Commission is aware, in accordance with domestic Polish tax policy, only primary agricultural activity is exempted from income taxes i.e. Personal Income Tax (PIT) and Corporate Income Tax (CIT). Activities normally carried out by POs or PGs i.e. preparation of products (cleaning, drying, trimming, cutting, packaging) are not regarded as primary agricultural activity and, as a consequence, are liable to income taxes, even in the instance when they are done by individual farmers.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight that the benefits stemming from Community and national support under the current Regulations may clearly outweigh the costs of compulsory taxation in Poland, although as mentioned in the second paragraph, the Commission is not convinced that there are any additional costs coming from the fact that the producer is member of a PO. Therefore, the Polish tax policy can not be considered as potentially discouraging farmers from organising.</p>
<p>The national assistance proposed by the Commission involves a transfer of national budgetary resources and it is additional to the operational fund. It is not the intention of the Commission to grant to the Member States other possibilities to hand out this assistance as this would complicate the system. If the national assistance were to be channelled in other ways than financial transfer it would be difficult to safeguard that it is additional to the operational funds and equal to maximum half the financial contributions of producers to this fund.</p>
<p>In any case, the proposal is still under discussion at the Parliament and the Council. After the adoption of the Council proposal, the corresponding implementing rules will be drafted. Implementing rules on the proportion and details of the national additional assistance will then be studied and the Commission will take into consideration all the proposals from Member States including this one.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would like to add that the area of direct taxation is harmonised only to a very limited extent within the European Union. Therefore, the Member States are free to determine their own tax legislation, as long as it remains within the framework of the provisions of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission would be grateful if the Honourable Member can provide it with additional information and evidence.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0308"></a>

<p>(EN) Structural change is an inherent part of the development of regional economies, and is experienced in many fields of activity including transport. The European Union, through its Cohesion Policy, helps the regions to design and implement policies to help regional authorities, businesses and workers to anticipate these changes, adapt more quickly to them and to exploit fully new opportunities. These policies result from strategies based on the strengths and weaknesses of each region, and are defined with the involvement of all local partners and all relevant expertise.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently finalising negotiations with the United Kingdom on its strategy for cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013, the National Strategic Reference Framework. While this strategy does not make specific reference to the transport sector, it is based on the need to promote the sustainable competitiveness of the regions, and their ability to adjust to and to exploit structural change. The strategy for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in the Regional competitiveness and employment regions is based on four priorities: 1) Promoting innovation and knowledge transfer, 2) Stimulating enterprise and supporting successful business, 3) Ensuring sustainable development production and consumption and 4) Building sustainable communities The strategy for the European Social Fund (ESF) is based on two priorities: 1) Tackling barriers to employment and 2) Improving the skills of the local workforce.</p>
<p>In the specific case of the South East of England, the Commission expects to receive the relevant Regional competitiveness and employment ERDF Operational Programme in late June/ early July, so at this stage cannot comment on the priorities it will identify. Given the amount of money available for this programme, (€ 48 million total cost with an ERDF contribution of € 24 million) it is not expected that it will contain specific actions in support of the transport sector. It is expected, however, that it will concentrate on the promotion of innovation and entrepreneurship which are both essential for sustainable economic development in the South East. The Ashford area will be eligible under this programmes and will therefore have direct accesss to cohesion policy support. The implementation of the programme, once adopted by the Commission, will be the responsibility of the Regional Development Agency (RDA) for the South East.</p>
<p>For the ESF allocation there is one Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment Operational Programme covering the whole of England. Each region has been given an ESF allocation within the total amount of the programme (2 893 million total for Regional competitiveness and employment of which 229 million is destined for the South East). The ESF Operational Programme has already been submitted to the Commission and contains two Priorities: 1) Extending employment opportunities and 2) Developing a skilled and adaptable workforce. The interventions will concentrate on tackling unemployment and inactivity by helping people with no or low level skills.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0311"></a>

He stressed that this was a hypothetical issue for the time being, as the Russian Government had not yet adopted a position on membership.

<p>The aim of this call is to implement a single network providing integrated services in support of business and innovation in Europe, building on the strengths and achievements of the current Euro Info Centres and the Innovation Relay Centres. Under this call, the new network will implement the requirements of Article 21.2(c) of the CIP decision by providing complementary services, especially at regional level, to those services provided by the NCPs, to support the participation of SMEs in FP7. The CIP single network will have around 600 outlets and involve 2,000 to 2,500 staff across the EU. It will start to operate in January 2008 and will provide services to enterprises, notably SMEs.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission also funds the "IPR-Helpdesk project" (http://www.ipr-helpdesk.org/controlador/principal?seccion=principal&amp;len=en</p>
<p>) which provides free Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) advice, including regarding IPR issues related to FP7.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0322"></a>

<p>Despite the ban imposed by the Commission on the hunting of birds during the migration season for many species of bird from and to Africa, and despite major protests from animal welfare organisations, the government of Malta has this year again, at the start of spring, authorised the hunting and shooting of a number of protected bird species. This is in flagrant contravention of the Birds Directive, which is designed, in particular, to protect a number of rare bird species. In 2004 the Commission already instituted proceedings against Malta before the Court of Justice, apparently to no avail.</p>
<p>What is the Commission's response? Will it be applying further sanctions vis-à-vis this serious and repeated violation of European legislation by a Member State?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Under Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds (hereafter the Birds Directive), the hunting of migratory birds listed in Annex II of the Directive is not allowed during the return to their breeding grounds. Article 9 of the Birds Directive provides the possibility for Member States to apply a derogation but only under exceptional circumstances and only if the strict criteria set out in this article are met. Crucially, derogations are only possible where there are no other satisfactory solutions.</p>
<p>In 2004, the Maltese Government decided to apply this derogation for the hunting of Quails and Turtle Doves during the spring migration. However, the information sent to the Commission by the Maltese authorities was insufficient to demonstrate that the derogations granted were able to meet the requirements set out in the Birds Directive. In particular, the Maltese authorities failed to show that there were no other satisfactory solutions and that the spring hunting takes places under strictly supervised conditions. This is why the Commission concluded that the derogation granted in 2004 infringes Articles 7 and 9 of the Birds Directive. In July 2006, an infringement procedure was launched in accordance with Article 226 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The abovementioned infringement case only concerns the derogation granted in 2004. However, the Commission is aware that spring hunting was permitted in the subsequent years. The Commission considers that the continuation of the spring hunting all these years without a proper justification constitutes a case of systemic bad application of the Birds Directive. Thus, in March 2007, the Commission decided to send a supplementary letter of formal notice aiming at broadening the scope of the infringement case and addressing the generalized practise of the Maltese authorities all these years. It should be stressed that the Commission gave Malta the opportunity to submit its observations on the matter within one month, i.e. a shortened deadline.</p>
<p>In their replies to the letters sent by the Commission, the Maltese authorities affirm that the derogations granted fulfil the criteria of Article 9 of the Birds Directive. The Commission is assessing the information received. If it is established that Malta has not fully complied with the Birds Directive, the Commission will not hesitate to continue the infringement procedure to its conclusion, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 226 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>On 10 May 2007, the Maltese authorities announced that legislation permitting spring hunting in 2007 of Quail and Turtle Dove would be revoked from that date. Spring hunting had commenced on 10 April 2007 and was due to terminate on 20 May 2007. The Commission welcomes the proposal of the Maltese authorities to stop spring hunting earlier than anticipated. The Commission hopes that such a move by the Maltese authorities indicates recognition of their obligations under EU law and that spring hunting in future years will not be permitted, to ensure that the infringement of the Birds Directive in relation to spring hunting may be closed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0328"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission welcomes the initiative of the Honourable Member in raising the issue of chronic pain. This is a serious issue that affects the daily lives of a considerable number of citizens in Europe.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is clear that the recognition of chronic pain as a medical condition varies between the Member States. This means that citizens in different parts of the Union get different access to treatment for chronic pain.</p>
<p>The Commission understands the frustration that this can cause, both to the patients concerned and their carers.</p>
<p>However, the primary responsibility for the organisation and financing of health services and medical care lies with the Member States. The Commission cannot therefore impose a single way of dealing with chronic pain at European level.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it can aim to promote better understanding and best practice through sharing experiences at European level. And it is doing so.</p>
<p>The Commission has included specific questions on how far pain restricts daily living as part of a Eurobarometer survey in 2006, to help assess the extent of this issue. It plans to issue the results in July 2007.</p>
<p>It has also funded relevant projects including "Defining best practice in palliative care" and "Highlighting the impact of headache in Europe".</p>
<p>And for this year, the Commission has specifically included 'pain management' as a topic in its 2007 Call for Proposals under the public health programme, to help support further cooperation on these issues in particular at European level.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the concerns of the Honourable Member over potential hearing damage and other health effects from MP3 and other music players. Several national authorities have pronounced themselves on this matter.</p>
<p>Community legislation is already in place that restricts the noise level of this type of music player to 100 dB. Therefore, emitting levels above may not be safe and should not be used without additional protective measures. These levels are set by a harmonised standard: EN 60065:2002 “Audio, video and similar electronic apparatus - Safety requirements”.</p>
<p>This standard is referred to by Community product legislation as appropriate to apply for both personal music players and other equipment including such a function.</p>
<p>The regulatory framework governing the safety of this equipment is as follows:</p>
<p>The Radio and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (R&amp;TTE) Directive<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 1999/5/EC governing the health and safety aspects of radio equipment, including mobile phones;</p>
<p>The Low Voltage Directive (LVD) 2006/95/EC governing the health and safety of electrical equipment within certain voltage ranges;</p>
<p>The General Product Safety Directive<a href="#defann_42_2" name="refann_42_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (GPSD) seeks to ensure that all consumer products are safe where this aspect is not further detailed in any other “specific” EU legislation (including personal music players).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that a standard exists, the Commission is preparing a request for scientific advice on this issue. The scientific opinion will inform the Commission, who will then proceed to take the measures deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>In respect of noise limits, a firm view on this will be taken at that time. In this respect the Honourable Member’s attention is drawn to the fact that most research findings on noise currently take into account not only the noise level, but also the length of time and number of exposures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is well aware that certain new Member States believe that their quotas, negotiated in the Accession Treaty and based on a historic reference period, are too small.</p>
<p>In the new Member State, the quotas were established with the same method as for the existing Member States, i.e. the allocation was based on traditional potato starch production, taking an average of the three reference years (1999–2001 except for Lithuania, where the years 1998–2000 were used). It was not possible to take into account potato areas since data on the part of the potato production used for starch processing were not available.</p>
<p>A reallocation of unused quotas would incite higher potato starch production under quota and weaken the quota regime itself. In view of the supply situation of the potato starch market, where currently 40% of the production has to be exported and where the cereal starch becomes more and more competitive on the domestic market, this should be avoided.</p>
<p>Therefore the Commission proposal is limited to a two years roll-over and does not consider any adaptation or modification of the present quota regime.

<p>(EN) A smoke-free Europe constitutes one of the main priorities of the Commission in the field of health.</p>
<p>This January, the Commission adopted a Green Paper which launched a broad public consultation on the best way forward to promote smoke-free environments in Europe.</p>
<p>On the basis of the comments received, the Commission will decide on the direction of further action. The opinion of the European Parliament will be of crucial importance to us in this respect.</p>
<p>The Commission will propose the way forward in a follow-up communication in 2008.</p>
<p>In addition, our media HELP campaign is now in its third year. So far, the campaign has been highly successful in warning young people of the risks of passive smoking and addiction. The latest HELP TV spot addresses the dangers of second-hand smoke to children.</p>
<p>The new pictorial warnings on tobacco packages are intended to help smokers visualise the nature of tobacco related diseases, including the risks of passive smoking to children and pregnant women.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is preparing a report on the implementation of the Council Recommendation on smoking prevention. The report will include an analysis of national smoke-free policies and regulations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0338"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is attentive to cases of restructuring in the automotive sector and is particularly concerned by the negative consequences of plant closures for the workers affected, their families and the regions in which they are situated. However, the Commission has no authority to prevent or defer the decisions of individual companies in relation to company restructurings or site closures and cannot interfere in a company's decision unless that decision violates Community law.</p>

<p>€ 9 974 577 under the Operational Programme "Competitividad y Mejora del € Tejido Productivo"<a href="#defann_47_4" name="refann_47_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>;</p>

However, since Delphi has so far not proved the implementation of the project in question, the corresponding aid has not been paid out to the company.</p>
<p>Spain has adopted the necessary measures to transpose into its national legal order Council Directive 98/59/EC on the approximation of laws of the Member States on collective redundancies<a href="#defann_47_9" name="refann_47_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>, Council Directive 94/45/EC the European Works Councils<a href="#defann_47_10" name="refann_47_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a> and Council Directive 80/987/EEC on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer<a href="#defann_47_11" name="refann_47_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a>.

<p>(EN) Cannabis use in Europe is a public health problem. Evidence shows that its use, in particular when intensive, and in young people, can be detrimental to physical and mental health.</p>
<p>The use of cannabis has increased over the past two decades. However, the speed and signs of the increase vary throughout Europe.</p>
<p>There is an overall increase in the level of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in cannabis products, however, this increase is not yet visible in every country and rates differ considerably between countries. This issue is taken into account very seriously by all Member States.</p>
<p>Much research exists on cannabis, on its medical use as on mental problems. However the suggested link ‘between cannabis and mental disorders’ has not yet been fully explored by researchers.</p>
<p>Cannabis use is the most widely used drug in the European Union, and indeed in the world. It is a public health concern.</p>
<p>Therefore selective interventions on prevention and treatment should be made available to curb the current level of use. This is reflected in the EU Action Plan (2005-2008).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0349"></a>

<p>In Greece and more generally in all the EU Member States, the number of workers being 'hired out', that is to say subjected to a modern form of slavery, is increasing exponentially. While they are employed for years at a time to meet the recurrent and ongoing needs of undertakings in the public and private sector, they are not directly recruited by these undertakings but indirectly through private employment agencies which treat them like slaves. The 'hired out' workers are not covered by collective bargaining agreements and are constantly denied their freedom at the workplace and their civil liberties. In this way the agencies concerned are clearly seeking to maximise their profits by keeping earnings and benefits for workers to a minimum. In Greece, for example, according to the incomplete information available (in fact the situation is much worse) the National Bank of Greece alone employs 700 of its staff on this basis while the total number of workers employed in this way exceeds 15 000 and is steadily increasing.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that this type of recruitment infringes the rights of workers to permanent and stable employment and the principle of equal pay for equal work under collective bargaining agreements?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The honourable Member highlights the situation of workers who are recruited in Greece and in the other EU Member States by private employment agencies in order to be placed at the disposal of user enterprises, the apparent objective of which procedure is to reduce the latter’s labour costs and social security contributions. At the same time, the employees concerned have little job security and are not covered by collective agreements. The situation described by the honourable Member corresponds to the triangular relationship more commonly referred to as ‘temporary work’, where agencies, as employers, make their employees available for a fixed term, with a view to providing a service to a user enterprise.</p>
<p>Many Member States, including Greece, have adopted national legislation that covers this type of situation and guarantees temporary workers adequate protection. Most of these laws establish the principle of equal treatment – not least regarding pay – between the temporary workers and permanent workers employed by user enterprises. In this case, temporary workers benefit from the provisions of the collective agreements applicable in the user enterprises. In some Member States, it is the social partners at national or sectoral level who have decided to conclude collective agreements with the specific aim of providing the workers concerned with a protective framework.</p>
<p>On 20 March 2002<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on the working conditions of temporary workers. After the European Parliament issued its opinion at first reading, the Commission adopted an amended proposal on 28 November 2002<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This text lays down the general principle of equal treatment, in accordance with which the basic working and employment conditions (in particular pay and working time) of temporary workers will be at least those that would apply if the workers had been recruited directly by the user enterprise to fill the same post. This text is still awaiting discussion by the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreed between the EU and China in June 2005 was a "once and for all" agreement. It comprises agreed levels for ten textile and clothing categories until 31 December 2007. It was intended to give an extra breathing space to the EU industry to adapt to the new environment after the end of the Agreement for Textiles and Clothing (ATC), foreseen since 1995. The Commission is convinced that the industry put the extra time since 2005 to good use. In fact, the social partners representing European textile and clothing industry did not demand any extension of the Memorandum. They call instead for priority being given to policies guaranteeing equal market access and respect of agreed rules.</p>
<p>After the end of the MoU the textile sector will be subject to the same rules as all other economic sectors in the EU.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission is monitoring and will continue to monitor the situation of trade in the textile and clothing sector and in particular the imports originating in China.</p>
