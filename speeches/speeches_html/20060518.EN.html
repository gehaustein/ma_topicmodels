<p class="contents">Recent trends seem to indicate a growing vulnerability of the European Union to disasters, and natural disasters in particular. The incidence of extreme weather events and related natural disasters is increasing, perhaps fuelled by the effects of climate changes. This year again, floods have raged in central and eastern Europe with four countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria – requesting assistance through the Community mechanism for civil protection. I am proud to say that European solidarity and generosity has once again mitigated the affliction those countries had to suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">The four reports rightly point out the human, environmental and financial costs of such disasters. The Commission therefore very much welcomes the European Parliament’s initiative to examine the various aspects involved, with a joint effort by no less than three parliamentary committees. The jointly organised hearing earlier this spring has certainly made a valuable contribution to this process.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports rightly consider a whole range of measures aimed at improving risk prevention and the response to crises. The Commission agrees with the recommendations regarding the need to adjust action in the area of prevention and management of natural disasters, as well as the need to coordinate Community instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the reports reinforce the Commission’s integrated approach to its policy on disasters, which includes instruments regarding prevention, immediate response and more longer-term, solidarity-based action. This approach is intended to strengthen the EU’s capacity and effectiveness in preparing for and responding to major disasters, while avoiding duplication of effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the proposals contained in the reports have already been endorsed through the Commission’s action. We are now proposing even more concrete ways to act. Our recast of the Council Decision establishing the Community mechanism for civil protection is the legal embodiment of a number of proposals put forward in these reports. These proposals are consistent with the Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument. The recent Barnier report also explores certain forward-looking suggestions for our response to disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also welcomes the progress on the negotiations for the proposed floods directive on the assessment and management of floods and the positive vote in the recent ENVI Committee meeting. The Commission would equally welcome strong support from this House for a directive that gives all citizens a right to the same approach and level of ambition for flood risk protection, prevention and preparedness, regardless of where they live in the Community: in transboundary or national river basins, or in the coastal areas of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only are floods on the increase with changes to our climate, but droughts have become more prevalent in Europe. At the request of a number of Member States, the Commission is analysing the issues of water scarcity and droughts. Options are under consideration and we expect that a Commission staff paper will be available shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Another relevant instrument for the future could be Life+, the new financial instrument for the environment. It aims, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, to support the efforts of Member States in the field of forest fire prevention, mainly through the implementation of knowledge-related measures such as training and awareness-raising campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, the Commission is prepared to cofinance prevention measures under the cohesion and rural development policies. Member States are invited to include appropriate actions in their programmes for the forthcoming period, where prevention will be one of the priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the rural development pillar, Member States can also implement specific measures to restore the potential of forestry or agricultural production. Under the rural development programmes, they can also request that a ‘severe natural disaster’ be recognised as <span class="italic">force majeure</span>, in order to derogate from certain conditions under the ‘agri-environment’ measures. Those possibilities continue in the new programming period from 2007 to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget, though, that natural disasters are not the only threat the Union is faced with. It must be prepared for and able to respond effectively to challenges. Major man-made disasters, major threats to public health and acts of terrorism might require just as much of a common European response. For the Commission, it is sometimes difficult to explain why the Union should be absent in some circumstances. The lack of a concrete expression of Union solidarity has already been a source of embarrassment to the Union during some of the traumatic events of recent years. The Commission is therefore particularly grateful for the widespread support expressed in Mr Berend’s report for extending the EU Solidarity Fund to non-natural disasters and for enlarging the scope of eligible operations accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Solidarity Fund created in 2002 has generally worked quite successfully, if judged against the objectives and conditions set out in its legal basis. Aid has been granted in 21 cases, concerning 15 Member States and candidate countries. Those who criticise the Solidarity Fund as being ineffective or too slow have a point. However, experience since 2002 has also led the Commission to the view that the existing fund has a number of shortcomings and that modifications to the current regulation are necessary. That is why we have proposed a new Solidarity Fund Regulation. The new proposal is based on the current Solidarity Fund, while introducing a number of modifications aimed at widening its scope, making the fund more transparent, and introducing a number of operational improvements, in particular the possibility of making advance payments so that the fund reacts more quickly and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission nevertheless considers that the fund must remain limited to public emergency intervention. Insured or private damage, including agricultural damage, should not be compensated. The ‘polluter pays’ principle and third party liability must continue to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">As with the current fund, the new proposal is based on the subsidiarity principle. The EU should intervene only when a state is considered to be no longer in a position to tackle a disaster alone. Consequently, there should be a relatively high threshold for European intervention. Today this threshold is defined in terms of direct damage, which must exceed EUR 3 billion, or 0.6% of GNI.</p>
<p class="contents">With the new proposal, the Commission has therefore sought to improve the transparency and simplicity of the criteria governing the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund. That would help the national authorities to have a clearer idea of when the fund is likely to be able to support them in recovering from a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside the enlarged scope, a major element of the proposal is therefore a new definition of the criteria for triggering the fund. The operationally complicated regional criteria would be abolished in favour of only quantitative criteria. In compensation for the loss of the regional criteria, the quantitative threshold would be reset at EUR 1 billion, or 0.5% of GNI, whichever is the lower. This would increase the predictability of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund decisions, thus reducing the workload in the Member States in preparing applications for support that have little or no chance of success.</p>
<p class="contents">Solely in the case of truly unexpected and exceptional situations, such as those where physical damage is limited, for instance terrorist attacks or major public health crises, the new fund could be mobilised by a political decision of the Commission, to be confirmed by the European Parliament and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The huge scale of some disasters in recent years, and last year in particular, has led Parliament to give due consideration to this issue. Three committees have been set up to provide solutions, from their particular perspective, for preventing disasters or for offsetting the impact thereof when it is not possible to prevent them.</p>
<p class="contents">I have worked on this report for some six or seven months and, having spent that time listening to many MEPs, specialists, economic agents, local, regional and national authorities and the communities affected, I found the experience highly rewarding. I was also able to go to the six worst affected Member States last year, namely Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, France and Italy. I was delighted with the welcome accorded to us everywhere we went and I have no doubt that in bringing Parliament closer to the citizens, we performed useful work for our institution.</p>
<p class="contents">I also worked hard to establish as broad a consensus as possible on the proposals that I shall present to you. I was able, in fact, to accept all the amendments that were tabled – 53 out of 60 – and the few exceptions were for formal reasons of redundancy or duplication and not because of their content.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us is based on three main ideas. Firstly, agriculture and forestry are activities that are closely bound up with the natural world and are therefore at the mercy of climatic phenomena, and exposed to bio-sanitary risks resulting from air, water and ground pollution and from increasing globalisation. Secondly, the exodus from the countryside is one of the main causes of the increase in forest fires in southern Europe, especially acute during times of drought, as the year 2005 sadly proved. The EU’s budgetary limits must, however, be respected. The proposals therefore submitted fall within the financial perspective that we adopted yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">The main thrust of my proposal is therefore to optimise the existing political instruments, for example the Solidarity Fund, the European Agriculture and Rural Development Funds, the Veterinary Fund, regional policy instruments, the future Life+ Regulation, by improving them and adapting them within the context of genuine disaster and risk management systems. In the case of the latter, this will be done by communitarising a system of insurance and reinsurance to be cofinanced by the farmers, the Member States and the EU via the EAFRD.</p>
<p class="contents">The Solidarity Fund will need to be broader in scope and more flexible, to cover disasters that unfold over time, such as drought, which is currently not included. In order to make it more effective, a flexibility clause should be attached to it to ensure the provision of adequate financial resources when they are needed, from common agricultural policy headings that currently go unused.</p>
<p class="contents">The funding priority of EAFRD, on the other hand, should be actions aimed at the forestation and reforestation of burnt areas, along with all possible prevention measures, such as upkeep of forests, the use of biomass to produce energy, the training of economic agents involved and the supply of information to them, and awareness raising on such problems, all made possible with greater cofinancing from national rural development programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">This is just a brief summary of a few points, which illustrate the importance of Parliament addressing the agricultural aspect of such disasters, and I hope that Parliament will lend its fullest possible support.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission and the Council will give due attention to these proposals, taking account of the urgent nature of the circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gerardo Galeote Quecedo (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, over the last eight months we have visited the areas affected by natural disasters in many of the Member States and we have held a public hearing at which some of the people who have not had the opportunity to speak in their own national Parliaments have been able to speak. Today we are presenting concrete proposals, which the other institutions cannot allow to be thrown into the litter bin.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members could legitimately be pleased with the work done in this area. It is more than the public administrations directly responsible in some of the Member States have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe that we should ask ourselves whether we are more prepared now than we were eight months ago to prevent and combat this kind of disaster and whether we now have more effective mechanisms for helping those suffering the consequences of fire, water or drought. I am not sure.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to thank all of the parliamentary groups for their commitment and dedication over these months of intensive work. I would like to thank the President of the European Parliament for taking an interest in who was going to attend the hearing, although I must admit that I would have preferred him to show his support by immediately visiting the areas affected, avoiding the bureaucratic procedures that delayed us for four months and resulting in us missing the opportunity to demonstrate the solidarity of all of us – I am sure – with the victims straightaway.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like in particular to thank Parliament’s services for the professionalism they have shown. They were subject to all kinds of pressures before, during and after the visits made.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that we have been able to vote on these reports at the same time as the reform of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund, because we have noted general dissatisfaction with the application of this Community instrument in each and every place we have visited, Mr Piebalgs. I believe it to be essential that the Council accept Parliament’s amendments, in particular those that demand, on the one hand, that the Fund assist all of the victims and their families, and on the other, that the Fund’s limits of applicability be reduced and that this Fund can be applied when certain areas are completely destroyed, as in the case of Riba de Saelices, which we have visited.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, on these visits we have seen the deficiencies in the information campaigns aimed at prevention and the lack of coordination amongst the competent public administrations in the Member States, including, as we have seen, in Pampillosa da Serra, for example. We have also seen the dissatisfaction of the population in broad sectors of society, in NGOs and amongst representatives of civil society. I therefore hope that the proposals contained in the reports being submitted for Parliament’s consideration today receive wide support and send a clear signal to the governments of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like quickly to summarise what we are asking for by means of ten points. First: a European strategy to combat natural disasters; secondly: the involvement of regions and local bodies; thirdly: flexibility in the redistribution of the funds available; fourthly: a Community forest-fire protection programme; fifthly: a specific proposal, Mr Piebalgs, for a directive for fire prevention and management in the European Union; sixthly: that the Seventh Framework Research Programme, the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and the Galileo system be applied in order to assist in prevention and early warning; seventhly: information and educational programmes and campaigns agreed with the Member States; eighthly: a Community civil protection mechanism; ninthly: that additional financial instruments also be applied, such as EIB loans or State aid for regional purposes; and tenthly: that the European Parliament continue to carry out its duty of control with regard to the shortcomings in the fight against fire and all of the problems relating to it.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, I would call upon everybody to put aside the party-political differences that may have divided us so that we can create a broad parliamentary consensus, which is what the European citizens are demanding of us and which we owe in particular to those who have suffered the consequences of these natural disasters: their victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer in particular to the visits that we made to the six countries affected by natural disasters and the public hearing that took place in Brussels. In our own countries too – at least this was the case in Portugal – we held public hearings to gather suggestions, information and proposals put forward by the various stakeholders. I should also like to thank the Members for their backing, their suggestions and their amendments, and the experts who helped improve my report.</p>
<p class="contents">The climate is changing. The year is no longer divided into the traditional four seasons. Days of unbroken drought alternate with days of torrential rain and with heat waves. Climate change lies at the root of the natural disasters – be they floods, extreme droughts or fires – that have been occurring with increasing frequency throughout the world and have caused terrible damage in terms of human loss, environmental deterioration and reduced economic activity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is one of the major problems of our times. 2005 began with the world in shock at the scale of the tragedy caused by the Asian tsunami. The process of identifying the dead and looking for survivors went on for a number of months. In the summer of that year, a series of fires destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest in Portugal, France and Spain, and violent floods spread devastation and death in countries such as Germany and Austria. Outside Europe, Hurricane Katrina wreaked unprecedented destruction in a number of North American States, and before the year was out, Afghanistan was hit by a violent earthquake.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to earthquakes, seaquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods and fires, there are other phenomena associated with climate change and global warming that cause sea levels in coastal areas to rise and beaches to disappear. Studies published in <span class="italic">Science</span> magazine reveal that sea levels could rise six metres by 2100, given that the ice of the Arctic and Antarctic is melting increasingly quickly. In order to prevent the worst case scenario, serious measures must immediately be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to honour the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you referred to the water shortage. Indeed, water must also be used more sustainably, more sensibly and more efficiently. More than 1 billion people fight for survival every day because they do not have drinking water, 400 million of whom are children. Water-related diseases kill a child every 15 seconds and are linked to many other diseases and malnutrition. The distribution of resources between the different domestic, industrial and agricultural users needs to be studied and debated, and waste must be combated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to encourage the citizens to help prevent these disasters, by reducing greenhouse emissions, as I have said before, by protecting the forests and by not building in high-risk areas. Natural disasters cut across borders and their environmental consequences also affect neighbouring countries. Given that Community action should complement that of the national authorities, in terms of prevention, planning and intervention, rehabilitation and follow-up, it is essential to step up coordination at all levels, to improve the existing mechanisms and to develop early warning systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Although each region has its own characteristics and each case is different, there are common needs to be addressed, such as defining risk assessment mechanisms and drawing up maps of areas of drought, forest fires and floods. My report contains a number of other proposals, which I naturally hope will be endorsed, first and foremost, by Parliament, the Commission and the Council, examples of which include the definition of prevention systems to facilitate the fight against the causes of natural disasters; improved urban planning, especially in coastal areas and high-risk areas; the preservation of natural ecosystems; increased cooperation on civil protection between the Member States and at EU level in order to ensure the availability of additional resources for rapid action to address emergency situations; and the simplification of the rules on implementing the instruments, such as the Solidarity Fund and the Forest Focus Programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rolf Berend (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the ever more frequent occurrence of natural disasters – for example the many forest fires and floods, not least in the summer of 2005 – there is an ever-growing demand for European solidarity. The solidarity fund set up in the aftermath of the devastating floods in 2002 and designed to run until 2006 is intended to give the European Union greater freedom to act in the event of major disasters or crisis situations, thereby playing a substantial part in enabling the EU to do more and target its efforts better in those areas in which the public expect the European Union to act.</p>
<p class="contents">As you, Commissioner, mentioned earlier, it was extremely difficult, not to say sometimes and in some situations impossible, to use the existing instruments at EU level as a means of responding appropriately to major crises, not all of which, it has to be said, were of natural origin. One can take as examples of this industrial accidents – such as the wreck of the tanker <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, or the bomb attack on Madrid in March 2004. In addition, the current threshold for the mobilisation of the solidarity fund is set extremely high, so that exceptional conditions and arrangements abounded.</p>
<p class="contents">The new solidarity fund regulation now rightly makes provision for the extension of its scope, in other words, no longer limiting major crisis situations to natural disasters, but extending the category to include industrial and technological calamities, except where the ‘polluter pays’ principle is applicable or where the damage can be covered by insurance. There is also a need for immediate action in the event of public health crises and when terrorists strike, although – and this is the crux of the matter – the budget must remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of a ‘major disaster’ has also been revised, so that a disaster is regarded as major if it causes damage estimated at in excess of EUR 1 billion or over 0.5% of the gross national income of the State concerned. One is talking here about damage in the public sphere rather than to private property or damage covered by insurance. As has been said, the threshold was formerly fixed at EUR 3 billion or 0.6% of gross national income, which threshold values had been proposed by the Commission and by this House, but not accepted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is also intended that a new political criterion be introduced to enable the Commission, should extraordinary circumstances in a specific part of the territory of an eligible state sufficiently warrant it, to declare a disaster situation to be major, even if the quantitative criteria have not been fulfilled – a criterion that is likely to apply to acts of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">It needs to be emphasised that the European Union’s solidarity fund is not a means for taking preventive action, but that it instead responds to disaster situations. That, for example, excludes the possibility of the fund being used to provide protection in advance of pandemics or to facilitate other preventive action. The solidarity fund cannot engage in preventive health care, nor is it meant to; health policy remains a matter for the nation states, and by that is meant specifically the deployment of vaccines and medicines in the initial response to disasters, medical and psychological emergency care and measures to deal with the risk of contagious disease, for example as a consequence of flooding.</p>
<p class="contents">As before, the fund’s financial assets amount to a virtual budget of 1 billion marks, the significance of ‘virtual’ being that these funds can be drawn on only in the event of a disaster, and must first be mobilised by the Commission and Parliament; it follows that they cannot be transferred elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by extending warm thanks to all who have worked with me on this report – to the Bureau, to my colleagues, and to the Members of this House, irrespective of whatever groups they belong to, with hearty thanks to the Commission, too, for its good cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does not reflect sister city relations, but the fact that the city had been destroyed by a flood over one hundred years ago, and was rebuilt by an effort of solidarity involving the entire Europe. It was not us, it was not the European Union who invented European solidarity, and it has been in operation long before 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, this does not mean that the Committee on Budgets does not support the existence of the Solidarity Fund and the currently planned modifications to its regulation. Our Committee wishes to see an efficient Solidarity Fund, and not one that narrows down artificially the scope of those eligible for assistance. We agree with the mitigation of damages suffered, and we pressed for the rapid activation of the system. We believe that it is important for the Fund to be situated within the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The Solidarity Fund represents a significant opportunity for the European Union to make its citizens aware of its existence in a manner that can be understood by all. The European Union can show, in a tangible form, that Brussels is not just a bureaucratic hydrocephalus, but also a helping hand. Numerous ungenerous rather than helpful proposals have been made during the debate, and I consider them to be a mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteur for his thorough work, and hope that we will only need to use this Fund rarely or perhaps never, but not due to bad regulations inspired by selfishness, but to the absence of disasters causing damages. I know that my natural optimism is a mistake, but please support these funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Haug (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even though the European Union’s Solidarity Fund has been in existence only since 2002, it is already in need of revision. Founded upon the principles of solidarity and aid in a crisis, it has proved its worth in dealing with the after-effects of natural disasters, but it has also become apparent over recent years that its scope cannot be limited to dealing with these. It has become more and more plain that industrial and technological disasters and the potential crises resulting from terrorist acts or – something that is of particular importance to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – a public health crisis, make it necessary that we should be in a position to respond and help by means of solidarity and financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Just so that it is clear to everyone, once and for all, I am not talking here about preventative measures, which, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, fall within the remit of the Member States. Our concern is with help, on the basis of solidarity, in dealing with the spreading of diseases, with pandemics, or with accidents such as the one that happened at Chernobyl. We want to be able to help without in any way overloading the European budget with unnecessary functions, not even when natural disasters need to be dealt with. It is for that reason that I expect the House not to give its backing to the renewed demand – made in another report – for an observatory to report on drought, desertification and other effects of climate change, for these tasks are already being dealt with by the Commission anyway. It must be clear to us that every additional agency – or whatever else we want to call these things – restricts the financial elbow room available for our policies, and just how tight that elbow room is was the subject of a resolution yesterday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In some respects, an even more positive solution could have been reached, which was proposed in Parliament but which ultimately was not taken forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must address the natural disasters that have lain waste to Europe in recent years – drought, forest fires and floods – in terms of their impact on agricultural activity. As Mr Capoulas Santos correctly pointed out, agricultural and forestry production, unlike other economic activities, is closely bound up with nature and is therefore more fragile when natural disasters strike. I therefore feel that following recent experiences, there needs to be a fresh approach to European farming in terms of preventing and responding to natural disasters. Current national mechanisms are often inadequate and one-off supranational response mechanisms are often inefficient.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight the Solidarity Fund, which has already been mentioned today and which we will certainly continue to speak about. The Fund is currently under review and it is hoped that drought can be included in its scope. At a time when climate change is already being felt and when the vulnerability of farmers in the face of such dangers is becoming increasingly apparent, I feel that it is vitally important to draw up a Community strategy to combat natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, in the next financial framework a Community forest and flood protection programme should be created with the appropriate funding, with a view to encouraging awareness raising activities, and fire risk prevention and management. This Community programme could be funded by a specific regulation, by its own funding or by its own budget heading under EAFRD or LEADER+, in accordance with an oral amendment that is to be tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must therefore provide a clear response for the communities it represents, who have suffered as a direct result of the natural disasters and who are naturally expecting our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For Portugal in particular, in common with other Mediterranean regions, 2005 was the driest year in the last 105 years. In December, around 87% of Portuguese territory was suffering from extreme drought. This was particularly serious in the Algarve region, where the climatic conditions were exceptional – a combination of high temperatures and the dryness of the air. In the Algarve region, the natural disaster of the drought of 2005 and the devastation caused by the 2003 forest fires had a terrible impact on local infrastructure, on the natural and cultural heritage and on farming and tourism. The water supply to the communities concerned was markedly affected in terms of scarcity and compliance with required quality standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Natural disasters are known to occur when extreme weather events affect a vulnerable area. It is therefore crucial that the fragility of these regions be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">European cooperation on civil protection must be stepped up, in order to ensure rapid response for the affected areas. There must also be increased prevention and a rapid response preparedness instrument for emergency situations. This is what these own-initiative reports seek to do and to coordinate. Even so, the Solidarity Fund has a long way to go before it is fully developed, which is why we are discussing it.</p>
<p class="contents">It should therefore be acknowledged that almost all the affected areas are classified by the EU and that following the devastation we cannot simply say that we have fulfilled our civil responsibility. The restoration of lost ecosystems is vital for the balance of these areas. To this end, solidarity is also crucial. It is also crucial to enhance information and awareness raising among the communities and regions that are vulnerable to natural disasters, so as to reduce the risks and the impact of those disasters and so that the people know what they can do to preserve the natural resources in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity has been a key word in the EU ever since the Treaty of Rome. Let us make sure, however, that it does not become just another empty word in the Community vocabulary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The various disasters that have taken place, the distress they cause - which we share with the victims insofar as we are able, as outsiders - and the discontent that is expressed show just how sensitive these issues are.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout our debates, we have listed what these various natural disasters might have consisted of: fires, cyclones, tidal waves, earthquakes, floods, health crises, terrorist attacks, droughts, shortages of drinking water, industrial and technological disasters, agricultural disasters and undoubtedly many more. That is a long list that affects our Union and that calls on it to shoulder its responsibilities. Yet, as we were able to recognise in our debates, those responsibilities are shouldered by a variety of partners. First and foremost, they are sometimes shouldered by those responsible for the disaster, or for a fire, for example. Yet they are also shouldered by insurance companies, which are obviously affected, by the Member States and by the various organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the European Union's role, what is its mission, in this general context? For, as my fellow Member, Mrs Madeira, just said, if we are responsible for solidarity, then we must shoulder that responsibility within the context of our powers. Yet, what are these powers, before, during and after these natural disasters? I think that, after having heard our fellow Member, Mr Galeote, draw up a fine list just now, there is a need, Commissioner, for total clarity regarding this responsibility of the Union, before, during and after disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to prevention, as with regard to protection measures, I believe that we do in fact have a power to exercise and a role to play in the fields of research and coordination. As regards the retrospective measures, which draw on our Solidarity Fund, our fellow Member, Mr Berend, has done a very fine job, but much remains to be done because it will always be very difficult to find ideal solutions, given the variety of situations and funding. We have a huge amount of work facing us. What I am asking you to do, Commissioner, is to find a better solution and to ensure that the European Union responds very clearly in the wake of these disasters. Our fellow citizens need a European Union that is very clear in terms of the measures it takes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is now a matter of facing up to the damage caused by those disasters, and we all agree on the need to support the victims and to help them get back on their feet and rebuild their lives after the disasters, as well as the need to support the ‘Disaster' fund in order to show solidarity with all of the victims and to demonstrate that the European Parliament takes an interest in, and cares about, its fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we also call for investment in the areas of prevention and restoration, instead of the focus being merely on curing the ills. Even though we broadly support the analyses of the proposals drafted in various resolutions tabled, in particular, by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and by the Committee on Regional Development, I am disappointed by the proposal of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is refusing, as it were, to assume its share of the responsibility for the speed with which these phenomena are occurring. What shocks me is the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is requesting that the aid not be deducted from the CAP resources. We have just spent a year witnessing a significant struggle aimed at obtaining a fund to preserve the biodiversity falling under Natura 2000, and we have failed. Yesterday, we all took note of that failure.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for Life +, I will be unable to agree to this programme – which is already well and truly dwindling away – serving as an insurance policy for disasters that are less and less the result of nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is in reality our cultivation methods that we must change. The flooding of the Danube can be mentioned by way of example. The dams had to be knocked down because the Danube delta, which is prone to flooding, had virtually dried up. We now need to pose this crucial question: what kind of agriculture and what kinds of transport do we hope to have in the future if the Kyoto Protocol is regarded as the key element where climate change and the fight against this change are concerned? We must seek out the causes of these disruptions, and we, as Members of the European Parliament, know what they are: they are changes in modes of transport. I am in favour of a Solidarity Fund and of giving aid to the victims, but let us genuinely seek out the causes, otherwise we are just going to make changes to a never-ending problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new proposal for the Solidarity Fund needs to respond to the difficulties that have been experienced in relation to its application since it was created in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the Fund should be adapted to the specific characteristics and the actual needs of the different countries faced with a very wide range of different disasters, as in the Mediterranean area. We therefore tabled a proposal aimed at reintroducing the concept of exceptional regional disasters, as laid down in the current regulation governing the Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say that this is a view voiced in the opinion delivered by the Economic and Social Committee, which deems it necessary to continue to address disasters with a serious regional impact. I also wish to point out that the report by the Committee on Regional Development before us today takes the view that the Fund should be applied when the majority of the population in a region has suffered from a disaster with serious and lasting impact on their living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Portuguese Parliament adopted a resolution aimed at maintaining the possibility of providing support in the event of regional disasters with a significant socio-economic and environmental impact in the least favoured regions of the EU. We also tabled proposals intended to ensure that both the promotion of support for reinstating production activity in areas affected by disasters and making land and air equipment immediately available to fight against forest fires should figure among the eligible actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we proposed that, as laid down in the regulations of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, a level of economic and social development in a region or Member State should be taken into account when financial assistance is granted under the Solidarity Fund. Among other aspects that form part of the new proposal for a regulation, I should merely like to underline our concern at the broadening of the scope of application of the Fund without the financial ceiling being increased. In other words, we believe that priority should be attached to natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">We also oppose the idea of reducing the mobilisation threshold whereby the EU Member States with the highest GNI stand to benefit most. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to highlight the rather perfunctory treatment of the damages caused by frost, which is also a form of natural disaster. I understand that natural disasters such as fires and droughts are issues somewhat closer to the rapporteur’s heart because he lives in the Mediterranean region. In Central and Northern European countries, frost causes very serious financial losses in the agricultural sector, especially in orchards and in the field of soft fruit production. When working on this draft, we should create a systemic solution that could apply to all regions of the European Union and all types of natural disasters. That is why the elements that have so far been omitted should be incorporated into the report in order to make it complete.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that was greatly emphasised in the report was the question of migration from rural areas and farmers abandoning their farms. This is partly caused by the lack of viability and the high cost of forest management. Serious losses in the forestry sector are caused by inappropriate forest management, monocultures across large woodland areas as well as the planting of inappropriate species of trees. I would just like to point out that, during discussions concerning this forestry strategy in Parliament two months ago, Members failed to mention the huge areas of forest where forest management is carried out in an exemplary fashion. I am referring here to state-owned forests, including those in Poland, where fires and hurricanes also cause significant damage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For example, an increasing number of flood plains have been lost in the course of centuries, and experts believe that we in Europe have, by the building of dykes, pretty well exhausted the possibilities of technological protection against flooding, so that we will, in the near future, have to have ever greater recourse to what are termed ‘retention areas’. It would appear that respect for the forces of nature is disappearing altogether. There is – as is well known – increasing settlement and industrialisation in exposed areas, for example on the coastline and in the flatlands of rivers, and so natural disasters, under such circumstances, can be prevented only with great difficulty if at all, but we can make the effort – by means of a solidarity fund such as this one – to alleviate the consequences in so far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, though, that the development and extension of early warning systems is essential in this respect; it is in this area that much remains to be done, and I regard this as an area in which the European Union, in particular, must act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can certainly make a number of improvements in terms of better coordination and the exchange of good practice. However, in the case of large–scale natural disasters, according to the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, we need higher–level arrangements for financial and technical operational help. ‘He who gives promptly, gives twice over,’ as they said in ancient Rome. <span class="italic">Bis dat, qui cito dat</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we deal exclusively in these reports with the consequences of natural disasters, we also need to pay great attention to preventative measures. In this respect, our policies relating to agriculture, forestry, water management, town planning and regional development policy also need to come under scrutiny, as they could have a substantial impact on the scale of the consequences of natural disasters. Take, for example, intensive animal husbandry, which is subsidised by the European Union, but which also leads to greater desertification in certain areas.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to monitoring climate change and its consequences, I advocate closer cooperation between existing research and scientific institutions and the financing of new community programmes. New community institutions, however, usually require a lot of money – they are easy to establish, hard to dismantle – and I also advocate that, in addition to the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, we also take very great care to respect the principle of proportionality. Let us establish new institutions only where they are genuinely needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has not therefore been an easy job to achieve a common position that makes it possible for this Parliament to act strongly and firmly in the coming negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like briefly to stress certain important elements relating to natural disasters, since I believe that we must enhance the European Union’s measures for dealing with them, given that Community interventions have so far proven themselves to be insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore reasonable for this Parliament to ask the Commission for a European strategy for combating natural disasters, and furthermore one that acknowledges the specific characteristics of those of a Mediterranean nature, such as droughts and forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">We must provide resources aimed at the victims of these disasters. Furthermore, the creation of a European Monitoring Centre for Drought and Desertification are important initiatives that we must promote.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress the main innovations incorporated into the Solidarity Fund, which are going to make it possible to respond more quickly and effectively to disasters that the Member States cannot tackle alone. Together with natural disasters, admissibility is also extended to industrial disasters, terrorist attacks and emergency public health situations.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this Parliament must be firm with regard to the proposal to lower the threshold for mobilising the Fund from EUR 3 000 to 1 000 million in damage caused. Thanks to this measure, it will be easier to use the Fund than it has been up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot lose sight of the fact that it is necessary to determine which emergency operations are essential for the re-establishment of the infrastructures and equipment affected, as laid down in the Regulation. The provision of air and land resources and the administration of drinking water are clear examples of this, without forgetting the technical assistance that the Commission will facilitate.</p>
<p class="contents">This instrument must respond quickly and effectively, with financial aid, to extreme situations of drought, fire and floods, without forgetting the victims of these disasters who need immediate help and assistance, and who Europe must not turn its back on.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about the Solidarity Fund and we must not lose sight of this notion, because the European citizens expect us to respond to their demands. We are talking about a Fund that is a political instrument and, as such, it must resolve the difficulties faced by the areas affected and the people living in them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reason why we now find ourselves having this debate is because of a new development that constitutes an even more serious challenge to our territory: climate change due to global warming.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore a need to identify long-term prevention measures, which can be summed up using the concept of integrated land conservation. Let me explain: since land is subjected to a variety of challenges, a form of conservation is needed that will address all of the aspects in question together: flood safety, by increasing the retention times of our rivers; geological safety, by draining slopes that are characterised by an unstable equilibrium and that can cause numerous casualties, as the recent events in Ischia serve to remind us; and fire safety, through forest-based activities aimed at reducing the risk of fire, without excluding, of course, the possibility of using biomass for energy purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need for short-term prevention, especially against floods, which should consist of a radar network that is capable of calculating precipitation and, thanks to river modelling, can guarantee a reaction time that is sufficient to protect the civil population and properties too.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Beaupuy has already pointed out, this is what we must do at EU level: draw far more attention to the matter, because that is the only way in which we will actually be able to address these risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur has already said, it was the devastation wrought by the floods in 2002 that prompted this House, the Commission and the Council to set the Fund up.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a second-generation regulation, and the clear and tight framework set down by the rapporteur makes it a really useful and flexible instrument that we can fully support. It is indeed the case that the fund is a reactive rather than a preventative instrument, but we believe it is irresponsible, when taking reactive action, to make the same mistakes that brought disaster in the first place. Take the example of the rivers that destroyed homes and property; never again must they be so tightly hemmed in; preventing them from being so is the only responsible way of using European taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I would like to point out that some Member States have a tendency to simply pocket the European funding and tell the public that it is they themselves that are putting the aid measures in place. That is something I regard as unacceptable; we know that the European Union has a credibility deficit, and it is by this instrument that the EU shows that it stands by ordinary people in a credible way. The source of aid funds must not be concealed; instead, the Commission must ensure that it is clearly affirmed and that every locality to which it goes receives a report stating what proportion is derived from European funds. Those are the main amendments that our group has tabled in the hope of further improving this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are overlooking the fact that the policy for dealing with natural disasters should not be confined solely to the formulation of internal policies to address and prevent them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important for the European Union to assume its share of the very heavy political responsibility for tolerating the causes of serious climate changes over recent decades. We need a stricter policy against European and any other industry that has contributed to them, inside or outside the Community borders, so that not only do they have to pay for the damage they have caused, but also – and much more importantly – they have to take measures of limitation and prevention in their future activities and bear the cost of such measures themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should also exercise its influence directly on the United States, which is completely ignoring and infringing the Kyoto Protocol and continuing its destructive action, which affects both European citizens and the citizens of the rest of the world. Foreign policy is therefore an equally important dimension. The geographical scope must be reviewed, in order to ensure support is extended to other countries beyond our immediate neighbours. This fund should apply to the various states involved, even to states who are not even candidate members, if they have been hit by an incident which has been caused by or originates in the geographical area of the Community or candidate states. In this way, other neighbouring countries will be entitled to solidarity from Europe, either through the fund or through the other mechanisms which apply to international cooperation. Our solidarity should not be confined to our borders. The fund regulation does not appear to take account of cumulative disasters or prolonged events during which a disaster develops gradually, such as drought. Cumulative disasters can also be addressed even if they took place when the fund did not exist, if they have visible consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I recognise the importance of the existence of this fund and the significant extension of its scope. This does not mean that the regulation, as it stands, satisfies us or that the policy for addressing natural disasters should be limited to it. We expect far more, not only as the European left, but also as European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An attempt is now being made to include terrorist attacks in the list of supposedly natural disasters covered by the fund. As usual, there is an ulterior motive at work here: it appears that disaster relief is to be politicised. Mr Berend suggests in his report, in the context of terrorist attacks, that the EU should be able to use the fund in such cases as a political signal of solidarity. Pandemics are also included, presumably to make the proposal acceptable to a public that is worried about things such as bird flu.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all a long way from the original intention of the fund. Who, therefore, decides what qualifies for it? Even Mr Berend says that it is incomprehensible that the Commission can make an arbitrary political assessment, thus calling into question the credentials of the institution that has produced this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, we see the confusion and incompetence of the EU in practice. Communities that have suffered disasters – natural or manmade – have their national governments to step in and assist. Even more likely to come to their aid, in cases of extreme disasters such as the tsunami, is the incredible generosity of the general public.

Although disasters on a larger scale occur on other continents, Europe is no stranger to them either. Forest fires frequently occur in southern Europe and floods are a regular occurrence in the central part of our continent. People affected by these disasters cannot be left without aid, and Member States should not be left alone to deal with the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It is laudable that, in Mr Capoulas Santos’ report, the problems in the agricultural sector are so clearly perceived, as it is a sector that is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters. The problem of natural disasters has quite rightly been linked to another issue that could be described as a socio-economic disaster. It is something that threatens European farming in the context of what has been happening at the WTO, namely sudden market liberalisation and the abolition or weakening of protective mechanisms for European agricultural markets. Considering that market protection is being reduced, it is good that we at least have the prospect of aid in the event of a natural disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the greatest merit of the reports we are discussing. The draft under discussion is an important step on the road to building true European solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Greece, for example, we have precisely this problem with the River Evros, which flows through Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece. Consequently, we need a global strategy for addressing such problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as immediate suppression is concerned, a typical example is fires, where solidarity is needed between the Member States, which is why I believe we need a European civil protection force, as proposed in the Galeote report, which deals with such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Berend report deals with the problem of restoring damage through the Solidarity Fund which has existed – and rightly so – since 2002. However, I believe that we need to lower the thresholds for the eligibility of actions, as Mr Berend quite rightly proposes, and extend the scope to include technological disasters, such as major shipwrecks or 'flu epidemics, so that we can supply the populace with vaccines and address the matter adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">The matters which we examine in the Berend report will proceed under the codecision procedure and, consequently, Parliament will fight to the end; however, on the matters addressed in the Galeote report, I think that Parliament should not lower the flag either. They are important to the citizens, they are matters which concern their daily lives and we need to fight to the end and put pressure on the Commission and the Council to proceed in the direction that we are calling for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most importantly, they cannot constitute a battle field, a field of political expediencies within the framework of the Member States. The policies of the states for materially addressing them have, in principle, two stages: prevention and response.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs and to say that the report by Mr Capoulas Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, is balanced as regards the way in which the problems and proposals are formulated. However, I should like to highlight certain points: firstly, the question of paragraph 16, on the basis of which the creation of a public cofinanced insurance scheme and a reinsurance scheme within the framework of the CAP are proposed, and on paragraphs 17 and 19, on the basis of which the establishment of a new risk management instrument and a system to stabilise the prices and incomes of farmers affected by natural disasters are proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, we must emphasise floods, a matter which exists – and we have experienced it – in Greece, in the Prefecture of Evros where, due to the absence of national measures, the area is affected every year.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that the state needs national and cofinanced projects to protect citizens' property and must be denounced by all of us when it is unable to protect citizens' lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We appealed at that time, and we continue to appeal, in the four excellent reports presented to us, not only, I would say, for a little less national self-interest regarding civil protection, but also, as Mrs Estrella proposes in paragraphs 3 and 4, for example, of her report, for enhanced European cooperation regarding civil protection. Mr Wojciechowski broadly addressed this precise point.</p>
<p class="contents">We need enhanced European cooperation for at least two good reasons. Firstly, the impact of climate change on the frequency of natural disasters, the torrential rain in northern and eastern Europe, drought and the fires that wreaked havoc last year are there to remind us of the crucial need to act, and to act quickly, on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the financial cost of these disasters is increasing, and our Member States are having more and more difficulty in meeting it by themselves. This is, of course, where the Solidarity Fund comes into its own, as it is designed to cover these emergency costs, such as the provision of water, energy and housing, or the repairing of basic infrastructure. I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank Mr Berend, who wants to make it easier immediately to access part of the payments and who also proposes to extend the benefit of the Fund to other types of disaster such as drought or even – as he mentioned – biological or chemical terrorist threats or attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will never, of course, succeed in preventing all natural disasters, but our duty is to help the Europeans who are hit by these tragedies and to coordinate our efforts more effectively in such cases. That is why, despite the reluctance of some Member States, we must also support the creation of a permanent European civil protection force, the famous ‘Green Helmets’. Let us also support the less controversial creation of an operations centre for the management of major crises.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, Commissioner - and, in saying this, I am responding to a fear expressed by Mrs Haug, which I share - we are not calling here for more Europe, but for a better Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am delighted to observe that an agreement has been concluded between our Parliament and the Commission so as to ensure that the scope of the next Solidarity Fund will from now on cover not only natural disasters, but also industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and major public health crises.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the members of the Committee on Regional Development for having supported my amendment, the aim of which is to specify that special attention will be paid to remote or isolated regions, such as island and outermost regions. This specification guarantees that, as from 2007, this Fund can potentially be used in the French Overseas Departments - even if they do not fully meet the general eligibility criteria - so that they can take advantage of emergency aid when a major crisis occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">The own-initiative report by the Committee on Regional Development highlights the devastating effect of these disasters on the economy, employment, national and cultural heritage, the environment and tourism and rightly emphasises the need for effective measures regarding warnings, civil protection and aid for the regions and populations affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur for having included my amendments concerning the outermost regions in the European strategy that he so earnestly desires, in the knowledge that, due to their geographical situation, those regions are exposed to natural risks of a specific character and intensity.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the numerous threats that regularly place a strain on those regions, from tsunamis to volcanic eruptions, earthquakes to cyclones, and, from now on, the reactivation of mosquito-borne viral diseases, such as chikungunya in Réunion or dengue in Guyana, the overseas populations are awaiting a suitable response from Europe in terms of security, prevention and solidarity.

As far as floods are concerned, neighbouring states should act together, as floods, like pollution, do not stop at borders. The flood prevention programme, like flood risk maps, should be set up not just for national states but for whole river basins.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the same kinds of disasters happen year after year, we have to make more effort in forecasting and prevention. The Solidarity Fund does not work in its present form. A new regulation is needed and it should help prevent environmental pollution as a consequence of natural disasters.

<p class="contents">As you know, a delegation visited Spain and Portugal and we were able to witness the scale of the ecological and human tragedy on the ground. We were able to hear directly from the sectors affected how the progressive abandonment of rural areas and of traditional activities creates a fertile environment for these disasters. We heard complaints from people accusing the competent administrations of abandoning the forests.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we must condemn the lack of a genuine policy for fire prevention and the leniency of the penalties relating to the causing of fires. If we are to be absolutely thorough in our observations, we must point out that, unfortunately, we have witnessed a lack of coordination between the public administrations responsible, and that, in the case of Guadalajara, this has undoubtedly aggravated the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the victims of these disasters deserve their own chapter. In the case in question, they have felt ignored in their own region. From a democratic point of view, it is unacceptable that a committee of enquiry should be set up in Castilla-La Mancha but that the families of the victims should have been excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been the European Parliament that has had to come along and put that unspeakable political behaviour right. At the hearing held in Brussels to that end, therefore, a representative of the victims spoke and the European Parliament was able to hear their fair demands as the passive victims of a tragedy that has affected their lives. At least they have been heard. The courts will now decide whether anybody needs to take responsibility, in addition to any political responsibility, which will undoubtedly have to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Committee on Regional Development for approving an amendment that I presented on the victims and I hope that plenary will vote in favour of it. That amendment urges the Commission to provide the resources necessary to alleviate the suffering and meet the material needs of all of the victims of natural disasters and their immediate families, by means of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund and other Community instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am very much in favour of the reform of the Solidarity Fund and I hope that the Commission, following the mandate from this Parliament, will present a proposal for a directive for the prevention and management of fires within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These texts, which represent Parliament’s opinion in this field, state what we have always expressed: the need to draw up and implement European policies for the prevention of those disasters, for immediate intervention capable of combating them effectively and for compensating for the damage caused. We hope that the Council and the Commission will now take Parliament’s proposals into account and respond accordingly, and we shall apply pressure in order to ensure that that happens.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the texts that we will approve also highlight the lies and agitation that, in my country specifically, have been demonstrated with regard to this action by the European Parliament, in certain cases and from certain political forces and sectors, even misleading people with regard to its very nature. Here today in this very debate we have heard untrue statements – half truths are always untrue – which are entirely contrary to Parliament’s opinion, which is expressed by means of the texts we are to approve and nothing more.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an insistence on a partisan and self-interested approach to dealing with disasters and the pain they cause for so many people, in my region, Castilla-La Mancha, for example. This kind of behaviour speaks for itself, and perfectly illustrates the nature of the people indulging in it. I have no doubt that our citizens will be able to identify the culprits.</p>

The Union should of course address this situation, but how do we go about this? I do not feel that the right response would be to create a single European policy to combat natural disasters, as proposed in one of the reports before us. I do not share the view that, once a problem is discovered, the reaction must be to regulate at Union level. As an advocate of consistent implementation of the subsidiarity principle, I take the opposite view, namely that changes to the law at Union level should only be carried out if the Member States are not able to resolve a given problem effectively by themselves. Natural disasters cannot be understood as homogeneous phenomena with single strategies and a single legal framework. Rather, the right way forward is to diversify. Floods are of a completely different nature to, say, fires or droughts. The formulation of a European strategy should be restricted to those types of natural disaster for which there can be added value attached to joint action at Union level. Otherwise, a joint strategy and directive would be meaningless and would be tantamount to excessive regulation without any positive consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the call to the Commission and the Council to table a proposal to harmonise compulsory measures aimed at punishing those who start fires is a glaring example of a violation of the subsidiarity principle. Just as fires do not usually have a European dimension, the Member States on their own should be responsible for punishing arsonists. On the other hand, I welcome the use of the proposed Galileo system for pre-empting and monitoring natural disasters across the Union, which is an important and positive aspect. As regards the Solidarity Fund Regulation, I particularly welcome the fact that financial aid will be made more accessible in the event of natural disasters, since instead of the current EUR 3 billion or 0.6% of GDP, billion-euro losses or 0.5% of GDP will be sufficient. Furthermore, where losses are lower, the Commission will, according to the proposal, be authorised to assess the situation. The Solidarity Fund will be able to help to repair any damage caused, which may for example help to improve the Union’s image in the eyes of Europe’s citizens. For this I thank all of the rapporteurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it would appear to be indispensable for the EU to take joint action either to prevent disasters or to mitigate their impact. The Solidarity Fund should therefore have a broader scope than it does at present. This would permit a faster response to crisis situations resulting from natural disasters as well as those caused by industrial or technological disasters, or by terrorist acts.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is also necessary to formulate a European strategy for dealing with the impact of natural disasters, in addition to appropriate Community prevention measures, the tailoring of Structural Funds spending to disaster prevention and closer coordination with other Community instruments. Once we have secured the necessary flexibility with regard to the distribution of available resources from various funds, we can then increase their efficiency in the event of a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, both individual Member States and the European Union institutions have to focus in particular on making the existing early warning systems more effective in order to minimise the impact of disasters. Even the largest Solidarity Fund imaginable, let alone the actual level of funding available over the next seven years, would not be able to cover all the costs incurred by European Union citizens each year as a result of the damage caused by unforeseen disasters and catastrophes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These proposals relate to natural disasters, such as fires, droughts and floods. In Ireland, thankfully, we do not have forest fires or droughts; we have lots of rain – sometimes too much – but no major floods. Therefore, the Galeote Quecedo report is of little relevance to Ireland: it is heavily oriented towards the Mediterranean. I have no problem with that. If we are a European Community we must support each other, while at the same time respecting the principle of subsidiarity. European solidarity is the spirit that should underpin all our responses to initiatives such as the reports we are debating today. The Solidarity Fund is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">These reports are well drafted. In the Galeote Quecedo report the emphasis is on prevention, research and risk management. It also proposes identifying vulnerable areas so that preventive measures can be put in place well in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">What is crucially important is that the environmental issue should be taken into consideration. Many of the environmental problems we are now encountering are caused by climate change and they are self-inflicted. Droughts and floods in particular are the direct result of environmental neglect and mismanagement: they are manmade.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is supposed to be leading the way in terms of environmental change, but at the same time the reality is that we are still destroying the world’s environment and we are doing it on a daily basis: greenhouse gas emission levels, for example, are being ignored by many EU countries, including, sadly, my own country. The sooner we, as a world community, wake up to this reality, the less will be the need to produce and to adopt the crisis-management measures that we are debating and, hopefully, adopting today.</p>

Natural disasters belong to the latter group.</p>
<p class="contents">Frequent floods, such as those in the region I come from, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also the fires which are typical in the southern part of our continent, are real challenges for the international community, including the European Parliament. It is important in this context that, instead of increasing the funds set aside for such matters in the 2007-2013 budget, we should make them more flexible and remove the red tape which makes it impossible to use the funds in line with the types of disasters that occur. A good example is the situation in Poland in 1997, before enlargement, when my country was affected by major flooding and these funds were reallocated.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must make use of both the Structural Funds in order to minimise the effects of disasters, as well the European Solidarity Fund to help the victims of such disasters. As Mr Wojciechowski said a short time ago, this is an example of European solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, we all recognise the importance of being prepared for disasters. We all wish for a better response to emergency situations. Significantly, we all recognise the need to work together. The resolutions passed by Parliament last year, these commendable reports and the Commission’s proposals all aim to achieve the same purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for increased cooperation in civil protection clearly reflects the Commission’s line of thought. To react effectively to a disaster, we need to have all our available resources in a state of ready deployment. When these do not suffice or are unavailable, the Commission needs to be empowered to find alternative means.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the agricultural aspects, I should like to emphasise that the Commission will do its utmost to optimise the use of existing instruments. It is clear that, at this stage, solutions or assistance for the agricultural or forestry sector in the event of natural disasters will have to come via existing instruments under the rural development and forest policies, state aid and the possibilities that exist under the first pillar of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be more cautious as regards greater budgetary flexibility to ease the problems for the agricultural sector. We are tied to the funds available. I see major difficulties in using underspent budget lines for disaster relief purposes, but the Commission is prepared to analyse the feasibility of any suggestions. One difficulty, for example, is that we will only know with any certainty late in the budget year whether there is any margin left in the budget. Finally, it should be remembered that in the future we will be more likely to have to apply financial discipline, which will reduce the likelihood of underspent amounts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also examining whether risk and crisis management instruments to support the agricultural sector could be a way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly grateful for the great expression of support the Commission’s proposal to adjust and improve the EU Solidarity Fund has received today. With the new fund, the EU will have an instrument at its disposal that allows it effectively to assist Member States and candidate countries whenever a crisis situation arises. An act of European solidarity can be counted on, no matter whether in response to a natural or another kind of serious disaster. This will be good not only for the European Union’s image but also, more importantly, for the Union, the Member States and acceding countries and their regions and, in particular, for the people affected by such disastrous events.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur and other honourable Members have spoken in favour of all major elements of the Commission proposal. This represents invaluable support in steering the proposal through the remaining steps of the legislative procedure. In the light of this far-reaching agreement between our two institutions, the Commission appeals to the Member States and the Council to rethink their position which, up to now, has certainly been much less favourable than that of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that you have proposed to grant Solidarity Fund assistance to candidate countries only if the same disaster also affects a Member State, even if this issue has not been discussed today. While I understand the underlying reason – i.e. not to financially overburden the fund – this proposal puts candidate countries in a worse position than they are currently in. At present, they are on an equal footing with Member States as regards eligibility for the fund. I would ask honourable Members to reflect again on whether politically this is what they really want.</p>
<p class="contents">I also note that the use of the Solidarity Fund for preventative measures has been proposed. There can be no doubt that prevention is an extremely important part of a comprehensive policy in relation to disasters, a view the Commission fully supports. But it cannot be the role of the Solidarity Fund, which has been designed to bear some of the emergency costs incurred by Member States in dealing with disasters. At EU level, prevention and reconstruction measures can be supported by the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund, or by agricultural funds. In fact, risk prevention is one of the European Rural Development Fund’s priorities for the period 2007-2013. In addition, rural development measures under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund can finance the restoration of agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and the introduction of appropriate prevention instruments, including risk prevention for forest fires.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to strengthen all of the European Union’s existing instruments for the benefit of our environment and, more importantly, for the safety and wellbeing of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those Members who said that actions of solidarity and actions taken to prevent disasters and deal with their consequences will bring Europe closer to its citizens. These issues are extremely important in order to get the European citizens’ full support for our work. That is why I should like to thank again all the rapporteurs, Mr Capoulas Santos, Mr Galeote Quecedo, Mrs Estrela and Mr Berend, for their excellent reports that will strengthen European identity.</p>

Due to the recurrence of such events, it is of the utmost importance that the solidarity instrument should allow for appropriate EU level response to major crises. As with the instruments that are currently available, it is extremely difficult to react properly, as illustrated by recent events.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly welcome our rapporteur’s approach, which argues that the Solidarity Fund must be adapted to new challenges and that there is potential for improvement in the way it is used. Major natural disasters within the Union can cause significant human, economic and environmental damages as well as it can affect more than just one European country. We must ensure that effective and targeted Community action is possible in areas where public opinion expects the Community to act. In this respect, we must also ensure that fund’s financial resources match its geographically and thematically enlarged scope of application. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also feel that these regions will only be able to make a decisive contribution towards creating sustainable employment and towards economic growth in the EU if the existing financial measures specially created to offset the negative effects on regional economies, the dispersion, small size and distance from the European mainland of the outermost regions are stepped up. In other words, I believe that a better and more effective Union requires better policies and more resources, with a view to sustainable development, which will in turn contribute towards economic and territorial cohesion, the primary objective of cohesion policy, as enshrined in the Treaties.</p>

<p class="contents">Among other objectives, competitiveness, privatisation, reducing the public sector and the role of the State in the economy, public-private partnerships, support for the infrastructure of recently privatised sectors and flexibility of the labour market have become objectives of the pseudo-policy of ‘cohesion’.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of the change of priority of the Funds – relegating ‘economic and social cohesion’ – is much more significant than it might first appear, even though some concerns do emerge as to whether this will be to the detriment of 'cohesion'.</p>
<p class="contents">Originally, the report clearly rejected the idea that a minimum of 60% of the amounts of the Structural Fund for convergence regions (75% for the others) must be earmarked for funding the objectives of the ‘Lisbon Strategy', and that that criterion had been accepted via Parliament's adoption of the interinstitutional agreement.</p>

We are particularly concerned at the excessive prominence attached to the economic and business dimension that the rapporteur has sought to include in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">What is thus being promoted is a development policy in which the EU’s economic and geo-strategic interests take precedence over the interests of the countries with which it establishes relations. What is more, ‘cooperation with international financial institutions’ is being proposed, demonstrating the support for the policy of structural reforms and adjustments promoted by those institutions. This is seen, for example, in the plundering of the natural resources and the wealth of many countries, in the exploitation of the work force, and in the privatisation of essential goods and services, such as water, health and social security.</p>
<p class="contents">Attempts are being made, in a somewhat underhand manner, to export and intensify capitalist exploitation and the current neoliberal model under the cloak of ‘consolidation of the rule of law’ and ‘good governance’.</p>
<p class="contents">The set of general priorities and principles being established gives us the greatest concern with regard to the set of ‘simplified regulations’ to follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad to see we have achieved breakthroughs on review and expiry clauses to allow for better modifications and reporting.</p>

<p class="contents">Rather than the issue of whether there are one or two instruments, depending on whether the countries involved are industrialised or not, the important thing is that the EU ought to be aware of its financial limitations – all too evident in the next financial framework – and must therefore set out clear priorities and criteria for action. Given that it is impossible to attend to all situations, the priority regions and programmes need to be identified. This, rather than the number of programmes, is the crucial question. Furthermore, international cooperation is not an exercise in competition between possible world powers. More than anything, it must be a coherent expression of an external policy that respects values, principles and priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the representative of EU citizens, the European Parliament has a great and immense responsibility where human rights are concerned. Firstly, within the Union itself by ensuring that the Member States ratify and implement the major international human rights treaties. Secondly, the Union, as an area of peace and democracy, must remain the guarantor for human rights in the world by ensuring that our declarations based on our values are followed through in all European policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In speaking of ‘the powerful impact the EU can have on human rights when it speaks with one voice’, particularly at the UN, and in drafting proposals designed to increase this ‘impact', Mr Howitt's report is in keeping with the idea that consists in gradually depriving the Member States of their sovereignty regarding foreign policy, to the advantage of the European institutions.

A majority in this House, voting by roll-call, was also found to reject the demand that the UN should mount an investigation ‘into the human rights violations committed by the international coalition, particularly as regards the use of prohibited weapons such as white phosphorus in the attack on Fallujah and the collective punishments inflicted on the Iraqi population, which are banned by international agreements’. This vote may be taken as emblematic of the double standards to be found in the human rights report. Human rights violations in states with which the European Union is on friendly terms are subject to insufficient criticism or to none whatever. One consequence of this is that no reference is made to the ongoing offences against human rights in Turkey. Restrictions imposed around the world on the right to refuse to do military service are simply whitewashed away, and, if one were to go by the human rights report, neither NATO nor EU Member States are waging war or participating in warfare at all. It was heartening, though, to note the adoption of a motion on the Western Sahara in which the Group of the Left denounced ‘the continued violations of the human rights of Saharaui population’ and called for ‘the protection of the Saharaui people’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Establishing clear priorities has become increasingly important in the case of the external actions budget heading given the cuts amounting to around 20% in funds committed. More than ever the trade dimension continues to impact on domestic political priorities in the budget. If the Doha Round is successfully concluded, the conditional agreement on the definitive elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies by 2013 would translate into incremental yearly EC budget savings that are estimated to be around EUR 3 500-4 000 million per year, depending on internal and world market prices, as of 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for a forthcoming report on trade-related assistance and draftsman for the annual strategic priorities, I have called for greater transparency in the funding of the so-called 'Barroso' billion, committed to support the trading capacity of developing countries. This pledge should not involve cosmetic re-labelling of funds given to infrastructure. The Commission must commit to producing an annual report on aid for trade to enable Parliament to scrutinise these funds and assure that they are truly additional. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within the EU, there is a host of problems resulting from freaks of nature, such as floods in central Europe and heavy storms and frost in northern Europe, yet it is forest fires in southern Europe that are the problem constantly addressed by the European Parliament as one that needs to be remedied through the EU. We believe, however, that it is exclusively the Member States affected that are responsible for ensuring that measures are taken in this area. The fact is that, if the Member States are relieved of responsibility for taking such measures and for putting preventive systems in place to forestall disasters of this type, the risks will increase. In insurance theory, this is called ‘moral hazard’.</p>
<p class="contents">The report lists a host of different measures at EU level, all with attendant costs requiring significant increases in the budget. We are opposed to a specific EU programme for forest protection because we believe that it is the Member States that should assume responsibility for protecting forests. The report’s idea of awareness campaigns at EU level with a view to promoting a change of attitude towards the use of fire (paragraph 23) is one of several examples of the way in which the wealth of ideas that emerged while the report was being prepared has completely lost touch with reality.</p>

Consequently, there needs to be a compensation fund, especially for small- and medium-sized holdings which, unless they receive compensation from the ΕU and the state, cannot continue their activities because, apart from the consequences of the anti-farming policy of the ΕU, they have to deal with climatic dangers, as in my country, in the areas of Thrace and Thessalia, where their production has been destroyed by floods and they face an acute problem of survival.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we cannot ignore the fact that the frequency of unforeseen natural phenomena and the risk of the viability of farmers is a consequence of the predatory plundering of natural wealth and commercialisation of the environment, a policy which constitutes the cause and which, unfortunately, is being promoted by the ΕU with tragic consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">If this philosophy continues of not addressing the cause and of fire-fighting by giving compensation, then the consequences of the fatal climatic phenomena will soon be so great that it will be impossible to satisfy the people affected with compensation, even if it accounts for a large sum in Community and national funds.</p>

<p class="contents">In light of these situations, and the need to prevent future recurrences, the rapporteur has suggested a fresh approach to improving protection for communities and farmers from the devastating impact.

<p class="contents">Lastly, training for prevention is a further crucial measure in such situations. As part of the civil protection measures, the Forest Focus programme and the rural development programmes, we have a framework in place for the necessary measures for raising awareness among communities and prevention training and information for those responsible for crisis management in these situations.

It is proposed, for example, that a European observatory be established. We do believe that cross-border environmental problems should be dealt with at EU level. It is, however, extremely doubtful whether natural disasters are cross-border in character. The issue of rivers bursting their banks may be something that can be resolved at EU level, but there is already a rivers directive that regulates how this type of problem might be tackled. Where fires are concerned, we believe that it is up to each Member State to create the structures required for preventing these and the damage they cause. If the EU were to cough up every time a natural disaster occurred, there would naturally be fewer incentives to do preventive work. This would lead to further and more serious disasters occurring in the future, something that would obviously be very harmful to the environment and expensive for taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur wants the EU to call on the Member States to establish national forest funds for the prevention of natural disasters.

<p class="contents">What both reports have in common is that they rely heavily on an EU framework with the primary intention of preventing (natural) disasters, responding to them and dealing with them.

<p class="contents">These proposals do, nevertheless and very rightly, remind us of the importance of preventative action.

The report provides a whole range of examples of how to go about this.</p>
<p class="contents">To European aid in a crisis, then, one has to say ‘yes’, but the prevention of disasters is primarily a responsibility for the Member States, and it is a responsibility from which we should not discharge them by passing it on to the European level; the same is true when it comes to organising the response to crisis situations, otherwise known as ‘European civil protection’. There is no need for new powers in respect of civil protection and disaster prevention; they would result in twin-tracking and wasted money in administrative systems.</p>
<p class="contents">That neighbouring states within Europe should help each other when disaster strikes is, then, perfectly obvious; what Europe can do is to help with programmes promoting improved coordination and alleviating material need.

His imposition of a state of emergency had been justified on the basis that the authorities had failed to defeat the Maoists in battle. What has been going on in Nepal over recent months has been quite unparalleled.</p>
<p class="contents">Having visited it over a dozen times, I know this state in the Himalayas very well. Its people had spent years enduring a terror regime with arbitrary arrests, and they vented their fury in active resistance, which will, in due course, make a return to democracy possible. A new multi-party coalition under a very experienced prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, commenced face-to-face negotiations with the rebels. It is planned that a constitutional assembly be summoned to decide what form the state should take in future, and the Maoists have declared themselves willing to accept its decision. I believe it to be particularly important that they should now also lay down their weapons and cease from standing in the way of the country’s democratic development.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the new coalition will be able to muster all its forces in order to maintain public safety on a lasting basis. Political detainees, human rights activists, students and journalists must be set at liberty. The tens of thousands who have been sent into exile must at last be allowed back into their homeland without needing to fear for their lives. I now expect the Tibetan refugee centre and the Dalai Lama’s office in Kathmandu to be reopened.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans should show our solidarity by sending a group of MEPs to Nepal as soon as possible. Let us encourage those who are involved in the re-establishment of democracy, both the non-governmental organisations and the ordinary public, who will need not only technical and financial help from outside – important though that is – but also stability and peace at home. Let us hope, too, that tourism – the main source of income for a country that is still a fascinating one – will flourish once more: Namaste! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I must say that some things simply do stand out. Before I entered the Chamber, a journalist asked me if I thought that the European Union should become involved in reinstating democracy in the world. I said that the European Union obviously has limited powers and that we must always support certain values.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that the situation in Nepal is unique. It is not merely a simple choice, based on the fact that the strong rule of a king has exceeded the mandate granted to the latter by Nepalese law, and as a consequence has brought with it serious problems for many Nepalese citizens. It is also a problem of the Maoist guerrillas in Nepal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember that we must be very careful when deciding who to support in Nepal. It would be a great tragedy for the country if, after the king is removed from dictatorial power which he wilfully claimed and after a short transitional period of democracy, Maoist tyranny should ensue.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that revolutionary Communists have frequently acted in such a fashion: they fought against a strong monarchy under the banner of democracy and then destroyed democracy in order to build their tyrannical governments. We must be very careful and, whilst supporting democratic change, demand respect for minorities and the opening of a centre for refugees from Tibet, which is something that was mentioned by Mr Mann. At the same time, we must carefully monitor the situation so that we can prevent one bad solution becoming another, even worse, solution. That will be the task of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not acceptable that, in any country, wherever in the world, all power should be in the hands of one person, as was, I think, formerly the case with the King of Nepal. There is certainly no doubt that we, here in this Chamber, at the heart of European democracy, should support by all means available the developments towards democracy in Nepal. I think that the king has acted reasonably in calling a constitutional assembly in order to endow Nepal with a good new constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me as particularly important that every group, whether currently outside Nepal or present within it, should be able to regard the electoral system as representative and inclusive, for, in Nepal too, representative democracy must prevail. The great question is: what can Europe do about it at this stage? If it is thought to be of value in terms of the development of democracy, and if the parties and the prime minister think it useful, that a delegation from this House should go to Nepal in order to give support at this time of change, then that – it goes without saying – is what we must do.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the European Union should become actively involved, at a high level, in the negotiations on the new constitution. It may well be that we can make some contribution, and I am in agreement with the wording of the resolution according to which we should do this together with the other major powers, not least the United States and India.</p>
<p class="contents">More time will be needed to enable the wounds from the past to heal, but we must use all means available, including money and financial resources, in an attempt to help them do that as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The SAARC delegation and I, as its chairman, have been concerned since the imposition of direct rule by the King, and have worked with the Troika to promote a return to democracy. Finally this has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">The new government faces many challenges, including limiting the King’s power and bringing the military under democratic control. I therefore welcome the fact that today they are already discussing a new role for the monarchy, which I hope will prevent any kind of return to the disruption to democracy that we saw over the last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The main priority for my delegation is to see the establishment of lasting peace, and Maoist cooperation is pivotal to achieving this. The fact that the ceasefire has been respected is an indication that the right environment for peace talks is being created. However, I call on the Maoists to demonstrate their genuine commitment to stop recruiting militia, to put an end to any extortion and to return confiscated land. Both sides need to make the ceasefire permanent and to enter into a constructive dialogue as soon as possible, with the aim of holding free and fair elections and putting the Maoists on the same footing as the other political parties.</p>

King Gyanendra’s decision in February 2005 to dissolve the government and declare a state of emergency has been the straw that broke the camel’s back in terms of Nepalese patience. We must make it absolutely clear that it has been the demonstrations in favour of democracy and peace that have forced this change.</p>
<p class="contents">Those demonstrations, which were dealt with brutally by the police and which have left several people dead and many injured, have forced the king to abandon the <span class="italic">de facto</span> military dictatorship, to restore Parliament and to hand the administration over to a government made up of a multi-party alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now seeing a glimpse of a new opportunity to reach a peace agreement with the Maoist guerrillas, which had previously declared genuine ceasefires which were rejected by the King; now, however, the ceasefire has been accepted. Our hope is that what is currently a temporary ceasefire will soon become a permanent one.</p>
<p class="contents">In the mean time, we must welcome the move from arms to the political arena, as demonstrated by the agreement that the Maoists have signed with the multi-party coalition to hold elections to a constituent assembly in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">This Resolution also gives us the opportunity to welcome the fact that the government has repealed the royal decrees restricting press freedom and establishing strict controls on NGOs and also to call for the release of all of the political prisoners, journalists and human rights activists remaining in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must monitor the situation very closely and assist this process wisely. For example, the new government has decided to freeze the purchase by the previous government of military aircraft and weapons; the Council and the Member States must respect this decision and must maintain the freeze on military aid. Nepal no longer needs arms, but rather it needs to return to democratic and institutional normality. Furthermore, as has been said, the European Union must contribute to the peace process, providing assistance for demobilisation and economic aid for development and humanitarian programmes and also sending electoral and human rights observers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certain regions in the individual countries are in rebel hands and this is true of most of the territory of Afghanistan and Nepal. Whilst in Afghanistan the countryside is in the hands of the chiefs of clans and tribes, 75% of Nepal is controlled by groups with which the official authorities have so far refused to negotiate. After the king assumed absolute power, other political players also ran out of patience and in February 2006 people took to the streets. Now that a new coalition government has been formed, there is vital work that needs to be done; for example, the constitution needs to be changed to include safeguards of democracy and, most importantly, the involvement of all stakeholders in resolving the situation. According to the most recent reports, this is the current state of affairs. Preparations for elections of course need to be speeded up. An elected parliament should draw up a new constitution at the earliest opportunity, and our job is to support the process of democratisation, an integral part of which is freedom of the media and development of the country’s economy. The resolution that we have proposed and supported will contribute in the search for a democratic path out of the current crisis, and I believe that the Commission has already earmarked appropriate funds to support the entire process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nepal’s problems demonstrate the weakness of the EU, but the recent reinstatement of democracy gives us the opportunity to demonstrate our strengths. In the absence of a collective will to find a solution in Nepal, we cannot impose one.

<p class="contents">This resolution contains a number of worthy ideas, in particular the establishment of an international contact group and continued engagement of the international community within Nepal, guiding all these democratic forces. We must continue to support the democratic growth of Nepal. We cannot criticise and we must have a clean pair of hands in our negotiations with all parties in that country. I commend every mechanism within this resolution to the House and I hope to hear from the Commissioner that the Commission will continue to support us in this aim. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The impact of the people’s democratic movement is impressive: Parliament has been restored, the government is committed to electing a Constituent Assembly to rewrite the Constitution and, most importantly, talks will soon be under way between the new interim government and the Maoists, under a mutually agreed ceasefire. This is a major victory for the Nepalese people.</p>
<p class="contents">There is now a tremendous opportunity for the new government to restore democracy and pursue a peace process, but the many challenges that lie ahead should not be underestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">The victory of the pro-democracy movement marks only the first step in Nepal’s long road to peace and stability. The new interim government is faced with important challenges: planning for constitutional changes, keeping the peace process with the Maoists on track and responding to calls for transitional justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary goal must now be to agree a formal ceasefire and bring an end to hostilities between the Royal Nepalese Army and the Maoists. The second is to take forward a peace process based on constitutional redress. The third is to ensure that Nepal emerges again on the world scene as a stable democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a key role in helping Nepal through this difficult process. The Commission is ready to contribute to a possible peace package. Such a package could include, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, support for elections, election observation, ceasefire monitoring and the necessary technical assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Working closely with the European Union Member States and successive European Union Council presidencies, the Commission remains committed to pursuing all efforts that may contribute towards a stable, democratic and peaceful Nepal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conflict concerned has claimed at least 60 000 lives, and millions of people have been compulsorily displaced. This situation will never be resolved if both parties do not sit down at the negotiating table and remain there for as long as it takes to obtain a solution. The fact that the Tamil Tigers have now left the negotiating table is destructive for all the parties. They are in a minority and will never be able to achieve their aims through violence. The path of negotiation where we can be of help is that which will lead to a successful outcome and on which both parties have some prospect of gain.</p>
<p class="contents">We must turn our attention to the Sri Lankan Government. As recently as in May, at least 18 civilians were killed on Kayts Island, and there are witnesses to confirm that the Sri Lankan navy murdered innocent civilians – at least 13 of them – because they were unwilling to leave their homes. Sri Lanka is responsible for a long list of human rights violations that it has never carefully investigated. Now that the country has been elected to join the UN Human Rights Council, it is absurd that it does not itself fulfil fundamental requirements to investigate human rights violations and take measures to bring their perpetrators to justice. If both parties get their act together and assume their responsibilities, we too can accept responsibility for helping with the peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are committing new atrocities, and it is the Sri Lankan Government that decides where. The general image of the situation presented by some of the media is that it is a war with the heat turned down, and that description I regard as an accurate one. The question that arises has to do with what role the EU might play in de-escalating this conflict; how might it be possible to prevent it from getting even worse?</p>
<p class="contents">It has been proposed that the LTTE be, officially, put on the EU list of terrorist organisations; to do so would be extremely counter-productive, particularly in the present situation, as it has not been possible to hold the negotiations on EU territory and the fact that there is any kind of negotiating process at all is thanks to the Norwegian Government in particular. That being so, the way the EU should do its bit for de-escalation is to refrain from apportioning blame, something of which the proposed resolution is a lamentably bad example, in that it tends, fairly one-sidedly, to present the LTTE as the guilty party. The Sri Lankan Government, too, has recently done much to crank up the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a quite different respect in which the EU plays an important part in this, for some of its Member States are continuing to deport people to Sri Lanka, consigning them to a situation of simmering warfare, and these deportations must be brought to an immediate halt. We must get really actively involved, without attaching blame to one side or the other, and that is a demand I make not only of the Commission, but also of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The LTTE is interested in one thing and one thing only, and that is political power. It does not represent all of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka. It certainly does not speak for them. Its murderous campaign has not improved their situation one iota. On the contrary, the Tamils, like all the other people of Sri Lanka, continue to suffer casualties, economic hardship and disruptive lives because of the uncertain and dangerous security situation. I hope it is not too late for the LTTE to pull back from the brink.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of this year there had been optimism that the ceasefire agreement would be reinforced and that substantial progress towards peace would be achieved. The failure of the LTTE to agree to a second round of Geneva negotiations and its resumption of a terrorist campaign have removed this hope. It is imperative that the LTTE is held to account for its actions and that further international pressure is brought to bear on it at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Mr Pflüger, I therefore urge the EU to add the LTTE to its list of proscribed terrorist organisations. I do not see this as a hindrance to future negotiations, but as a major incentive for the LTTE to stop the violence. At the same time, this ban must be backed by effective action by Member States to prevent funds and other support reaching the LTTE. Human Rights Watch, a highly respected international NGO, has testified to the intimidation, extortion and physical violence that has been inflicted on Tamils living in Britain and other countries in order to suppress criticism and ensure a steady flow of income.</p>
<p class="contents">Every EU country where there is a Tamil community should establish special police taskforces to investigate and prosecute the agents of the LTTE, as well as freezing bank accounts linked to them. This should be seen as another dimension to the war on terrorism. For its part, the LTTE should immediately impose a ceasefire, give up its child soldiers, stop its suicide bombings, and agree to return to the conference table in a positive and constructive spirit. That is the greatest service it could provide to the Tamils and all the people of Sri Lanka. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all, of course, urged them to return to the negotiating table – I say all of us, but if we ban them they will not be able to do that – because a political solution is the only hope. Already LTTE delegations to EU Member States will not be received.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, as I have said, is considering listing the LTTE as a terrorist organisation. Surely it can see that will probably happen if there is any more violence and it will just be isolated even further. Negotiation is the only way forward, but negotiation should involve all groups, including other Tamil organisations – peaceful Tamil organisations, such as the Tamil United Liberation Front, for instance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Government must also play its part and it is certainly not blameless in this. Both sides have violated the ceasefire. Both sides have, I believe, committed gross violations of human rights. I call on the Sri Lankan Government, for instance, to investigate fully and to prosecute cases of extra-judicial killing. It says it is investigating, but I want a full investigation. I want it to reinstate the Human Rights Commission. On the other hand, I want the Tamil Tigers to cease their violence completely, stop using child soldiers and return the child soldiers they are using to their families. Only if all parties show restraint that will we prevent further violence, otherwise it is the ordinary citizens, yet again, who will suffer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all condemn the violence taking place in Sri Lanka and we all bemoan the loss of life. We have highlighted the points we have in common and, having worked on a joint resolution, I really regret the inflammatory remarks made a few minutes ago by Mr Van Orden, who seems to have made a ‘hit-and-run’ contribution and left the Chamber. It shows a fundamental misunderstanding not just of the process in this House but also of the severity of the situation and of the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lynne highlighted a couple of points that need to be re-emphasised, for instance, for a peace process to be successful, all parties have to be involved in it. Perhaps we were wrong to talk in the resolution only of the LTTE and the government, when there are plenty of other organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been too many unexplained deaths in Sri Lanka, whether it was that of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar or the Tamil MP Joseph Pararajasingham, both of whom I and others had met and both of whom had been present in this Chamber. We hear about many deaths, but too many go unreported.</p>
<p class="contents">We must give full support to the peace process, but we must recognise, as Mr Pflüger and others have said, that unfortunately, in a civil conflict like this, a lot of people are involved. We need them all around the table and we cannot apportion blame beforehand. Paragraph 17 on prescription will have a serious and negative impact on the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Human Rights Commission is now up and running.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it was Winston Churchill who said that ‘jaw-jaw is always better than war-war’. What we have to do is continue talking. There is no final military solution to this conflict, which has now raged in the country of my birth for over 25 years. Thousands of people have died and, with no possibility of a military solution, we must negotiate and talk until a commonality of interest is found.</p>
<p class="contents">Who should do the talking? The European Union is a Co-Chair and I am led to believe that the Council has decided to ban the LTTE as a terrorist organisation. But we must continue to talk and the EU and the Co-Chairs, including Norway, in consultation with India, now have the role of peacemakers. We have to bring peace to the island. The intransigence of the LTTE, which periodically talks peace and then goes back to war, has got to stop. The international community is not going to be fooled anymore by this stop-go, stop-go process.

I would appeal to all parties to renounce the vicious cycle of violence and to approach this dispute constructively. All parties must abandon violence once and for all. After an encouraging return to the negotiating table in February, the LTTE’s refusal to participate in the second round in April was very disappointing. The LTTE needs to resume peace negotiations with the Government of Sri Lanka, and the government too must be careful not to jeopardise the very delicate peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view the Commission needs to play a more proactive role to enable this process to move forward. The European Union, as we have heard, is a Co-Chair, but we appear to be playing a rather passive role, rather than seeing ourselves as dynamic players.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that together with the other Co-Chairs – the USA, Norway and Japan – we should urgently consider how we can strengthen Norway’s role as facilitator, in order to make positive progress towards a peaceful resolution and to get an agreed roadmap to end this conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is pouring enormous resources into Sri Lanka. We need to get some real results to ensure that the lives of the people there are remarkably improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are dealing with here is a sort of suppurating swelling that breaks out from time to time. I agree with all those speakers who have said that it is no solution at all to have recourse to force of arms in order to win a particular dispute. We should instead carry on talking. The great question is: what is the best way to do this?</p>
<p class="contents">Norway has been acting as a mediator since 2002, and Mrs Gill and the other Member were quite right to point that out, but whether Europe can play a more significant role is a major issue. Would it do any good if a major politician from Europe were to go to Sri Lanka to talk with the two sides and with other interested parties too? A delegation of us went there last year, and, at the time, the suggestion was made from various quarters that it might be useful if some greater power than Norway were to emerge as mediator. I would be particularly appreciative if the Commission could let us know what it thinks of this suggestion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now faced with a further round of violence and another opportunity to supply weapons, to criticise the Sri Lankan Government and to lay down very peculiar conditions for the Colombo Government to take part in the next possible round of peace talks. Who is so interested in the possible deposits of oil and gas between the shores of the island and the federal state of Tamil Nadu? Sadly the motion for a resolution fails to answer this question. Perhaps the next one will. Right now, all we can do is support the resolution. I would merely like to conclude with a question for Mr Schlyter, an advocate of ethnic rights.

Conflict in this region has already claimed 64 000 victims and a further 300 lives have been lost in a series of terrorist attacks during the last six months. A week ago, the attacks of 11 May culminated in the sinking of a navy vessel with 18 people on board. The lives of peacekeeping observers are also in serious danger.</p>
<p class="contents">These incidents undermine the already fragile ceasefire and threaten to destroy it completely. According to the principles of the peace agreement, the territorial waters around Sri Lanka lie under the jurisdiction of the government, and both sides are fully responsible for protecting local observers. It is particularly worrying that the escalating conflict is preventing the economic development of the island, that aid is not reaching those affected by the tsunami, that there is growing racial and ethnic discrimination, that children are recruited to the military and that the independence of the media is limited.</p>
<p class="contents">International institutions must categorically condemn the terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka to date. Support should be given to measures to set up a second round of conciliation talks and to work towards mobilising local communities to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict and to prevent the shedding of civilian blood, especially the blood of children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission shares your concerns about the worrying situation in the country. It is clear that the situation in Sri Lanka is now at a critical juncture. However, the solution can only be a negotiated settlement of the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the first round of talks in Geneva in February, the Commission was rather optimistic about the readiness of the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to enter into discussions on the implementation of the ceasefire agreement as a prelude to possible talks on an overall peace settlement. The Commission is very disappointed that the second round of peace talks has now been put back indefinitely and that there are no prospects for new talks at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very concerned at the recent deterioration in the situation, in particular the suicide attack directed against the army chief, Lieutenant General Fonseka, and the recent rebel attack in northern Sri Lanka against a troop carrier and accompanying vessel, which killed 17 soldiers. Both actions led to retaliatory air strikes on rebel positions, causing casualties and deaths. We are clearly witnessing a very serious escalation.</p>
<p class="contents">The navy attack was an open violation of the ceasefire agreement by the LTTE and is made more serious by the known presence of Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission monitors.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has repeatedly condemned violent acts that have caused death and suffering among all the communities. The European Union has called on both parties to do all in their power to show restraint and to prevent further violence.</p>
<p class="contents">These new developments are important for the EU in its role as a Co-Chair of the Tokyo Donor Conference, and we should carefully calibrate our response. An extraordinary Co-Chairs’ meeting in Oslo at the end of April took stock of the situation. A new meeting of the Co-Chairs is scheduled to take place in Tokyo on 30 May.</p>
<p class="contents">The indications are that neither side seems keen to continue the peace negotiations and go to the planned second round of peace talks in Geneva. However, neither side wants to pull out completely and be accused of triggering all-out war.</p>
<p class="contents">We thus continue to monitor the situation very closely and will explore any opportunity that could help stabilise the situation in Sri Lanka and lead to a peaceful, negotiated resolution of the conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is my view that, with all due respect to the Government of the People’s Republic of China and without violating any relevant United Nations resolutions, the 23 million Taiwanese people should, for the sake of world health, be allowed to be represented by their own observers in the WHO.

Our demand, which centres on Taiwan's being granted observer status at the World Health Organisation, is a public health issue of the utmost importance. It concerns both the 20 million residents of the island and the entire international community, us included. Given the issues at stake – among which I will simply mention the dangers of an epidemic that are threatening us – this demand is the bare minimum.</p>

Nobody, surely, would wish to do so, but the situation in Taiwan appears to be an exception. The health of its 23 million citizens, and also that of the many foreigners who live on the island, is in serious danger. Why is this so? It is, quite simply, for political reasons that Taipei is being systematically excluded from the activities of the World Health Organisation, and this is an intolerable and shameful state of affairs. During my visit to Taiwan, I also heard this charge levelled not only by Europeans who think as I do, but also by the indigenous population.</p>
<p class="contents">I am prompted to support this clear resolution even more strongly as a result of a very recent development in Taipei – as recent as this week, according to senior European diplomatic sources. Most of all, the Taiwanese authorities wanted to depoliticise WHO membership.

<p class="contents">I have three points to make. Firstly, this resolution is an abuse of our Rules of Procedure. Rule 115 is not intended to be used in this way. If it were, I would have attempted to raise the issue of the sadly mismanaged primary healthcare trust in west Gloucestershire closing two out of two local hospitals in Lydney and Cinderford. We all know what this is about: it is an attempt to undermine by creeping resolution our one-China policy – a perfectly reasonable political position, which I do not happen to support. Let us have an honest debate about it rather than hide within the Trojan Horse of supposed healthcare issues. The resolution is a serious one: it is true that Parliament has previously supported Taiwanese observer status at the WHA – not the WHO.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network comprises a series of 40 different institutions from amongst the almost 200 Member States of the WHO. There is no universality, so there is no Taiwan gap. In fact, a number of NGOs with Taiwanese membership are members of GOARN and, therefore, they have no shortage of information.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, given the quarter to half a million Taiwanese immigrants in Shanghai alone who regularly travel between China and Taiwan, it is hard to imagine that the Chinese would take any risks of them bringing in diseases from Taiwan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means that Taiwan has decided that, in this area, substance and pragmatism are more important than legal form. That is the position the EU supports.</p>
<p class="contents">In May 2004, the Irish Presidency, explaining why the EU did not support a vote on the issue of Taiwan’s observer status in the WHO, asked the WHO Secretariat for Taiwanese officials to be involved in technical work and meetings of the WHO where appropriate. The Irish Presidency referred to the WHO principle of the ‘enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health’ as one of the fundamental rights of every human being and also to the precedent that had been created by the involvement of and practical cooperation with health officials from Taiwan during the SARS crisis, which could serve as an example.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, in view of the arrival of avian influenza and the risk that implies, the Austrian Presidency, after discussion with Member States and the Commission, again took up the issue of practical cooperation with the WHO. Subsequently, on 2 May, EU representatives in Geneva had a very constructive meeting with the Director-General of the WHO. In fact, over the last year, representatives from Taiwan have participated in a number of technical meetings taking place under WHO auspices. Our clear understanding is that the WHO Secretariat is prepared to further explore possibilities for Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the technical work of the WHO. We can only welcome this and will follow the matter with great interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Directive applies only to labour-intensive services of the kind listed in Annex K of the Sixth VAT Directive and which, being rendered locally, cannot result in distortions of competition.</p>

<p>For the 12th year in succession, the European Court of Auditors has refused to sign off the EU budget, because it was able formally to account for the proper use of only nine percent of expenditure. A business manager involved in such wrongdoings would soon end up in prison. It is specifically in the payment of EU subsidies – which are administered by the relevant authorities in the Member States – that irregularities repeatedly arise. Rather than constantly looking for new sources of funding – in the form of EU taxes, for example – and raising expenditure, it is high time that the fight against fraud was stepped up and money wasting was finally brought under control.</p>
<p>What is the Council’s position on this matter and what ways of improving the situation are being considered?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) The Council shares the concern that the honourable Member has expressed at the Court of Auditors’ inability, for what is now the eleventh year in succession, to issue a Statement of Assurance (termed a DAS) in respect of the transactions to which much of the EU’s annual accounts refers. The Council has regularly and repeatedly addressed this lamentable state of affairs in its discharge recommendations, in particular in its recommendation in respect of the Budget years 2002 and 2003<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. When it came to the financial year 2004, though, the Court of Auditors was able to establish that progress had been made in developing the supervisory and control systems associated with the pre-accession strategy and with parts of the common agricultural policy in which the Integrated Administration and Control System was being properly used.</p>
<p>The Council has examined the Commission communication on a timetable for the creation of an integrated internal control framework, which would make a positive statement of assurance more likely.</p>
<p>The Economic and Financial Affairs Council, in the conclusions that it adopted in relation to this communication on 8 November 2005<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, confirmed that a ‘positive DAS’ was an ambitious medium-term goal, and went on to make a number of recommendations relating to such subjects as simplification, control systems, measures to be taken by the Commission, the role of the Member States, declarations and decentralise management of EU funds and audit issues. A number of these aspects are also reflected in the InterInstitutional Agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which was signed this morning.</p>
<p>Where the combating of fraud is concerned, the Council attaches the greatest importance to the protection of the European Union’s financial interests and shares the honourable Member’s view that it is in the interests of the EU to take effective action to make the EU’s expenditure more effective and make better use of the resources allocated to all programmes. </p>
<p>On 8 November 2005, the Council also adopted conclusions on the special report No 1/2005<a href="#defann_2_3" name="refann_2_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> of the Court of Auditors on the management of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)<a href="#defann_2_4" name="refann_2_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, in which it strongly urged both OLAF and the Member States to step up their cooperation in order to achieve better coordination of their anti-fraud activities and improve the exchange of information.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Commission is contemplating submitting an amended proposal relating to Regulation No 1073/1999, and the Council will carefully examine it.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council wishes to point out that the President of the Court of Auditors, when presenting the Court’s annual report for 2004 to Parliament on 14 November 2005, stated that the Court’s qualified opinion was to be interpreted neither to mean that all the transactions to which the payments budget for 2004 referred were defective, nor as an indication that fraud had been committed.</p>
<p>In line with its 8 November 2005 conclusions, the Council will continue to endeavour to improve sound financial management in all areas of the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The directive applies, inter alia – as indeed already did the so-called ‘Second Money Laundering Directive’ of 2001 – to casinos and provides that the identity of all visitors to casinos is to be established when they purchase or sell gambling chips with a value of EUR 2 000 or more. Casinos subject to state supervision can also comply with this requirement by checking the identity of patrons as soon as they enter the casino. The directive also applies to those activities in which those institutions and persons subject to it engage over the Internet. The function of these rules, which were drafted in accordance with the international standards of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), is to effectively combat the use of games of chance for money laundering purposes in the European Union.</p>

<p>(DE) The legal framework in the European Union provides comprehensive protection against money laundering and terrorist financing. With the Second Directive on money laundering the European Union took a major step towards ensuring harmonised implementation of the international standards of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF).</p>
<p>On the basis of new developments during the revision of the FATF standards the decision was made within the European Union to take account of these as soon as possible, and to revise the 2001 Second Directive on money laundering: Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing came into force on 15 December 2005 and repealed Directives 91/308/EEC and 2001/97/EC.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 45 of Directive 2005/60/EC Member States must bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to implement the Directive by 15 December 2007. Until such national measures are in place it is impossible to judge the Directive's effectiveness. Pursuant to Article 42 of the Directive, meanwhile, the Commission is required to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council by 15 December 2009, and at least at three-yearly intervals thereafter, on the implementation of the Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0367"></a>

<p>This includes an increasing number of Council decisions under Article 27 of the Sixth Value Added Tax Directive and the Council’s work on the proposal to amend the Sixth Value Added Tax Directive with certain measures to simplify the collection of VAT and to combat tax evasion and avoidance.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member has emphasised, the combating of VAT fraud has an important place in the working programme that the Austrian Presidency has presented together with the future Finnish Presidency.</p>

<p>In May 2006 the European Union will be required to take a decision on the requests for introduction of the euro submitted by Lithuania and Slovenia. This will be the first genuine enlargement of the euro zone, which will at the same time see the introduction of euro banknotes and coins. According to various political speculations, some new Member States do not have the necessary financial prosperity to form part of the euro zone. The Director of the European Central Bank has stated that it is not enough to meet the Maastricht criteria at the time of assessment, but also in a longer-term perspective.</p>
<p>Among the eleven countries which joined the euro zone on 1 January 1999, no fewer than six have failed, at one time or another, to meet the price stability criteria. In Ireland, for example, inflation was higher than authorised between November 1998 and June 2005.</p>
<p>Inflation in Lithuania may not exceed the Maastricht criteria by more than 0.1% despite the fact that it was lower than the limit set by the criteria for six years.</p>
<p>In assessing the situation in the new countries applying to join the euro zone, will consideration be given to the experience of euro zone countries as regards exceeding authorised inflation rates and infringement by certain euro zone countries of the Stability and Growth Pact requirements? Does the Council not consider that account should be taken of external factors, such as the rise in energy prices and the fact that it is actually impossible to have rapid economic growth and price cuts simultaneously? Would it not also be appropriate to improve the Maastricht criteria themselves in order to avoid an unintended fall in commodity prices in Finland and the Netherlands, which have a lower rate of inflation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The requests made by Slovenia and Lithuania for assessments to be made of those countries’ chances of adopting the euro raise new questions on the future of the euro zone. Before the introduction of the euro, certain parameters (e.g. inflation) were calculated on the basis of all EU countries, because none of them had adopted the euro at that stage. It would now be appropriate to calculate inflation only on the basis of parameters of the countries in the euro zone. To calculate average inflation on the basis of countries that have not even made a commitment to fulfil the Maastricht criteria on inflation is today illogical and hinders enlargement of the euro zone. Some countries have artificially reduced inflation by lowering duty on alcohol and petroleum products, making it more difficult for countries that reject state control of their economies to join the euro zone.</p>
<p>What steps does the Council intend to take to ensure that enlargement of the euro zone is not held back by artificial measures? Are there plans to amend the Maastricht criteria (which are entirely technical in nature) to ensure that the requirements laid down for countries aspiring to join the euro zone are supported by economic logic?

<p>In December 2005 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on payment services in the internal market; the proposal sets deadlines for both national and cross-border payment transactions.</p>
<p>Providers of payment services are to be required to credit payments in euros within the European Union to the payee's account essentially within one day. To allow the banks time to adjust their infrastructure to the new requirements, this deadline may be extended to a maximum of three days until 1 January 2010 – subject to an agreement to that effect.</p>
<p>The negotiations on this proposal for a directive within a Council working party have commenced under Austrian chairmanship, and are making rapid progress.

<p>(DE) The Council considers it very important that there should be further improvement in financial management, and that controls should work correctly and effectively, so that, in the medium term, a positive statement of assurance (DAS) can be given for all transactions underlying the EU’s accounts.</p>
<p>With regard to the financial year 2004, the Council regrets that payments relating to CAP expenditure, which is not covered by the integrated administration and control system (IACS), to structural measures and to internal and external policy areas are still materially affected by errors. However, the Council notes with satisfaction the progress found in that financial year in areas where supervisory and control systems are implemented and allow for appropriate risk management, that is, revenue, commitments, administrative expenditure and pre-accession strategy. The Council is pleased to note that, with regard to CAP expenditure, the Court was able to conclude that the IACS, if properly used, is an effective system for limiting the risk of irregular payments.</p>
<p>The Council commented on the question of declarations at national level in its conclusions of 8 November 2005. As the honourable Member is aware, the President of the Council, Mr Finz, raised the question of national declarations when presenting the Council’s discharge recommendation at Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control on 20 March 2006. He stated that with regard to compatibility with administrative structures in the Member States, particularly those which are federally organised, this would entail considerable difficulties, pointing out how important it is that, in keeping with the EC Treaty, the Commission's ultimate responsibility for Community funds be maintained. He further pointed out that, in the Council’s view, the introduction of such statements could lead to an increased administrative burden and additional costs for Member States. With regard to the aim of attaining a positive DAS, then, the Council proposes an approach based on improving existing declarations at operational level with greater Member State involvement.</p>
<p>During the negotiations on the new Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA), too, the call for Member States to be obliged to issue national declarations at political level was made by Parliament’s representatives. Parliament, the Council and the Commission ultimately reached agreement on a provision in the IIA which reads as follows:</p>
<p>A.	Ensuring effective and integrated internal control of Community funds</p>
<p>44.	The institutions agree on the importance of strengthening internal control without adding to the administrative burden for which the simplification of the underlying legislation is a prerequisite. In this context, priority will be given to sound financial management aiming at a positive Statement of Assurance, for funds under shared management. Provisions to this end could be laid down, as appropriate, in the basic legislative acts concerned. As part of their enhanced responsibilities for structural funds and in accordance with national constitutional requirements, the relevant audit authorities in Member States will produce an assessment concerning the compliance of management and control systems with the regulations of the Community.</p>
<p>Member States therefore undertake to produce an annual summary at the appropriate national level of the available audits and declarations.</p>
<p>This decision of principle taken by the institutions on the control of EU funds also made it possible to find an agreed solution to the question of declarations by the Member States.</p>
<p>On the basis of that decision, the Council would point to the scale of the work still to be dealt with so that a positive DAS for all transactions underlying the EU’s account and an effective integrated internal control framework can be brought about.</p>
<p>The Council therefore calls on all those involved in implementing the budget to continue efforts to improve financial management so that reasonable and verifiable assurance can be had that controls are in place which work correctly and effectively.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) The honourable Member is right to point out that the Austrian Presidency’s priorities include the promotion of growth and employment not only at the macro-economic level but also in terms of improved conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency has made considerable progress towards achieving these goals, not only as regards the formal adoption of legislative acts, but also in successfully bringing several major policy initiatives to fruition. In view of the honourable Member’s interest in the connection between the macro-economic objectives and the role played by SMEs in achieving them, the Council wishes to point out that:</p>
<p>On the basis of the contributions from the various Council configurations, the Council, in its Spring Conclusions<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, unreservedly endorsed the revival of the Lisbon Strategy and stressed the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises for the creation of growth and new jobs.</p>
<p>Thanks to the work done by the previous Presidency, negotiations on the proposal for a programme for competitiveness and innovation to run from 2007 to 2013 have now progressed to such an extent that it is highly probable that agreement will be reached at first reading before the end of the Austrian Presidency.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency is endeavouring to move forward the deliberations on the proposal for the seventh research framework programme and the services directive in order that these dossiers, which are subject to codecision, may, in close cooperation with Parliament, be completed successfully and as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency is actively supporting the Commission’s efforts at achieving, at international level, and in particular in the context of WTO negotiations, market conditions characterised by real and fair competition, in which European enterprises can hold their own in doing business.</p>
<p>On 13 May 2006, the Council adopted conclusion on policy on the role of SMEs in growth and employment<a href="#defann_13_2" name="refann_13_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, in which it highlighted the fundamental importance of this policy area, which has so many horizontal connections to others.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency will, in May 2006, be submitting to the Council, for final adoption by it, draft Council conclusions on industrial policy. These constitute a response to a Commission communication on the same subject<a href="#defann_13_3" name="refann_13_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Presidency has initiated a wide-ranging dialogue on industrial and SME policy with interested parties, which includes conferences on important aspects of them, and this dialogue will be continued. Particularly worthy of note in this context are the Fourth European Business Summit (EBS), which was held on 16/17 March 2006 in Brussels under the heading of ‘Building a Europe of Excellence: Turning knowledge into growth’ and also the EU Conference on progress in implementing the European Charter for small business, which the Presidency will be staging jointly with the Commission on 13/14 June in Vienna.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency will also be conducting a review of the strategy for sustainable development<a href="#defann_13_4" name="refann_13_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, on which the various Council configurations will state their positions, since environmentally-friendly models of production and consumption can significantly stimulate growth in the internal market while at the same time improving the competitive positions of European businesses in global markets.</p>
<p>The initiatives for the simplification of legal acts and for better lawmaking will be continued with; they have already had a considerable effect on the adoption of current legal acts and on the drafting of new Community regulations particularly in terms of the ‘Think Small First' principle, which is to be applied to all legal acts relating to competition policy.</p>
<p>The examples given above demonstrate conclusively how much the present Presidency is doing to achieve major progress on the Lisbon goals, notably in terms of micro-economic policy, internal market policy and research, which are primarily the responsibility of the Competitiveness Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) The [Council/Presidency] is satisfied with the application of the new rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.

Overall, an equally positive view can be taken of the evaluation of the stability and convergence programmes.

<p>(DE) The honourable Member rightly points out that far too little use is currently made of Europe’s waterways. Through greater use of spare capacity on Europe's rivers and canals, inland waterway transport can help make energy use more efficient and reduce air pollution.</p>
<p>To exploit the potential of inland navigation to a greater extent, the Austrian Presidency has declared promotion of this transport mode to be a priority task. On 17 February 2006, the Commission submitted a communication on an integrated European action programme for inland waterway transport to Parliament and the Council. At a high-level meeting attended by representatives of the Member States, the non-EU Danube riparian states, the leading international inland-navigation organisations and economic stakeholders in Vienna on 14 and 15 February 2006, there were intensive discussions on this issue and a findings paper was adopted. Accordingly, the Presidency is seeking adoption of conclusions on the Commission communication at the Council meeting on 8/9 June 2006. The Council conclusions are intended to give decision-takers at all levels, in line with their respective remits as determined at present in law, appropriate political signals for framing the necessary legislative proposals and further initiatives to promote inland navigation under the next Presidency.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all future construction measures on inland waterways must be planned and carried out in keeping with the environmental objectives for surface waters, groundwater and protected areas under the Water Framework Directive and with possible derogations in this connection.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0326"></a>

<p>(DE) The Council is aware of the events to which the honourable Member refers and is following developments with close attention. With regard to freedom of religion in Turkey, the Council has repeatedly emphasised how important it considers this issue to be. Allow me to refer you once again to the fact that this is one of the key areas in which tangible progress is urgently required and in which concrete steps now need to be taken to adopt and implement appropriate legislation; this is all the more true now that accession negotiations have been started. Religious minorities and faith communities are continuing to experience difficulties in connection with their legal personality, with property rights, training, residence and work permits for Turkish and non-Turkish clerics, schools and internal management. The EU is particularly concerned about the fact that the state is continuing to confiscate the property of non-Muslim religious minorities. Among the short-term priorities of the accession partnership adopted by the Council in January 2006 is the enactment of an act resolving all the difficulties faced by non-Muslim religious minorities and faith communities in line with currently applicable European standards.</p>
<p>The Council can therefore assure the honourable Member that developments relating to freedom of religion will continue to be closely monitored, and, where necessary, raised at every level as part of the ongoing reform process in Turkey in line with the conclusions of the December 2004 European Council, the negotiating framework for Turkey and the revised accession partnership. It is quite clear that whether or not Turkey makes progress in moving the reform process forward, and its compliance or non-compliance with its treaty obligations and the requirements of the accession partnership, will have an effect on how the negotiating process develops.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) With regard to freedom of religion in Turkey, the Council has repeatedly emphasised how important it considers this issue to be. Allow me to refer you once again to the fact that this is one of the key areas in which tangible progress is urgently required and in which concrete steps now need to be taken to adopt and implement appropriate legislation; this is all the more true now that accession negotiations have been started.

The EU is particularly concerned about the fact that the state is continuing to confiscate the property of non-Muslim religious foundations. The need to enact a law comprehensively resolving all the difficulties encountered by non-Muslim religious minorities and faith communities in line with the relevant European standards is one of the short-term priorities in the revised accession partnership adopted by the Council in January 2006. I should also like to point out that this accession partnership requests Turkey to transpose in full the rulings of the European Court of Justice regarding human rights.</p>
<p>The Council can therefore assure the honourable Member that developments regarding freedom of religion are being, and will continue to be, monitored closely and discussed at all appropriate levels as part of the ongoing process of reform in Turkey, in full compliance with the Council Conclusions of December 2004, the negotiating framework for Turkey and the revised accession partnership (it was most recently discussed, for example, by Mrs Plassnik at the troika of foreign ministers with Turkey on 8 March and at the Joint Parliamentary Committee on 4 and 5 May). It is quite clear that progress in the reform process and Turkey's compliance with its treaty obligations and the accession partnership will have an effect on progress in the negotiating process.</p>
<p>With regard to relations between Turkey and Cyprus, the EU has consistently stressed to Turkey how important it is for significant progress to be made regarding the normalisation of these relations, and it will continue to do so. The European Council did welcome Turkey's decision to sign the Protocol regarding the adaptation of the Ankara Agreement and thus to take account of the accession of the 10 new Member States, but in this connection I should like to point to the declaration by the European Community and its Member States of 21 September 2005, which emphasised, amongst other things, that the recognition of all Member States is a vital element of the accession process. The declaration also points out that the Union attaches considerable importance to normalising relations between Turkey and all the Member States as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The EU will be monitoring and assessing the complete implementation of the Protocol regarding the adaptation of the Ankara Agreement this year, because the commencement of negotiations on the relevant chapters depends on Turkey meeting its treaty obligations to all Member States. If it does not fully meet all its obligations, this will impede progress in the negotiations as a whole. In addition, the Council will also follow up the progress made on this issue in 2006.</p>
<p>It is therefore clear that the Union attaches considerable importance to these issues, and I should like to conclude by assuring the honourable Members once again that progress in these areas is being followed very closely.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0338"></a>

Some Member States allow consumers the right to make early repayment without extra cost while others make provision for such early repayment only against payment of a fee. One of the main issues is on what basis the APR, which will enable consumers to compare credit costs, including with those in other countries, is to be calculated.</p>
<p>The Council working group will continue its work on the basis of the results of the policy debate with a view to reaching agreement as soon as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0352"></a>

<p>Only three months ago, a large team of European observers was present as elections were held to the new Palestinian Legislative Council. Those observers verified that the election procedures were transparent and correct and declared that the Palestinians hade once again demonstrated their aspiration for and their resolve to operate within democratic structures. The election contest revealed Hamas to be the leading political force and, once again, everyone declared that they respected that result.</p>
<p>Recently, and because of the outcome of the election, the European Union decided to suspend the various forms of economic aid which it provided to the Palestinian Authority. The result of that decision is suffering for the Palestinian people since nearly all State officials have gone unpaid in recent months and basic commodities such as milk, bread and medicines are now luxury items.</p>

<p>(DE) Inasmuch as Mr Beglitis's question relates to the result of the elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council on 25 January 2006, the Council would point out that the EU and its partners in the Middle East Quartet have congratulated the Palestinian people on their free, fair and secure elections. However, as the High Representative, Mr Solana, stressed to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 5 April this year, we cannot have 'business as usual' with the Palestinian Authority until Hamas expresses its unequivocal intention of respecting the principles of the international community – namely non-violence, recognition of Israel's right to exist and acceptance of existing agreements. The Council confirmed this position on 10 April, recalling that the new Palestinian Government's failure to adhere to those three principles would have unavoidable consequences on direct aid for this government; this was also stressed once again in the conclusions on the Middle East peace process adopted by the Council at its meeting on 15 May. It must not be forgotten that these three principles are not new guidelines invented for the Hamas-led government, but criteria that originate from the long-standing Oslo Process. These principles are also in line with the Palestinian President Mr Abbas' peace platform.</p>
<p>With regard to Mr Beglitis's question on economic aid to the Palestinian Authority, the EU has repeatedly stressed that it will provide the necessary aid for the basic needs of the Palestinian people. To this end, the EU is working actively with its international partners in the donor community to find ways of continuing to provide the Palestinian people with the necessary aid, whilst at the same time ensuring that this aid is not used for purposes contradictory to the aforementioned three principles. The Council deals with the issue of aid in more detail in point 3 of the conclusions on the Middle East peace process of 15 May 2006, which states that the Council 'welcomed the willingness of the Quartet to endorse a temporary international mechanism, the objective of which is direct delivery and supervision of assistance to the Palestinian people. The EU is working urgently to develop such a mechanism which as a matter of priority will be aimed at contributing to meet basic needs including health services. It will consult International Financial Institutions and other key partners, and invite other donors to actively join in the effort to establish the mechanism as soon as possible.' It therefore cannot be said that the EU is imposing an 'economic embargo' or 'economic sanctions'.</p>
<p>As far as Mr Adamou's question regarding the peace process is concerned, the Council's conclusions of 15 May 2006 call for an early engagement between the Israeli Prime Minister and the President of the Palestinian Authority in view of the urgent need to relaunch the process towards a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict leading to an independent democratic and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours. As before, the Council is prepared to explore all the possible ways in which it can make an effective contribution to achieving this goal.</p>
<p>With regard to Mr Beglitis's reference to 'Israel's continued refusal to implement the November 2005 agreement', the Council would first of all point out that the opening of the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, which is based precisely on this agreement, the implementation of which the EU is supporting through its mission to support border controls at the Rafah border crossing, has been a real success so far. The opening of this border crossing has had a direct and distinctly positive effect for the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip, and the EU will continue to work with the parties involved to enable further sustained progress in this regard.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0354"></a>

<p>(DE) The South Caucasus region is currently undergoing major upheavals. The size of the region, its strategic position as the gateway between Europe and Asia, its natural resources and its economic potential, mean that its role and importance have considerably increased.</p>
<p>As long ago as 2001, the European Union expressed a willingness to play a more active role in the south Caucasus, and since then it has endeavoured to step up its policies regarding the region. The clearest and most specific sign of this move towards a greater presence by the EU in the region was the appointment of Ambassador Heikki Talvitie as the first EU Special Representative (EUSR) for the South Caucasus in July 2003.</p>
<p>On 20 February 2006, the Council appointed Ambassador Peter Semneby as the new Special Representative for the period from 1 March 2006 to 28 February 2007. At the same time, the mandate of the EUSR for the South Caucasus was extended, including with regard to issues of conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Joint Action appointing the EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus, one of the EU's objectives is, in accordance with existing mechanisms, to prevent conflicts in the region and to contribute to the peaceful settlement of conflicts, including through promoting the return of refugees and internally displaced persons.</p>
<p>In order for this objective to be achievable, the EUSR has the task of contributing to the settlement of conflicts and of facilitating the implementation of such settlement in close coordination with the United Nations Secretary-General and his Special Representative for Georgia, the Group of Friends of the United Nations Secretary-General for Georgia, the Organisation for Security and cooperation in Europe and its Minsk Group, and the conflict resolution mechanism for South Ossetia.</p>
<p>The EUSR's team assisting the Georgian Border Guard will continue its work at least until the end of February 2007. A functional border control system could also make an essential contribution to resolving these intractable conflicts.</p>
<p>In terms of conflict resolution, the EU Special Representative must, according to his mandate, coordinate closely with the existing conflict resolution mechanisms. In the course of May, Special Representative Semneby will undertake consultations with Moscow and Washington and with the United Nations.</p>
<p>On the basis of the talks that Mr Semneby held on his first visit to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, the Council estimates that there are good conditions in place for further cooperation with these countries, including with regard to conflict resolution.</p>
<p>As part of his mandate, the EUSR is also required to propose guidelines for future EU measures. Mr Semneby will present Secretary General/High Representative Solana, the Council and the Commission with an interim report by the end of June 2006 at the latest, and with a comprehensive report on the fulfilment of his mandate by mid-November 2006.</p>
<p>In its declaration of 21 February 2006, the European Union reiterated its support for a peaceful resolution of the territorial conflicts in Georgia, based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognised borders. It also stated that it supported the initiatives taken towards peaceful resolution of the conflict and believed that the Georgian Peace Plan would serve as a basis for that resolution. All of our efforts should ultimately be directed towards a permanent solution. The parties should now attempt to find acceptable solutions through dialogue, and renounce unilateral measures that could increase tensions. It is very important to build trust and confidence. At the end of May, Mr Semneby will travel to South Ossetia and Abkhasia.</p>
<p>At a later date, and in agreement with all the parties, it may be examined in the context of conflict resolution whether a peace-keeping mission to South Ossetia may be required, and, if so, what its composition should be. In the context of the OSCE needs analysis and the Brussels Donors' Conference, the EU is currently assessing what additional aid it can provide in the conflict region.</p>
<p>The EU is also prepared to help with regard to Nagorno-Karabakh. It is prepared to participate in a donors' conference if appropriate and to look into how it can best contribute to peace-keeping measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0361"></a>

<p>(DE) The Council shares the honourable Member's concern, and has repeatedly and systematically called on the Chinese authorities to provide us with information on the whereabouts of the 11th Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, and assurances as to his welfare ever since he disappeared. The situation in Tibet and freedom of religion in China are two of the central issues in the human rights dialogue that takes place between the EU and China every two years. In the last two years, the EU has made efforts to persuade the Chinese Government to allow an independent international delegation, for example from the Committee on the Rights of the Child, to visit Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, given that China has signed and ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The EU has raised particular concerns regarding the child's religious upbringing and his access to Tibetan teachings. The EU will continue to raise this case both during the dialogue and at political level.

<p>(DE) The Austrian Presidency has given a high priority to improving the competitiveness of European businesses in line with the relaunched Lisbon Strategy that was adopted in June 2005. At its Spring summit from 23 to 24 March 2006, the European Council adopted conclusions containing important political guidelines for implementing the reforms provided for in the Integrated Guidelines (2005-2008) and in the national reform programmes adopted by the Member States; these conclusions were based on the papers produced by the competent Council configurations in response to the European Commission's progress report on the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p>The March European Council also introduced, amongst other things, the following measures that will make a significant contribution to Europe's position as a business and investment location with prospects for the future:</p>
<p>investing more in knowledge and innovation, aiming at the overall objective of 3% by 2010;</p>
<p>improving workers' qualifications and at the same time providing efficient social protection systems;</p>
<p>reducing red tape and administrative costs through better and more transparent legislation;</p>
<p>creating a more favourable environment for SMEs, such as establishing a one-stop shop for setting up businesses.</p>
<p>In addition, the topic of globalisation was the focus of discussions at the informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council in Vienna, at which three CEOs were present. At this meeting, the finance ministers clearly stated that the increasingly international division of labour was basically making a contribution to better employment and income opportunities and that the challenges of globalisation could not be met by protectionist measures. However, it was also made clear that these employment and income opportunities were not equally distributed and that policies must ensure that as many people as possible can benefit from the advantages of globalisation. This requires appropriate opportunities for education and training, effective labour markets and an efficient social system.</p>
<p>In addition, the Austrian Presidency, in close cooperation with the European Parliament, has made considerable efforts to adopt in good time the most important implementation instruments needed to improve Europe's competitiveness on the global market; these include the Interinstitutional Agreement on the Financial Perspective (2007-2013), the Seventh Research Framework Programme and the Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation. Although it is still too soon to venture a prediction on the exact result of these negotiations, you can already be certain that the Austrian Presidency has given considerable impetus to the implementation of the relaunched Lisbon reform agenda.</p>
<p>Ensuring that the fruits of globalisation are distributed equally to all countries, population groups and levels of education is a complex matter, affecting many areas of policy (not just at EU level), in particular international trade, education, development and social policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0377"></a>

<p>On 24 March 2006, a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties visited detention centres for illegal immigrants in Malta and witnessed the gravity of the situation there. Parliament has adopted a joint resolution on the crisis experienced on a daily basis by Malta, which lacks the resources to cope with the continual arrivals of illegal immigrants. Furthermore, Malta is devoting 1% of its GDP to this crisis, while 10% of its security forces are engaged in dealing with it. Parliament's resolution (<a href="/doceo/document/TA-6-2006-0136_EN.html">P6_TA(2006)0136</a>) points out that, despite its efforts, Malta is unable to fully apply Regulation (EC) No 343/2003<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> ('Dublin II') and calls for it to be exempted from its provisions. Parliament has called on all Member States to assist Malta in its efforts by each sharing part of the burden, bearing in mind that Malta is not the final destination of the illegal immigrants who land there. It has also called on the Council to hold an extraordinary meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Malta itself as soon as possible in order to discuss the crisis.</p>
<p>As also requested by Parliament, the Commission should propose the setting up of a fund for humanitarian emergencies such as the current immigration crisis in Malta and take steps to amend 'Dublin II', with a view to sharing the task of considering asylum applications among all Member States, rather than leaving it to the country in which they first arrive.</p>

Three of these funds, relating to refugees, external borders and repatriation, cover measures that aim to provide financial support to Member States in emergencies when immediate aid is required. The legislation establishing these three funds needs to be enacted in accordance with the codecision procedure; the Council is currently working closely with Parliament to ensure that this legislation can be adopted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>With respect to the 'Dublin II' Regulation, the Commission needs to report to Parliament and the Council on its implementation, and in this connection it may also propose amendments to the Regulation, which would then need to be adopted by Parliament and the Council under the codecision procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) As the Presidency has already stated in its response to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0291_EN.html">H-0291/06</a>, to which the honourable Member referred, it is the Commission that manages the Community's budget, including the funds for the press and the media.</p>
<p>As far as the Council is concerned, the Presidency can confirm that the Secretariat-General's budget does not provide for any grants to individual journalists.</p>
<p>On the question of transparency in connection with lobbyists, the Presidency would refer the honourable Member to the Presidency of the Council's response of 9 June 2005 to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2005-0441_EN.html">H-0441/05</a>.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member mentioned, the Austrian Presidency considers it to be very important to improve the openness and transparency of the Council's work in line with the Council's conclusions of 21 December 2005. In accordance with these conclusions, the Council has already undertaken an initial assessment of the measures to increase the openness of its work, which were adopted in December 2005. It is also looking into additional options that could further increase openness and transparency, including the possibility of amending its rules of procedure.</p>
<p>The Presidency of the Council has already submitted proposals for an overall approach to greater transparency in the work of the Council to the ministers for Europe, at a meeting on the margins of the most recent General Affairs and External Relations Council. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The report on “European electronic communications regulation and markets 2005” (the 11<span class="sup">th</span> Implementation report)<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is a report on the implementation of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications at the end of 2005 in the 25 Member States. The Annex<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> of this report is a working document of the Commission’s services. It includes an analysis of the e-communication market in Europe, market data, and chapters on the regulatory and market situation in each Member State.</p>
<p>As stated in the reply by the Commissionner in charge of information society and media on behalf of the Commission to the written question<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> made by the honourable Member in February 2006, Article 3 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) provides that Member States must ensure that each of the regulatory tasks attributed to national authorities is undertaken by a competent body. The concern expressed in the working document with regard to Spain is about the availability of the resources needed for the national regulatory authority (Telecomunications Market Commission - CMT - in Spain) to work efficiently in the performance of the tasks assigned to it under the regulatory framework (c.f. Recital 11 of the Framework Directive). The concern expressed is not about how the decision on the relocation of the national regulatory authority (NRA) was taken, nor about the location itself. These are issues within the exclusive competence of the Member State concerned. Similar cases in other Member States have also been referred to, since the proper functioning of the NRAs is crucial for the correct implementation of the regulatory framework.</p>
<p>As stated in the working document in relation to the human resources of CMT, “operators complain about the resulting legal uncertainty and possible impact on the performance of the CMT.” It should be noted, for example, that the first three draft measures proposed, following the market analysis procedure, were notified to the Commission only at the end of September 2005, i.e. over three years after the entry into force of the EU regulatory framework and 15 months after the pre-consultation processes carried out by the CMT. In these circumstances, the significant loss of staff by the CMT, for whatever reason, is a matter of concern. It is precisely in order to reinforce regulatory certainty that the working document reflects this concern.</p>
<p>On this basis, the Commission does not share the assumption of the honourable Member that the statements contained in the report are not accurate.</p>
<p>As regards the seat of the European agencies, it is the Heads of State and Government gathered in the European Council, and not the Commission, who decide on the location of the different European agencies and other decentralised bodies of the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the honourable Member’s concerns about the exposure of minors to violence on TV. Protecting minors from harmful content is of paramount importance. As a result of cultural differences, there remain, however diverse views on the methods to be used to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>According to the Commission, the protection of minors is a shared responsibility of parents, industry and regulators. Due to the arrival of the internet and other digital technologies, the world has changed considerably over the past few years. Nowadays, children are often more digitally literate than their parents. In this changing environment, parents need to be empowered to make informed choices for their children. Co-and self-regulation, within the meaning of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, can play a significant part in this process. Rating and labelling of content combined with media literacy and technological solutions are key tools to address these important issues. Through its legislative proposals as well as through its other actions, the Commission is endeavouring to ensure the best protection possible for our children within the bounds of its responsibilities under the Treaty.</p>
<p>As to the possibility of setting aside a specific day each year “where television stations across Europe would not transmit programmes using violent death as entertainment”, the Commission feels that this should be a matter for self-regulation. Finally, the Television without Frontiers Directive will be revised so that the general principles regarding protection of minors and human dignity are also applied to audiovisual content distributed through on-demand services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission considers that broadband services are important and that public support should stimulate deployment in the presence of market failure. The Commission has identified the availability of a secure broadband infrastructure across Europe as a key element to achieve the objectives of the initiative “i2010: A European Information Society for growth and employment<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>”. Deployment of broadband in remote and scarcely populated regions is a key element to enable an inclusive information society across Europe.</p>
<p>More recently, the Commission has addressed the issue of public intervention for the provision of broadband infrastructure in remote and rural areas in the Digital Divide Forum (DDF) report<a href="#defann_39_2" name="refann_39_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Results have been summarised in the recent Communication “Bridging the broadband gap”<a href="#defann_39_3" name="refann_39_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This Communication was launched on 20<span class="sup">th</span> March 2006. It recalls the broadband gaps and the instruments available at the EU level to help bridging them (regulatory tools, competition policy, and cohesion policy). The rigorous enforcement of EU telecom rules promotes competition and stimulates broadband deployment through market forces. A more coordinated and flexible EU spectrum policy contributes to broadband deployment in rural areas where wireless technologies are particularly suited. Public intervention, also through the contribution of Structural Funds and Rural Development Fund, may accelerate broadband deployment in the less developed regions and rural areas. State-aid policy will ensure that competition distortions are minimised.</p>
<p>Back in 2003 and 2004, at the request of the Commission, Member States put in place national broadband strategies. As markets are fragmented and progress is uneven, the Commission has proposed in its recent Communication on bridging the broadband gap an update of these strategies with concrete actions and clear national broadband targets.</p>
<p>As far as rural development is concerned broadband development in rural areas can be supported by the ‘basic services for the economy and rural population’ measure under Art. 52 (b) (i) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005<a href="#defann_39_4" name="refann_39_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, if in the question posed, the honourable Member raises the question whether broadband should be included in the Universal Service obligation, the answer would be, that following the recent review of the scope of Universal Service<a href="#defann_39_5" name="refann_39_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, there is no case for including it. Nevertheless, the Commission will look again at Universal Service obligations as part of the review of the Regulatory Framework for electronic communications during 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Communication, which is provisionally entitled “A strategy for a secure Information Society - Dialogue, partnership and empowerment”, should be adopted by the end of May.</p>
<p>It has been drawn up on the basis of a broad consultation process, an important element of which was the International High-Level Research Seminar "Trust in the Net" held under the auspices of the Austrian Presidency on 9 February 2006. The seminar brought together a wide range of stakeholders, including Member States governments, the research community, representatives of consumer protection organisations, and civil liberty groups. The main conclusions of the Seminar, which are available on the Austrian Presidency web site<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, have been taken into account in the drafting of the Communication.</p>
<p>The Communication will call, inter alia, for a structured process of consultation and dialogue on network and information security issues. This process, which will benefit from the participation of European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), will involve all relevant stakeholders, including public administrations, private sector and civil society. This will include a series of security-related events, including a session on network and information security at the i2010 Conference planned in September 2006 by the Finnish Presidency. A specific public consultation on the security and privacy implications of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is also foreseen, as part of the broader consultation on RFID recently launched by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Recently (March 2006) the Russian Government officially announced its support for a bill to protect its ‘strategic economic sectors’, making it necessary for prior authorisation to be obtained for all projected foreign investment in protected strategic sectors. In other words, Russia is poised to introduce legislation controlling direct foreign investments in its energy sector. Is such a measure compatible with the objectives of the EU-Russia energy dialogue at a time when Russia ought to be progressively opening up its energy market and its infrastructures with a view to securing greater reciprocal market access for European companies? How does the EU intend to persuade Russia to ratify the Energy Charter and approve the Transit Protocol at a time when its Government is clearly stepping up measures designed to achieve economic protectionism?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In the past few months, the Russian authorities have made a number of declarations on new legislation aimed at restricting access to certain strategic economic sectors, including energy. However, the possible legislation relating to energy have seen some potentially varying statements by the Russian authorities and it is therefore difficult at this stage to express an opinion on a legislative initiative which is not yet fully clear. The Commission nevertheless intend to closely monitor this issue in order to examine the compliance of new legislative proposals with the overall objective of "fair and reciprocal access to market" and also with respect to international trade principles, in consideration of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement commitments and of the future accession of the Russian Federation to the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p>With respect to the Energy Charter Treaty, the Commission has consistently urged the Russian Federation to ratify this instrument, which includes indeed certain provisions relating to investments in the energy sector, giving common rules and more predictability and transparency. The Russian Federation however has not yet ratified the Charter Treaty since its signature in December 1994. Previously the Russian authorities had set a condition of the successful conclusion of the Transit Protocol to the Energy Charter for their ratification of the Treaty. The Commission, on behalf of the Community, has continued the negotiations on the Protocol on this basis. It hopes these negotiations can be successfully concluded, in order to facilitate Russian ratification of the Treaty.</p>
<p>Such principles as:</p>
<p>open and transparent approach towards investment needs in production and infrastructure in Russia in order to secure our supplies;</p>
<p>market reciprocity, i.e. a level playing field in market opening, fair competition, environmental protection and safety, including nuclear safety;</p>
<p>fair transit for energy products through Russia;</p>
<p>third party access to export pipelines</p>
<p>are consistently being defended by the Commission in bilateral contacts with Russian authorities and, whenever possible, in close cooperation with the EU Member States in international foras and, in particular, the G8 where Russia is holding the yearly Presidency.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0397"></a>

<p>Energy security has always been one of the main economic and political problems of the EU. Energy dependency on Russian oil and gas has become a hot topic of discussion in the EU especially this year, and the EU has clearly understood that in the coming decade energy supplies will play a much more evident political role than before. The lack of an effective EU energy policy towards Russia allows the Kremlin to play European companies and their governments off against each other for access to gas and investment opportunities. The Green Paper on energy is filled with recommendations, but no enforcement power on the vital issues of energy diversity.</p>
<p>Is the EU in a position to implement an effectively coordinated energy policy, to be converted into an EU common energy policy in the near future?

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the honourable Member’s view that in today’s world, energy security requires a common European response. The same applies to energy challenges relating to climate and competitiveness. The Commission has argued this in the Green Paper on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Commission is encouraged by the clear statements of the Parliament, Council and the European Council in favour of the development of an energy policy for Europe.</p>
<p>In the Green Paper, the Commission has indicated areas in which existing frameworks may have to be strengthened and it has put forward some new tools to help in the development and implementation of a coordinated or common EU policy.</p>
<p>Developing a European energy policy, a long term challenge, requires a clear but flexible framework: clear in that it represents a common approach endorsed at the highest level, flexible in that it needs periodic updating. As a foundation for this process, the Commission therefore proposes that a Strategic EU Energy Review be presented to the Council and Parliament on a regular basis, covering the issues identified in this Green Paper. This would constitute a stocktaking and action plan for the Spring European Council, monitoring progress and identifying new challenges and responses on all aspects of energy policy.</p>
<p>As regards Russia, the development of a common external energy policy should mark a step change in this energy partnership at both Community and national level. The EU, as Russia’s largest energy buyer, is an essential and equal partner in the relationship.</p>
<p>A true partnership would offer security and predictability for both sides, paving the way for the necessary long-term investments in new capacity. It would also need to ensure fair and reciprocal, transparent and non discriminatory access to markets and infrastructure including in particular third party access to pipelines. Transparency would be an important factor. Negotiations with Russia must be pursued with vigour; the EU must speak with the same voice and strongly. It is particularly important that Member States and the Commission speak with a common voice also in multilateral frameworks.</p>
<p>This year, the Russian Presidency of the G8 offers an opportunity for intensified pressure on Russia for ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty and conclusion of the negotiations on the Transit Protocol. It is important to note that during the preparatory Sherpa meetings and the G8 Energy Ministerial preceding the July G 8 summit, the personal representative or “Sherpas” from both the Commission and the EU Member States, that are members of the G8, as well as energy ministers and the Energy Commissioner, have been clear on passing the same message about market reciprocity, the right of transit conditions and third party access.</p>
<p>Alongside negotiations with Russia, diversification of supply routes is important. Diversification is progressing, helped by the Trans-European Networks programme, the Energy Community in South-East Europe, European Neighbourhood Policy, internal market developments and the growing competitiveness of Liquefied Natural Gas.</p>
<p>The Commission argues in the Green Paper for a clear policy on securing and diversifying energy supplies, both for the EU as a whole and for specific Member States or regions, especially for gas. To this end, the Strategic EU Energy Review could propose clearly identified priorities for the upgrading and construction of new infrastructure necessary for the security of EU energy supplies, notably new gas and oil pipelines and liquefied natural gas terminals, along with the application of transit and third party access to existing pipelines.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The increase of minimum gas and electricity interconnection levels between Member States is essential to build a truly competitive and single European market and to reinforce security of energy supplies in Europe. Equally, additional or better interconnection facilitates the development and reducing the isolation of the less-favoured and island regions of the Community. As pointed out by the honourable Member, Ireland is indeed one of these “isolated islands”.</p>
<p>The Green Paper on Energy proposed, and the European Council in March 2006 confirmed that priority should be given to “the realisation of priority infrastructure projects…”.</p>
<p>The revised guidelines on Trans European Energy Networks (TEN-E), which are expected to be adopted formally by the Council in Autumn, should certainly contribute to accelerate certain of EU TEN-E priority projects declared of European interest and allow the European Investment Bank and the Structural Funds to participate actively in the implementation of the TEN-E projects.</p>
<p>For Ireland, the integration of the Irish electricity system and the British system on the one side and on the other side the European continental system has indeed been recognised as a major European priority. In particular, it is worth mentioning two specific projects that will contribute to reducing the isolation of Ireland by for instance ensuring a 10% interconnection capacity target). The Commission is referring to</p>
<p>the link between Ireland and Wales (UK);</p>
<p>and the link between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>For these links, Community support under TEN-E has been granted since 2000. Further financial support of a total of €2.84 Million has been allocated since 2000 to studies in view of strengthening the connection between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>In the gas sector, feasibility and technical studies were supported by the Commission during the period 1995-1999 concerning three major activities:</p>

<p>In the last decade, demand for oil has substantially increased, primarily due to dramatic economic growth in China and India. Global demand has grown by 7 million barrels per day since 2000 of which 2 million barrels have gone to China and, although its oil consumption is currently less than 40% of China's, India's demand for oil is accelerating. Moreover, as both rapidly move from self-sufficiency to integration in the world economy, they grow increasingly dependent on global markets.</p>
<p>Does the Commission accept that these realities highlight the need to expand the concept of energy security in two critical areas: recognition of the globalization of the energy security system and the importance of markets to absorb shocks and allow supply and demand to respond with greater ingenuity than controlled systems; and acknowledgement that interdependence and the growth of energy trade require collaboration among consumers and producers to ensure the security of the entire energy supply chain? Does the Commission agree that these can only be achieved by engaging China and India in the global network of trade and investment, rather than allowing them to move towards a mercantilist, state-to-state approach, and would the Commission explain how energy security has affected the EU's trade and investment policies with these two countries?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission continues to closely follow developments on the international oil market and would agree with the honourable Member that the energy market has become increasingly globalised. For this reason, in addition to its regular participation in multilateral fora such as the International Energy Agency and the International Energy Forum, the Commission has embarked in recent years on a number of initiatives designed to enhance bilateral relations with important energy producers such as Russia and OPEC, transit countries such as Ukraine and major consumers such as China and India.</p>
<p>Indeed, with forecasts pointing to an increasingly important share of future energy demand being accounted for by both China and India, the Commission has recently enhanced its energy relations with both countries. With China, in addition to the energy industry conference held every two years, the Summit last September saw the signature of a Memorandum on Understanding (MoU) on an EU-China Energy Dialogue, as well as a Joint Declaration on Climate Change. The first meetings under the MoU took place in Brussels in March.</p>
<p>With India, energy relations have recently been enhanced with the first EU-India Energy Business Conference and the first meetings of three joint working groups on energy issues in the framework of the EU-India Energy Panel. Global energy security is also one of the three key issues for the forthcoming G8 Summit in July in St. Petersburg and the Commission has been very active in the preparatory work for this event. In this context, the Commission has stressed the importance of promoting the development of transparent and non-discriminatory regulatory frameworks, favourable investment climates. The discussions to date have also underlined the importance of bringing countries such as China and India into the energy security debate.</p>
<p>Energy security has clearly become a key issue and the Commission’s recent Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy called for a more coherent external energy policy that would “permit a better integration of energy objectives into broader relations with third countries”, investment trends, climate change, energy efficiency and renewables, and research and development of new technologies. Also, the Green paper mentions that there is a scope to make better use of trade policy tools to promote goals such as non-discriminatory energy transit and the development of a more secure investment climate. The Presidency Conclusions of the Brussels European Council of 23-24 March 2006 invited the Commission and the High Representative to “work closely together on the important issue of external energy relations and to provide input for an EU strategy that may be discussed at the next European Council meeting”. The Commission intends to take this work forwards with an EU Strategic Energy review, with concrete proposals to adress these challenges, at the end of this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0323"></a>

Greece is one of the Member States still not in compliance with Community legislation on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources.</p>

<p>(EN) Energy is a complex issue and direct involvement of all stakeholders, from the government, business and civil society, is needed to assure environmentally safe, competitively priced, and robustly reliable supplies. It is therefore important to focus on seeking synergies. The Parliament, the Commission and the Council have consistently given significant support to the development of alternative energy sources.</p>
<p>International oil companies (IOCs) are undeniably significant players both in international economy and in the global energy sector. Many IOCs themselves run extensive corporate programmes dedicated to the promotion of alternative energies, be it in the field of solar, wind, biomass or other. Most companies themselves have an interest in supporting progress towards alternative energy sources. As examples, The Commission can mention that Shell invests in alternative fuels, and will produce 500 Megawatt hours from windmills in 2007. British Petroleum (BP) will also invest $ 8 billion over the next years into a company called “BP alternative energy”. BP allready operates some of the largest wind turbines in Europe, and should produce about 450 Megawatt hours of wind energy in 2008.</p>

<p>(EN) Promotion of clean and efficient energy technology is indeed one of Commission’s main priorities. Some of Commission’s recent proposals clearly reflect this preoccupation:</p>
<p>The Green paper on energy efficiency<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Biomass Action Plan<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the EU strategy to promote biofuels<a href="#defann_47_3" name="refann_47_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Thematic Strategies on air pollution<a href="#defann_47_4" name="refann_47_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and the urban environment<a href="#defann_47_5" name="refann_47_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> and, more recently, the Green Paper on a secure, competitive and sustainable energy policy for Europe<a href="#defann_47_6" name="refann_47_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> discussed at the Spring European Council.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission intends presenting an Action Plan on energy efficiency by mid-2006 and developing a prioritised Action Plan on an energy Policy for Europe before the 2007 Spring Council.</p>
<p>Regarding the financing and economic support of clean and efficient energy technology, the Commission can also underline the existence of an important number of proposals notably in the framework of the forthcoming financial perspectives 2007-2013. These proposals regard notably the competitiveness of European companies, research and innovation, cohesion policies as well as the external dimension of the European Union.</p>
<p>Firstly, part of the budget for the new Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme<a href="#defann_47_7" name="refann_47_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> is aimed at encouraging the use of renewable energy, energy efficient technologies and best practices amongst companies in Europe. These objectives should notably contribute to the enhancement of competitiveness and innovation capacity in the Community, the advancement of the knowledge society and to sustainable development as well as to address the specific needs of small and medium sized enterprises. Support shall be granted to EU-wide promotion and dissemination actions and to the market replication of existing technologies that are to be utilised in a new and innovative way.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Commission also understands that Europe should encourage innovation and research that focus on the development of these objectives. The 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme of Research and Technological Development<a href="#defann_47_8" name="refann_47_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> recognises that there is no single solution to our energy problems, but deals with a wide portfolio technologies: renewable energy technologies, making clean coal and carbon capture and sequestration an industrial reality, new energy vectors such as hydrogen and environmentally friendly energy usage (fuel cells) and energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Commission had also suggested that regional policy instruments should be used in promoting energy efficiency, low energy and carbon intensity development models and renewable and alternative technologies. The Commission would simply recall the Community regional development programmes<a href="#defann_47_9" name="refann_47_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission believes that the EU needs to have a clearly defined external energy policy which would also promote these objectives with other countries. In this context, a new external thematic programme has been proposed as a new financial instrument for cooperation with third countries<a href="#defann_47_10" name="refann_47_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The honourable Member can be assured that Commissioner in charge of Energy has made no statements to suggest or imply that Irish Government should consider selling portions of its State-owned energy firms (i.e. ESB and Bord Gais).</p>
<p>The Commission is, of course, aware of Article 295 of the Treaty and is committed to upholding the principles of this Article.</p>
<p>The situation in the energy markets in Ireland is characterised by a high level of market dominance of the existing state owned companies, particularly for electricity. In the light of the ongoing efforts to create a single market for electricity on the island of Ireland, such a level of dominance is counter-productive. Electricity and gas prices in Ireland are among the highest in the European Union.</p>
<p>In the newspaper article to which the honourable Member is referring, the Commissioner did indicate that, in the event of the Irish Government divesting existing companies, “[there] should be some additional conditions provided for newcomers in the Irish market to compete on the same level as the dominant companies.”</p>
<p>The Commissioner’s comments reflect experience to date with European electricity and gas markets, whereby competitive prices are more likely to be achieved where there is some degree of restructuring so that wholesale prices can be formed in a reliable way without suspicion of manipulation or the need for heavy handed regulation. These comments might therefore be seen as providing some advice to the Irish Government in the interests of promoting a competitive market on the island of Ireland.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0356"></a>

<p>(EN) The current high oil and gas prices, and their impact on electricity prices in Europe, are certainly raising concerns among European consumers.</p>
<p>The Commission would point, however, to the recent European Council statements encouraging the development of an energy policy for Europe with notably, a strong and coherent voice for Europe in external energy relations. It is clear from the comprehensive conclusions from this year’s Spring European Council that a strong external stance must go hand in hand with a strong internal stance, part of an overall energy policy for Europe. Thus, the current high prices and the concern about the evolving global energy situation may over time encourage the adoption of structural measures.</p>
<p>The Commission argues that sustainable, competitive and secure energy will not be achieved without open and competitive energy markets, based on competition between companies looking to become Europe-wide competitors rather than dominant national players.</p>
<p>This is part of the strategic response at the level of Europe as a whole which the Commission believes is necessary to deal with today’s energy challenges and has outlined in the Green Paper on a European Strategy for a Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. An approach based on 25 individual energy policies, or many small markets, is not sufficent to deliver the common objectives of sustainable, secure and competitive energy.</p>
<p>In the Growth and Jobs Strategy, energy policy is one of the four areas identified by the Commission for short-term reform.</p>
<p>Any government measures that could impinge on the functioning of the internal market would go against the objectives of boosting efficiency through optimal allocation of resources and exploiting the growth potential of the European economy to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>In a longer term perspective, energy efficient and low carbon technologies constitute a rapidly growing international market that will be worth billions of Euros in the coming years. Europe’s industries and companies have the potential to be world leaders in these new generations of technologies, processes and systems. If protectionism holds back the development of competition in the internal market, it may also hold back the development of strong European players in these new and expanding global markets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

At its meeting on 23-24 March 2006, the Council also stressed that the energy policy for Europe 'should fully respect Member States' sovereignty over primary energy sources and choice of energy mix' (document 7775/06, paragraph 47, 24 March 2006). However, the Commission and the Council are sending out ambiguous and contradictory signals.</p>
<p>In the green paper, the Commission stresses that it is appropriate to specify that a certain minimum level of the EU's overall energy mix should come from 'secure and low-carbon energy sources' (p. 18). The Commission will also draw up a 'road map' to determine how renewable energy is to be introduced in the Member States. The Commission notes that a strategic review of EU energy policy may allow 'a transparent and objective debate on the future role of nuclear energy in the EU, for those Member States concerned' (p. 9).</p>

<p>(EN) In the Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission notes that each Member State and energy company chooses its own energy mix. The Commission does not suggest any change to the corresponding Treaty article.</p>
<p>It is clear that choices made by one Member State inevitably have an impact on the energy security of its neighbours and of the Community as a whole, as well as on competitiveness and the environment. What the Commission suggests in the Green Paper is an improvement in the information available to Member States for their national decisions on the energy mix.</p>
<p>The idea is that there should be an analysis of all the advantages and drawbacks of different sources of energy, and the knock-on effects of these changes for the EU as a whole. This analysis could be included in the Strategic EU Energy Review, to be presented to the Council and Parliament on a regular basis, and to the Spring European Council.</p>
<p>On honourable Member’s first question, the Commission does not believe that the ability of Member States to choose between different energy sources and the general structure of their energy supply will be compromised if the Commission provides this analysis.</p>
<p>The honourable Member mentions the Commission taking a view on the EU's overall energy mix. To be clear, what it raised for debate in the Green Paper is the idea of an overall strategic objective, a benchmark against which the EU’s developing energy mix could be judged, relating to the agreed goals of sustainable energy use, competitiveness and security of supply. Such a benchmark, the Commission believes, would combine the freedom of Member States to choose between different energy sources and the need for the EU as a whole to have an energy mix that, overall, meets its core energy objectives.</p>
<p>The Green Paper suggests, by way of example, the level of the overall EU energy mix originating from secure and low-carbon energy sources to be a possible benchmark.</p>
<p>On the honourable Member’s second question, the Commission does not have the power to raise objections if an individual Member State chooses to satisfy national energy requirements by using only a small number of sources and types of energy, as long as the existing Directives are satisfied.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission acknowledges the importance of providing a longer term perspective, considering in particular the infant state of the renewable energy industry and the need to ensure sufficient investors’ security. On the basis of currently available feasibility studies, however, the Commission considers that prior to the adoption of targets beyond 2010 and to taking a position on a global target for the share of renewable energy in 2020, a more thorough assessment of the impacts of renewable energy sources is deemed necessary, notably with regard to their global economic effects.</p>
<p>As announced in the recently adopted Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission will bring forward a Renewable Energy Road Map that will consider which targets or objectives beyond 2010 are necessary, and the nature of such a targets, in order to provide long term certainty for industry and investors, as well as the supporting measures needed to make this a reality.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of the honourable Member on heating and cooling from renewable energies, the Commission would like to reiterate what the Commissioner in charge of Energy has explained on 14 February 2006 when the Parliament adopted the report of Mrs Rothe<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on this topic: The Commission is doing its utmost to address this important question. It will need to carry out an Impact Assessment to evaluate the best options to implement this action at the appropriate level in order to promote the production of heating and cooling in the most economical and environmental manner, also taking into account the social aspects. This assessment is complex due to the highly diffused use of heating and cooling from renewable energies, the difficulty to collect and analysis sound data and also the very wide range of actors involved.</p>
<p>The Commission expects to be able to present the results of this impact assessment in the second half of 2006. The Commission can reassure the honourable Member of its strong interest regarding this dossier and as a consequence it will be with pleasure that the Commission will come back to the Parliament with concrete proposals to finally better promote the production of heating and cooling from renewable energies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Indeed, the Commission is concerned by the recent increases in the price of oil and other energy resources<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. However, the Commission recognizes that prices of oil and most other energy commodities are set, or directly determined, by global markets.</p>
<p>A pragmatic if ambitious approach to dealing with high energy prices is needed. Already in September 2005, the Commissioner in charge of Energy presented a five Point Plan for dealing with high energy prices. This plan laid base for a systematic approach focusing on actions vis-à-vis the underlying factors of the rising energy prices.</p>
<p>This approach was further elaborated in March 2006 in the Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy<a href="#defann_52_2" name="refann_52_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which puts forward six priority areas of action:</p>
<p>towards a fully competitive internal energy market;</p>
<p>solidarity among Member States with regard to the internal energy supply policy;</p>
<p>a diverse, efficient &amp; sustainable energy mix;</p>
<p>an integrated approach to tackling climate change:</p>
<p>energy efficiency, renewable and low carbon energy production</p>
<p>an approach to energy technology and innovation; and</p>
<p>a coherent external energy policy.</p>
<p>These represent mutually interdependent domains in which the Commission intends to seek initiative in order to remedy the current situation. Collectively they represent a systematic approach, including internal and external action, completion of internal energy markets in Europe and a strategic approach to energy mix and R&amp;D.</p>
<p>The follow-up to the Green Paper, currently under discussion with European public and energy sectors’ stakeholders, should lead to lesser European dependency on external and finite energy sources bearing additional risks in terms of supply security and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Such approach should increase the ability of European economy as well as its citizens to cope well with new global realities in the energy sphere.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) First of all the Commission would like to point out that the EU is not in the process of “dismantling the Common Agricultural Policy as advocated by the World Trade Organisation”. What really is happening in the context of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) is that the Commission targets the binding in a World Trade Organisation (WTO) setting of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that resulted from the reform efforts undertaken in 2003-2005. In doing so it encourages the trading partners of the EU to similarly reduce their trade distorting support.</p>
<p>One of the priorities in the ongoing negotiations concerns particularly the development dimension of the DDA. The Commission is making every effort together with its partners in WTO to make this round of trade talks a success, also in the sense that poor farmers in developing countries will benefit from new trading opportunities. Traditionally special and differential treatment for developing Countries is part of the negotiated trade deals. Currently again possibilities for developing Countries to take specific measures that target poor farmers are object of negotiations.</p>
<p>Already in the past the EU has opened export possibilities for the poorest developing countries in its “Everything But Arms” initiative. A commitment to follow this example is already contained in the Declaration of the Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005. The Commission is confident that most developing countries will benefit from an agreement in WTO. It is also using its development policy to facilitate the adjustment efforts of these countries, and to support the weaker stakeholders in taking advantage of potential opportunities arising from a WTO agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0305"></a>

<p>(EN) The aim of Recommendation 2005/737/EC is to foster the creation of innovative EU wide licensing platforms for a variety of online services (e.g., "on demand" or webcasting services). The recommendation will have been successful if a large number of online customers can obtain EU-wide licenses from these new platforms and if, overall, EU-licensing will lead to online service growth and help to overcome the time lag with which new online services are introduced in the EU versus the United States.</p>
<p>Effective dispute resolution should contribute toward the above-stated aims. While it is left to the Member States to create the appropriate dispute resolution mechanisms, the effectiveness of these mechanisms will be reflected in the amount of time it takes to settle any disputes in relation to the tariffs that apply to the new EU license. Effectiveness will also be reflected in the time it takes to settle disputes in relation to the withdrawal and entrustment of online rights for effective cross-border management. Finally, parties should be free, when negotiating EU-wide or multi-territorial licenses, to opt for the most effective dispute resolution mechanism among those available in the different Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

For the sites that have been classified as SPAs there is no additional assessment by the Commission, thus the Commission is simply evaluating the sufficiency of the Member State proposed SPA lists. Following the submissions of proposed SCIs, the Commission has planned the necessary bio-geographical seminars needed for the scientific assessment and evaluation of the new Member States' proposals. In 2005, three bio-geographical seminars took place, to address the proposals for the Alpine, Pannonian and Boreal regions, while the seminar for the Continental region is planned for April 2006. Additionally, two screening meetings took place in Cyprus and Malta in 2005; the proposed Sites of Community Interest of these Member States were scrutinised.</p>
<p>Following the assessment and conclusions of these seminars and screening meetings, the Commission expects further sites to be proposed by those Member States for which gaps have been identified. It is expected that additional sites will be classified and that the majority of the identified gaps will be resolved during 2006. Further more, the Commission intends to take up bilateral meetings with those Member States for which gaps remain to fill them, prior to proceeding with the preparation of the draft Community lists to be adopted by a Commission Decision in the course of 2007.</p>
<p>The Commission is not following a different procedure for Cyprus and Malta. Both Member States belong to the Mediterranean region, however, the proposals from both countries include lists of sites with a wide variety of local endemic species and biotopes that are not common for both of them. Because of this, it has been decided that a prior screening will take place in each Member State to identify gaps and when these gaps are filled by the expected new proposals, a concluding Mediterranean seminar will be envisaged for finalising the Mediterranean list for these two Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the discussions in the United States (US) Congress in relation to the US Department of Tranportation’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on actual control of US air carriers. In finalising the text of the draft EU-US air transport agreement in November 2005, the Commission stated that, in reaching a decision on whether to proceed with an EU-US air Transport Agreement, the European Community and its Member States would consider the results of this process as expressed in a final rule. The Transport Council confirmed at its meeting on 27 March 2006 that the finalisation of this rule is seen by the European Union as an essential element of the draft agreement. The outcome of the process in the United States is therefore awaited before the Council can make its overall assessment, and this should not be prejudged.</p>
<p>Community law places Member States under certain obligations with respect to the negotiation and implementation of air services agreements with third countries, and in particular Member States must comply with the requirements of the Regulation on the negotiation and implementation fo air service agreements between Member States and third Countries<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

The EU-US agreement would replace all existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the United States, including that between Ireland and the United States. In the event of a notification by a Member State of an intention to enter negotiations with a third country with whom the Commission is actively negotiating, such as the United States, the Commission would consider whether the Member State’s negotiations would be likely to undermine the objectives of the Community negotiations already under way.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) On 22 March 2006, the Commission adopted a new Communication on “Implementing the partnership for growth and jobs: making Europe a pole of excellence on corporate social responsibility”. The Communication outlines the important role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in achieving the new strategy for growth and jobs and invites companies to step up their commitment to CSR in the interest of sustainable development, economic growth and more and better jobs. In the Communication the Commission announces backing for a new European Alliance on CSR, which is an open alliance of European enterprises. Backing for this Alliance is an important part of a wider partnership that the Commission wishes to develop with all stakeholders involved in CSR, with a view to making Europe a pole of excellence in this domain.</p>
<p>The new Communication builds on the Commission's achievements in CSR. In recent years, the EU has helped to create an understanding of why CSR matters to all stakeholders. In formulating its policy on CSR, the Commission considered at length the views and proposals of all stakeholders. The European Multistakeholder Forum on CSR achieved a measure of consensus amongst participants, but significant differences of opinion remained between business and non-business stakeholders. In this context, the Commission has sought a policy approach that is most likely to achieve the aim of making CSR part of mainstream business practice amongst all enterprises, the vast majority of which are small and medium Enterprises (SMEs). The new Communication and the Commission’s backing for the new European Alliance on CSR respond to that ambition.</p>
<p>In the Communication the Commission states that “because CSR is fundamentally about voluntary business behaviour, an approach involving additional obligations and administrative requirements for business risks being counter-productive and would be contrary to the principles of better regulation”. What companies can achieve through CSR is complementary to what they are required to do by law. Needless to say the Commission reserves its right to propose legislation on specific social and environmental issues where and when it believes that such legislation is necessary.</p>
<p>The new Communication makes very clear that the Commission remains fully committed to facilitating an inclusive dialogue with all stakeholders on CSR. Social partners and Non Governmental Organizations (NGO) made an important contribution in the context of the Multi-stakeholder forum. CSR instruments are discussed more and more often in European sectoral social dialogue committees. The Communication identifies support for multistakeholder initiatives on CSR as one of the priority areas for Commission action. In the Communication, the Commission also explicitly recognises that “without the active support and constructive criticism of non-business stakeholders, CSR will not flourish.”</p>
<p>That is why we state that our “backing of the Alliance is not a substitute for further dialogue with all stakeholders”, and propose regularly to re-convene meetings of the European Multistakeholder Forum, which has not met since June 2004. The first meeting will take place before the end of 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0313"></a>

<p>(EN) Parallel Trade is a lawful form of trade in goods between Member States of the European Union. It is based on the principle of the free movement of goods and facilitates the intra-community trade with similar plant protection products authorised in several Member States.</p>
<p>In its question the honourable Member refers to an amendment to the German plant protection act which is about to be adopted. By the amendment specific provisions on parallel trade will be introduced into German law.</p>
<p>During the legislative procedure, an alternative wording was discussed allowing products not authorised in the Member State of exportation and destination but either only in the Member State of exportation or only in the Member State of destination to benefit from the simplified authorisation procedure applicable for the marketing of parallel imports. The honourable Member is wondering about the compatibility of such wording with Community law.</p>
<p>In this respect it has to be noted that it is difficult for the Commission to comment on the basis of the wording of a single fragmentary sentence of a Member State’s law.</p>
<p>In any case, it has to be underlined that the factual circumstances the honourable Member refers to are not of parallel importation in its stricto sensu.</p>
<p>If the product imported is sufficiently similar to a product already authorised in the Member State of destination but not authorised in the Member State of exportation this could be qualified as a re-import, if both products are of common origin, or as an import of a generic. The marketing authorisation necessary for a generic differs in principle from the licence granted for parallel imports.</p>
<p>If the product imported has only an authorisation in the Member State of exportation the products shall be authorised in the Member State of destination before placing on the market according to Directive 91/414/EC.</p>
<p>These principles have to be taken into account by a Member State if regulating the placing on the market of plant protection products in its territory.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) There is no measurement framework available that allows an objective statement on this issue. Nevertheless, a number of studies have identified interoperability problems as one of the barriers for the uptake of pan-European eGovernment services.</p>
<p>At present, interoperability is often an after-thought, not an original design goal. Individual administrations develop their own information systems (or such information systems already exist) and it is only when the need arises to share/exchange information with other administrations that interoperability issues are taken into account. Also, interoperability is not only a technical, but also an organisational (compatibility between administrative processes) and legal (compatibility between legal systems) issue.</p>
<p>Most interoperability issues are dealt with within the various policy areas (public health, security, etc), either within the context of Community initiatives (when Community legislation foresees that information is shared or exchanged between the Member States or between the Member States and the Institutions) or within the context of bilateral or multilateral co-operation between Member States. Such efforts are complemented by work done by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) -CEN eGovernment Focus Group- and by guidelines (European Interoperability Framework and Architecture Guidelines) provided by the IDABC<a href="#defann_63_1" name="refann_63_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> programme. Such guidelines tackle non-sector specific ("horizontal") interoperability issues.</p>
<p>The recently adopted i2010 eGovernment Action Plan<a href="#defann_63_2" name="refann_63_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> emphasises the need to avoid barriers to the creation of cross border eGovernment services through joint work among Member States. It also proposes to focus on key enablers for high impact pan-European applications, notably putting in place by 2010 pan-European interoperable electronic identification and authentication mechanisms that will allow for easy to use and smart public services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Tourism has an important contribution to make to regional development.</p>
<p>Among the financial instruments available to the Union, the Structural Funds are the main source of funding for projects directly or indirectly linked with tourism. In the current programming period, tourism has a significant presence in structural interventions. Many programmes have strands specifically devoted to the development of tourist-related infrastructure or projects, protection of the heritage and other related activities.</p>
<p>The Structural Funds have contributed, for example, to the expansion of the Palma de Majorca air terminal in the Balearic Islands (Spain) (EU contribution of €4.5 million by the Cohesion Fund, for a total cost of €6 million).</p>
<p>In the next programming period, the Commission has proposed that, under the “Convergence” objective, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) shall focus its assistance on a number of priorities, among which tourism. The precise policy-mix, and thus the relative weight attributed to tourism in the allocation of funds, will depend on the specificities of each Member State.</p>
<p>In the area of tourism, eligible activities will include promotion of natural assets as potential for the development of sustainable tourism; protection and enhancement of the natural heritage in support of socio-economic development; aid to improve the supply of tourism services through new higher value-added services and to encourage new, more sustainable patterns of tourism.</p>
<p>In addition, the development of sustainable tourism can be also supported under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective and under the European territorial cooperation objective (both cross-border and transnational cooperation strands).</p>
<p>In particular, the ERDF intervention in areas with geographical and natural handicaps (as islands) shall pay particular attention to addressing the specific difficulties of those areas and may in particular contribute to finance investments aimed at, among other priorities, encouraging sustainable tourism.</p>
<p>The potential of an integrated approach between the European Social Fund (ESF) and the ERDF is to be taken into consideration as well.</p>
<p>Training does not go without the necessary infrastructure. Tourism development – often requiring infrastructure development- may also require investment in the knowledge of people –for example future guides - about the cultural, natural heritage or other issues.</p>
<p>The ERDF and the ESF may finance, in a complementary manner and subject to a limit of 10% of Community funding to each priority axis of an operational programme, actions falling within the scope of assistance from the other Fund, provided that they are necessary for the satisfactory implementation of the operation and are directly linked to it.</p>
<p>The Commission has already started informal negotiations with Member States on the national strategic reference frameworks for the implementation of operational programmes.</p>
<p>In the preparation of the national strategic reference frameworks and operational programmes, each Member State, in dialogue with the Commission, has to find the right policy mix for its own development path in the light of its particular economic, social, cultural and institutional conditions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0342"></a>

So long as the two types of plant are separate from each other, the rules on waste and combustion can be applied separately, provided that the product which is supplied by the waste processing installation to the combustion plant can be regarded not as waste but as fuel. However, as soon as these plants are linked, the rules which are laid down for waste apply in full to the large combustion plant. This can mean that, at a large power plant, unnecessary measuring reports have to be produced. It can also mean that when a fault occurs which has nothing to do with the operation of the waste processing plant, the operation of the combustion plant has to be halted within a few hours.

<p>(EN) The possible application of the Waste Incineration Directive 2000/76/EC at a large combustion plant is not dependent on whether or not there is a link with a waste processing plant. Rather, the determining factor is whether a large combustion plant incinerates or co-incinerates any "waste", meaning any solid or liquid waste as defined in Article 1(a) of Directive 75/442/EEC (the so-called Waste Framework Directive). If it does not, then even if a large combustion plant is linked with a waste processing plant, which supplies a fuel that legitimately no longer meets the definition of waste, the combustion plant is not subject to the Waste Incineration Directive, but instead will be subject to the Large Combustion Plants Directive 2001/80/EC (replacing Directive 88/609/EEC). If the combustion plant does incinerate or co-incinerate some "waste", however, then it will be subject to a combination of the requirements of the Waste Incineration and Large Combustion Plants Directives. In practical cases, it will be the competent authorities of the Member States that will assess whether or not a material is "waste", taking account of the definition of the Waste Framework Directive and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>The possible linkage of a combustion plant and a waste processing plant may be a relevant factor in deciding whether the plants form one "installation" or two for the purposes of Directive 96/61/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC). However, this does not affect the separate identification of the "co- incineration plant" and "combustion plant" for the Waste Incineration and Large Combustion Plants Directives respectively. These Directives apply only to the discrete parts of the "installation" that constitute the "plant" for their purposes, in this respect setting the minimum requirements for those plants, without prejudice to the application of the IPPC Directive to the installation as a whole.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The first officials from the new Member States were recruited on 1 May 2004 on the basis of successfully completed enlargement competitions prepared by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).</p>
<p>As indicated in the Communication on “recruitment of officials and temporary staff from the New Member States (EUR-10) at the Commission”, the indicative overall EUR-10 recruitment target over the 7-year transition period (2004-2010) was set at 3441 establishment plan posts (i.e. posts for officials and temporary staff). Indicative recruitment targets were also established for each new Member State. These indicative targets were determined by considering the relative weights of each Member State in an enlarged European Union according to the following three criteria: the number of inhabitants, the weighting of votes in the Council and the number of seats in the Parliament. For Cyprus, the recruitment target was hence set at 110 posts. For comparison, Malta’s target was fixed at 83 according to the same criteria.</p>
<p>On 15 January 2006, the cut-off date for the figures released in the above-mentioned Communication, the Commission had indeed recruited 49 A*, B* ad C* grade staff from Cyprus. Notwithstanding difficulties encountered, 20 months after accession, this represents already 45% of the 2004-2010 recruitment target for Cyprus, which the Commission considers as a good result. For comparison, the global EUR-10 average is 47%. For this period, Malta indeed had a better result (68%). It should be pointed out, however, that since Malta accession brought a new official language to the EU, part of the maltese recruits consists understandably of translators. The same necessity did not occur for recruits from Cyprus, whose accession did not bring an additional official language to the EU. In addition, as far as senior management is concerned, Cypriot nationals are adequately represented.</p>
<p>The number of recruitments depends on several elements:</p>
<p>the availability of laureates on reserve lists. It is clear that in some competitions the number of successful candidates was considerably smaller than expected and did not satisfy the recruitment needs of the Commission;</p>
<p>the profile of the candidates;</p>
<p>language coverage;</p>
<p>the ability to pass a selection interview for their recruitment;</p>
<p>the needs of services; and,</p>
<p>the willingness of the laureates to accept the offer. In this respect, it must be stressed that a high number of candidates from the new Member States has refused the offer of the Commission.</p>
<p>Taking into account the fact that targets per nationality should be reached by the end of the transition period (2010), it cannot be considered that, at the present time, there is a significant problem as regards the recruitment of Cypriote nationals. The Commission will, however, continue to monitor and review all stages of the implementation of its recruitment strategy with the aim of ensuring that the Commission has an appropriate staff balance by the end of the transition period.</p>
<p>It should be noted finally that the above-mentioned figures do not cover the situation of the other Institutions, for which the Commission has no responsibility.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0347"></a>

<p>(EN) Involuntary infertility is a serious medical condition and has serious negative consequences on the wellbeing of the couples concerned. Reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) play an important role in remedying involuntary infertility. It is up to Member States to determine whether such treatments are covered by social insurance and whether they are provided by public health care systems. The Commission does not have information on public support for, or public provision of, IVF or other assisted reproductive technology.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the need to avail of detailed information on involuntary infertility. This is why it has invited its experts on demography and health in the 'Social Situation Observatory' to investigate the literature on this issue as part of their annual work programme for 2006. First results of this work are expected to be available in 2006.</p>
<p>The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology<a href="#defann_71_1" name="refann_71_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (ESHRE) collect data on the use of assisted reproductive technology in most EU countries. The results of the Fourth European report on Androgen Replacement Therapy (ART) in Europe, conducted by the ESRHE, contain data until 2002 and cover all Western Europe countries. In the five years since 1997 to 2002, the numbers of treatment cycles have increased by 62%, from 203 225 to 324 238. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) accounts for approximately 96% of these procedures. The success rate across Europe was in 2002 an average of 26% (per aspiration) and 29.5% (per transfer) of treatment cycles resulting in a live birth. 24.5% of the IVF births in Europe were multiples (22.5% twins, 2% triplets or more).</p>
<p>IVF interventions in EU Member States account for 1 to 4% of all births. Information on the extent of unmet demand for treatments is not available. It is therefore not possible to estimate how many more children might be born if such treatments were more widely available. However, it is unlikely that the wider availability of assistive reproductive techniques would significantly contribute to increasing fertility rates in Europe.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently preparing a Communication on the demographic future of Europe as a follow-up to the Green Paper on Demography. While increased fertility will not stop demographic ageing, it is important to understand the reasons for Europe's very low fertility rates. Given the difficulty of reconciling professional and private lives, far too often, women postpone child births or have fewer children as a result. Creating the appropriate conditions for couples to have their children preferably before the age of 35, is likely to be a more effective way of dealing with infertility problems and of increasing European birth rates.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This is the reason why the EC is highly supportive of Special and Differential treatment for Developing Countries (DCs), including the possibility for DCs to designate Special Products and to have recourse to a Special Safeguard Mechanism. The EC wants to treat Developing Countries according to their level of development. This is the reason why we do not, for example, expect Least Developing Countries (LDCs) to make any major concessions in this Round.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, ‘Doha Development Round is not a synonym for ‘Doha Agricultural Round’, nor is agriculture the only key to development. The argument that the greatest benefits in Doha for developing countries will come from freer farm trade is often only used to push the EC to make further concessions on agriculture. The World Bank's Global Development Report actually suggests that the vast majority of gains for developing countries lie in services liberalisation, industrial products and trade facilitation.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, developing countries have moved beyond their traditional specialization in agriculture into manufactures. 62% of tariffs paid by developing countries are paid to other developing countries and mainly on industrial products. Liberalising trade in manufactures would easily match the benefits for developing countries of lowering barriers to farm trade. Countries that have grown most in recent years are those that have actually moved away from agricultural trade to trade in industrial goods and services.</p>

<p>During a visit to India by the European Parliament’s Tibet Intergroup, which took place from 27 February to 4 March 2006, I had the honour of meeting the Dalai Lama. In a discussion with members of the Intergroup, the Dalai Lama emphasised that he entirely agreed that Tibet should be an autonomous part of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Talks are being held between representatives of the Dalai Lama and representatives of the PRC. The fifth round of talks took place in February 2006, without, however, producing any serious outcome. These talks have no future because they are being held at expert level and do not address the fundamental issues relating to Tibetan autonomy. Until agreement is reached on the status of an autonomous Tibetan republic, serious human rights violations will continue to be committed in Tibet, violations that show the signs of approaching a genocide of the Tibetan people.</p>
<p>What is the Commission doing, or what does it intend to do, in order that talks might be held between the Dalai Lama himself and the leaders of the PRC, or between the Tibetan Prime Minister in exile and the Prime Minister of the PRC, with a view to resolving the fundamental issues relating to the status of Tibet, the details of which can be discussed by lower-ranking officials at a later stage?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the view expressed by the honourable Member regarding the situation of human rights in Tibet. The EU has regularly raised, in the framework of both the political dialogue, including at the highest level, and the EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights, the issue of fundamental rights in Tibet, including the case of individuals as well as the protection and maintenance of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people.</p>
<p>It has been a long-standing position of the EU, in the context of its overall political dialogue with China, to call for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama as the only realistic way to reach a peaceful and lasting solution of the question of Tibet. The Commission therefore welcomes the fifth round of talks which took place in China from 13 to 22 February 2006 between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of the Dalai Lama to pave the way for establishing such a dialogue.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that the fifth round of talks has not produced any substantial outcome, the Commission, however, found encouraging the assessment by one of the Dalai Lama’s special envoys who considered positive the strengthening, at this occasion, of good personal relations between the Tibetan and the Chinese sides to the extent that it laid the ground for mutual trust and allowed for the first time for a clear understanding of where the differences lie, thus making the dialogue more meaningful.</p>
<p>The honourable Member can be reassured that the Commission will continue to encourage in any possible manner the early launching of a direct dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0378"></a>

<p>On 24 March 2006, a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties visited detention centres for illegal immigrants in Malta and witnessed the gravity of the situation there. Parliament has adopted a joint resolution on the crisis experienced on a daily basis by Malta, which lacks the resources to cope with the continual arrivals of illegal immigrants. Furthermore, Malta is devoting 1% of its GDP to this crisis, while 10% of its security forces are engaged in dealing with it. Parliament's resolution (<a href="/doceo/document/TA-6-2006-0136_EN.html">P6_TA(2006)0136</a>) points out that, despite its efforts, Malta is unable to fully apply Regulation (EC) No 343/2003<a href="#defann_75_1" name="refann_75_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> ('Dublin II') and calls for it to be exempted from its provisions. Parliament has called on all Member States to assist Malta in its efforts by each sharing part of the burden, bearing in mind that Malta is not the final destination of the illegal immigrants who land there. It has also called on the Council to hold an extraordinary meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Malta itself as soon as possible in order to discuss the crisis.</p>
<p>As also requested by Parliament, the Commission should propose the setting up without delay, of a fund for humanitarian emergencies such as the current immigration crisis in Malta and take steps to amend 'Dublin II', with a view to sharing the task of considering asylum applications among all Member States, rather than leaving it to the country in which they first arrive.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the reception conditions of asylum seekers, refugees and irregular migrants in Malta and is taking action to improve the overall situation, including the conditions in which they are accommodated.</p>
<p>The problems faced by Malta affect the European Union as a whole and need a global approach to the management of migration and asylum. The external borders of the European Union are under permanent pressure from irregular migratory flows and many people who undertake these journeys require international protection.</p>
<p>The European Council in December 2005 identified a series of measures that will enhance the EU's external policies on migration and asylum. The Commission is actively engaged in finding structural answers to the heavy migration pressure on EU borders, together with its partner countries. In this respect, the EU-Africa Ministerial Conference on 10 and 11 July 2005 in Rabat, reinforced cooperation with the African Union and dialogue with the main countries of origin are important initiatives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission is carrying out an evaluation of the Dublin II Regulation which will be presented in Autumn. It should be recalled that this Regulation reflects the main principles of the EU asylum policy – that a single Member State should take responsibility for the examination of an application for asylum.</p>
<p>However, the most immediate assistance available to Malta at EU level is through the EU financial programmes. The European Refugee Fund already provides financial support for Member States in bearing the consequences of receiving refugees and displaced persons. Support for the development of adequate reception conditions for asylum seekers is a priority of the European Refugee Fund and Malta benefits from the Fund's assistance in this area. The European Refugee Fund allocated to Malta €114.000 in 2004, €500.000 in 2005 and €600.000 in 2006.</p>
<p>In addition, most recently the Commission agreed to provide €120.000 in order to fund a project designed to improve reception conditions on Malta within the framework of the ARGO Programme.</p>
<p>In this respect, the Commission is going to make available, within the framework of the ARGO Programme for 2006, €2.7 million which could be immediately used by Member States for urgent situations, such as those faced by Malta. The funds could be used, for example, to improve the reception and administrative capacity of a Member State confronted with large numbers of irregular immigrants arriving at its external border.</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to address specific situation such as those faced by Malta in recent months, amendments will also be proposed to the European Refugee Fund to enable Member States to access funds quickly and with a minimum of bureaucratic process to deal with the consequences of sudden arrivals of large numbers of people who may be in need of international protection. Specifically, the amendments will aim to support emergency measures to grant appropriate reception conditions for asylum seekers, including basic needs as well as fair and effective asylum procedures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission understands that illegally-sourced material refers to illegally-sourced timber. Its answer has been prepared accordingly.</p>
<p>Policy to address illegal logging and the trade in illegally-harvested timber has been set out in the EU Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT). The Action Plan sets out a new approach, which uses the incentives and influence of the EU market to help in the fight against illegal logging and the associated trade.</p>
<p>The main elements of the Action Plan are support for improved governance in wood-producing countries, and a licensing scheme to ensure only legal timber enters the EU from countries with FLEGT Partnership agreements with the Community. These elements will be implemented through partnership agreements to be negotiated with wood-producing countries.</p>
<p>Other elements of the FLEGT Action Plan include the use of green public procurement policies by Member States’ authorities, and encouragement for complementary private sector initiatives based on principles of corporate social responsibility. These include codes of conduct, designed to exclude the import of illegal timber to the EU.</p>
<p>The licensing scheme and partnership agreements are in the process of being developed together with potential FLEGT partner countries. Once the agreements enter into force, the Community will be able to prevent entry of illegally harvested timber shipments from FLEGT partner countries through the provisions of Council Regulation 2173/2005 of 20 December 2005, the legal basis which has been specifically established for the licensing scheme. Furthermore, the partnership agreements themselves will include extensive provisions for in-country monitoring as well as procedures for corrective action when problems are identified.</p>
<p>Imports into the Community of timber species listed in the Appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) are subject to the controls foreseen by the Convention, which are transposed into Community Law by Regulation (EC) No. 338/97, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No. 1332/2005. Therefore no CITES-listed timber can be legally imported into the Community without the relevant import permit, export permit or certificate of origin, which can only be issued in respect of legally sourced timber. The Regulations provide for appropriate sanctions to be imposed for attempts to import shipments not covered by the relevant permits.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0383"></a>

<p>(EN) At the current state of development of Community legislation in the field of migration, no binding rules exist concerning the conditions of stay of illegally residing third-country nationals. It is therefore not possible to judge the compatibility of the referred national legislation with community law.</p>

For this purpose, reference is made to a set of conditions, already laid down in an existing instrument of Community law: Articles 7 to 10, Article 15 and Articles 17 to 20 of Council Directive 2003/9/EC<a href="#defann_78_2" name="refann_78_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> of 27 January 2003 laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers. These provisions contain detailed rules on residence and freedom of movement, respect for family unity, medical screening, the right for schooling and education of minors, necessary health care as well as an obligation on Member States to take into account the situation of persons with special needs (minors, unaccompanied minors and victims of torture and violence).

<p>(EN) The Commission is deeply concerned by the extent of the theft of cultural objects and their illicit trafficking, especially during or following military conflicts.

This criminal activity engenders considerable profit with a limited risk due to differences between national legislation including criminal provisions and law enforcement tools to track and pursue the perpetrators.</p>
<p>The EU may provide a framework for cooperation mechanism and for exchanging best practice among the relevant public and private bodies. Thus Directive 93/7/EC on the return of unlawfully transferred cultural property sets up arrangements enabling Member States to secure the return to their territory of cultural objects which have been removed from their territory in breach of the national measures.</p>

<p>Following the recommendations of the Council and the Parliament adopted in 2002, the Commission has pursued the discussions on the reinforcement of the fight against illegal trade in cultural goods with a view to the adoption of the most appropriate legislation. Moreover, Europol, in association with national experts, is working on the feasibility of setting up a European database of stolen cultural goods.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0387"></a>

<p>(EN) The bilateral relations between the EU and Iran are at a low point. The lack of progress by Iran over a long period of time in the area of human rights, and, in particular, the lack of the country’s cooperation with the IAEA, have both strongly contributed to the current situation.</p>
<p>Certainly, the possibilities to interact positively with Iran in a number of areas would be greatly enhanced if the country chose to comply with all the past resolutions of the IAEA. This message was very clearly conveyed to Iran in the nuclear “incentive package” endorsed by the EU and tabled by “EU3” (UK, France, Germany) in 2005 but which, regrettably, was rejected by the Iranian side in August 2005.</p>
<p>As regards the situation on human rights, the view of the Commission and of all EU Member States, as well as of the leading international human rights organisations, is that we have, sadly, been witnessing a consistent deterioration in the respect for fundamental rights in Iran, with no visible signs of improvement since the installation of the new government under President Ahmadinejad.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0389"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is concerned about the terrorist attacks and violence occurring in the South East of Turkey and the spread of such events to other areas of the country.</p>
<p>According to information available to the Commission, of the 91 children placed under arrest on charges of "violating the integrity of the state” and "inciting and provoking the people to rebellion, resentment and hostility", 34 have been released following an appeal by the Diyarbakir Bar Association Children's Rights Centre. 57 children are still under arrest.</p>
<p>The 2005 Law on Child Protection provides specific procedures for dealing with minors. However, juvenile offenders are still prosecuted within the ordinary penal framework, although sentences and penalties may be different. The Turkish National Plan of Action aims to establish juvenile courts in all provinces by 2015.</p>
<p>As regards judicial reforms, the Minister of Justice has repealed more than 3000 circulars issued before December 2005 and replaced them with 127 new ones taking into account the recent major changes in the Turkish legal system (Penal Code etc.). Two such circulars recall the need to respect the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) and its related case law as well as Article 90 of the Constitution which refers to the primacy of international and European law over domestic law in human rights issues.</p>
<p>Under the Copenhagen political criteria, Turkey must ensure respect for fundamental rights, minority and cultural rights, as set out in the revised Accession Partnership adopted by the Council in January 2006. The Commission uses every opportunity in its contacts with the Turkish authorities to emphasise that the situation in the South East of the country needs to improve and fundamental rights must be fully respected. The Commission will continue to follow the situation closely in the framework of its regular monitoring of the political criteria.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0392"></a>

<p>(EN) The multi-sectorial agreement on respirable quartz (crystalline silica), signed on 25 April 2006, by 17 employers and workers organisations covering the majority of the EU users and producers of silica, is a positive step forward in the reduction of workers' exposure to this substance. The Commission strongly supports this important contribution of the social partners to the health and safety of workers in European industry.</p>
<p>The Commissions replies to the specific questions raised by the honourable Member are as follows:</p>
<p>The Commission confirms that the agreement reached by social partners on crystalline silica does not prevent any legislative initiative that the Commission would deem necessary in the exercise of its right of initiative.</p>
<p>The Commission has not changed, due to the conclusion of the agreement, its position, as stated in its communication "Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006"<a href="#defann_82_1" name="refann_82_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, as regards a possible amendment of Directive 2004/37/EC<a href="#defann_82_2" name="refann_82_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The inclusion of any substance within the scope of Directive 2004/37/EC is directly determined by its classification as carcinogenic or mutagenic categories 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The Commission recognizes that workers in the building industry are a significant proportion of EU workers that are exposed to quartz. This is why the Commission encourages the Construction sector to adhere to the agreement. The Commission notes that the European Federation of Building and Woodworkers in the EEC (EFBWW) participated as an observer at the beginning of the negotiations on this agreement.</p>
<p>The EU legislation on health and safety at work, including Directives 98/24/EC<a href="#defann_82_3" name="refann_82_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and 2004/37/EC, covers all sectors of economic activity, public and private.

<p>(EN) The competition rules of the EC Treaty establish the framework for ensuring undistorted competition in the common market. These rules ensure that media undertakings do not engage in anti-competitive behaviour or abuse a dominant position in what is a rapidly evolving media environment. These rules also ensure that competition between undertakings - irrespective of their private or public ownership - is not distorted through State aid which is incompatible with the Common Market. The Commission has clarified the State aid rules as laid down in the EC Treaty in a number of communications, including a communication on the application of State aid rules to public service broadcasting, which was published in the Official Journal in 2001<a href="#defann_86_1" name="refann_86_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This Communication lays down the conditions under which Member States may grant financial support to public service broadcasters without unnecessarily distorting competition between public and private broadcasters. Concentrations between, or involving, media undertakings, to the extent that they fall under the Community’s jurisdiction, are also assessed in the light of EC competition rules.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it should also be noted that setting the rules for (media) ownership and assessing their implications for social, cultural and political changes lie within the competence of the Member States. This is of course subject to the need to ensure compatibility with Community law, particularly the principles of freedom of establishment, freedom to provide services and free movement of capital.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At Parliament’s April part-session I put a question to the Commission concerning the purpose, powers and composition of the High Level Group on Competitiveness, Energy and the Environment. The answer concerning the composition of the group, in which there is not a single representative of interest groups from the new EU Member States, is unsatisfactory. I am therefore asking an additional question which is directly related to the Commission’s answer (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0230_EN.html">H-0230/06</a><a href="#defann_87_1" name="refann_87_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>).</p>
<p>The Commission explained that there were no experts from the new Member States in the High Level Group because the members of the group had been invited ad personam on the basis of their professional experience, and that they did not represent their national governments. The Commission stated that it had attempted to gather together experts in the areas of competitiveness, energy and the environment and that geographical distribution and national interests had played no part whatsoever. In view of this answer, I have the following questions.</p>
<p>Does the Commission believe that there are no suitable experts in the new Member States who have equal expertise in the areas of industry, energy and the environment and who could work together with experts from the EU-15?</p>
<p>On what specific criteria did the Commission base its choice of experts?</p>
<p>Does the Commission believe that experts from the EU-15 gathering information on the situation in all EU Member States will be sufficient to reduce the current large disparities between the so-called old and new Member States in the areas mentioned above?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The High Level Group on Competitiveness, Energy and the Environment is addressing the need for a more stable and predictable regulatory framework. By setting up this Group, the Commission seeks to promote the dialogue, notably with industry, relevant stakeholders and public authorities on issues of high policy priority in areas where competitiveness, energy and the environment inter-relate.</p>
<p>The High Level Group includes experts from the new European Union Member States. A Latvian citizen who has expertise in the public utilities sector of post-transition economies has been appointed a member of the High Level Group. Moreover, experts from the new Member States, notably Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic have been involved in the ad hoc groups that were created to provide relevant input for the reflections of the High Level Group.</p>
<p>The experts, participating in the various ad hoc groups set up to prepare the High Level Group meetings, have been selected on the basis of their expertise. They were selected and invited by the Commission on the basis of their specific competences and experience in the fields and issues being addressed by the ad hoc groups in which they were involved. These experts have been working at national, EU and international level. They have sent spontaneous applications or their names were suggested by stakeholders, including industry associations, trade unions, NGOs and other public and private organisations. This pro-active attitude of the experts and stakeholders is welcome and encouraged. There will be further possibilities for participating in the ad hoc groups that will be created in the future, or sending written contributions. The Commission will pay full attention to ensure a balanced representation in all these new ad hoc groups, including experts from EU-10 countries.</p>
<p>The High Level Group is mandated to give advice on policy challenges concerning the interrelationship between competitiveness, energy and the environment. Implementation of effective solutions to these challenges falls under the responsibilities of all actors, including industry, the Member States, the Commission, etc. To ensure that the meetings are not so large as to inhibit efficient participation, it is not possible to involve all the highly qualified people who have expressed an interest in participating. Nevertheless, the Commission debriefs a wide number of groups on which all Member States sit (including the Council Working Groups) on the work of the High Level Group and the main documents of the Group are available on-line (http://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/environment/hlg/hlg_en.htm).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The election contest revealed Hamas to be the leading political force and, once again, everyone declared that they respected that result.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees with the honourable Member that the Palestinian elections were transparent and that they demonstrated the commitment of the Palestinian people to work within democratic structures. The Commission supported the elections and respects their outcome. But the outcome has consequences - the emergence of a Palestinian Authority whose government is led by members of an organisation included in the EU terrorist list.</p>
<p>The Quartet and Council have therefore set out clear principles for engagement with the Palestinian Authority. The Council has stated that the EU could not continue business as usual.</p>
<p>The Commissioner in charge of external affairs made clear what this means when she addressed this House on 26 April: the Commission has suspended payments going to the Palestinian government, but it has not suspended aid to the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>The Commission is all too aware that the economic, social and humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories is getting worse.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the beginning of this year, the Commission has stepped up our aid to the Palestinians. In February, the Commission announced a €120 million package of aid including help for the refugees, and with fuel bills. €100 million of this has already been paid. This represents an acceleration of our aid to the Palestinian people, not a suspension.</p>
<p>The Commission is looking at further measures to help the population along with other Quartet members and EU Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission is not imposing an economic embargo on the Palestinians as the honourable Member contends but on the contrary, it is doing all in its power to avert a crisis. But the Commission must be clear on one point: the key to preventing a humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territories lies with Israel and the Palestinian Authority, not the international community.</p>
<p>The major issue is Israel withholding Palestinian customs and tax revenues. Withholding them means that basic services can’t be delivered, and salaries cannot be paid. The increased closures of territory in the West Bank and into and out of Gaza have also had dramatic effects.</p>
<p>The Commission is addressing these issues directly with Israel and in conjunction with international partners in the Quartet.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
