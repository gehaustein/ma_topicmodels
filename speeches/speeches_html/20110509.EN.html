<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President.</span></span>   – I would like to start by making a few comments. Today we are celebrating Europe Day. I have spent most of the day in Florence which, as you know, is the home of the European University Institute and where the Festival of Europe is taking place. A conference on the subject of the state of the European Union took place there too, and I met students from the European University Institute.</p>
<p class="contents">We are celebrating the 61st anniversary of Robert Schuman’s momentous declaration which paved the way for the creation of the European Union, and we have now achieved a great deal together. Robert Schuman would have been proud of our accomplishments. Our founding fathers knew that crises exist in order to be overcome and to help us build solid foundations for the future, so today, 9 May, remembering the past, we are working on the present and looking forward to the future with hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union is, today, a full participant in international affairs. This was confirmed on 3 May by the United Nations General Assembly, which accepted the participation of the European Union in the work of the United Nations by an overwhelming majority. Representatives of the European Union will be able to speak at the General Assembly and submit amendments agreed by the Member States of the EU. This is a joint achievement of the Member States, the Commission and Council, but also of the European Parliament. Our voice and actions must remain united. Our joint action is particularly important, as we face the need to decide on further action in North Africa, where tensions are rising, as well as in Syria and Bahrain.</p>
<p class="contents">Item three: on 17 May, we will be observing the International Day Against Homophobia in the European Union. The European Union is fighting discrimination on all fronts, in Europe as well as beyond. Homophobia is not an exception. Unfortunately, people all over the world are still being persecuted, tortured and even killed. The obligation to protect the discriminated is embodied in our most important legal acts – in the Treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We will keep to this obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, item number four: the European Parliament totally condemns the execution of one of the men sentenced to death by the army tribunal in the Gaza Strip for cooperation with Israel. The European Union is always against the death penalty. A return to carrying out executions undermines efforts for a lasting reconciliation in Palestine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title4"></a><a name="creitem4"></a>

<p class="contents">Since February 2011, the price of oil has been steadily rising, and has recently exceeded the USD 100 mark. Fishermen in every European coastal region are being hit hard by this oil price rise.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, fishing operating costs are soaring while the price of oil is rising. Small-scale fishing, in particular, is severely affected. Fishermen’s incomes are also dependent on the price of oil. Professionals everywhere are telling me that they are concerned about the rise in oil prices. I want us to act together to ensure that businesses can carry out their work despite the rise in operating costs.</p>
<p class="contents">With this question and the resolution that will follow, I call on the Member States to help fishing professionals, where necessary, to continue their work without distorting competition. Hence, I am calling for the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> aid threshold to be increased from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per firm. This in no way means increasing Parliament’s budget or the European budget. <span class="italic">De minimis</span> aid is aid that the Member States may grant to their businesses if they believe it will not distort competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I am calling for a little more flexibility for the Member States. I am also calling for the Commission to analyse my request thoroughly and to understand the concerns of an entire sector, which must be preserved and developed. The fishing community consists of men and women who need a decent income, whom we must support. As a result, among other things, of the rise in imported fishery and aquaculture products on the European market, that sector is becoming increasingly fragile. This is not just about economic profit. It is in our interests to preserve this activity; by doing so, we can develop our territory and coastal regions, ensure the European Union’s food security and safeguard jobs in the sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fuel price is high, yet the price of fish is low, at a record low, in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would draw your attention to the fishing of plaice. Plaice fishing is important for my country, the Netherlands, but also for France, Belgium, England and Denmark. A few years ago, plaice stocks were very low, as a result of which duty-free importation of other flatfish was permitted. Cheap alternatives, less tasty too, but that is beside the point. However, today we have enough plaice and yet, the duty-free importation of cheap flatfish is continuing. As a result, fresh plaice is sold at far below the cost price or withdrawn from the market and auctioned off. What a regrettable situation! The duty-free importation of plaice fillets must stop, Mr President. It is not only fishermen, but also the processing industry and the market who want that. Why? The survival of fishermen is essential for traders, otherwise traders will not be able to offer plaice in their range in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we urgently need concrete measures. This crisis demands that Europe take decisive action. I call on you to vote for such action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fishermen in all European seas complain about the painful drop in income, which may be severe enough to threaten their existence. Yet, why is the income of our fishermen decreasing? As far as I can see, there are three reasons for this. Firstly, there is the decline in fish stocks; secondly, the general fall in prices in precisely the area where fish stocks are healthy and supply is too high; and thirdly – and this is what we are concerned about today – operating costs are higher as a result of rising crude oil prices.</p>
<p class="contents">We politicians need to step in here. We must do what we can to help. I would stress that we can only do what we can. The motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) promises more than we can deliver. It demands an increase of 100% in the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> aid ceiling from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000, which is to be used to fund fuel subsidies. However, fuel subsidies are something that many Member States really cannot afford. Therefore, most fishermen would not be helped by this at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the other two problems would still remain: firstly, overfishing would actually increase and, secondly, it would not solve the problem of market prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Where financial support for fisheries is concerned, I can see a much greater problem. The Member States do not use the resources of the European Fisheries Fund, although the European Union pays 50%. Something urgently needs to change in this regard in the interests of our fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us work together to produce a differentiated text by Thursday and jointly come up with a sensible, sustainable and less showy fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, when it comes to the increase in oil prices, there are actually two sectors which are exempt from all energy taxes already and those are aviation and shipping – including fisheries. So, compared to all other sectors in the European Union, fisheries are proportionally less affected by the rise in oil prices since they are already exempt from all the taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is already a hidden subsidy which has contributed to making it possible for European fisheries to go on fishing depleted fish stocks; and the segments in the fisheries sector which have the highest consumption of fossil fuels are, in fact, the most destructive ones, such as beam trawlers and bottom trawlers. So the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> has already been increased tenfold in 2008; this is also a large subsidiary to the sector. Yet, at the same time, we are making lots of promises in the international arena to reduce CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, in fact, by 80-95% by 2050; we have also promised in Nagoya to eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies by 2020; in the WTO negotiation context, we are also focusing on how to eliminate the distortion of fishery subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would think that, if the EU were to introduce an increased <span class="italic">de minimis</span> at this point in time, it is likely to undermine the EU leadership in the ongoing negotiation process, sending a signal round the world that other countries, too, could increase their fishery subsidies on fuel, which would lead to a vicious circle, increasing the pressure on the world’s fish stocks. This is absolutely not what we need at this time: we need to turn around the trend, and this would send completely the wrong signal. The market must take the increase in prices, and this is what the Commission must focus on in the CFP reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fuel prices are one reason for the problems we have, but they are not the only reason.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to fuel prices, in order to address this situation, the Commission encourages the Member States to use fully the possibilities offered by the European Fisheries Fund. We have not used those possibilities. Up to now, the Member States have used less than 20% of the overall allocation.</p>
<p class="contents">The high fuel prices could be best addressed by the use of those EFF measures that help to restructure the fishing fleet and add more value to fisheries products, thus improving prices. It is likely that fuel prices will remain high in the coming years. Of course, last week the prices fell, but nevertheless we can expect prices to remain high.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission is reflecting, in the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy and the Financial Regulation, on how to further incentivise less fuel-intensive fishing. The objective will be to encourage the adjustment of the sector and to increase its resilience to fuel prices. However, such an approach needs to respect the principle that financial assistance may not, under any circumstances, increase fishing effort.</p>
<p class="contents">The best way to increase the resilience of the fisheries sector to fuel prices is to ensure that fishing levels are in line with maximum sustainable yield. This will lead to more abundant fish stocks in the mid-term. More fish mean more fishing opportunities, and that means higher revenues for the sector in general.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the increase of the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> threshold, this is not a new issue. The Commission conducted a study, back in 2008, analysing the effect of moving from the ceiling of EUR 30 000 to EUR 100 000 per beneficiary.</p>
<p class="contents">The study concluded that we could not accept this proposal, mainly for three reasons. First, because such an increase would distort fishing operations towards more fuel-intensive technologies with greater negative impact on the marine environment. Second, because larger and more fuel-intensive vessels would receive more funding than smaller and less fuel-intensive vessels. I do not think that anybody here would like to encourage the bigger vessels to use more fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason is much more important, and some Members of Parliament have already mentioned it. Many Member States are now forced to implement austerity measures. Therefore, there would only be limited political support from Member States for a proposal that could lead to an increase in public expenditure. Even if the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> threshold was increased, many Member States would not have the money to actually exploit this new opportunity to spend taxpayers’ money. If only some Member States paid higher <span class="italic">de minimis</span> aid, this would distort competition and result in an uneven playing field for the fleets of different Member States. This is the most important reason of all.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the reduction of the fuel tax exemption of the fishing industry raised by the Greens, we cannot accept that. This issue cannot be tackled appropriately by EU legislation alone, but needs to be discussed at a global level. Taxing fuel taken up in EU ports alone would lead to massive competitive distortions, to the detriment of EU fleets. It would also harm EU ports, as many vessels would simply buy fuel outside the European Union. That is why we urge the Member States to use our Funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Until the proposal for its new common organisation of markets is tabled, the sector will continue to have almost no room for manoeuvre when setting prices. The rules on imports, many of which originate with illegal fishing, remain unfair competition for EU production: new monitoring obligations require companies to mobilise more of their resources and the general crisis does not exactly encourage increased consumption of quality products. To this must be added the upward trend in fuel prices, which is once again threatening companies that have already managed to survive the crisis of 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Far-reaching reforms of the CFP are envisaged and, in light of that, and in a context of ever decreasing structural aid, many companies could need liquidity to restructure or adapt themselves with a view to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have tabled this oral question and this motion for a resolution before the House, given that this aid does not cost the EU budget anything and that, furthermore, the increase in aid being requested falls far short of the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> aid received by other sectors, such as transport or agriculture. We do not want to see ourselves in a situation like that in 2008, when we debated the package of measures adopted <span class="italic">in extremis</span> by Commissioner Borg.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say something to you, Commissioner: it is true that there are some Member States that will and others that will not be able to give this aid, and that, according to you, this will create disparity. However, greater disparity is created by the fact that some Member States do not cofinance the European Fisheries Fund, and that is something that is generally accepted. What needs to be proposed is aid, and any Member States wishing to defend their sectors will also be able to defend them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On top of the particularly painful situation for them of a reduction in fishing quotas and plans for exit from the fleet, there is now the added problem of soaring oil prices.

<p class="contents">This situation is extremely worrying, and we are anxious to show fishermen that we are fully behind them. To do so, we call on the European Commission to raise the threshold of <span class="italic">de minimis</span> aid that can be granted to them to help them cope with this crisis. This is simply a temporary measure, justified by an urgent situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission already reacted to a similar phenomenon in 2007, and in the face of this new peak, we wish to know what concrete measures – you have already given details of some of them – it intends to take.

<p class="contents">At a time when the future common fisheries policy appears to be taking shape, I believe that our fishermen are not resistant to change; quite the contrary. Many of them told me that they were willing to make an effort, particularly in terms of preserving stocks. This is, in fact, a collective responsibility. In order to make that effort, they must not fall victim to factors outside their work over which they have absolutely no control.</p>
<p class="contents">A swift and effective response by you, Commissioner, on this point would send a signal that would also help strengthen what we know are historically fragile links between the Commission and the profession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their profits have gone down because fuel prices have gone up.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us are suffering because fuel prices have gone up. Let us subsidise each other! This is all nonsense. It is American pork-barrel politics – special pleading for sectoral interests – brought into the European Parliament. But what this debate does reveal is that, while everyone says we should have sustainable fishing policies, in practice, when it comes down to it, some people do not understand the word ‘sustainability’. They do not actually know what it means.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has made it quite clear that they understand that the fishing industry is not economically viable in some respects, but that is not the result of extra fuel prices. It is because of the unsustainable fishing practices of decades. If the market is constrained, if fishermen are not able to directly pass on the costs of fish to their consumers, then that is something that we should investigate. We should ensure that there is a direct link between the price of fish and the cost to consumers, but simply subsidising unsustainable practices is not the way to reduce the over-fishing which has caused the economic problems in the first place. The Commissioner told Parliament’s committee one month ago, when Mr Cadec put this question to her, that she was not mindful to support subsidies to compensate for the extra cost of fuel. She has repeated that today and I, for one, am delighted to hear her words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fishing is a particularly important part of the economy, but it should also be stressed that fishing has a cultural value, which is passed on from generation to generation. Therefore, retaining this value should become an aim of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">From an economic point of view, it is essential for maintaining appropriate economic balance. With regard to the drastic increase in fuel prices in Europe which has contributed to the collapse of the industry, the common fisheries policy should include a mechanism which would protect fishermen against an uncontrolled rise in prices in situations like these. The European Union cannot allow another branch of the European maritime industry to migrate to the Far East, as in the case of shipbuilding and maritime transport. We should note that Iceland – precisely because it has reservations concerning CFP – does not want to join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the above, we should speed up the reform of CFP considerably and act in order to protect the environment and ensure appropriate protection for fishermen. Once again, the question arises whether we should introduce regionalisation for the fisheries industry, and exert more influence on CFP on the part of individual states, albeit in a balanced way. Once again, it should be stressed that as a result of the crisis and economic instability, CFP will no longer function and will leave the fishermen to their fate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is really about political consistency within the European Union, and about a serious structural trend, namely, the rise in the price of oil on account of its scarcity – and every one of us here knows that it is here to stay. We therefore cannot provide a short-term, circumstantial solution by increasing subsidies in line with the fluctuations in oil prices. This is a question of political logic. The European Union must remain firm with regard to the principles and objectives it has set itself; namely, combating global warming as a priority issue and reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">It should therefore avoid sending the opposite signal and conducting a contradictory policy. Ensuring the survival of a doomed energy system will not help fishermen; they, too, will inevitably be doomed as a result of it. Instead, they should be given the opportunity to redeploy their fisheries resources and to refocus their factors of production on energy-saving tools. Subsidies should be channelled into these areas and not into short-term support determined by fluctuating oil prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time, the European Parliament expressed its solidarity with the fishermen and called on the Commission to draw up specific proposals with the intention of relieving the situation in regions which relied mostly on fishing. Statistics clearly show that from 2003, the cost of fishing in the European Union has increased more than threefold, and the sudden jump in fuel costs means that fishermen currently have to invest 40% more of their funds so that fresh fish can reach their customers as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The phenomenon of the sudden increase in fuel costs on world markets in the past few months is, without question, the most significant reason for the sudden deterioration in the situation. The increase in fuel prices translates directly into a fall in fishermen’s profits, as the fishermen’s boats are driven by diesel engines. So we have a vicious circle. The fishermen, in trying to make up for the increase in fuel prices, are increasing the volume of their catches and sailing further to fishing grounds, which, in turn, means that their boats use more fuel. This is why there is an urgent need for the European Commission to take further steps and to lift the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> aid ceiling, as my political group proposes, from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per firm for the three-year period. This is a sensible proposal which, in the current situation, would guarantee help for a sector wrestling with financial difficulties, and ensure social and economic development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The price per barrel has increased by 63% since 2007; it is true that it has decreased today, but I do not think it has fallen enough to be sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament are concerned by the crisis affecting the sector, and we are convinced that the solution involves an EU response including actions that Members and the governments of the various Member States had already been demanding.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call for this situation to be tackled using an effective and impartial mechanism enabling emergency measures at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2007, <span class="italic">de minimis</span> measures were adopted. We are not just asking you for <span class="italic">de minimis</span> measures, Commissioner Damanaki: we ask that you look into opening up the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), and that you allow it to become more flexible, because of the inability – which you have acknowledged – of some Member States to contribute money and solve the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that the Commission is able to explore new avenues, concrete proposals, so as to be able to use the EFF to help the hardest-hit sections of the fleet, which are small-scale and artisanal coastal fishers, and those operating from remote ports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask, Commissioner, that you study the possibility of introducing to the CFP, as you have proposed, new measures limiting fishing’s fuel dependence, which is excessive. I would also ask you to commit to the necessary improvement in product sales. All this must be viewed from the sustainability standpoint you have been talking about, as well as from the environmental and social standpoints, but must also be viewed from the other side, which is also important: that is, the human side, for fishers who are suffering enormously.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this is an emergency measure and we think that short-term flexibility measures could give a breathing space to a sector that has been hit quite hard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, fishermen are dependent on the vagaries of the weather and unfair competition. During recent years, they have also been faced with another huge problem – ever-rising oil prices. All these factors have made it almost impossible to pursue this form of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">de minimis</span> principle is intended to apply until 2013. It is time to review it, if we are really thinking about the prospects ahead for the sector. Fuel prices have trebled, which has naturally raised the question whether EU legislation is adequate and suitable for the economic reality and meets European fishermen’s needs. In this regard, I am waiting for the Commission to review the current applicable ceiling of EUR 30 000 and to increase its amount significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is also another issue at stake. The Commission must also abandon its pure control functions relating to the granting of State aid and actively encourage Member States to use it. Why is this important? Some countries in the European Union prefer not to mention this facility because it means an additional burden on their domestic budgets. On the other hand, when they exert pressure on the fisheries sector, they use Brussels to justify themselves. Just a cursory analysis indicates that Bulgaria’s fishermen do not even know that such a facility and regulation exist. Organisations from the sector have made a number of requests for State aid to be granted in support of the sector, but they are completely unaware of the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> regulation. States are concerned about granting this facility now when the blow from high oil prices needs to be softened, which raises the question not only about high prices, but also about the sector’s survival in general.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there is also the problem with the onerous procedures involved with using European funds, including under the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I want to add my question to those raised by my fellow Members, and I thank Mr Cadec for initiating this debate today: how will the European Commission encourage Member States to use the facilities under the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> regulation?

Its volatility in recent years has hit hard and made it difficult to adjust gradually. We therefore need a response to put a stop to cost increases in the area of fisheries, which are often sudden, and to the deterioration of the sector’s already complicated situation.</p>
<p class="contents">When the regulation introducing <span class="italic">de minimis</span> aid was adopted in 2007, it was thought that it would not affect trade or distort competition. There is a need to evaluate these aspects and to move toward a more ambitious solution, created with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Europe 2020 strategy in mind, and as part of the process of reforming the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a coherent response should increase the sector’s capacity for structural adjustment and, at the same time, help its most vulnerable members, particularly small and medium-sized producers. Relieving the sector’s situation in the short term, with measures like that proposed by the Commissioner of mobilising and encouraging the mobilisation of the European Fisheries Fund, seems positive to me, and I believe it should be compatible with other measures and long-term action toward greater stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thirdly, and this is the issue we are discussing today, the rise in oil prices is making operating conditions in this crisis-hit sector even more difficult.</p>

The current sales dynamic does not permit fluctuations in the cost of factors of production, including fuel, to impact on fish prices, and current import policy, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, contributes to this. Average first-sale prices have stagnated or declined over several years, without this being reflected in reduced prices for end consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The current common organisation of the market (COM) for fisheries products has not contributed sufficiently to improving first-sale prices, nor towards better distribution of added value across the sector’s value chain. The economic situation of a large number of companies has deteriorated in recent years, leading to many of them going out of business, with a real risk that thousands of fishing businesses will go under and that thousands of jobs will be lost because of the rise in fuel prices. The coastal and small-scale fishing sectors are particularly vulnerable, and represent more than 90% of the fleet in some Member States, such as Portugal. Under these circumstances, the Commission’s attitude of inertia and its refusal to take the necessary measures – a stance you have confirmed here today, Commissioner – is absolutely disgraceful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can only think of one solution for the problems facing the fisheries sector: indiscriminately cutting the number of ships, which amounts to curing the illness by killing the patient. It is important to say that when such cuts were made in the past, without taking into account fleets’ particularities, the state of fish stocks in each case and each country’s consumption needs, they did not solve any of the problems with which the sector is now faced. It merely caused EU-level concentration of ownership and activity in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Emergency measures therefore need to be adopted that give an immediate and suitable response to the sector’s socio-economic needs, such as the creation of a guarantee fund, paid for at Union level, that ensures the stability of fuel prices and the use of all financial possibilities and margins of the EU budget to finance extraordinary support measures for the sector. However, taking into account the structural trend of oil price increases and, on the other hand, the demands of environmental sustainability, there is also a need for measures ensuring the medium- and long-term viability of the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Mechanisms are needed to improve first-sale prices, and to promote fair and appropriate distribution of added value across the sector’s value chain. The European Fisheries Fund (EFF) needs to effectively and substantially support the renewal and modernisation of fishing fleets, not least by making the different types of fishing more selective, and by replacing engines for reasons of safety, of environmental protection and of fuel efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as any tax measures that could be adopted at Member State level, EU-level solutions are needed so as not to exacerbate the inequalities that already exist today between Member States and which are increasing because of the serious social and economic crisis, which is hitting the most vulnerable economies particularly hard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In order to prevent this crisis becoming any worse, therefore, we need to take action regarding the fisheries sector’s problems; swift and far-reaching action.

I share your concerns about the poor income of our fishermen, especially of the owners of small vessels in coastal regions. But is this problem caused by the increase in fuel prices? Are you sure about that? We have discussed this problem again and again and we recognised that we had this problem even before prices were raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I can understand that the increase in fuel prices could worsen the problem, but the main reason for the problem has always been overfishing – the fishing over the set limits which cannot leave stocks in a healthy state. We have discussed it and this is the main problem we have to solve through our CFP reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, now we are discussing fuel prices. This is a problem and we must discuss how we can face it. The only way to face this problem on a permanent basis is to improve the resilience of our sector to the increase in fuel prices. This is the only way, because we cannot be sure about the evolution of fuel prices. Let me give you an example of what could happen: in Belgium, they improved the engines in their fleet after the last crisis and now they have reduced spending on fuel in their fleets by 20 percent. So this is the way to go and this is what we are trying to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, referring to your proposals, there is a proposal to the Commission to increase the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> ceiling. Let us look at this problem. What is this ceiling? This is the ceiling of the aid that Member States can give to their sector. If the Commission now increases this ceiling, it means that only the Member States with a healthy budget can give this. So this would result in creating an uneven playing field in our sector, favouring the richest countries. Let me put it clearly so that we understand the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, if we increase the ceiling, only the bigger vessels will gain any advantage from it. I am surprised that some Members of Parliament – who I would not have expected to say this – are asking me to increase this ceiling. The Member States can give their own State aid. The richer Member States can already give it now.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the funds, let me explain. The Member States use only 20% of our funding. Some Members of Parliament say to me that our funding is the problem because they cannot use it in the way they want; but we have flexibility; the Member States can reallocate their funding – every Member State can do this. Only Italy has asked us for a reallocation and we approved it. So why do you not try to persuade the Member States – the governments of your countries – to use the funds properly? If we really want to help, and if there is a problem with absorption of the funding, I am here to facilitate it for everybody, but until now, no such effort has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">To answer the questions in a very direct way: yes, the funding is there; yes, the Member States can use it; and, yes, the Member States can give from their own resources to this <span class="italic">de minimis</span> ceiling. So if I change the situation, the only result it will have is to distort fair competition between the Member States and between the small and bigger vessels. We have to understand this. Of course there is a problem in general and, referring to our reform, we can discuss what we can do to help our small-scale fisheries, in particular. We can also discuss every other proposal, but this proposal to increase the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> ceiling is one that cannot help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to tackle this situation, the Commission needs to adopt emergency measures to help fishers. To this end, the Commission should allow the subsidies that the Member States can award fishers to be increased temporarily, for three years, from EUR 30 000 to 60 000. Further to this, the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) should award grants to fishers, in particular, in order to make fishing techniques more selective and to replace engines, for reasons of safety, of environmental protection and/or of fuel efficiency. These measures should pay particular attention to small-scale and coastal fishing. Finally, it is crucial that there be regulation mechanisms to improve first-sale prices, and to promote the fair and appropriate distribution of added value along the fisheries sector value chain, in a way that acknowledges the prices paid to producers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1950, when Schuman proposed the founding of this Union, it was about coal and steel; today, it is about information technology and knowledge that will be crucial for the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to say that the report we are presenting here today has emerged from extremely good cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, Ms Trautmann, Mr Rohde, Mr Chichester and Mr Lamberts, who have supported the proposal. I am very grateful for this because we are discussing today a proposal that can enable Europe to recover the lead in mobile telephony, mobile Internet and modern information technology.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, the discussion about the various proposals in this report is about the choice of whether Europe is to be number one or number three. For me, the choice is simple. Sometimes, when we talk about the world’s biggest economies, we talk about the US and China, all of us forgetting that the European Union is the biggest economy, although we do not have the biggest markets. It is up to us today to discuss whether we are going to take the steps that can make a change.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to do so, then, in order to secure the lead in area after area with regard to telecoms and the development of broadband, I want Europe to have the best broadband capacity and the highest speeds, because then we will be home to the development of all the new services that will be crucial to the modern economy and to our competitiveness. I want Europe to be home to the next generation of Googles, Yahoos, Apples and all other companies that are manifestations of both competitiveness and innovation. We can be that, but it is also possible that other economies like America, China, or India will take the lead, so we have a choice to make.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, I have proposed that we stick to the date of 2013 with regard to the 800 MHz band. In addition, I have proposed that we be more ambitious and say that the European Union should free up 1 200 MHz in the 1.5 GHz band and the 2.3 GHz band, and that we should also start the discussion about the 700 MHz band – because if we do not start it now, we will not have the opportunity to take decisions in the future – and we should use the 5 GHz band for common licence-free use for all short-distance mobile Internet communications.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we have the proposal. I would like the strongest possible support from Parliament because then, we can discuss this with the Member States and raise with them the issue of whether they all want to be number one or whether they are happy to be number three. I think that choice is simple and I am looking forward to this debate and to the vote on Wednesday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Neelie Kroes, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, this is a clear wake-up call and I think that this is really the language that Europe needs. I must say a word of thanks from my side, in particular, to the rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, for the hard work that he has done on the first radio spectrum policy programme.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about information and technology and it is about making up your mind what position Europe should take: the far East, the far West, in between, there are a couple of important players in this game, but Europe can indeed be the number one.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme is essential for a digital Europe and for the European economy and for our society as a whole. It is quite clear from this report that Parliament shares the Commission’s view on the importance of a coordinated and effective spectrum policy to meet broadband targets.</p>
<p class="contents">And indeed it is vital to maintain and improve Europe’s economic and competitive position and to maximise its social and cultural impact by enabling innovative services for the benefit of citizens. And I would like to add the term ‘cultural’ impact, as this is quite important. If we are talking about the Internet, it is one of the main instruments to give more opportunities to the members of Europe’s community to have the inside knowledge and inside view of cultural impact.</p>
<p class="contents">What was rightly mentioned is that this is a moment of choice. It is not any more a question of nice words, but now is the moment of truth and now we have to take our responsibilities. You cannot get a number one position, which is indeed the leader’s role, if you are not taking the choices that need to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking about the cultural aspects, it is that cultural element that I want to emphasise first because I know that this has been a significant preoccupation of Members of your Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, I see a lot of synergies between the use of spectrum for the distribution of content and culture, especially talking about audiovisual media content and for wireless broadband. Digital television and wireless broadband can develop successfully in parallel and we should not forget that broadband Internet access also offers high cultural and social value. In addition, wireless is essential in areas currently deprived of such access.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal not only protects the existence, but also ensures the future development, of those valuable cultural and economic services which, by the way, produce rich media content and feed future data highways with attractive cultural offerings. Of course, remaining obstacles such as interference on air or on cable TV will have to be solved; there is no doubt about that.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that broadcasting knows no borders. European Union policies will need appropriate support in international negotiations and Member States may also need assistance to negotiate with neighbouring non-EU countries. Just through preparing the whole debate, I am, of course, already in contact with certain ministers in certain Member States that are even more confronted with the neighbouring country aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the content of the report, the Commission can support, sometimes subject to small modifications, almost all of Parliament’s approach. The Commission particularly welcomes and agrees with the position taken in the report on a couple of issues. Firstly, the importance of spectrum for the Digital Agenda to provide all citizens with high broadband access. No doubt about that, we are completely on your side.</p>
<p class="contents">Number two: keeping under review the possibilities for additional spectrum to meet the growing consumer demand for wireless broadband. Completely on your side and, even if your speed is perhaps a little bit higher, be assured that we are aware that that is the next step.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, confirming 2013 as the date to free the 800 MHz digital dividend band, while recognising the need for derogations until 2015. So 2013 is the goal, but with a possibility of derogations until 2015, in exceptional technical circumstances as well as further derogations due to coordination issues with third countries, which I was touching upon earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the coverage of other important Union policies beyond electronic communications: here, I am talking about the environment, transport or research and the need to make a substantial amount of spectrum available.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the importance of an efficient inventory of spectrum use, which is an essential part of building an effective and forward-looking policy programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, the need to coordinate the promotion of EU policies at an international level and to support the Member States in their negotiations with non-EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of other important issues where the report is supportive or reinforces the Commission proposal, and that is encouraging. On certain amendments, however, the Commission has to be a bit more nuanced. On restructuring, the presentation of principles and objectives should not reduce the visibility of the principle of efficient use of spectrum, which should apply to all sectors to the greatest extent possible. Another nuanced issue: while I understand the addition of the need to ensure sufficient spectrum for audiovisual services, that should not single out specific modes of delivery.</p>
<p class="contents">Another nuance between the Commission and the rapporteur’s report concerns competition. Reserving spectrum for new entrants may be an appropriate tool in certain cases, but with a view to avoiding unnecessary procedures; we would then be close to each other. Another issue again involving just a nuance: while the compensation of migration costs by Member States is a very important issue – no doubt about that – it must be in conformity with State aid rules. I think there is no difference between our points of view; it is something that has to be mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has slight difficulties in accepting just two proposals. Number one: for spectrum already technically harmonised, an obligation to authorise its use by 2012 should not be replaced by the softer obligation to make such spectrum available. Existing positions already require this, and we need to move to effective licensing of the spectrum: going forward and not going backward.</p>
<p class="contents">A second issue that is different and that we have difficulty in accepting concerns spectrum for broadband satellite access; the Commission wants to be able to actually ensure its availability. On both of those issues – to authorise and to ensure availability on both of those issues – there must be a solution to be found and I am certain that it could be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a couple of remarks to conclude. Both Parliament and Commission recognise that an early adoption of the proposal is desirable, considering the importance of the work ahead to implement this programme. A clear statement is needed, the sooner the better. The Commission will do its best to support the process and I am absolutely confident that Parliament will engage in an early dialogue with the Council to reach a rapid and a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is running out. Time is not our friend in this and, at the end of the day, if we want to have a solution and if we are backing the number one position called for by Mr Hökmark, then we need to go as quickly as possible in that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the spectrum is a scarce resource and, above all, it is a public good. It was therefore a particular concern of the Committee on Culture and Education that it be made clear that the spectrum is, and remains, essential for the fulfilment of a wide range of societal, cultural and social functions. For this reason, it was particularly important to us that the requirements of the telecoms package for safeguarding media pluralism and cultural diversity were not thrown out by the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">Both public and private broadcasting are essential guarantors of media pluralism and diversity of opinion in Europe. We must ensure that they can continue to fulfil their vital functions unimpeded in future, too. The Committee on Culture and Education had therefore proposed that the 790 band not be opened in the first instance, but unfortunately, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy did not follow our suggestion. Although it is mentioned in several places that the interests of broadcasting are to be taken into consideration, the Committee on Culture and Education would have liked there to have been much clearer wording in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">It was particularly important to us that, before spectrum allocation, clear regulations be laid down to prevent theatres and anyone using wireless microphones, for example, from being saddled with the cost of paying for a frequency change or for new technology.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all called on to continue to ensure a fair balance of interests for all parties concerned. I hope that we will succeed in doing so in future, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, please also allow me to thank, as he did, all the shadow rapporteurs. The result of all this work was the unanimous backing that this report received in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the report before us is guided by an objective, which is none other than a way of making the European economy more competitive in a global world. That is the key objective of this report and I therefore believe that it is extraordinarily appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to go into the details, but I would like to focus on two or three aspects that I consider key. First of all, we are in a situation – and this report points this out – in which wireless broadband through the 800 MHz allocation for mobile communications across Europe will be a reality. However the report goes much further: it is thinking more about the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about the 700 MHz frequency band, which also has an extraordinary capacity for mobile telephony and its development. I believe that is why we also have to view and evaluate the proposals made in the report very positively. It is not a trivial issue: the spectrum relating to economic activities currently represents 3% of European gross domestic product (GDP) and that is just the start.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention the importance of video’s exponential growth as an element of communication between different people, and between different institutions and companies. Right now, video represents 40% of world traffic and that is only the start: by 2014, it will represent 91% of end-user traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, the report positions itself realistically in a vision of an extraordinary future, so I believe that we should give it our full support the day after tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like to commend our rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, as well as my fellow shadow rapporteurs, for our good cooperation on a report which reveals some major political issues hidden behind its highly technical aspects. We have had numerous debates, which have really made me see that Parliament and the Commission do, quite naturally, share the same opinion and ambition.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion is that spectrum is a scarce resource that does not recognise borders. Everyone seems to agree on this point. However, it is on the solutions to be found to improve its management and on the general ambition that some differences can be observed, in particular with the Member States, which I do not deny have historically had a certain sovereign responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Although not all the compromises tabled and adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are as balanced as I personally would have liked, I support very sincerely the general move to develop a spectrum management approach that is more integrated, realistic and responsive to the social, cultural and economic needs of our fellow citizens. This is a common thread in all the positions adopted by our Parliament, Commissioner, be it on the own-initiative report by my colleague, Mrs Toia, or on the proposals that I myself defended as one of the rapporteurs for the telecoms package.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the radio spectrum policy programme, my group and I placed particular emphasis on several points in our amendments. They include, therefore, introducing transparency so as to learn how spectrum is currently allocated and managed – that is, the inventory principle – and also finding innovative and original solutions to the electronic communications sector’s growing demand for use of frequencies. They need to be qualitative, not just quantitative, solutions. By emphasising spectral efficiency, we will remedy this situation without limiting the diversity of services available on the spectrum.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing so, we are also using spectrum as a vehicle for bridging the digital divide and developing new services that are within the reach not only of large telecommunications companies but also of SMEs and start-ups, which will need them. I believe that this economic dimension is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to say a few words about the next stage. As you said yourself, it was clear from the start that a first-reading agreement was out of the question, but it is imperative that we reach an agreement by the end of the year. This is essential for our public services, for meeting consumers’ expectations, and for developing the Internet regardless of the infrastructure in place. It is also essential for planning the economic recovery of our European Union thanks to this resource. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But let us face it: it will not come easily. Nevertheless, I believe that with the Parliament’s first-reading position, we will be able to take a big first step towards this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">And let us be clear: broadband for all is not only about making sure that everyone has a Facebook profile. It is about ensuring Europe’s place in the world as a leading knowledge-based economy. If we manage to connect 500 million people, our citizens and businesses will be able to reap all of the benefits and opportunities of the digital economy. Two things, especially, need to change if Europe is to get there.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we need a well-functioning pro-competition telecommunications market at European level. That is why we have introduced rules on competition-proofing. Member States should not be allowed to allocate newly freed-up spectrum to a specific market player if that would diminish or distort competition in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need a more efficient allocation of spectrum: an allocation that also more actively reflects today’s diverse demands and needs for spectrum. That is why we are gearing this policy programme not only to free up the 800 MHz band, but also to free up additional bands amounting to at least 1 200 MHz by 2015.</p>

<p class="contents">I just want to sound the slight warning note that we must respect subsidiarity and national competences in this area and in this process. Legislating in this field of policy is particularly difficult because the technologies involved change and advance so rapidly and so much, which means that we are always playing catch-up rather than legislating ahead of the game.

We were told – and it is true – that radio spectrum is a scarce resource.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, first of all, to stress that it is a shared asset. It is an asset of which no one can claim exclusive ownership. As far as we are concerned, then, no stakeholder, whoever he or she may be, can claim to have a kind of pre-emptive right, a kind of vested right, over spectrum, and I believe that this is something that is established in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Being both a shared and a rare asset, we need to have a good understanding, firstly, of how spectrum is used today, hence, this idea of a wide-ranging, comprehensive study on how spectrum is currently being used by all stakeholders, including those whom Mr Chichester just singled out, namely, civil protection services, for example, and even military services. It really is important to understand how this scarce resource is actually being used today, because we do not feel it is being used optimally – far from it. Secondly, we need to have a transparent process for allocating this scarce resource, but it must also be dynamic enough to prevent any idea of vested rights emerging again.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like us to pay attention to the principles of allocating and auctioning spectrum, because it is not necessarily used in every case for commercial purposes and, hence, to generate profit. I am, of course, thinking of the cultural dimension, which has been pointed out, but also of spectrum use for public service purposes – we should actually have a discussion about civil protection services – and indeed for military purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take a purely market-based approach, then we are clearly in danger of giving priority – or excessive rights in any case – to market players which we know are able to distort the market on account of their size; in other words, we know that small operators cannot always compete with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to draw attention to the fact that the exponential use of the radio spectrum has public health implications, too. I know that this is not the subject of the report, but I believe that we will have to monitor this issue very closely because our fellow citizens are affected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The radio spectrum policy programme is therefore of particular importance. The spectrum must be utilised efficiently, taking into account economic, social and cultural aspects. To this end, we must fully utilise the technical means available to us in all bands to achieve the greatest possible efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The telecoms package adopted last year must form the basis of our radio spectrum policy because it also stipulates that the spectrum management of the EU and its Member States must take equal account of cultural, social and economic interests. This must be taken into consideration, in particular, in connection with the harmonisation of spectrum use in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to point out that implementation of the first digital dividend in the Member States has so far been progressing at very different rates. Further opening of the UHF band, particularly below 800 MHz, should therefore only be considered after taking into account our experience with white spaces in this band.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many technical and financial questions that are yet to be definitively resolved. In particular, the problem of interference and the question of cost offsetting for cultural facilities and local authorities in connection with technical retrofitting, with regard to radio microphones for example, have not yet been satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">When allocating frequency bands, the various different interests must be weighed against each other in a responsible manner. On the one hand, provision of mobile broadband networks across the board is a basic requirement that is in the interests of European citizens, but, on the other hand, development in the area of public and private broadcasting must be taken into consideration as an important instrument for cultural diversity and the provision of information. We must set the correct course for technical development and for Europe’s position in the area of digital information technology and cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, thanks to Parliament’s determination during the negotiation of the telecommunications package, conducted so magnificently by our fellow Member, Mrs Trautmann, this discussion on spectrum is taking place where it should be: in the political sphere of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that it is a scarce public resource and its cross-border scale make our intervention as EU legislators worthwhile, but we should not couch this process as a confrontation between the various uses that we could assign frequency bands.</p>
<p class="contents">Incessant technological progress means that we are increasingly able to transmit more data using less of the spectrum and with less interference.

<p class="contents">This draft report broadly supports the European Commission’s proposal, in particular, on the need to make available, by 1 January 2013, the 800 MHz band freed up by the changeover to digital television and the complete cessation of analogue television broadcasting.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the digitisation of terrestrial television broadcasting, a large number of frequencies, referred to as digital dividends, are being made available. The qualities that these frequencies possess in terms of coverage and penetration of buildings are universally recognised: they are called golden frequencies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context that the European Commission is proposing a first programme to develop an approach, for the years 2011-2015, to the strategic radio spectrum issues facing the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to highlight two aspects that I feel are important, Mrs Kroes, Mr Hökmark. Firstly, I believe that we should create the inventory proposed in Article 8; it is preferable to rely on a precise, expertly prepared inventory so as to identify new bands before explicitly mentioning harmonised frequency bands. If the aim of finding more frequencies for wireless broadband communications is to be pursued and encouraged, it would seem appropriate to proceed on the basis of this inventory – without anticipating the result – by selecting, without any prior technical expertise, one or more specific frequency bands.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point that I should like to discuss concerns the use of frequency bands that are currently used for military purposes. The Commission certainly has no authority to explore the scope for sharing spectrum with military uses.

Its aim is strategic planning and harmonisation of the use of radio spectrum to ensure the functioning of the internal market. In practical terms, the programme will facilitate spectrum availability, maximise the flexibility and increase the efficiency of its use based on general authorisations, avoid distortion of competition and avoid harmful interference and disturbance, as well as harmonise technical conditions and protect health.</p>
<p class="contents">In keeping with the decision, the Commission, together with Member States, will produce an inventory of existing spectrum use and of possible future spectrum requirements in the Union, in particular, in the range from 300 MHz to 3 GHz.</p>
<p class="contents">We used the amendments tabled to request a bridging of the digital divide so that all EU citizens have access to the broadband communications infrastructure at no less than 30 Mbps by 2020, and that opportunities are secured for both the commercial sector and public services by means of increased broadband capacities. We have also asked to ensure that new consumer devices and technologies are accessible so as to secure consumer endorsement for the transition to digital technology and efficient use of the digital dividend. I welcome the importance attached to ensuring that the required radio spectrum is available for monitoring the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface. This enables space applications to be developed and utilised and transport systems to be improved, especially for the Galileo and GMS systems, as well as for smart safety and management systems for the transport sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that this is a key point to be remembered at all times; in other words, through the programme, we can develop the great potential for economic exploitation of this field by the telecommunications sector, the audiovisual sector and new services, while, at the same time, giving a boost to economic development and to other sectors linked to the telecommunications sector. We can also develop the potential for cultural and social development that this dual purpose permits and requires.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in my opinion this programme should also be seen as an opportunity, so that we respect and uphold certain fundamental principles through the choices we make.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the principle of media pluralism. The review of the system for managing radio frequencies at European level is very important, and I believe that we must clearly prevent the accumulation of frequency rights and the creation of monopolies and oligopolies, which unfortunately exist in some European countries and which are becoming stronger and gaining a foothold in the broadcasting sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the principle of balance between the liberalisation and opening up of the market to new operators, and fairness, so that the commitments entered into with those operators who have provided substantial investment can also be promoted, supported and maintained on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, transparency and the guarantee of well-managed and well-administered frequency allocations. We are talking about auctions not only to focus on an aspect of the market that should be reconciled with all the possible social uses for spectrum, but also to say that discretion should not be used and unfair advantages should not be given with regard to radio frequencies. This point also deserves close attention.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, unfortunately I do not have the time to expand on the social aspects, but they have been discussed at great length by all the members of my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe is eagerly looking for particular things which matter to our citizens and which also bring with them prosperity and well-being to the European community. This topic, this report by Mr Hökmark, fits that brief perfectly. It is specific and it puts us more in the picture about the social and the economic dimensions. Public airways, which are in short supply, will be freed up and that is badly needed if we are to meet the demand for ever more and ever faster wireless Internet connections.</p>
<p class="contents">Good coordination at European level is an obvious requirement in this respect. In 2013, 800 MHz will be freed up, in 2015, 1 200 MHz, and that is badly needed if Europe wants to remain amongst the global frontrunners. These services have a huge financial value: EUR 200 million annually, which is to say, that around 3 to 4% of economic growth depends on there being enough spectrum. And that percentage is only going to keep growing.</p>
<p class="contents">Just look, for example, at the GSM standard which we jointly brought about in the 1990s; that, too, was the right move at the right time. Let me tell you, those advantages of scale are clocking up. Every year, they can make a difference of EUR 80 billion. The Netherlands, my native country, which I and the other Dutch MEPs have a mandate to represent here, is ready for it; we have already freed up space for the fourth generation mobile Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">In a nutshell, both the problems faced by auxiliary services, TV stations, public service broadcasters and the continuing problems concerning interferences that could arise, that is, problems with local microphones, will be a thing of the past. I therefore sincerely hope that, on the basis of this excellent and promising report, we will be able to reach agreement with the Commission as early as the first reading. Good luck with it! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, a vote is taking place in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy at the same time as this debate and we have not yet invented a way of dividing people in two.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hökmark has found a good compromise here. However, with regard to this matter, we must always take into account the performance level that we want to see in the future, on the one hand, for the first generation network and, on the other, for the cable operators and everyone else with an interest in the spectrum, particularly the blue light organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">This performance level must be defined. The most important aspect with regard to this data is the quantity of data. The next most important aspect is the time it takes for it to be transmitted, the strength with which it is transmitted in order also to enable coexistence here, and, finally, the priorities that are established by means of the software. For the future, we need a detailed report in this regard in order to significantly increase the speed of the GSM first generation network. Cable network operators already achieve very high speeds of up to 100 megabits/s, which is very respectable and can be increased further in future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have major problems when it comes to the price level, particularly with regard to data roaming. In some Member States, it is currently possible to buy one gigabyte for less than EUR 1. I have just looked at my mobile phone to see how much it costs me. At home, one gigabyte costs me EUR 1. When I am here, one gigabyte costs me EUR 9 900, and when I travel to another Member State, it can cost EUR 14 900. We urgently need to take action in this regard. I would ask you, Commissioner, to ensure that this decision takes account not only of performance range and performance level, but that, above all, we also establish a common European market with regard to price level that enables people to use data services even when they are not in their own Member State. We have urgent priorities to address in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Broadband technology is undoubtedly an important part of this. Our new radio spectrum policy must ensure large transmission capacities and high transmission speeds. Overarching frequency planning and management at European level is, without doubt, less appropriate for achieving this goal, as the Commission itself also stresses that this can be carried out well and efficiently in the individual Member States. A coordinating role would certainly be desirable, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the high costs, the provision of optical fibre networks should, in my opinion, be encouraged. The European Union is currently lagging behind its competitors, the United States and China. That is probably a consequence of irresolute policy and too much bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore agree with the rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, that we absolutely must stick to the timetable that has been set for freeing up the spectrum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, as Catherine Trautmann has said, a scarce good, it is a public good, and it is also an essential good. The rapporteur and his shadows have succeeded in making the issue quite clear, and simply putting before us what has to be done to achieve a positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this is a democracy: we are debating the issue and it is an attractive debate. Not so long ago, however, we discussed the Digital Agenda; we all agree on the Digital Agenda; and this issue is a major one for the Digital Agenda. For if we do not assume our responsibility and take a clear line, then we can forget what was said earlier by Ms Toia: we need to be aware that in 2020 – and we set this out in the Digital Agenda – every European should be able to pursue his or her interests via what are ultimately spectrum opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also talked about creating digital opportunities for every European by 2013. If that is what we have in mind, then we need to be consistent and we need to be in a position to assume the consequences of being consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all those Members who have spoken in clear language, stating priorities while, at the end of the day, agreeing on exactly what we have to do in a strategic approach to regulation with regard to the management of radio spectrum. There are still hurdles to be overcome, no doubt about that. Given what is at stake, however, I am confident those hurdles will be taken successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully respect the use of spectrum for broadcasting and cultural activities: let there be no misunderstanding on that. We will tackle that point if there is still any hesitation to be overcome. With regard to additional spectrum for broadband and the second digital dividend, I think everybody is aware that sooner or later – and most of the Members of Parliament will probably think sooner – we will have to tackle that point, too. This is a win-win situation, and in freeing the 800 MHz band, we took the option which affected the least amount of spectrum, so we can see that as step one on our journey.</p>
<p class="contents">To look backwards for a moment: who could have imagined 15 years ago what is at stake today? Had we waited 15 years ago, and hesitated in taking decisions as politicians, we would have failed. In that event, what we would be discussing now is not whether we want the number one position or the number three position, but whether we want to avoid the last position.</p>
<p class="contents">Spectrum is a national competence: I am aware of that. The Commission agrees, and the inventory is a matter for the Member States. However, we all agree that spectrum is a very valuable resource and we need to recognise that talking about a digital single market also gives us the opportunity and the responsibility to think along cross-border lines – and, if there is one area in which we ought to think cross-border, it is spectrum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to deadlines and what has been and is at stake, it is clear, to me at least, that 2013 is not too early. We should also be aware that derogations are proposed for two types of situation: in the case of difficulties with neighbouring countries and in the case of circumstances that no one could have foreseen. I believe, however, that we have to take the line that time is not on our side and that derogations should not be misused.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I am looking forward to discussions with the Council members, I am looking forward to the result of your voting and I am looking with confidence to the future, in the hope that one of the pillars we have talked about will be finalised before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by thanking, once again, not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, but also the members of the various committees involved, for their constructive and very positive efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The pace of change has been, and will continue to be, extremely rapid. We are really talking about how we want things to be in the year 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important to make the point that, in discussing the 700 MHz band, we are not saying anything more than that we shall have the opportunity to take decisions later on the best way of using it. As has been said, spectrum is a scarce resource, but it is also a public good, and we have the responsibility to use it as well and as efficiently as possible – a point that Ms Trautmann also made.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise that there is no conflict between cultural and commercial use. I want us to have ambitions of a kind that will enable us to bring culture into this new technology, rather than reserving the technology for commercial use, which will be the outcome if we are not sufficiently ambitious. In that case, culture will be left behind, and I do not think that culture in Europe will have the best opportunities if it is closed into the old technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is possible not only to secure broadcasting as of today but also to create new opportunities for a new time. However, we need to be able to take decisions. I must say – without irony and with a high level of satisfaction – that no one here tonight has questioned the fact that we need to be number one.

I am an accidental rapporteur, who came in at the last minute because the original rapporteur stopped working on this report. Therefore, as chair of the committee, I took over, in line with the Rules of Procedure. As well as being an accidental rapporteur, I am also a reluctant one because, in truth, I did not vote for this report and have deep objections to its content. Nevertheless, things are as they are and it falls to me to gallantly accept the duties I have been given.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, this report on the exceptional trade preferences conceded to Pakistan originated with a European Council decision, which mandated the Commission to make a proposal to Parliament and to the Council. As these are exceptional preferences that are not compatible with the positive or negative non-discrimination rule of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), it is necessary to obtain a WTO waiver before awarding these trade preferences. Despite everything, the Commission tabled the proposal before Parliament and the Committee on International Trade, which I chair, decided to go ahead with the debate and vote on this report, of which I am the accidental rapporteur. It is the result of this vote which we are bringing to the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, has proved rather contentious in Parliament’s Committee on International Trade, as regards whether – and this was the pretext for this Commission proposal – we should use trade preferences as a means of emergency aid to a given country; as regards the duration and extension of those trade preferences; and, finally, as regards what conditions would be imposed on the beneficiary, Pakistan in this instance.</p>
<p class="contents">Although a majority in the committee voted for the Commission proposal to award Pakistan these exceptional preferences, in fact, the Committee on International Trade also voted for several amendments aimed at limiting the impact of these trade advantages awarded to Pakistan, including, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the adoption of a safeguard clause, in case imports from Pakistan increase too much because of the reduction or removal of trade tariffs. Other amendments relate to, for example, requirements that Pakistan not create or abolish the restrictions it has on exporting commodities.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is important to take into account that our efforts here could turn out to be completely in vain if the WTO waiver is not obtained; we do not presently know when, or if, it will end up being granted. In any case, even if our efforts turn out to be in vain, it will, at least, be an excellent opportunity to debate how sensible it is to use exceptional trade advantages as a means of emergency aid – or, as in this case, as a means of political repayment for a given country – and what limits such usage has.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore run the risk of setting dangerous precedents or, worse still, of making political use of trade preferences that should perhaps follow criteria that are rather more objective, and rather less discretionary and contextual than in this case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Neelie Kroes, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, today we are discussing a legislative proposal for emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan. This proposal was tabled by the Commission at the express request of the European Council in the immediate aftermath of the floods that hit Pakistan in the summer of last year and brought widespread devastation to the country and to its people.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on International Trade for their hard work and their support for the proposal. The Commission proposal aims at the introduction of a unilateral and temporary suspension of import duties on 75 export items from Pakistan. These trade preferences would liberalise about a quarter of Pakistani imports to the EU and be available for two years, with a possible extension for another year.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is aware that such trade concessions, especially in sensitive sectors such as textiles, might have an impact on EU industry, and therefore we have ensured that a balance is kept between the needs of Pakistan and the interests of our own industry and other supplier countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of products selected is limited. We have set a ceiling on the liberalisation of very sensitive items, and liberalisation would only be of limited duration. In the meantime, we have also requested the World Trade Organisation to grant us a waiver of the applicable WTO rules to enable us to implement the proposed measures. As you know, we are still discussing this issue with other WTO members and hope to come to a solution soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The images of people having lost their livelihoods might not be present any more in everyone’s mind, but we should not forget the immense cost of those devastating floods, both in terms of humanitarian needs and economic devastation. These trade measures are not ‘stand-alone’, and come on top of the significant humanitarian and development assistance – amounting to EUR 480 million – that the EU has granted to Pakistan. However, ambitious trade measures are essential for the sustained economic recovery of Pakistan’s economy and should be part of our medium-term response to those unprecedented natural disasters. I therefore hope that Parliament will support the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to some of the amendments that have been proposed. I will not go into detail on all of them, but let me highlight the most important ones. I know that there are requests for making the granting of autonomous trade preferences conditional upon Pakistan respecting certain fundamental principles. I understand the concerns that may exist in that respect, and you are aware that human rights issues are an integral element of our long-term relationship with Pakistan. However, given the temporary nature of the waiver to address an emergency situation, the Commission believes those conditionalities would not be appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Our human rights dialogue, in the context of our Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Pakistan, is the appropriate forum to address such issues with Pakistan and reach sustainable solutions. As regards provisions that would oblige Pakistan to abstain from maintaining, introducing or increasing duties or charges having equivalent effect, or any other restriction on the export or import of certain products, I believe that such conditions would seriously undermine the granting of the preferences and are contrary to the spirit, the nature and the purpose of our regulation. Moreover, we cannot prohibit Pakistan, through this regulation, from implementing measures that are consistent with its international obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we could agree to the introduction of a mechanism allowing the imposition of limits to duty-free imports for Pakistan tariff rate quotas where volumes of imports of products liberalised increase beyond certain levels. I also agree that preferences should be removed for any product causing or threatening to cause serious difficulties to a Union producer of like or directly competing products, as determined by an investigation carried out by the Commission. We could also agree with mechanisms to establish customs surveillance on imports covered by the regulation, linked with quarterly reporting. However, a prior surveillance mechanism would create an undue burden in terms of administrations’ licensing requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I note, finally, that there are requests to limit the duration of the trade preferences to one year from the date on which the waiver takes effect. I think that would be very problematic.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission initially proposed applying exceptional measures for a period of three years. In its compromise proposal, which was reflected in the WTO waiver request, the Council limited the duration to two years, with the possibility of extending it by one more year. However, to limit the duration even further to one year would erode the advantages of the autonomous trade preferences measure, and they would become meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also point out that a compromise reached in the Council on 10 November was based on subjecting seven textile and clothing products to tariff rate quotas rather than full liberalisation. This compromise became the basis for the subsequent request for a WTO waiver. However, this is not reflected in the European Parliament amendments, and as a result of the consultation with WTO members, it might be necessary to subject a few more products to tariff rate quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">The waiver, if granted, would constitute a maximum of preferences the EU could grant to Pakistan on those terms and, as a consequence, the regulation will have to reflect the content of the WTO waiver once it is agreed in the WTO. Let me also reassure you that the Commission will conduct an annual impact assessment on the autonomous trade preferences granted to Pakistan and present it to Parliament and the Council, and that is another reason not to reduce the duration of application of this instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the European Parliament for its cooperation on this sensitive issue. The Commission stands ready to work closely with Parliament in order to have this proposal adopted and show the EU’s determination to act responsibly towards countries in need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why? The reason is because we are currently awaiting a decision on the waiver requested by the European Union from the World Trade Organisation on the topic actually being discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal view is that it is important, in this context, for us to convey a clear message to the European Union’s other trade partners. The Union must continue to be determined to supplement the emergency humanitarian aid which it generously granted to Pakistan during an initial phase with trade measures aimed at bringing about the Pakistani economy’s sustainable recovery. Diplomatic consultations with the World Trade Organisation definitely require time because the concerns of the Union’s trade partners must be taken into account. The outcome of these consultations is currently uncertain. However, as the recent events remind us, it is clear that we need a stable, prosperous Pakistan, which will not go down the slippery slope of extremism and will be able to act as a partner in the anti-terror effort.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I would like to thank my fellow Members in the Committee on International Trade for adopting the main points which we developed in our opinion. I want to highlight two of these points here. The first one, which is perhaps the most important for the Committee on Foreign Affairs and was also mentioned by the Commissioner, is the requirement not to decouple human rights conditionality, including respect for the basic standards of the right to work, from granting trade preferences. I believe that we have a difference of opinion on this point. As human rights are a key aspect of the agreement binding the EU and Pakistan, the autonomous trade preferences proposed must be dependent upon respect for human rights in this country. On the other hand, a prior full assessment of the impact of the measures proposed has not been conducted by the Commission. I think that it would have had a major impact, in particular, on Pakistan’s population and this country’s budget resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was therefore right and proper for the European Union to take action and to very quickly put together a multi-million euro aid package, and it is important that this aid actually reaches the local community.</p>
<p class="contents">Right from the start, I was not particularly happy about the Commission’s proposal, under pressure from the Council, to use foreign trade instruments of all things in order to provide short-term aid for Pakistan. I brought this up several times in committee and asked in particular for the person responsible for foreign policy in the European Union, namely our High Representative, to also come to the committee or to Parliament in order to explain why foreign trade should have to be used to pay for this, to present to us in detail the overall strategy of the European Commission and put this in a common context and, in so doing, perhaps convince us that it really does make sense – I will say this again – to allow foreign trade to make a short-term contribution in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful that Mr David and others have succeeded in putting together a package that received the support of a broad majority in committee. In this regard, I would particularly like to emphasise the time limitation that we would like to see. This is the only solution that enables us to avoid the misdirection of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what is the situation in Pakistan at the moment? Although Bin Laden is out of the equation, the question that has arisen in recent days as to the extent to which representatives of the Pakistani Government were aware of who was hiding in their country remains. Many fellow Members, including some in my group, are not happy about this. Moreover, we do not yet know how the other countries within the WTO will act and whether they will ultimately give their consent. It would therefore be good, when we vote on the amendments tomorrow, if we do not carry out a final vote, but rather refer the matter back to committee so that we can see what comes out of the WTO talks and whether it does actually make sense for us ultimately to give our consent to this package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both decisions are wrong; however, because of the time constraints, among other reasons, I intend to focus solely on the issue of merit, but only after voicing my full support for Mr Moreira’s speech.</p>
<p class="contents">In this complicated world in which natural and man-made disasters are occurring all the time and in large numbers, we would be setting a dangerous precedent if we were to turn every humanitarian emergency into a review of trade policy. That is a slippery slope that could result in serious imbalances and, hence, unfair treatment of the poorest countries. Yet it is only through balanced, permanent and objective rules that those countries can reap the benefits of trade policy, which must not replace development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that any aid earmarked for Pakistan would not be used to help the people hit by the floods almost a year ago. We know with just as much certainty that it will be the European textile sector that mainly, if not exclusively, pays the price for this humanitarian aid. We cannot accept this unfair departure from trade policy rules because we are aware of the need to consider other factors, too, in our discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that, as well as showing solidarity with Pakistan’s flood-hit populations, another fundamental reason for granting aid lies in the decision to support Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts. The grey areas that have emerged in recent days between the Pakistani authorities and al-Qaeda, and the Bin Laden affair itself, show how unreliable that country is. I believe that we must focus attention on this, just as we must focus attention on the major human rights issues that have emerged lately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not support the socialist position, which was expressed by Mr Susta just now. It is partly due to this hesitation that we are still racking our brains trying to work out which instruments we can adopt in order to actively help Pakistan, and on top of our frustration at not having achieved that yet, we are also conscious that we need a trade policy approach that is more mature in political and humanitarian terms: trade policy must become one of the instruments for helping populations in difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">I admit that the Commission has acted swiftly and effectively by proposing a package of measures, which obviously needed to be discussed and rebalanced so that they did not penalise a European sector that has already been tested by the crisis. It is thanks to the work done by the Committee on International Trade, including that contained in certain amendments – among which the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports Amendment 37 – that businesses, too, can request application of the safeguard clause. However, it seems that these are bad times for Pakistan and that too many people are failing to face up to their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We are asking India to change its attitude and to soften its ‘no’ stance at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as a tangible sign of good-neighbourly relations. True, relations are difficult between those two countries, since there was also the Mumbai attack and Pakistan’s poor cooperation in identifying and capturing the perpetrators of the attack. Yet that affair could be something that breaks the bad habits of a bad relationship between neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also asking the Pakistani authorities for something, namely, to be more determined to consider this issue from a bilateral point of view in their relations with India. Bilateral meetings have recently taken place, though little has come of them, perhaps due to a pride issue on the Pakistanis’ part. It is clear that cricket diplomacy, emphasised by Pakistan’s Members of Parliament, whom we met just two weeks ago, has so far failed to produce meaningful results.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is the WTO, above all, that we are asking – as we did in Geneva during the recent Interparliamentary Assembly – quickly to adopt mechanisms that will enable international trade rules to respond swiftly and flexibly to emergencies in a country hit by unforeseen disasters. This tariff reduction affair may end up achieving nothing, or it could open a new era in trade relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, I am proud to say, reacted fast. Commissioner Georgieva was on the scene, and, when I met with Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani, I was certainly able to discuss the EU’s response with him.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing was absolutely clear. We needed to think outside the box. We needed to come up with a new solution to provide help. Not only aid but trade was the answer, as a short-term measure to assist.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the committee has approved the report, after much deliberation, and I know, through colleagues from right across the committee, the painstaking work that was done to try and come forward with something that was acceptable. But I am afraid some of the amendments to which the Commission has already made reference take away from the spirit of our initial intentions and the initial way in which we reacted.</p>
<p class="contents">At WTO level, objections have been registered to our EU proposal. On the one hand, India says that this should not be a part of the EU-India FTA. I agree. There should not be a link. That is the right approach. But at the same time, it is asking for relaxation in trade directly from Pakistan. There is a contradiction in its approach. I ask them to reconsider.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this House should reaffirm the Commission position. We have the guarantee of annual impact assessments.</p>
<p class="contents">I hear what colleagues say about their security concerns, but I stand here as somebody who narrowly survived the Mumbai attacks and I say to those colleagues: this is not the time to turn your back on Pakistan. The credibility of the EU is at stake. Give the Commission proposal your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I did so at the time and I do now. However, when I look at how the political will has been lacking, how the corporate interests have interfered and how the WTO has procrastinated, what I see before us are recommendations that dilute the original proposals put forward at such short notice by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention has already been made of the short timescale for the trade preference relaxation, reduced from three years to one year: Pakistan is prevented from maintaining or increasing duties or charges within that time. Moreover, it is proposed to seek not only an annual report on a one-year programme but also quarterly reports on the application and implementation of the measures. This adds up to a huge bureaucracy being created, only to come to an end within one year.</p>
<p class="contents">So I have a great deal of sympathy with the proposal, which is Amendment 43, to send this back to the committee so that we can come up with something which will actually deliver the help we want to give to Pakistan. Finally, I think this really does point to the acute need to look at how the WTO works and to transform it into a properly democratic body whose proceedings are transparent and whose members are accountable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all have very close ties with the people of this stricken country.</p>
<p class="contents">What is scandalous, however, is the fact that the negotiations in the WTO are still dragging on, and that alone makes it clear that this form of trade facilitation is not suitable to be used as an emergency aid measure. My group has repeatedly called on the Commission to put forward a plan B in order to be able to help the people of Pakistan quickly and permanently to rebuild their country. No alternative solution has been presented, however. Perhaps the Commission simply lacks ideas or is unable to act because it feels obstructed by resistance in the European Council, which it is only too familiar with. Otherwise, it would seem as if the difficult negotiations in the WTO are being used as an excuse for the lack of action.</p>
<p class="contents">You knew as well as we did that these negotiations would be difficult before they even started and you probably also already knew this when some of the foreign ministers from Germany and other Member States sent you on this mission. After all, the facilitation of trade in the area of textiles, leather and ethanol that you now want to offer to Pakistan would undermine the GSP+ (Generalised System of Preferences+) status that countries like Bangladesh have attained, and indeed, in contrast to Pakistan, they have attained it through ratification of important UN and ILO conventions for the rights of workers and environmental protection. It is precisely this status advantage that enables Bangladesh to import primary products from Pakistan, to process them and then export them to Europe. It is no wonder that this country is now putting up resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we cannot in all honesty expect approval for our desire to help Pakistan at the expense of one of the poorest countries in the world. By doing so, we will ultimately damage ourselves, too, and indeed we will be doing this on the eve of the presentation of the new Commission draft on the revision of our system of trade preferences.</p>
<p class="contents">My solution to this problem is therefore as follows: place the focus on direct aid for the reconstruction following the floods and take immediate action instead of losing in the negotiations in Geneva. After all, with every day that we fail to provide aid, we as Europeans are losing the trust of Pakistan in particular and we will ultimately pay a high political price for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware of the tragic floods that struck Pakistan last year and I think it is right to help that country. I understand that the European Union has already made around EUR 500 million available, which I do not consider to be a trifling sum.</p>
<p class="contents">These new concessions are absurd, since they are concentrated in a sector – textiles – which is a dominant sector in Pakistan but which in Europe, on the other hand, has been destroyed precisely as a result of unfair competition from Asian countries. Do we want to deliver the final blow to the European textiles sector? That is certainly not what the <span class="italic">Lega Nord</span> want, nor do we intend to accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of whether to grant these waivers, should Parliament approve them, will subsequently have to be examined by the World Trade Organisation. It appears that some states – including the aforementioned India, Pakistan’s long-time enemy – are willing to give their consent, not free of charge, of course, but in exchange for similar favourable conditions being granted by the European Union, which is inclined to welcome such requests.</p>

In addition to the commitment of EUR 415 million in emergency aid, the EU now wants to lift duties on a number of products. Pakistan will now soon attain the long-wished for status of a developing country with special tariff preferences.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the EU should not be under any illusions that granting trade preferences could put an end to the advance of fundamental Islamists and terrorists in the nuclear state of Pakistan. The United States has failed to do this despite billions being provided in military aid. The West has therefore paid dearly for the loyalty of a small and, moreover, diminishing part of the political leadership in Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The elimination of Bin Laden by the United States has also raised a number of difficult questions. Even if Pakistan was aware of the whereabouts of the al-Qaeda leader, who was the subject of an international arrest warrant, and therefore would have been called on to extradite him, it does not change the fact that the targeted killing was a violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty. The West must not throw its own principles, such as the rule of law, overboard. Terrorists, dictators and mass murderers must be brought before a court and not eliminated by means of targeted killings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am representing him here today because it is absolutely impossible for him to be present in the Chamber. I also want to say that we have always considered support for flood victims in Pakistan an ethical and moral imperative. For this reason, we have strongly supported all the traditional humanitarian aid measures that have been taken. We really believe work towards helping stabilise the situation of so many millions of affected people must continue.</p>
<p class="contents">What we cannot accept is that European Union trade policy should now be considered a suitable and appropriate instrument for humanitarian aid. The truth is that this will have two harmful consequences: one within the European Union, especially for the southern countries, and for their textile and clothing industries, which are now seriously weakened because of an economic, social and financial crisis unparalleled since they joined the Union; and, secondly, at international level, during World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations, where this opening of the largest trade bloc in the world – the European Union – to these potential exports from Pakistan could completely unbalance the negotiations. It is not by chance that they are at the impasse they have reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with a situation like this, therefore, it is only natural that we have to say, regarding the history of the eight months of difficult negotiations – in which we have taken part and offered the most constructive proposals – on this regulation, that the only position we will now be able to take is, unfortunately, in support of the amendment that, ultimately, envisages the end of this proposal for a regulation as we know it.

An exercise in hypocrisy which consists of bringing into the sphere of humanitarian aid things whose place is strictly in the sphere of the commercial interests of a few; of business, pure and simple. An exercise in hypocrisy which is using the natural disaster that has befallen Pakistan to bring the longstanding plans of a few big companies in the European Union’s powers to life.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the justification is humanitarian aid to Pakistan. Yesterday, it was helping in the fight against terrorism. Yesterday, like today, there is only one true intention: to obtain trade concessions that benefit, above all, the big European importers. That is how it is, however much the Committee on International Trade might want to sugar the pill with toothless safeguards which essentially do not change anything.</p>
<p class="contents">These trade concessions, as the report itself acknowledges, will harm the European Union’s textile industry, and the countries and regions most dependent on it. This impact is severe in a sector that is already very weakened – hit hard as it was by the liberalisation of world trade – and which is concentrated in regions with high levels of unemployment, poverty and marginalisation, and with low economic diversification. However, it becomes even more serious when these regions are situated in Member States, like Portugal, faced with an extremely serious economic and social crisis, which could shortly be exacerbated by the illegitimate intervention that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Union are preparing.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember that the Portuguese Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution against these trade concessions. There is a need for measures defending the European textiles sector and related jobs. We have seen nothing like that from the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cannot allow the EU to further damage high quality sectors such as textiles in Italy and elsewhere. We should protect them by any means possible from unfair competition from countries such as China, Turkey, India, Vietnam and Pakistan, where workers are exploited at very low cost and where there are no minimum guarantees in terms of respect for social rights. It is to those countries that many large European companies have relocated their production, at the expense of jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, why it was not even possible to wait for the World Trade Organisation’s verdict on this regulation is beyond me.

I understand the Commission’s reasoning in terms of providing aid in the form of unilateral trade concessions in favour of Pakistan. However, I do not agree with the Commission’s proposals calling for two industrial sectors in the Union, namely the textile and bioethanol industries, to shoulder most of the burden.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that the European textile industry has been under immense pressure over recent years as a result of the liberalisation of trade within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I served four terms as a member of parliament for a region, one area of which, namely Naoussa, has one of the highest unemployment rates in the whole of Europe, as a result of the impact of globalisation of the textile industry. As far as bioethanol is concerned, I would stress that important investments have been made in the EU in this new industry. We must not overlook the fact that these are two industries in which Pakistan would appear to be particularly competitive. Furthermore, the said concessions have no conditionality clause attached, as would apply if Pakistan were granted GSP+ status. Finally, I should like to ask if the said concessions will benefit the flood-stricken inhabitants of Pakistan. I doubt it. In order to moderate the virtuous intentions here, my counter-proposal is that concessions should be made on other industrial products. Why specifically on textiles? We would be equally useful to the flood victims in Pakistan. In any event, the duration and range of concessions should be limited and provision should be made for safeguards, as proposed in the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is that there is absolutely no proof that trade facilitation will benefit the people affected by the floods. On the contrary, we can even see that the textile industry in Pakistan is based in other regions and, in recent years, has even experienced growth. Thus, this sector is not really affected at all. How we intend to help the people affected by the floods by means of trade facilitation is beyond me.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I cannot understand how we can now grant these facilitations to a country that plainly does not meet the GSP+ conditions in terms of social and environmental standards and send a signal to other countries, like Bangladesh, which do meet these conditions, that essentially tells them that their efforts are not wanted and it is also possible to achieve this status by other means.</p>
<p class="contents">My third argument, Commissioner, is that this is not an approach based on solidarity, because the burden in Europe is borne in a one-sided manner by certain sectors and certain countries only. If we want to do something, then we should do so in a spirit of solidarity with all countries and with the involvement of everyone, and that means we need direct aid for the flood victims. That would be the right approach to take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The future of Pakistan is a key issue for the world and for Europe. This is an important country in the context of the fight against terrorism, and it is also a country which is a significant source of immigration to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, until now, the European Union has had no concept for a policy on Pakistan. The proposal for EU trade preferences has no specific aim. The Commission was not able to justify implementation of the proposal, and neither could the Committee on International Trade during its meeting. The proposal does not help those affected by the flood, nor does it have any significant influence on the country’s development. The European Union has two significant and very important interests in its relations with Pakistan: firstly, the fight against terrorism; secondly, the economic development of the country, which should be based on the rule of law, as it is elsewhere. So instead of making proposals which do not achieve anything, we need to prepare a serious, wide-ranging offer of economic aid and cooperation, on a conditional basis.</p>
<p class="contents">If Pakistan wants to increase its cooperation with the European Union, it should show that it is cooperating in the fight against terrorism in a very real way and that it is developing its rule of law. Then, a wide-ranging aid programme would make sense; wide-ranging and not limited to one or two branches of the economy. The proposal which has been presented – and I am repeating this once again – does not solve anything, so I believe it should be rejected. I call on Mrs Ashton to present a well-thought through, conditional concept for cooperation with Pakistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret that, eight months later, we are still debating it and not implementing it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us ask why we needed this package. There is a difference between aid and what is contained in this trade package. Aid, of course, is very important to Pakistan, but the idea of this trade package was to provide an incentive to entrepreneurs to start rebuilding factories and reinvesting in the textile and other industries that were literally swept away by the flooding. It is not true to say that the textile industry was not impacted by the flooding. It is true that the centre of much of the textile industry is elsewhere than the flooded area but a lot of the support packages for the textile industry were in flooded areas, as was a lot of the textile industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This would have given an incentive to rebuild the textile industry by demonstrating there was a market for their products. Unfortunately, our response has been very curmudgeonly. I can certainly support the idea of having a safeguard clause, but it would be better to do nothing at all than to do this for only one year. One year will not give the space for the investment that is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret that India has been less than supportive in the WTO but I hope, as Mr Rinaldi mentioned, that the so-called cricket diplomacy is going to lead to a solution and that India will recognise that, both on humanitarian grounds and in the interests of security, it is important to help Pakistan create jobs and investment in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although urgent humanitarian aid in the form of funding is essential in response to disasters such as those in Pakistan, more needs to be done. The most effective way we can promote development is to enable people to help themselves. I therefore welcome the abolition of customs barriers – no matter how temporary – and I am confident that this transitional period will allow us to evaluate the process proposed by the Commission. If this process and approach works, I would perhaps then revise the definition of the European Union’s development assistance. If anything, it is not Pakistan, but China that poses the biggest threat to Europe’s textile market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that granting trade preferences may not help directly the people who have suffered as a result of flooding. However, by implementing measures to supplement humanitarian aid, we can contribute to Pakistan’s economic recovery. Indeed, international trade and humanitarian aid are not two diametrically opposed activities. In practical terms, there is a degree of complementarity between all European Union policies. In fact, when we offer developing countries trade preferences, we do not take this action purely for pragmatic, commercial reasons, but to show our solidarity with these states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, first of all, I would like to apologise for not being present at the beginning of the debate, but I was only just arriving from Brussels by plane and you were – how shall I put it? – in advance of the schedule, which is very laudable, but which resulted in my being a little bit late.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken notice of all the speeches that have been made on this report. I would simply like to stress a couple of points. First, we are not discussing an FTA. It seems to me that a lot of speeches start from the assumption that this is a kind of FTA with all the elements that go with it. For example, the problem of social conditionality, of sustainability as we call it, should not be considered here because this is very clearly a measure that is limited in time.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are not discussing the GSP either. We will do that in the near future and then there will be the discussion as to which countries can be included and which not.</p>
<p class="contents">No, this is a proposal that the European Commission has made with respect to the massive flooding in Pakistan, time-bound for two years, with the possibility of its being continued for another year.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say that the amendment to limit it to one year, honestly speaking, to my mind does not make much sense: it would be better for you simply to vote against it.</p>
<p class="contents">Why have we not yet come to a conclusion, and why is this argument being used now, when about a year has already elapsed since the flooding took place? It is simply because we have just introduced this request for a waiver with the WTO, but within the WTO we face serious problems with the neighbours of Pakistan. I do not think I have to name them. We tried to find a solution. I think we were moving in the right direction and we will have to see in the coming weeks what the impact may possibly be of what has recently been happening in Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">But there we are in the hands of the WTO as to whether or not we get a waiver, and this waiver can only be obtained by unanimity, so we cannot force this within the WTO. We can only try to do our best to get it through.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that I am not talking, as one of the previous speakers has done, about crocodile tears and hypocrisy and so on. That is not up to me to say, but let us say in a very neutral way that what has been said tonight is not necessarily consistent with what has been said in the past. It is not because time has elapsed and that we have not yet got a waiver that the argument as such has changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning, there has been a discussion as to whether or not this was directly in favour of the people struck by the flooding. It is partially, yes. Since the beginning, it has been said that there should also be humanitarian aid. There has been humanitarian aid up to EUR 480 million so the arguments have not changed and I really do not see the merit in us now, all of a sudden, switching to another direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken notice of the problems that can arise with the European textile industry, and with the ethanol industry. There is a safeguard clause proposed that is, I think, sufficient to counter possible problems that might arise, so this is fairly clear and you are either in favour of it or against it. The Commission is in favour of it and I think that, both from the point of view of the economic development of Pakistan and from the point of view of the security issues that are certainly linked with Pakistan, it would be a major mistake on the part of the European Parliament not to take up this responsibility and vote this down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the accidental rapporteur of this report and, once more, against my will<span class="italic">,</span> please allow me just two observations. The first is that this debate has demonstrated as much division on this issue as in the Committee on International Trade itself or even more, and the second is that the merits of the proposals adopted by the Committee on International Trade, some of which the European Commission considers inconclusive ... the plenary sitting tomorrow will decide on the merits of these proposals and the Commission’s objections.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me just two final observations. There are two things of which Parliament and the Committee on International Trade cannot be accused. Firstly, of having tried to block this issue, despite it being dependent on a World Trade Organisation (WTO) waiver and, in truth, of voting on an issue that can be rendered toothless by a lack of that waiver. In fact, the Committee on International Trade decided to go ahead despite this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we took into account all the Commission’s last-minute amendments, because the Commission – which is the only body and institution that can initiate legislation – submitted its proposal, but the terms of the waiver request submitted to the WTO are not the same as the proposal that the Commission tabled before Parliament. Moreover, then came the Council’s compromise, which was also different from the Commission’s initial proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on International Trade did not question any of these things as an obstacle to taking the debate into their own hands and voting on this issue, and took on board all these late changes from both the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the case of autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan, it is important to introduce a safeguard clause in case of interruptions to trade resulting from the abolition of tariffs. We should also take into account our trading interests and care for them in the long term by establishing their optimal period of validity and the conditions which must be fulfilled by Pakistan. The flood which affected Pakistan so catastrophically in the summer of 2010 had a disastrous effect on the country’s economy. The EU wants to help Pakistan by contributing to the economic redevelopment of the country. In view of the fact that Pakistan is unusually important to the security of the EU due to its geo-strategic position, we should do everything we can to stabilise the situation there. In this way, we will prevent the radicalisation of opinion in Pakistan. A more stable economy always brings with it a more democratic society and a retreat from anti-democratic, radical social movements. Our decision will send an unambiguous signal to Pakistan that we want to help and that we would like Pakistan to become a stable and rich country, which will prevent opinion becoming radicalised there. I believe that this Pakistan, as our ally, would also help to solve the deadlocked situation in Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I feel that the proposal made by the Commission is inappropriate for several reasons. Firstly, it is not a particularly quick solution: almost a year after the disaster, we have no positive sign of the waiver that the Union must obtain from the WTO before its proposal can enter into force, we have not finished our work as legislators, and we have still to hold negotiations in the Council. Secondly, no impact assessment has been carried out, and we do not know what effect these measures will have either on the Pakistani economy or on the European economy (in particular, the textile and ethanol sectors, which are specifically targeted by the proposal). Nor do we know how Pakistan will redistribute the income from exports covered by these measures so that they genuinely benefit the regions affected by the floods. Lastly, it should be noted that the proposed measures place no human rights obligations on Pakistan. This goes against all the positions recently adopted and must remain the exception. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title20"></a><a name="creitem20"></a>

The issue is simple. This is an initiative of the Committee on International Trade, of which I am chair, and it is as chair that I am asking this question, in relation to which the political groups have reached agreement by consensus. I am pleased to be asking this question, which has had the approval of the political group coordinators on my committee and which seeks a response from the European Commission on a range of concerns regarding the state of play of the EU-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations, which have been ongoing since 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to stress the importance of this initiative. In fact, one of the great innovations of the Treaty of Lisbon was giving the European Parliament the right not just to give final approval to agreements on, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, international trade after their negotiation, but also to be informed about every stage of negotiations, from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that Parliament has the power and the duty to monitor negotiations – in this case, trade negotiations – and to intervene politically using the parliamentary means at its disposal, such as hearings, resolutions and oral questions, in order to stay informed on the progress of these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that the Committee on International Trade believes in listening to the Commission, which, we should say, has been providing us with a great deal of information on this subject. However, I think it needs to answer a number of questions publicly. The oral question consists of seven questions, specifically on the progress made on a range of sensitive subjects, such as public procurement; negotiations concerning intellectual property rights issues in relation to generic medicines; the application for a mandate on overseas investment negotiations that the Commission submitted to the European Council; issues being negotiated relating to culture and cultural services; whether there has been a specific assessment of the effects of a possible FTA with India on the main European industries; whether there is a quantitative assessment of the foreseeable benefits and losses from this FTA for the European Union; and, finally, whether the Commission assures us that it will give Parliament’s views on this issue the proper consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions are in writing; they are in the document we tabled and I think that they are clear enough for us to make progress on the issue of public information on these important trade negotiations between the European Union and one of our great trade partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It goes without saying that to conclude an agreement with India at this juncture is not only of great economic value but also of major strategic importance. India is just at the beginning of a development path which will make it one of the key economic players of this century. An ambitious and balanced agreement with India would take our relationship to a different level by providing a stable, predictable framework governing our future economic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore working very hard to bring this negotiation to a conclusion and there is a real opportunity to do so. India is clearly interested at the highest political level. The India-EU Summit in December came out with a strong commitment expressed by both sides to conclude the negotiations as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made progress across a range of issues. We are making headway on the tariff offers and are preparing the exchange of offers on services. We are now intensively negotiating on procurement, and this is the first time that India has negotiated a substantive procurement chapter including specific rules and market access commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I do not want to hide the fact that there are also still some thorny issues on the table which require difficult negotiation. As with any negotiation, the last yards are the most difficult. Firstly, there are the tariff negotiations where we have made some good progress quickly over the last few months and I am confident that India will significantly improve its offer, but a few sectors remain very difficult; notably, cars, and wine and spirits.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also having very intense discussions on services and the contours of a possible package are getting clearer, but some of our key interests concern sectors where legislative reform is still ongoing or being contemplated in India. This mainly concerns insurance, postal, financial, retail, legal and accountancy services. This makes negotiations very challenging. There is also sustainable development, which is, of course, very important for us but very sensitive in India. We are fully aware of the views of the European Parliament in this respect and will take those into account.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must remain realistic. We need to see what will ultimately be possible with a partner like India. We need to find a solution which satisfies our expectations but also takes into account the specific situation of India. So yes, there will be a chapter on sustainable development that will be part and parcel of the agreements, that will recognise the importance of relevant international standards and be based on cooperation, but we also need to be clear that a sustainable development chapter which would allow the use of trade restrictions linked to social or environmental issues will not be acceptable to India. This would also not be in accordance with the model we are advocating in our trade agreements in general. We are not pursuing sanctions but cooperation in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue which has been sensitive in this negotiation and the cause of some concern is access to medicines and the potential impact this FTA might have on access to medicines in the developing world. But let me reassure you on these crucial points. We are fully aware of the specific role played by India as regards access to affordable medicines in the developing world. Therefore, this FTA – whether its intellectual property rights chapter, its investment chapter or any other chapter – will not undermine the capacity of India to promote, produce or export generic medicines, including through compulsory licences. We ourselves have even proposed very clear language to this effect but, at the same time, one should bear in mind the potential of a robust framework on IPR in India, which can certainly encourage innovation and research, including as regards the development of new medicine. Therefore, negotiating a chapter on IPR with India remains an important objective for us in this negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also be very clear as regards data protection and data exclusivity for pharmaceutical products. What we will be asking through this agreement is that, if and when India decides to introduce a system of data exclusivity, it will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner so that European producers will also benefit from it and, of course, we continue to believe that access to medicine and the protection of test data can coexist constructively. Further dialogue by all interested stakeholders should help to develop a common understanding on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, in the intellectual property rights chapter, geographical indications are a major area of interest for the EU. It is important to obtain in this negotiation a political deliverable allowing for the effective protection of the major EU GI names. Negotiations have so far proven to be difficult. Nonetheless, the Commission continues to push for a satisfactory outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as you are aware, the Commission has also proposed to the Council additional negotiating guidelines to also negotiate investment protection. These draft negotiating guidelines have been shared with Parliament subject to the appropriate confidentiality requirements. The Council is currently examining these guidelines and we look forward to hearing Parliament’s view on them. When and how this chapter can be negotiated will ultimately depend on when the Council manages to agree on these additional negotiating guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by reiterating that this negotiation is very important and, I believe, an opportunity we should not miss. Of course, we should not conclude an agreement at any cost but only if the substance on the table is right. If the substance is not there, we should simply say no. Some of our requests, such as access for our cars or wines and spirits or the opening of certain services sectors, are difficult for India to deliver. I look forward to more intensified exchanges on this with the European Parliament as we move into what is hopefully the final phase.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the debate we will now have is a useful opportunity for this House to give its views on these negotiations. These views will be taken into account as far as possible, taking into account the realities and specificities of this particular negotiation. In this respect, we look forward to the resolution that you are planning to adopt on the India FTA, which I believe is very timely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The strategic reasons alone – you mentioned some of them – speak for themselves. In particular, the fact that, regrettably, we are not making any progress within the framework of the WTO also speaks even more in favour of this free trade agreement with India.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the issue that is still causing me concern is whether we really will obtain access to the Indian market for our enterprises. Does this free trade agreement ultimately really only suit the world and the division of economic power between Europe and India that we know today, or will this agreement still be suitable in ten or 15 years’ time?</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I am increasingly concerned about the issue of the exclusions. I fully understand why India is currently demanding certain exclusions in certain sectors in the negotiations. A country at the level of development at which India currently finds itself needs exclusions. This is certainly something that we in Europe can understand very well.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would expressly like to see all these exclusions expire on a particular day. I would like the exclusions to be provided either with a clear time limit or with definite benchmarks, however they are structured – perhaps the Commission could consider what proposals it intends to bring to the table to go some way towards meeting India’s demands. I would therefore like very clear limits for all exclusions, whether in the form of time limits or benchmarks. We more than owe that to our enterprises and thus, also to our workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be very grateful if you could tell us to what extent you have such exclusions and possible limits for them in view in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important subject that you mentioned and that I would like to express my agreement with is the subject of intellectual property. We absolutely must achieve a result that benefits our farmers and other parties affected here, particularly in the area of geographical indications. We must also help our manufacturers when it comes to medicines, but I think that we will all agree that this must not be to the detriment of those who are dependent on access to cheap medicines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">India is booming; it is a strategic partner, as you have reminded us. Everyone understands the importance of developing trade between us. Yet we are not starting from scratch, since the Union is already India’s main trading partner, the main investor in India and the main destination for Indian investors, and India is also the main beneficiary of the system of generalised preferences.</p>
<p class="contents">We will therefore have to be alert to any new impact that a new and more far-reaching trade agreement may have on fragile sectors of the Indian economy. I am thinking, for example, of agriculture – our Indian colleagues spoke to us about this – and of the consequences for sectors that are particularly exposed to competition from emerging countries in Europe, and I am thinking of the car industry. Such an agreement should serve the development of our societies and of employment and not give rise to uncontrolled liberalisation that would have disastrous effects.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why my group wishes to emphasise a number of points in these negotiations, which should culminate in an agreement that helps achieve the objectives of sustainable development and poverty eradication, and which should also be accompanied by clear and verifiable commitments, on the basis of cooperation, of course, but then coupled with serious social and environmental commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise a few points in particular. Firstly, regarding agriculture – which I mentioned earlier – we call on the Commission to ensure that none of the agreement’s provisions, either on the liberalisation of agricultural trade or on intellectual property rights, threaten small-scale farming in India. I am thinking of the provisions on seeds, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, regarding generic medicines, India is the biggest producer of generic medicines in the developing world. We call on the Commission to stop demanding data exclusivity, since all the NGOs say it is liable to harm the distribution of those medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in the area of services, we call, firstly, for public services to be left out of the sectors to be liberalised and, secondly, concerning mode IV, for the principle of equal treatment to be guaranteed – in other words, for all forms of social dumping to be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly – thank you, Mr President – we believe that the sustainable development chapter must include binding commitments in relation to respect for social and environmental standards, in particular, ILO social standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am now going to explain the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Firstly: access to medicines. While I welcome the Commissioner’s statement, I confirm that I am against any attempt to implement protectionist measures in a sector in which Europe actually hindered access to low cost medicines in the past. Exploiting the issue of counterfeiting purely for protectionist purposes is about as low as it gets. The agreement should instead be an opportunity for the Indian and European pharmaceutical industries to cooperate with one another.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: industrial sectors. We are asking India to allow sensitive sectors such as the automotive and alcohol sectors, in which our exports are today heavily taxed, to also feature in the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: agriculture. For our part, we declare ourselves willing to discuss agricultural products and to open up our market, but with a few conditions attached: obviously, we must say ‘no’ to GMOs and do everything we can to protect geographical indications. As regards this last aspect, I would remind you that geographical indications are not just a trade policy matter; they are also part of Europe’s identity. We therefore hope that a huge effort will be made to simplify registration procedures in India’s bureaucratic system, which is very onerous, perhaps even more onerous than the European one, which says it all.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards public procurement, I congratulate the Commission if it is true that India seems to be prepared, for the first time, to include public procurement in an international agreement. Indian railways – to give you an example, 17 000 trains transport 18 million passengers every day, and there are plans to build a further 25 000 kilometres of track in the next 10 years – are one of the many markets that could potentially be opened up with this free trade agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">If the negotiations go well, both parties will benefit: sustainable development will be promoted, child labour will gradually be eradicated and a more progressive form of social protection will be upheld. I feel it is pointless and detrimental to oppose this, and so I call on all the groups in Parliament to reject <span class="italic">a priori</span> a compromise text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The conclusion of an ambitious FTA is expected to boost bilateral trade by EUR 160 billion by 2015, with key sectors seeing as much as a 30% increase in bilateral foreign direct investment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the Commissioner will agree that these are exactly the kind of figures that will help to stimulate the economy and create jobs, not only throughout the United Kingdom, but also in India.</p>
<p class="contents">In its initial assessment of the potential FTA between the EU and India, the Centre for the Analysis of Regional Integration at Sussex concluded that any gains would depend on the extent to which the text identified and dealt with the key areas which the Commissioner specifically mentioned, such as government procurement, services, investment in trade facilitation, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">It states that if an agreement is largely confined to an issue of shallow integration, notably, the reduction of tariffs, there is a strong possibility of trade diversion exceeding trade creation for both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner mentioned, quite rightly, sustainable development. I would say to you that we have to be very careful. The red lines are set, as it were, in tablets of stone, and I hope that we will not go too far towards conceding too much.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also agree with Mr Caspary on time limits. I think he put a very good point forward there.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should also mention the impact of the WTO Doha Development Round on an EU-India FTA. Current signals from Geneva have not been positive, and the Commissioner admitted not so long ago that the negotiations were in dire straits. Now is perhaps the time, he said, for Plan B – something, I hasten to add, that the Committee on International Trade has been looking for for a long time. What effect will this have on the EU-India FTA? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

India’s per capita GDP is about 6% of that of the EU. India, although ambitious, is a developing country with a huge number of poor and starving people within its borders. We must not forget this.</p>
<p class="contents">We are bound by the principle of policy coherence for development, which is enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty, and it tells us that none of our policies must harm development. Yet, with this FTA, we are causing harm – to agriculture, retail, Indian companies, etc. Examples have already been mentioned. In addition, through the dispute settlement provisions, we are reducing the policy space for India, and for the EU and its Member States, to introduce, for example, new environmental legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The mechanism in question has led to multinational companies suing countries for their policies on health and environment – and your governments, too, will be affected by this.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to generic medicines, as I see it, they are not out of the danger zone. Pushing for data exclusivity in any form is a problem, no matter how it is done.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament needs to send a clear signal to the Commission that a trade agreement should be fair and should not curb the policy space.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, the members of the EPP, ALDE and ECR Groups are actually curbing their own power as Members of this Parliament. In the Committee on International Trade, they have consistently asked the Commission not to pursue the investment chapter until Parliament has given its opinion on what investment policy should look like, but now, in this resolution, they are calling on the Commission to go ahead without waiting for Parliament’s opinion. How come?</p>
<p class="contents">I really hope that some of our colleagues can have a second look at the text before simply agreeing to it on Wednesday. I hope we can send a clear signal to the Commission and thereby influence the negotiations, making it very clear that we want to exercise our powers as the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By using the specific texts, we want to examine whether the role of India as the pharmacy to the world’s poor is put at risk or whether the production of cheaper malaria medicines or medicines for the treatment of AIDS will be obstructed by the agreement, without ignoring the massive research investments also made by our own pharmaceutical companies. We want to examine whether European local authorities, hospitals or ministries are, in future, to be obliged to make calls for tenders in which Indian companies can also be included. We want to know whether the agreement will regulate the conditions of entry into the Member States of the European Union of Indian nurses or carers for the elderly, including the length of stay and recognition of qualifications. We want to know whether the agreement text will put small-scale farmers and fishermen in India at risk and whether European steel workers are threatened with redundancy because Indian capital will, in future, be able to be invested freely in the purchase of companies in the EU as a result of the agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although India has an emerging economy, social disparities persist. More than 800 million people live on less than USD 2 a day. India’s efforts in building a strong economy must be backed up by the political will to improve the situation in terms of human, social and environmental rights. This is why the European Commission must urge during the negotiations for some legally binding clauses to be introduced relating to these areas. India can set not only an economic example for the rest of the developing countries, but also an example of democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A small group of us went, and it was exceedingly interesting and very valuable to go.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to talk, in particular, about paragraph 29 of the motion on which we will vote on Wednesday. It says that Parliament ‘welcomes all efforts by the Indian Government to eradicate child labour’. I suppose the person who drafted this is attacking goods that might be manufactured using child labour and brought into Europe, but the motion does not say that. What it does is single out one of the unfortunate aspects of Indian life which still exists. Last year, our delegation visited a project in southern India, which is financed by EU money, to eliminate child labour. From what we saw, the problem was that children were actually working in the fields – not manufacturing anything – to pay off debts that their parents had incurred. They were sentenced to do this for life and to miss out on schooling.</p>
<p class="contents">The phrase used in the motion for a resolution is potentially offensive to Indians. Of course they want to eliminate child labour. We should either get rid of paragraph 29 or change it to say that we are concerned about goods that might be made using child labour. For me, there is a whiff of superiority here, with Europe saying: ‘We have got rid of child labour, but you Indians are still using it’. That is not the relationship we should have with a very important trading partner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the view that goes: we now have an agreement which is the most extensive in the world. We therefore need to maintain it and it is important in itself and, then, as we trade with India, a number of what are commonly known as non-trade concerns, such as minority rights, child labour and caste discrimination, will crop up. I call this ‘the trader’s take on things’. This way of thinking pervades the resolution that is before us.</p>
<p class="contents">The second take on things, Mr President, actually demands that we, first of all, clear up non-trade concerns and only then reach an agreement. I call that ‘the preacher’s take on things’. We know that, in the latter scenario, India will definitely not want to enter into an agreement with us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind this House that in March 2009, we adopted a resolution which took into account both the trade and the non-trade concerns. In my opinion, the resolution before us is a retrograde step. It may contain a sustainable development clause, but it has no teeth. The Dalits have hardly been mentioned at all. Nature and the environment are the biggest losers in the current text. I cannot therefore endorse the text of the resolution. Our negotiators have to hold on to the 2009 resolution. The trader and the preacher must continue to cooperate and, I am quoting the Commissioner here, ‘only then will you have a balanced agreement’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If negotiations are to be brought to a swift conclusion, consultations must be stepped up on key sectors, such as services, non-tariff barriers, public procurement and geographical indications.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the trade in goods is concerned, I would highlight the high average tariffs imposed by India on both agricultural and industrial goods. As regards access to the services sector, unfortunately, there appears to be no clear commitment on the part of India at present. The Union should insist in no uncertain terms on its claim to enhanced protection for all geographical indications on a market as important as the Indian market. Moreover, India is also an ally of the Union within the framework of multilateral negotiations on geographical indications in the Doha Round. It should be noted that India has a clear legislative framework, especially as regards the procedure for the registration of geographical indications and their coexistence alongside trademarks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that the Union must demonstrate flexibility towards the Indian request for protection for non-agricultural Indian geographical indications so that India, in turn, will grant protection for European geographical indications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we once again consider the fact that India is clearly a market of the future, we must also feed this back into a clear position adopted by Parliament: In our view, industrial development in the European Union – linked to jobs – is of key importance. We therefore need to make it clear that the interests of jobs in industry in Europe must take priority in the trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, although an agreement has to be asymmetrical, at the end of the day, the tariffs must be zero. It is not acceptable for us to have tariffs of 100% in mechanical engineering and the automotive sector and, in the end, perhaps negotiate 50%. As long as we do not have any zero tariffs, it will encourage investments outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, we need to clearly define our priority areas and they lie in industry. We also need a level playing field to be established with regard to social standards, and it is also necessary for clear obligations to be imposed on India in relation to workers’ rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The free trade agreement with India is extremely important for the future of trade relations. This is why I, too, am in favour of concluding this agreement as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">One important aspect relates to the deregulation of services, especially with regard to modes 3 and 4. Services are particularly important for economic growth, both in India and the European Union, which must be reflected in the free trade agreement. With regard to mode 4, the problems linked to the recognition of professional qualifications need to be resolved, which is, nevertheless, a fairly difficult issue, given that we have problems with mutual recognition of professional qualifications even between European Union Member States. I would like to ask the Commission to tell us what stage the discussions have reached on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect relates to reciprocity of access to the public procurement markets. Providing European companies with access to India’s public procurement markets may contribute to our companies’ development.

<p class="contents">It is quite clear to me when I look at what the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce is now saying that we are likely to increase bilateral trade from EUR 69 billion in 2009 to EUR 160 billion in 2015.</p>

The world order is changing. Some superpowers are becoming weaker while others, like India, are growing in power. That is why we, the European Union, need a partner like this, a democratic partner, since we also have various relations with undemocratic partners. The agreement which is currently being negotiated concerns the exchange of goods, services and investments, but there will also be references to sensitive social and environmental issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very pleased to hear the Commissioner’s comment with regard to generic drugs that there will be no danger of a negative effect on the patients. Having been in India many times, and also in developing countries, we have heard from AIDS patients how important it is for them to have access to cheap drugs. Digital services and personal data are very important in Europe as well. I am convinced that India can fulfil European conditions concerning personal data, although the EU is amending them at the moment and will probably change them as technology develops. After the latest events at Sony, Europeans need to be sure that their data are secure if they are being processed abroad. I am sure that this agreement will lead to a rise in various environmental working standards, but we need to be careful here. It appears to me, especially in view of our debate, that we all have different expectations of India and we want to include these expectations in the free trade agreement. However, this is a free trade agreement, and it cannot include all our expectations or everything we would like India to achieve.</p>

In my opinion, there are two things that are immensely important, both of which could be subsumed under the heading of ‘fairness’. The first is fairness for our producers and for our industry. That has been mentioned several times already. We must not allow certain restrictions, which may perhaps make sense at the start, to remain in place permanently. Right at the start of this agreement, we must establish how long something should apply and under what circumstances regulations will subsequently be discontinued. After all, India will obviously continue to develop and we need to take account of that. In this regard, I share the views expressed by my fellow Members.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a question of fairness for the people, both in the European Union and also in India. That is also extremely important. An agreement such as this must also contain elements that do not necessarily relate only to trade – these have also been mentioned already: sustainability, human rights, social, environmental and labour standards – these things are also unbelievably important. Above all, these aspects must be laid down in such a way that there are consequences if they are not complied with. I do not at all mean this to sound schoolmasterish towards our Indian friends. When it comes to human rights, I can imagine that India has better law relating to the press, for example, than some Member States of the European Union.

<p class="contents">Firstly, the issue of whether to include a chapter on sustainable development. This free trade agreement is a new-generation agreement, so it is only natural that it should include such a chapter. Hence, we are not talking about a quid pro quo, but about a negotiating chapter as such. Furthermore, if the free trade agreement is to reflect each party’s level of development, it cannot overlook such fundamental standards as the prohibition of child labour, for example. Although it has been officially prohibited since 1986, an estimated 60 million children still work today in India’s fields and factories. The Commission cannot ignore minimum social standards during these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to the purely commercial negotiating chapter, the issue of reciprocal access to government contracts has not been fully resolved. I am pleased that access to Indian federal government contracts is being covered by these negotiations, but what about provincial contracts?</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I have a few concerns about the protection of intellectual property rights and, in particular, of geographical indications – this has been mentioned several times. Indian legislation protects them only at national level, not at international level. As I understood it, the Commission had listed 200 indications that it intended to protect via an agreement that would come into force before the free trade agreement. Is this still the plan? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, there is a lack of adequate progress on government procurement and services, principles for the protection of intellectual property, including geographical indications, conditions for sustainable development, and particularly in following production standards when creating equal conditions for competition. I believe that it is essential to carry out an assessment of the specific character of individual sectors to flag possible negative influences of a free trade agreement on vulnerable sectors of the economy of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, of course, very difficult to go into all the questions in a detailed manner, but let me just focus on some questions that have been repeatedly put.</p>
<p class="contents">On public procurement, it is obvious that the public procurement chapter will focus on federal level, not on provincial level. By the way, this is the first time ever that they have been ready to negotiate on public procurement as such, but I also want to indicate the limitations of this. What is very important is that our negotiations also cover to the maximum extent possible India’s central level public sector undertakings where the bulk of procurement is done. Niccolò Rinaldi gave the example of trains, which is obviously one of the major sectors, given the difficult position of India with regard to infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question that has been repeatedly touched upon is child labour. I think it is fair to make a distinction between child labour in manufacturing and child labour in agriculture. Obviously, there are still quite a lot of youngsters working in agriculture. Whether they combine it or not with schooling is not always very clear, but I think the majority of them do so. It may also be the case that the number of children working in manufacturing goods that will be exported to Europe is rather limited so I think, as Mr Newton Dunn rightly pointed out, we should clearly distinguish between the two.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say that child labour is a very complex matter and it has always been a very complex matter in our own countries. I remember very well that when I was young, which is, of course, some time ago, but nevertheless not ages, a lot of children were still working specifically in agriculture, so this is not something that completely belongs to the Dark Ages in Europe either. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr Désir raised the issue of Europe’s demand for data exclusivity to be included in our negotiations. Several other Members specifically raised this point in connection with doctors in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to be very clear, however, and I have already said this on several occasions, during conferences and also directly to the NGOs concerned: we are not asking for data exclusivity; we are simply not asking for that. What we are saying – and it seems reasonable to me anyway – is that, if India ever decides by itself to apply data exclusivity, then it will apply to us too. There is what we call in our jargon ‘national treatment’, and I believe that that is the right approach. I therefore believe that I would be criticised to some extent if I agreed to apply protection measures to the Indian pharmaceutical industry that were not applied to our own industry. That is what this is about, nothing else. I really want to be very clear on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Other issues have been raised, Madam President, in particular with regard to tariffs – an issue raised, among others, by Mr Caspary. There is, of course, a different timeframe for, let us say, the path to zero for India and for Europe, which is understandable because they have different levels of development. The only question is whether zero can be achieved in certain sectors. We always emphasise the need to achieve it in every sector. Even so, I should like to draw your attention to the following, Mr Caspary: what will benefit our industry the most? A path towards zero in the very long term, or a rather drastic reduction in the first few years? I believe that we actually need to strike a balance between the two and then see where it takes us. Nevertheless, I should like to draw your attention to the two objectives: to reach zero in, say, 20 years, and to obtain a very moderate reduction in the meantime. The same solution is not necessarily that attractive to our industry, in my view. Therefore, we shall see, and I am sure that together, we shall come up with the best possible solution during this discussion. </p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the GIs, the high level of protection is an important objective in this negotiation and it has taken quite some time and effort with India to come to a common approach. One should also consider that India has never protected GIs through a bilateral agreement, so this is the first time that they are discussing this with a partner. We will continue to pursue this issue vigorously with the overall objective of achieving a high level of protection for our GIs.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that I have covered most of the other issues. I am certainly willing to continue the discussion on this agreement with Parliament and the Committee on International Trade, the more so now that we are reaching the end game in this discussion. I am not going to pronounce on the exact timeframe for coming to a final agreement. In any case, this cannot be long now because we are now dealing with the most sensitive topics – cars, wine and spirits, public procurement and GIs. We have to come to a conclusion, so we are really in what I would call the end game of these negotiations. We are in the last stretch to the finish, but the road will still be rather bumpy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even now, the majority of Indian foreign investment is situated in the European Union and the Tata Group alone is a leading employer in the industrial sector in Great Britain. Taking into account the pace of India’s development, it should be acknowledged that the trade agreement between India and the EU will form one of the most significant and demanding agreements to have been concluded to date. The agreement will undoubtedly contribute to an increase in the level of investment and imports and exports for both parties to the agreement. It will allow a freer exchange of goods and will contribute to greater prosperity in India as well as in EU countries. The agreement will intensify world trade, especially in the field of services. In spite of the advantages to be gained from signing the agreement, we should, however, bear in mind issues where both parties to the agreement present opposing views. The EU does not accept goods which have been produced to the detriment of the environment, or which have been produced using child labour. The agreement which we are striving for should guarantee proper workspaces, diversified, developing economies and multicultural diversity. It is crucial to introduce a decision-making system which is effective and improves cooperation, and also to introduce measures to support training for individuals and organisations which will help the regions to develop. In order to achieve the aims intended, a transparent and public debate is necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a difficult exercise in which the Commission will try hard, I hope, to accommodate Europe’s various strategic interests. In this respect, I should like to draw attention to the need to make progress in opening up the Indian market to European wine exports. Today, the Indian market has closed itself off to our products by imposing exorbitant 150% tariffs on them. We must therefore demand respect for the principle of trade reciprocity. It seems absurd, in fact, that our market should be very much open to wine products from emerging countries when we do not have satisfactory access to their market. I therefore encourage the Commission to continue the ambitious strategy it was able to carry out when it concluded a free trade agreement with South Korea. It is imperative to compensate for the arrival on our market of cheaper wines produced outside the EU with improved access for our products to foreign markets and, in particular, to the Indian market, the growth potential of which is exceptional. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

From the point of view of the European Parliament, the most important issue should be the non-tariff barriers, which has been emphasised many times at meetings of the Trade Policy Committee. The problem is not tariffs but the numerous restrictive regulations and obstructions faced by EU companies in gaining access to the Japanese market. I am in favour of greater cooperation between the European Union and Japan, but I believe that the priority should be the removal of these non-tariff barriers which restrict the access of EU goods to the Japanese market.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why paragraph 30 was accepted in the conclusions of the European Council in March and indicates the line to be taken and presented by the European Union at the EU-Japan Summit in opening negotiations on a free trade agreement. It is quite right to make the opening of these negotiations conditional on Japan showing goodwill in reviewing, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the issue of non-tariff barriers and restrictions on public procurement. It is worth bearing this in mind, all the more so as Japan is lobbying against the loss of competitiveness in the EU market as a result of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement which is due to come into effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, given the difficulties that we all know have been encountered there, I think the Commission deserves support in negotiating some of these bilateral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I think we should actually be pressing ahead with an EU-Japan free trade agreement. I recognise that there are concerns over the natural disasters that have befallen Japan, but I have spoken to many Japanese colleagues, friends and others who believe that, if we tread sensitively, an EU-Japan agreement would send a signal that Japan is back on its way and is on the road to recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at the figures, in 2009, Japan and the EU together represented more than a quarter of global GDP and more than 20% of world trade, and had a combined volume of foreign direct investment of about EUR 200 billion. Given that the EU countries and Japan face common challenges, I think it is important that we look at some of these issues and address them through trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite low tariffs, I think it is quite clear that bilateral trade volumes between the EU and Japan lag behind the bulk of the EU’s trade partnerships with its other main trading partners. I think this is mostly due to the non-tariff barriers. It has been estimated that the cost of some of these barriers is actually higher than the existing tariff levels, and that most of the gains will come from removing these barriers. For companies within EU countries, there would be gains if we could tackle barriers to public procurement, to the medical devices market – where there is insufficient recognition of international standards, to services – including financial services and postal services, and access for SMEs. For the Japanese, there would be gains in the automotive and ICT sectors. But let us not forget that removing or reducing barriers to ICT products from Japan would be of benefit to the EU as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, overall, there is a feeling on both sides that an EU-Japan FTA has the potential to become a true win-win for both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that this opportunity should be used by Parliament to strongly support an FTA with Japan for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and Japan are industrial giants that share democratic values and together represent 38.5% of the world’s gross domestic product. We share similar challenges: the rise of China, the global financial crisis, decreasing demographics and the need to access raw materials and energy sources and to achieve price stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I see great potential in further developing trade relations with Japan, our sixth largest trading partner. The economic benefits are clear. The Copenhagen Economics report concluded that the bilateral elimination of tariffs and reduction of non-tariff barriers would benefit both businesses and consumers and drive economic welfare by EUR 33 billion in the EU and EUR 18 billion in Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">The potential launch of negotiations on an FTA agreement was backed by the Council as long as Japan was willing to tackle non-tariff barriers on market access and restrictions on public procurement. I would like to reiterate that non-tariff barriers and public procurement are crucial areas for European businesses where Japan needs to make significant concessions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the European Parliament demands that the Commission be fully transparent in all negotiations and that we be provided with timely sectoral impact assessments. In addition, we will support bilateral safeguard measures, as was the case with the South Korea FTA, to avoid serious injury to sensitive sectors such as automotives, electronics, aviation and machinery.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am firmly convinced that it is high time that Parliament showed its support for a future FTA between the EU and Japan, building on the establishment of a high-level group, especially in the wake of the March 2011 disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, according to the OECD, our market penetration in Japan is amongst the lowest, and the reason for this has been indicated by my colleagues. The problem is not high tariff barriers – the tariff barriers are relatively low – but rather non-tariff barriers, including regulatory complications, issues in relation to mutual recognition, poor access to public contracts, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The million dollar question for both the Commission and this Parliament is whether to insist that Japan continues to make progress in tackling these non-tariff barriers before we open negotiations, or to open negotiations in the hope that, by doing so, we will encourage Japan to reduce its non-tariff barriers. There is no easy answer to that question.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think the omens are good that Japan does want to tackle non-tariff barriers. The Japanese Prime Minister has called for an ‘open Japan’ policy, and that is partly because he recognises that Japanese industry is stultifying in its present environment. It is also, of course, partly because of the anticipated impact of the South Korean free trade agreement on Japanese exports, but I think that, in addition, it reflects recognition of Japan’s limited experience with opening up.</p>
<p class="contents">European companies have had improved access to telecommunications, car manufacturing, retail and the insurance sector in Japan, and that has not damaged the Japanese economy but has, in fact, encouraged innovation and development in Japan. So I think the omens are good.</p>
<p class="contents">On balance, my group takes the view that we still need Japan to show a little more willingness before we announce the opening of free trade negotiations. We are not against an FTA but we think that Japan needs to do a little bit more to prove that the Japanese Prime Minister can deliver on his words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the trade side, the high-level group looked into ways of strengthening and integrating the economic relationship, addressing all issues of interest to both parties. These include tariffs, non-tariff measures, investments and procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">From Japan’s side, the clearly stated preferred option is to start negotiations on a free trade agreement which includes preferential tariffs. However, from the EU side, an agreement focusing on tariffs would clearly not be enough. The problem with Japan is, indeed, not so much tariffs but the fact that EU exporters and investors still face all sorts of non-tariff barriers. Typical examples of these include cumbersome approval processes for medical equipment and certain food products, and lack of convergence with internationally recognised standards for car parts and components.</p>
<p class="contents">Barriers in these areas have been in place in the Japanese market for decades. We have raised these matters in the various bilateral dialogues between Japan and the EU over the past few years but little progress has been achieved so far.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, we would need an agreement that would also tackle non-tariff barriers, increase market access for investment and open the Japanese public procurement market.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus of the high-level group’s trade discussions has been on exploring how to achieve progress on these issues. A degree of progress has thus been delivered on a limited number of non-tariff measures from a list identified by the EU, namely three out of 27, but for most non-tariff measures on the list, we feel that Japan has failed to present a credible road map demonstrating how the problems should be solved. So, in the Commission’s view, what has been achieved in the high-level group provides, at this stage, no more than a good basis for further discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">On 25 March 2011, the European Council reiterated the strategic importance of the EU-Japan relationship, confirming that ‘the forthcoming summit must be used to strengthen this relationship and bring forward our common agenda’. In this regard, the conditions for a successful FTA should be explored on the basis that Japan can demonstrate its willingness to tackle, inter alia, non-tariff barriers and restrictions on public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions are still ongoing with Japan. Last week, I met Foreign Minister Matsumoto precisely to discuss this matter. In my opinion, it is not yet clear how far we can progress, in the limited time before the EU-Japan Summit, with regard to fulfilling the Council’s conditions. In particular, more work is needed in order to arrive at a shared level of ambition on agreeing the contents of the negotiation, as well as an ambitious but realistic outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">This could be achieved through a so-called ‘scoping’ exercise, which could be conducted after the summit. Once that has been done, we would examine the results and decide whether or not to launch the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">On the trade and economic side, the level of ambition should include, at least, aiming for the following: 100% duty and quota-free treatment for all goods; a robust and credible road map for eliminating a critical mass of non-tariff measures; an open investment regime to achieve levels of foreign direct investment into Japan comparable to those of other OECD countries; and a government procurement market with a level of openness matching those of the EU countries at all levels of government.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also mention that, if the summit leaders decide to go ahead with the option of a comprehensive bilateral legal framework, this should include both trade and investment relations and political relations and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">This comprehensive approach, encompassing all bilateral, political and economic relations in a balanced way, is necessary in order to fulfil our targets and our ambitions for a deeper strategic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, indeed, at a crucial stage in our economic relations with Japan, and there are still some issues that need to be clarified. I therefore welcome this debate and look forward to hearing your views on how we should shape this relationship in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I get the impression that the situation with regard to these trade relations has barely improved in the last two years. You mentioned the summit in 2009 and the high-level dialogue and I get the impression that so far in these talks, we have not succeeded in obtaining any obvious additional market access for European companies in Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the first initiative, namely, this high-level dialogue, has been unsuccessful, I am very concerned that our primary concern is not the question of how we can perhaps achieve tangible success in this high-level dialogue, but instead we are already considering whether we should not negotiate a free trade agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I can well imagine that a free trade agreement with Japan would make sense, but before we enter into such negotiations, it is not too much to ask that we first wait for the results from the existing instrument, namely this high-level dialogue. I want to be very open about this and I am not saying this in order to take away any negotiating chips from Japan, but because I would genuinely like to see whether Japan is serious about intensifying trade relations with us and genuinely opening up its markets and also its attitude to our products.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be very interested – unfortunately, Commissioner, you did not mention this at all just now – in how you intend to involve the European Parliament in the issuing of the mandate. I have the impression that we would have a great deal to say on the subject of Japan. With regard to the negotiations with India, Canada and also Korea, we as Parliament have repeatedly been critical of the fact that, in our view, the wrong priorities were set to some extent in the negotiations, and therefore it would be very helpful if you would involve Parliament very closely in this matter right from the issuing of the mandate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore welcome the Commissioner’s cautious approach to this issue and we call on Parliament as a whole to follow that approach, which inspired our group’s motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Japanese Government has demonstrated – at least verbally – its willingness to open up its market, one of the most closed markets in the developed world. This positive attitude must be verified in practice, especially with regard to the 27 non-tariff barriers identified by the European Union, which must be lowered so that we can open negotiations with Japan and make them one of the priorities of our trade policy. We believe that improving these relations can help make Europe more competitive, since Japan accounts for 9% of world GDP, or over 35% when its GDP is added to our own.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, we cannot adopt resolutions unless they make the opening of free trade agreement negotiations subject to specific, binding and verifiable conditions; namely, that there will be genuine reciprocity and a proper impact assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Japan’s protectionist policy in the automotive sector concerns us, because there is an imbalance between exports and imports. Secondly, we wish to raise the issue of non-tariff barriers. I am talking about a whole range of standards, from health and plant health measures to technical standards – especially in the agricultural and automotive sectors – export subsidy rules, customs checks and factors allowing for counterfeiting and also triangular trade with China and Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that before Europe declares itself willing to open negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement, it resolutely defines the Community interest that it intends to protect and specifies the areas in which it will request reciprocity from Japan. We hope that the Commission will take these comments of ours on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that, unlike some other EU partners in the Far East, we share common values of democracy, human rights and the liberal market economy with Japan, making her a more natural partner for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the 19th EU-Japan Summit in April last year, it was agreed to establish a joint high-level group in order to analyse the progress in EU-Japan relations so far and draw up suggestions for streamlining our current activities. The importance of continuing to work on non-tariff issues was also stressed in the context of the joint high-level group and I hope that these agreements can be put into practice as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to speak in favour of timely and concrete steps to alleviate non-tariff barriers in order to liberalise EU-Japan trade relations. Both markets would benefit greatly from upgrading trade relations between the EU and Japan, especially keeping in mind innovation and technologies. I would also welcome further cooperation on matters relating to cyber security.</p>

<p class="contents">There is a lot that we can support in the EPP-ALDE-ECR resolution but I think that they are making a mistake to ‘strongly support’ an FTA. That is a direct quote from paragraph 2. I think that is premature support when we do not have impact assessments on the environmental and social effects of an FTA. They are predicting the answer before identifying the effects of implementing the solution. Many people have commented about the non-tariff barriers and the work that has yet to be done by the high-level group. I think that needs a positive step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">When we bear in mind the importance of Japan as a trading partner – with bilateral trade with the EU standing at EUR 120 billion a year, and with the EU being the number three trading partner for Japan and the number two investor in Japan – I think we recognise that any bilateral agreement runs the risk of undermining multilateral agreements with the rest of the world and, in particular, with the developing countries. So I think that strong unconditional support for an FTA needs to be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that, whilst we have every sympathy with Japan, future trade policies simply cannot be based on who has had the most recent natural disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I once again wish to express my deepest sympathies to the Japanese people.</p>
<p class="contents">We must immediately extend offers of partnership and help in dealing with this disaster – particularly in view of the debate we have just held on Pakistan. The summit must produce concrete decisions, particularly in relation to cooperation in clearing contaminated areas and joint research and development in the area of renewable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The possible development of our trade relations and economic cooperation through a corresponding agreement should not be simply a response to the nuclear accident. For this reason, negotiations should not begin too hastily, but should be examined with due care, paying particular attention to the different traditions and lifestyle.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the size and strength of the two economies, particular care is required when agreeing a comprehensive, bilateral trade agreement. Many issues have been raised, including intellectual property rights and public procurement, and the investment capital has reduced the scope for political action on both sides. That is why long-term impact assessments are required in relation to the relevant chapters and aspects of any economic and trade policy cooperation agreed in the future between the 27 EU Member States and Japan. For this reason, the European Parliament, as a codecision-making authority, as well as the public at large, must also be consulted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under this arrangement, the interests of all 27 Member States need to be satisfied, which, of course, means in practice that they will not be.</p>
<p class="contents">In consequence, an EU-negotiated trade agreement is likely to be less beneficial for an individual Member State – and, I have to say, the UK in particular – than if the Member State had been able to negotiate for itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the rationale for all this is that the EU is a large trading bloc and because of this clout, the EU is able to negotiate a trade treaty that would not be open to a Member State to negotiate on its own. But what do we find here? The negotiations for the EU trade treaty with Japan have not even properly started, as the Commissioner said. Meanwhile, the comparatively small, but dynamic, economy of Switzerland already has a trade treaty with Japan, and has had since 2009.</p>

<p class="contents">There are three reasons for my uncertainty. The first question is whether we are actually undermining our attempt to establish a multilateral agreement by agreeing a large number of external trade agreements with highly significant trading partners. Are we not in danger of concentrating too much on concluding individual agreements, which may prevent us from pursuing a multilateral system with appropriate and sufficient vigour?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, so far, I have not got the feeling that Japan is really meeting us half way in terms of market protectionism and non-tariff trade barriers. The wheels should already have been set in motion, otherwise the entire agreement is in danger of being too one-sided.</p>
<p class="contents">My third question is: what are the consequences? I do not intend to judge whether this is good or bad for us in the final analysis. However, I would like to know in advance how the social consequences are to be assessed, and how things look in terms of the environment or labour market. These are issues that I do not believe have been entirely clarified. Surely these questions should have been better assessed and researched in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">As some of my fellow Members have pointed out, if these points were to be clarified, the Commission would be well advised to consult the European Parliament when issuing a mandate.

As you have heard, my group is not so sure. I myself have great sympathy with this position because I believe that by strengthening cooperation in trade, we can help generate a new economic dynamism in Japan, following the disaster that has befallen the country.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are some fundamental questions that are inescapable. I do not intend to repeat what has been said about the need to predict the consequences in the bilateral area, or about the fact that we should avoid the mistake of first defining free trade priorities and then moulding European industrial policy to these as a dependent variable, or that the question of making a contribution to sustainability must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise something else: I believe that the effects that such a free trade agreement between two of the giants of international trade would have on the entire structure of global trade must be discussed in greater detail than has been the case heretofore. When two such mammoths of the commercial trade sector enter into negotiations on a free trade agreement, then this is not simply a bilateral matter. Until now, there has been no free trade agreement between two economic superpowers, so this would be a first. But what does that mean? What is the strategic perspective? What effect will this have?</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough simply to say we want multilateral trade and if we do not get it, then we will stick with the bilateral dimension of free trade and wait to see what happens. We are also responsible for making the implications clear to the European public, which is why the involvement of Parliament in the issuing of the mandate, as called for by several of my fellow Members, must be central. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that a free trade agreement between these two economic powers could provide benefits for both sides. However, the first thing which needs to be done is to remove the difficulties which form the basis and, in practical terms, stand in the way of drafting a really profitable agreement for both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">The Japanese market is currently subject to barriers, non-tariff barriers, as my fellow Members have also mentioned, which restrict import access, thereby impacting as a whole on trade activities and investments. As part of the negotiations it is conducting, the European Commission must strive both to promote a more transparent regulatory policy, which will help European companies to understand fully the rules for conducting trade with Japanese partners, and to deregulate access to public procurement. Finally, I also think that an impact study needs to be carried out, which will examine the effects of any agreement, particularly in the area of vulnerable European industries, such as the car industry, electronics and aeronautics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although both Japan and the European Union are mature economies, their trade cooperation has failed to exploit the opportunities presented by their economic clout. In addition to duties, more effective trade cooperation is hindered by the numerous obstructions that Japan has placed in the way of standardisation and access to public procurement and government contracts.

First, the relationship between bilateral and multilateral agreements. Some Members have advanced the idea that we should concentrate on the multilateral agreements rather than the bilateral ones. We do! As you know, the multilateral negotiations for the Doha Round are in dire straits, and we are the only big trading bloc that has been making proposals recently to try to bridge the differences between the developed and the emerging economies with respect to industrial sectors. But while we are really concentrating on the multilateral aspects of trade, on the other hand, we should not neglect all our bilateral relations with important trading partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with respect to Japan, as many among you have been saying, it is really a ‘chicken and egg’ situation. Do you start the negotiations and then hope that in the course of the negotiations, you can resolve the non-tariff barriers that have been in place for many years, or do you rather try to do away with the majority of the non-tariff barriers as a precondition for negotiations on the free trade agreement? I think that, to a certain extent, we need that conditionality, because the real problem with Japan is not so much tariffs. Of course, the idea would be to eliminate 100% of tariffs, which normally you would not have with a developing or an emerging economy. The real problem is with respect to non-tariff barriers. We have been proposing a list of 27 non-tariff barriers which we think are crucial for our trade relationship, but in only three cases out of the 27 is there now a solution on the table which seems to be acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Japanese claim that they have solutions for all the rest too, but we cannot see a solution in the proposals that they have been making to us.</p>
<p class="contents">So we believe that we need a scoping exercise so that we know what we are talking about. I hope that, in the course of that scoping exercise, we can do away with a number of non-tariff barriers, and that this will create the right climate for us to get down to actual free trade negotiations with Japan. That is how we see it. We see it, at least partially, as a precondition that we should stick to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European aircraft industry has long been the chief supplier of civil and military technology in the international market. Japan is also carrying out research into advanced solutions for general aviation as well as for passenger transport and cargo. It is estimated that the transport of passengers and goods by air will be one of the fastest growing branches in the coming decades. It is true that we already have examples of cooperation between partners from the European Union and Japan, including the EC 145 helicopter, designed jointly by Eurocopter and Kawasaki, but the potential for cooperation could be much greater in my opinion. I appeal for action to be taken for rapid European-Japanese cooperation in aeronautics, at company level as well as in research and development units. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

We have over a thousand bilateral investment agreements. According to the Treaty of Lisbon, this falls within the competence of the EU. How should we handle this situation?</p>
<p class="contents">It is not proving to be very easy. We have had a lot of meetings and we have tried to find a common position, but without success. I might as well be honest about that. We will have to vote on it and see what Parliament’s position will be. I would have liked us to have had a position that we all agreed on in order to be better placed to enter into negotiations with the Council. We would then have been able to defend Parliament’s powers and principles as laid down in the Treaty. That was not to be, on account of the fact that this is a sensitive subject, particularly when it comes to how to deal with the old agreements. With regard to the new agreements that the Member States are continuing and are entitled to enter into, we could undoubtedly have agreed on a policy in which there is a reasonable balance between the rights of investors and other rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This was difficult to do with regard to the old agreements, however, and I have therefore retained the compromises that we proposed in committee, as the vote was very even. I still hope that we have a more up-to-date view of the investment agreements than was the case with many of these old agreements, where we were the ones who invested in other countries. Nowadays, we have at least as many investments coming into our Member States. We must therefore make sure that we have the necessary scope in our policy and also that investments are adapted to more developed, modern work in relation to the environment and social matters. We must defend this part of the Treaty. Investment policy cannot fail to take it into account, either. As I said, we will have to see how the vote goes tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem we have here is the fact that we cannot even use the reasoning of providing maximum protection for investments. That is not the right way to create legal certainty. Since the new trade policy is more balanced, we must also have a more balanced view of what maximum protection can entail. We surely do not want to provide maximum protection here to foreign state-owned companies, or even companies owned by dictatorships, at the expense of human rights and the environment. This is a balance that I hope we will be able to achieve. The idea is not that we should use investment agreements to achieve social objectives, but neither should they prevent us from achieving social and environmental objectives. This is a far-reaching debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important debate concerns transparency. We recognise that Parliament and the EU have been given new competences. The Commission is now responsible. Therefore, it must also have access to the documents. We must increase transparency. Many of these agreements were written at a time when there were hardly any cases of dispute settlements. Now we have more than 300 cases and ongoing procedures. This must, therefore, be opened up to better scrutiny. We cannot have this total secrecy and I very much hope that, irrespective of what we think about this link between policy and investment, when it comes to transparency, we can stand united and defend openness and the new competences bestowed on us by the Treaty. I truly hope that that will be the case. I therefore hope that Amendment 13 will receive support. Without it, we will have absolutely no democratic control over these procedures. We need this if we are to retain and defend legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also seeing a tendency for many other countries, like the United States, Australia and Canada for example, to start to look at renewing their agreements. It will be good if we can agree to update the existing dispute mechanisms and judicial procedures, because these are outdated and need to be brought up to date and made more transparent. Then we will have an investment policy for the future. That will be dealt with in a different context – the debate about the future itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, the regulation on transitional arrangements for bilateral investment treaties is an important legislative initiative. The Lisbon Treaty has entrusted the Union with a new exclusive competence on foreign direct investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The continued existence, since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, of more than 1 200 investment-related international agreements concluded by Member States is not questioned under international law. However, it is incompatible, under EU law, with the new exclusive competence on foreign direct investment. At the same time, these agreements serve as a valuable source of legal protection for European investors operating abroad. Because the Lisbon Treaty does not contain arrangements clarifying the status of bilateral agreements, we need to establish legal certainty for investors benefiting from these agreements by authorising their continued existence.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is important to authorise existing investment agreements, it is also important to foresee the possibility of taking action in a cooperative manner to address important issues that could arise with regard to the content of the agreements and their interaction with EU investment policy. We have to reserve appropriate mechanisms for Union action to permit the development and implementation of the policy at EU level. I understand that, in relation to the Commission proposal, the scope for such action is the most difficult issue – for Parliament and even more so for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">So the challenge we have here is to find a solution that safeguards the principles I have just outlined and is acceptable to both Parliament and the Council. We realise, in this respect, that there are still some considerable gaps to be bridged between the institutions but, at the end of the day, we will have to find a compromise in the interests of the EU and of its investors.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the amendments adopted by the Committee on International Trade constitute a basis for finding such a solution. They maintain fundamental trust in the Commission’s proposal but, at the same time, seek a potential compromise. We note with satisfaction here that Articles 5 and 6 would still leave the Commission the power to review investment agreements and withdraw authorisation should such agreements create major problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the positions of the main protagonists in this process, we will all have to show some level of flexibility. The Commission is ready to play its part, to be flexible and to facilitate an agreement between Parliament and the Council, but this cannot be at any cost. We will be vigilant on the basic principles of our proposal. The existence of the bilateral investment agreements needs to be safeguarded but, at the same time, we cannot unconditionally bless agreements if they create significant problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully shares Parliament’s sentiment that the competence on investment should be exercised primarily at EU level, and we support the objective of Europeanisation of investment negotiations. However, I need to make clear that the Commission will not be able to negotiate with all countries targeted for investment protection by Member States. Our Member States have investment treaties with more than 100 countries. Replacing those will be a very gradual exercise, taking years. That is why it is important to create an effective mechanism empowering the Member States, under certain conditions, to continue negotiating and concluding bilateral investment agreements. Such a mechanism should respect the procedures and prerogatives of the institutions involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it needs to be emphasised that we are approaching a decisive stage of the legislative process, and time is becoming a major factor. It is important because the longer the adoption of the regulation takes, the longer the limbo period lasts, with the potential to create legal uncertainty for investors. I hope that, after the vote, Parliament and the Council can sit down together to find an early agreement on this issue. We are ready actively to support them in that endeavour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr Schlyter said, whatever happens tomorrow – the voting results are anyone’s guess – I hope they will reflect what has been done by the committee. Creating a common investment policy for the European Union is a very important step forward in the integration of the European Union. If firms within the European Union compete jointly within the same framework, on the same principles, the same should be true externally; they should have the same system of legal protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with Mr De Gucht. I am very pleased that he is supporting the proposal negotiated by the committee, because it really is a very good compromise between various standpoints: a compromise between the Commission’s standpoint, on the one hand, and the opinions presented by the Member States, and, on the other, it is compatible with investors’ interests, but most of all, it opens up good prospects for the Union’s investment policy in the future, serving the Union as a whole. It is very important that we are creating a new system, beginning by establishing a solid legal basis created by the agreements currently in force, and which were negotiated by Member States so that a common system of protection for the entire European Union could at last be established. It is important that the resolution which will be voted on tomorrow should be quickly agreed with the Council. This is something which is very important. I hope it will happen this year, with the active participation and support of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the era of the globalised economy, the European Union’s common commercial policy seems quite natural to us.</p>
<p class="contents">In this light, an initiative for the European Union to coordinate investment policy seems just as normal. The current system, relying on Member States’ numerous overlapping, and sometimes conflicting, bilateral investment agreements, should be replaced within a reasonable timeframe by a new framework of European Union investment agreements consistent with the horizontal objectives of EU policies. Personally, I would be in favour of placing the main emphasis on development policy. I agree with the rapporteur that the transition to the new regime should not take place overnight but should play out within a predetermined transitional period, the duration and rules of which should be established in advance so as to avoid any legal uncertainty. Without such a timeline, the regulation would allow parallel, potentially incompatible investment schemes to emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">A sufficiently long transition is needed to make the open-ended duality in EU investment policy unacceptable for Parliament, as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that investment policy is fully within the competence of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not all investment agreements can be replaced by European agreements, but not even the Commission can ignore agreements that infringe European provisions, and we agree with the rapporteur about placing the emphasis on transparency.</p>

<p class="contents">Some of the amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow in plenary may now alter this compromise and balance, and I call on my fellow Members, and the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs in particular, to come up with a balanced measure that is acceptable to all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know we are discussing transitional arrangements but what matters is that the Lisbon Treaty has removed from Member States the right to negotiate bilateral investment treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Some time in the future, and it is still not clear when, bilateral investment treaties will fall under the Commission. Because of Lisbon, investment treaties can become an instrument for the Commission’s political objectives – and not just the Commission’s: we can be absolutely sure that the Greens will try to advance their political programme, and we have seen that in the trade treaties time after time. Attempts will be made to tack on to every investment treaty the full Green agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the Greens are talented politicians – and I say this in admiration. They will often succeed, and in consequence, investment and hence commerce in all Member States will be hamstrung and hobbled. By contrast, countries outside the EU will not be subject to the Greens’ Pantomime of the Ents, if you remember those characters in the Lord of the Rings.

The only way to secure existing jobs or to create new employment is by safeguarding investments.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why there are two things that I regard as being important. Firstly, the over one thousand agreements already in existence must be retained. It makes no sense to cast investors, Member States and others into a state of legal uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and this is particularly important for us: in future, we will have to have many common European agreements that apply to all 27 Member States and investors from these Member States if we are also to have a uniform level of protection within the European internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I am very grateful to my fellow Members – Mr Schlyter, as well as Mr Zalewski, Mr Sturdy and Mr Rinaldi – because they have tried and succeeded in finding a broad consensus. I think it would be a good thing if the other groups would reconsider this issue and recognise that the compromise on the table is actually a very good solution that tries to cater to all needs.</p>
<p class="contents">For my own group, I would like to state clearly once again that we want a good solution for investors, workers and Member States. We are looking for speedy negotiations with the Council, so that this issue is not put on the long finger, but that a solution is found soon.</p>
<p class="contents">On account of the differences between the groups, my group favours completing the first reading this week. Finally, I would like to add that we would be very open to finding a swift solution in the second reading – and we would be very grateful if this were possible – in other words, we would suggest that, rather than following the normal procedure of the second reading, we should try to find a so-called early second-reading agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to thank all those involved.

The first is that this project should come under an enormous banner guaranteeing security and reliability for investors who wish to invest in the EU, as well as investors in the EU who wish to invest elsewhere. Both groups must be able to rely on the support of the existing contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: while we should be very grateful to the rapporteur for his truly comprehensive work, we should avoid trying to pack too much into trade agreements. I must contradict the rapporteur because this is quite a typical process for dealing with differences of opinion at committee or parliamentary level and not everything can be accommodated by compromises. Accordingly, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his fairness in our cooperation. Let us wait and see how the vote goes tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I welcome Mr De Gucht’s statement that the Commission was not questioning the existing agreements. This does not mean that the EU should not quickly conclude new agreements now that the Union has been reconstituted under the Treaty of Lisbon. However, if Mr De Gucht believes this to be the case, he will certainly agree with the significant weakening of the instrument for examining existing agreements, which we voted on in an amendment, and with the limitation of the reasons for withdrawing approval to four clear criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings me to my final point: it has been made quite plain in these discussions and during the committee’s work that there are different interests at stake here, depending on how many bilateral agreements one’s own country has concluded. That is why it is a good thing that a transitional period is clearly defined in this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, until such time as it is possible to conclude investment agreements at Union level, a legal vacuum – the legal uncertainty referred to by Mr Caspary – needs to be avoided and the necessary security of law must exist for European investors. I would point out that the legislation of the Member States of the Union, in conjunction with unifying legislation, provide every guarantee needed for third country investors. On the other hand, if a high level of protection is to be safeguarded for Europeans investing in third countries, the current bilateral agreements executed by individual Member States of the Union need to remain in force.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution does not, in my opinion, safeguard the necessary security of law in any way whatsoever. I refer, in particular, to the points relating to: firstly, the Commission’s discretionary powers to withdraw the authorisation to maintain existing agreements or to approve new negotiations to amend current or execute new agreements; secondly, the provision to review the legal framework within five years; and thirdly, the extremely time-consuming procedures for executing new agreements. The amendments adopted by the Committee on International Trade are, in my view, a move in the right direction. I repeat, the objective should be to maintain existing and simplify the procedure for executing and applying new bilateral agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">More than 1 200 bilateral investment agreements concluded by Member States under different, frequently incompatible, legal regimes need to be placed comprehensively under the auspices of the European Union without impairing the rights of the parties involved. The only possible way out of the legal stagnation brought about by transferring Member States’ powers to the European Union would appear to be a principle allowing both sets of agreements to coexist over a transitional period, in order for Member States to renegotiate existing bilateral agreements or, in line with EU investment policy, to complete negotiations on agreements under preparation.</p>

We aim to be flexible and to achieve a good compromise for the transitional regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">These amendments go even further than the Commission’s initial proposal for the regulation, as they considerably expand the scope of the review and withdrawal mechanisms which are already a source of major concern for Member States and many Members of Parliament. These new criteria, relating to incompatibilities with established policies of the Union or general principles of the Union set out in Article 21 of the Treaty, could be regarded as opening the door to all sorts of additional requirements that existing investment agreements should meet. I believe such an approach would be strongly opposed by Member States as considerably increasing the level of legal uncertainty for investors benefiting from these agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the next steps in this procedure, I believe that tomorrow’s vote will be an important signal for all stakeholders in this process, and most notably also for the Council as regards the legislative procedure. The outcome of tomorrow’s vote will be discussed with the Ministers during the public debate next Friday. Next Friday, we have a Foreign Affairs Council on trade, and this will be one of the topics that we will discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope – and I am confident – that your votes will provide the basis for an agreement. I understand that tomorrow, there will be a vote on the amendments and on the report as a whole but – as Mr Caspary, among others, has said – I hope that this will not hinder us from reaching an early agreement at second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been difficult. Some points that were taken up by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and others relate to security and fairness. That is precisely what we are all agreed on: investments must be fair, people should be treated fairly and we must have a reasonable level of security. At the same time, we cannot over-protect them like molly-coddled infants. It is like a minefield sometimes; we take hits occasionally and we develop our awareness. On the other hand, the risks must be reasonably predictable and we must be able to understand what risks we are taking. If we are too over-protective, we will retain our old industries and miss out on the change and renewal that we need because we do not dare to take new decisions. That would be unfortunate. Therefore, I do not quite understand the Commissioner’s criticism of some of the compromises that are being tabled again here, as we refer to the Treaty and you are the ones who interpret how it is to be applied. We are very well aware that you cannot review every single agreement and query everything, but can only look at serious violations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also good that we are in agreement that Articles 5 and 6 should be retained. It would be unfortunate if the Commission’s only means of querying an agreement were to be to take the matter to the European Court of Justice. If an agreement is called into question and the European Court of Justice says that the agreement is invalid, hundreds of agreements would suddenly become invalid without warning. That would certainly not be a practice that would result in legal certainty. It is important for Articles 5 and 6 to be retained.</p>
<p class="contents">I completely agree with Mr Caspary that our negotiations should be conducted quickly. Irrespective of how the vote goes tomorrow, it is important that we conduct the negotiations quickly. I have already spoken to the Hungarian Presidency and it is ready and willing to deal with this matter as soon as we have voted. It could also conceive of a decision at first reading, but it does not look as if that will be the case here.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that the Earl of Dartmouth need worry that the Greens will take over investment policy. There are many forces that wish to keep it precisely as it has been for the last 50 years. I have to say that even if you admire our political capability to get proposals through, please do not exaggerate it. For my part, I admire your rhetorical skills. With their help, perhaps we could get even more green policy through.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, we will have to vote this week and see how it goes. I would like to thank those involved and also the Hungarian Presidency, which I have met with on a number of occasions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The legal protection offered by the bilateral investment treaties (BITs) is important in ensuring that businesses are encouraged to take the step of investing abroad, which can cost many millions. The EU is both a recipient and provider of foreign direct investment. It remains to be seen whether a move to coordinate the good 200 BITs in operation in the European Union can finally resolve the problem whereby binding BIT arbitration judgments based on international law entail commitments to investors by Member States that give rise to EU Treaty infringement proceedings. Direct investment is certainly not the miracle cure claimed during the economic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe, for example. Although greater predictability in relation to FDI opportunities for EU investors is something to be welcomed, the potential negative aspects of investment policy, for example, the fear among the local population of redundancies and wage cuts due to outsourcing and the relocation of production, should not be swept under the carpet. Likewise, we need to make it clear to developing countries that FDI can only improve living standards if the fundamental institutional requirements are met, such as clear property rights, the independence of the legal system, and political stability. I believe there is a lack of honesty in relation to this pseudo-humanitarian development aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title23"></a><a name="creitem23"></a>

Many official celebrations, festivals and parades are taking place to commemorate the anniversary. Do not let the celebratory mood blind us to the problems with which the EU is currently wrestling. Firstly, we must reply to the question whether the national self-interest which has appeared in the negotiations over the next financial perspective is in accordance with the calls for solidarity of our founding fathers? Secondly, are initiatives which reverse European integration, such as the latest initiative to restrict the Schengen area, compatible with the spirit of Europe? Finally, does the current crisis in the euro area and the lack of solidarity of Member States in tackling it present a threat to the success of this ambitious project?</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, there are many more examples pointing to a crisis in European integration. On this anniversary, let us take the opportunity to reflect seriously on what to do to stop these detrimental tendencies, and to return to proper, dynamic integration in the future. Let us renew the spirit of Europe according to the ideas of Robert Schuman, so that the successes we have had so far in our common project do not fall by the wayside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this is only one of the conditions of stability of Europe.</p>

However, the agreement on the euro is fundamentally a move in the wrong direction, as it does no more than impose the traditional economic orthodoxy. Attempts to link the euro to constant cutbacks in the social state and constant pressure on wages and pensions in the long term risk eroding not only political cohesion, but also the European ideal.</p>

It is a brazen insult to the millions of dead and injured, the victims of fascist and Nazi bestiality in Greece and Europe as a whole, for the European Union to try and wipe out and falsify history: to turn 9 May from a day of anti-fascist grassroots victory into a vulgar celebration as Europe Day, a day which celebrates the European monopolies.

It is a paradox that there has been a regression, especially in educational matters, writing surnames in Polish and the rights and privileges of Poles living in Lithuania.

One of the most tangible results of negotiations on climate change in Cancún was the agreement on a Green Climate Fund, with unprecedented financing in the order of USD 100 billion. While the transitional committee set up within the framework of the UN is preparing the final form of the Fund, so that it can obtain a final seal of approval in Durban at the end of the year, questions relating to the design of this unique and extremely important instrument remain unanswered. The Fund must be a carefully designed vehicle that will provide effective financing for adjustment to climate change in the developing world. However, both the recent criminal attacks on the Community emissions trading system (EU ETS) and the information in the recent report by Transparency International on corruption in climate funding are causes for concern, not only because huge amounts of money are at risk, but also, more importantly, because a global fight which, unlike others, may not be open to repeat efforts, is at risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A labour code is a piece of legislation under which a state provides a system of fundamental social rights for workers. The current government in Slovakia is preparing an amendment to its Labour Code that will increase working time to 56 hours per week and overtime from the current 400 hours to 560 hours. In addition, it places workers at a disadvantage, creates uncertainty for those in employment, and reduces financial support for those who lose their jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Paradoxically, the new rules are also destabilising for employers. Trade unions have taken to the streets to voice their opposition to the Labour Code amendment. The European Parliament declared 2010 the year for combating poverty. All of Europe is fighting against poverty.

<p class="contents">This programme has become vital for 13 million Europeans who have little job security.

<p class="contents">Viktor Orbán, as the Hungarian prime minister, has ridden roughshod over fundamental democratic principles. Not only has he refused to cooperate with the opposition in the adoption of this basic law of his country, but, because of the way the constitution has been conceived, he has very fundamentally undermined the rights of minorities, and destabilised good neighbourly relations between EU Member States. I therefore hope that the Venice Commission’s findings will be directed towards the adoption by this Parliament of a resolution demonstrating that the Fidesz government is bad for Hungary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Roma strategy of the Commission concentrates only on one side, the social tasks, and even in that respect, it shifts responsibility primarily to the Member States. Unfortunately, it barely mentions the necessity of combating anti-Romanyism, the human rights dimension of the issue. The Commission did not raise its voice when paramilitary groups were threatening the Roma citizens in the Hungarian Gyöngyöspata for weeks, and the Hungarian Government took action only when the tension and the provocation escalated into violence. I fear that if Europe does not show willingness to play a greater role in the improvement of the situation of the Roma people than what was mentioned in the Commission Communication, similar situations will occur again and again.

Forests are a part of our identity. We use them for recreation and for employment, and yet forests are so different for each of us, in each area of Europe. If someone from northern Europe visits the Mediterranean forests, he will think that many areas that we in the Mediterranean call forests are savannahs or parks, as they support no productive activities. Or, conversely, someone from the Mediterranean travelling in northern Europe will consider that the forests in the area are man-made rather than natural, as they support heavy productive activities.</p>
<p class="contents">These forests, which are so different for each individual in Europe, for each area, face a common threat: climate change. Climate change is threatening European forests, with an increase in forest fires, with diseases passing from one country to another and putting entire species at risk, and with disasters caused by extreme weather conditions. The impact differs from one geographical area to another, but it is a cross-border impact and needs to be addressed with Europe’s assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are debating, and in two days, we shall vote on Parliament’s report on forest protection. This report was shaped by consent, right from the start, in cooperation with members from every country and political group. When it was tabled for debate in committee, it was further shaped by a procedure of 50 compromise amendments, from all the political groups and areas represented in Europe. I am therefore certain that this report represents Parliament’s opinion as to how we can help forests, how we can help our communities to adapt to climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we asking for in this report? We are asking for the Commission to proceed with the White Paper on adapting to and protecting forests from climate change, we are asking for a new regulation to replace the old regulation on the prevention of forest fires, we are asking for a new regulation to replace the old regulation on information on the state of forests and, finally, we are asking for an increase in funding for forests under the second pillar of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Forests account for 42% of the countryside, but only 1% of the CAP. We are asking for the facility to finance public agencies, for sustainability criteria for woody biomass used for energy and, finally, for pro-active, viable management of forests adapted to climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is to draw attention to threats currently weighing down on countless forest ecosystems. Amongst other things, I would highlight the spread of invading alien species, pests and forest fires. There is evidence of some recurrence of some of these factors, especially in convergence regions. There is a need for rigorous study of their impact, and also of the best ways to make the forest more resistant to this group of biotic and abiotic threats. To this end, sufficient financial resources should be channelled through Union programmes and support measures for evaluation of forests’ ecological states and the health of their plants, and for their reclassification, including reforestation that favours indigenous species and mixed forests, as well as their resilience and biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would draw attention to the enormous diversity of natural conditions and, consequently, of forest ecosystems occurring in Europe. They need to be recognised and valued: their multifunctionality needs to be valued, along with their potential for generating employment and development in the rural world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ability to cope with the type and range of expected problems depends on natural regional conditions (mountainous areas, for example, are exposed to different problems than those of low lying areas), on the physiological sensitivity of forest vegetation, on how far individual ecosystems have developed their potential to adapt, on the intensity of the expected climate change (in Central and Eastern Europe, for instance, the change is projected to be one and a half times greater than the global average) and on the technical possibilities available to forestry to take adaptive action, for example, by changing species composition in favour of resistant trees. When drafting measures aimed at protection and adaptation, it is therefore extremely important to take into account specific local and regional features, and to respect factors specific to protected habitats. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, my colleagues and I were speaking for the first time in the Irish National Assembly – the Dáil – on Europe Day, so it is a historic day from that point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">The topic before us is absolutely vital because forests have a huge role to play, particularly in combating climate change. We hear a lot about high-profile issues such as renewable energy, etc., which are certainly important, but forests deserve far more attention because it takes a long time to grow forests and they must therefore be protected and encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for research, in particular, into ways of limiting forest fires. It is galling to realise that a single lit match can potentially destroy thousands of hectares of fine forest. I would also agree with the rapporteur that 1% of CAP expenditure going to forestation is not enough. Our Parliament wants to increase the number of hectares of forest in Ireland over the coming years, and an increase in funding through the CAP would certainly be sensible and worthwhile. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thanks also to the members of the committee who have put forward their views for their valuable contributions. The Commission announced its intention to present a Green Paper on forest protection and information in the context of the 2009 White Paper on adaptation to climate change. It was adopted in March 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper set out the various socio-economic and environmental functions of forests and the challenges they will face in coming decades. It also reviewed current forest information systems in Europe. Most importantly it invited Parliament and the Council, as well as all other interested stakeholders, to provide their views on forest protection and information and on the way forward so that the EU could provide added value to the work going on at Member State level and more widely across Europe. The guiding principle has been to respect Member States’ competences and subsidiarity while, at the same time, seeing how best the EU could contribute to ensuring that the functions of forests are protected and that the information necessary to achieve this is available.</p>
<p class="contents">The past year has been rich in discussion and the Council conclusions, together with the results of the stakeholder consultation, are already feeding into the Commission’s reflections on the next steps. Despite the fact that there has been a lengthy debate as to whether the EU needs a forestry policy or not, I am very pleased to see that appreciation of the economic, social and environmental functions of forests was a common theme in the stakeholder and Council input and that this concern is again evident today in the report drafted by Kriton Arsenis.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, there is a very great need for information at a comparable level across a wide range of forestry-related issues such as employment, stocks, biomass, fires, soil and forest carbon information and trends, forest health, biodiversity and water protection, and each institution lays great emphasis on finding means to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">In anticipation of Parliament’s report, we have already begun working with the Member States to develop further and more clearly the precise information needs at EU level. The report will help us to focus this work.</p>
<p class="contents">A further phase needs to be developed once the information needs are clear. We will be working on both aspects over the coming year, carefully and without duplicating other efforts in the forest area.</p>
<p class="contents">Armed with relevant useful and comparable information, we should, in the near future, be better able to provide EU added value across forestry-related socio-economic and environmental issues, thus paving the way for better EU input to help forests to continue to deliver their multiple benefits for us all. The Commission will now study this report in detail and reflect fully on our response to it and to the Council conclusions and stakeholders’ input. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the fact that we must count on further losses through climate change, European forestry finds itself in a difficult and risky situation. Some Member States (for example, Germany and Austria) operate a balanced forestry policy. A large number of countries – especially new Member States, including the Czech Republic – allow unsustainable forestry on their territory, however, which can be defined as the total clearance and looting of forest growth. The ratio of clearance to new forest growth is even higher than 100%. It is absolutely essential to manage and regulate the felling and clearance of forests at the European level, as long as these countries have such incompetent or corrupt politicians who are either unable or unwilling to halt this trend. In the Czech Republic, forestry management has become a business, in which the financial profits of the firms involved are all that matters. There can be no talk of maintenance or sustainable forestry management. It is also quite common that some citizens cut down trees without a permit, because the cost of heating fuel makes it worthwhile. I must appeal to the authorities who fail to penalise this and even fail to address it, because cutting down forests has become common practice in the Czech Republic. I welcome the report. It is a further step towards sustainable forestry in Europe, and halting the looting of forests in some Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must support it at the European level at the very least due to the principle of subsidiarity. From the point of view of climate change, ensuring the safety of forests is extremely important, as they are threatened more and more by natural disasters, especially such as fires or wide-ranging tree diseases. We have to remember the exceptional role of forests in ensuring biological balance and diversity, and that they are a valuable link in the proper functioning of the economy, not only in the production of timber, but also in relation to other products and services which are a common public asset. I believe that it is therefore very important to establish a sustainable common European forestry management policy. I appeal to the Commission to draw up legally binding criteria for the sustainable development of tree biomass, at the same time introducing tools for collecting information on forests and forestry and for making this information accessible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have endeavoured to emphasise the link that exists between forests and rural communities, based on the economic and social role which forests play as an important source of income and also in agricultural production. I feel that the role of forests in the future common agricultural policy is an important aspect of this. This is especially true in the context where Europe’s action in the forestry sector is implemented in particular via the second pillar of the CAP – rural development. This must be preserved as a powerful, effective instrument, while funding must continue at a sufficient level as part of the post-2013 CAP programmes. Support must be maintained for creating forest plantations as part of these programmes. Forests are also an important provider of public services which go unrewarded by the market. This is why I think that forest owners should be given a direct payment per area. The role of forests in the European Union’s energy strategy is another important point because their potential as a renewable energy source is currently underexploited. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore necessary to coordinate policies related to forestry, agriculture, renewable energy, biodiversity, as well as other environmental policies, more thoroughly. Here, we must also take industrial and research policy and the Europe 2020 strategy into account. Forestry is a natural part of an integrated rural and regional policy, and this must be taken into account in the discussions on the future of the common agricultural policy after 2013. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, EU forest-related instruments need to be updated to address new threats to their sustainable management and conservation. It’s underlined the central role of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) and the importance of forests for competitiveness and employment, in order to achieve EU’s climate targets and deliver necessary ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation, protection against natural disasters and CO<span class="sub">2</span> capturing. Requests for: 1. Reporting through National Forest Programmes to be enhanced and SFM to be better implemented throughout the European Union. 2. The immediate adoption of legislation on forest fire prevention as well as on forest information taking into account climate threats and the need for collection and dissemination of comparable data. Moreover, it calls for a White Paper on forest protection, addressing financial resources, knowledge exchange and promotion of research. 3. There is recognition of the importance of forests for rural development and the need to remove obstacles to funding for forestry and biodiversity. A call for access to funding of the relevant measures for public bodies and rural producers has been agreed upon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title25"></a><a name="creitem25"></a>
